The Beckhams have only just returned from eldest son Brooklyn’s Miami wedding with Nicola Peltz. But it seems David and Victoria will already need to gear up for the next one as Romeo 19 is also thinking about tying the knot.

Romeo is said to be utterly besotted with his girlfriend influencer and model Mia Regan also 19. The young couple recently celebrated their second anniversary and are reportedly looking to the future. However a source claimed Romeo is holding off on proposing so soon after his big brother’s wedding to billionaire’s daughter and actress Nicola so as not to steal their thunder. “Mia is close to Romeo’s mum Victoria. It was clear the couple want a long-term future together and have already spoken about being soulmates” said the insider. READ MORE: Michael Bublé says he and wife almost ended their marriage

The insider continued: “They are besotted with each other and are definitely in it for life. They also talked about how much they want a big family and can’t wait to get started.”

Showbiz editor Halina added that the couple's wedding would most likely be ""low-key"" in comparison to Brooklyn 23 and his 27 year old other half Nicola Peltz's nuptials.

The couple had some strict rules around their special day including there being no social media allowed – but this was quickly broken by none other than Romeo's girlfriend Mia.

Mia took to Instagram on Saturday 9 April to share a snap of the outfits she and her other half wore to the rehearsal dinner.

Another one that surprised viewers though came in the eighth episode during which Jacob revealed that he has a boyfriend. It's a development that adds a new layer to the history teacher and drew an enthusiastic reaction from his friend Janine. Ultimately the plot point ended up being a nice change of pace from traditional LGBTQ+ storylines on the small screen. And series creator and star Quinta Brunson has opened up about how the show tackled the subject in a nuanced way.

For most viewers finding out that Abbott’s resident awkward progressive is gay wasn’t a huge deal compared to such storylines of yesteryear. It was subtle and authentic which was exactly what Quinta Brunson was aiming for. The Abbott Elementary actress and producer revealed to The New York Times Magazine why the sixth-grade history teacher’s storyline was one of her proudest moments from Season 1:

But another thing I was proud of — that may not be internet humor but that I think is internet culture — was the episode when we found out one of our characters is gay. It was important to us to not make it a 'coming out' story. Instead it was like Janine and Jacob are people who probably have grown up with queer or gay people in their life. They’re not going to have a coming-out discussion. It represented my generation in a way that I had yet to see on network TV. Just matter-of-fact and not a huge deal. I was proud of that.

As the star mentioned Gen Xers and Millennials have a far different relationship with the LGBTQ+ community than some in past generations did so it made sense for Abbott Elementary's storyline to play out the way it did. It happened naturally with no fanfare. You have to give props to the show’s writers who were in tune enough with today’s attitudes to capture that on screen.

There are definitely a number of notable tropes that have been present with ""coming out"" storylines over the years. Oftentimes on TV shows they fall into one of two camps: the tragic coming-out story filled with angst and torture or one that shows a character suddenly being defined by their sexuality. By going with neither the comedy series ensured that Jacob would not come off as a caricature or plot device. And I should add that when his boyfriend Zach does appear in the following episode it also feels natural. Hopefully the ABC sitcom will explore more of their relationship when it returns for season 2 during the 2022-2023 television season.

The comedy series has really been making an impact in varied ways. For instance the alphabet network and Quinta Brunson came together to help real-life teachers by providing much-needed supplies. Considering the show's desire for true representation its affection for its topic and its humor and heart it's not hard to see why it’s one of TV’s best comedies.

So a sighting of the two enjoying a cosy evening at a trendy Soho bar last week was bound to create a frisson among the people-watchers of London’s Theatreland.

The pair who met when they played a married couple in 19th Century romantic drama The World To Come in 2020 were deep in conversation at Ducksoup a bar popular with staff from film production companies.

An onlooker said the stars ‘looked super comfortable in each other’s company’ as they drank wine and chatted for a couple of hours at an outside table.

Dressed in a leopard-print jacket and crocodile-leather ankle boots Ms Kirby who found fame as Princess Margaret in The Crown was also seen enjoying a cigarette.

The onlooker said: ‘They were both smoking so were sitting outside. They seemed to be very familiar with one another they were talking lots and there was the occasional smile.’

Kirby and Abbott shared a cosy evening without her partner Callum Turner (couple pictured)

American actor Mr Abbott best known as sweet-natured Charlie in the comedy drama series Girls is currently working on the Marvel movie Kraven the Hunter now filming in London.

The two are understood to be single and it is not known if they are romantically involved. However both have had relationships with co-stars in the past.

Ms Kirby 34 dated Callum Turner after they starred in 2014’s Queen And Country. They got together a year later but parted in 2020 blaming busy schedules for their split.

Mr Abbott 36 dated Vanity Fair actress Olivia Cooke whom he met on the set of Katie Says Goodbye in 2016. They split in 2019 and Ms Cooke went on to date EastEnders actor turned Hollywood star Ben Hardy.

Abbott joins Texas Tech School of Veterinary Medicine for ribbon cutting,"On a windy Friday afternoon the Texas Tech University School of Veterinary Medicine (TTUSVM) officially celebrated its opening and first class which started in August with a ribbon-cutting ceremony and special appearance by Gov. Greg Abbott. Also in attendance were university state and city officials with gold scissors in hand to help commemorate Texas’ second veterinary school.

After breaking ground in early 2020 on the facility the veterinary school started classes in August 16 of last year with a class of 64 students.

With the addition of the Texas Tech veterinary school Texas now has two schools of its type within the state including Texas A&M. This opening marks the first new veterinary school to open in the state in over a century.

Friday's ceremony was celebrated not only with appearances by dignitaries and supporters from across Texas but also on hand were Texas Tech mascots Raider Red and the Masked Rider as the festivities kicked off with a unique harmonica rendered “Star-Spangled Banner.”

Texas Tech University President Lawrence Schovanec spoke about the importance of adding another veterinary school to the state of Texas especially in a region such as the Texas Panhandle.

“The Texas Tech University School of Veterinary Medicine like Texas Tech University was established to fill a vital need” Schovanec said. “As the first century of Texas Tech University comes to an end we can be proud that the School of Veterinary Medicine strengthens the foundation and expands the capability of our university to serve West Texas our state and the nation for the next 100 years and beyond. This school is about our future.”

Schovanec stated that the real impact of this school would be felt for generations to come. He said he was very grateful for all the support from the Amarillo community and across the state.

“The facts said that we need more veterinarians in this state and these graduates will help to fill the special needs that are quite prevalent in the Panhandle and beyond” Schovanec added.

Guy Loneragan dean of the TTU School of Veterinary Medicine talked about the historical importance of the new program and its possible impacts on rural areas in need of animal care.

“Being a part of something historical like this is a once-in-a-generation – maybe even a one-in-many-generations opportunity” Loneragan said. “I now get to work with a community of students staff and faculty that is second to none. I am so very thankful for what everyone has contributed to making this possible and the opportunity to be a part of our wonderful community.”

Loneragan said one of the issues with only having one veterinary school in the state at Texas A&M was that there was a great swath of the rural areas further from that region that still had a shortage of veterinarians which will now be alleviated. He said that they hope to be able to increase class size over time to fulfill the need for veterinarians.

“We tried to look at the established need how much will the need grow and what can we do to address the need” Loneragan said. “We fully expect people that we do not even know yet will be shading themselves under the tree that we are planting now. This is a great step forward for people in this area.”

He said that when talk of the School of Veterinary Medicine first came to fruition Amarillo and the Panhandle were a consensus choice for the program's location due to its impact on agriculture and livestock.

After his introduction Gov. Abbott spoke about his mission as governor to create more Tier 1 universities of which now Texas leads the nation with 11. He also talked about the state’s great need for veterinary care.

“This is a historic day for Texas Tech and everyone who loves animal agriculture” Abbott said. “I am proud to stand by Texas Tech as you open this first-rate state-of-the-art veterinary school.”

Amarillo Mayor Ginger Nelson a big supporter of creating more educational and economic opportunities spoke about the school's benefit to Amarillo and surrounding communities.

“Opening the vet school is like opening a wide gate to opportunity for students and our economy” Nelson said. “The benefits will multiply across our state and its agriculture economy for decades to come.”

Nelson said that programs like this mean more opportunities for prospective students in the area and a greater field of veterinarians that could impact the shortage in an area that feeds a significant percentage of the nation. She said this helps tell the story of the great things that go on in the Texas Panhandle and its value to the nation.

“The economic and knowledge impact of bringing more people to the city for this university is a benefit that cannot be ignored"" Nelson said.

Texas Tech is now one of 32 accredited veterinary schools in the U.S with no state having more than two.

In Canyon VERO (Veterinary Education Research & Outreach) a partnership between the Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences and the West Texas A&M University Paul Engler College of Agriculture & Natural Sciences was established in 2009.

According to projections by Mars Veterinary Health with the current average of 2600 graduates each year the national veterinarian shortage by 2030 will be 15000 personnel.

After the ribbon-cutting ceremony tours of the TTUSVM campus were granted to guests to get an up-close and personal view of the state-of-the-art classrooms and laboratories."

With graduation less than a month away he sees a potential career as a sheet welder.

“The pay is good and they pay you to go to school too he said. “They said they would teach us everything we need to know. This has really helped me get some ideas. I’m going to keep looking.”

Carreno was one of 1500 Waukegan High School juniors and seniors who learned about potential careers after high school during a Waukegan Tech/Trade Fair Friday at the Washington campus learning about careers from more than 60 potential employers.

Students talk to a potential employers at the Waukegan Tech/Trade Fair Friday.

Chad McMillin a counselor at the high school said he organized the event at the Washington campus where the juniors and seniors attend so they could learn about good skilled jobs which are both available and in demand.

“Waukegan students are struggling especially these past two years” he said. “I wanted to do something for them. They are good workers and I want (employers) to see that. Not everyone is college material.”

Potential employers ranged from local manufacturers like Medline and AbbVie to union representatives to real estate companies to the Waukegan police and fire departments to military recruiters from multiple branches of the United States Armed Forces.

Several labor unions had representatives at the event including Paul Brown of the Mid American Carpenters Regional Council. He said an apprentice can earn $42307 their first year and by the time they become a journeyman after five years they can expect to earn more than $100000 annually.

“It’s not just about building buildings” Brown said. “There are a lot of other things. We pay them while they’re learning. We offer health care benefits now and when you retire. That’s very important.”

Valeria Pacheco a high school junior said she was impressed talking to representatives of AbbVie. She liked the pay offered and the types of skilled-labor jobs the global North Chicago-based pharmaceutical manufacturer had available.

Representatives of Medline talked to students about the company’s facilities in Waukegan and elsewhere in Lake County.

Jeremy Picard was one of three people at the event representing AbbVie. He said anyone 17 or older was eligible for a summer internship which means there is an immediate opportunity for juniors.

Picard said summer internships for skilled laborers included opportunities for plumbers/pipe fitters HVAC and industrial mechanics. While the internship can lead to a career it is also a chance to see what working there is like.

“We offer summer internships with our skilled trade team” he said. “It gives them a chance to see if this is something for them.”

Ashley Vasquez a high school senior said the idea of working for the fire department as a firefighter or paramedic appeals to her.

Szymon Czyż a 22-year-old engineer waited for two hours for his favourite local second-hand shop to open on the day of the new clothes delivery. That is when treasure hunters like him sprint to find trendy good-quality used clothing pushing each other and occasionally even stealing baskets or taking each other’s finds.

Such second-hand clothes stores have been dying out in Polish towns and cities: there were 39% fewer operating in the country in July 2021 than there were in 2009. Yet despite this trend the market in used clothes is thriving as it increasingly moves online and upmarket catering to a more fashion- and environment-conscious young clientele like Czyż.

“Recent data show that the second-hand clothing market is growing faster than the market for new clothing” says Agnieszka Wąsowska of Fashion Revolution Poland a fashion activist group.

That trend was outlined in a recent report by Accenture on consumer choices which found that 44% of Poles first look for second-hand items when they need clothes shoes or accessories. Even though more than a half of respondents still prefer going to a pre-owned shop in person more and more are doing so on social media and in online marketplaces a change accelerated by the pandemic.

Second-hand second-rate

The negative connotations that linger around second-hand shops in Poland are shown by some of the words used to describe them: lumpeks ciucholand or szmateks meaning something like “rag shop” or “togs land”. Lumpeks is particularly popular derived from a mixture of the German word lumpen meaning rags and giving rise to the term lumpowanie referring to the practice of purchasing and recycling used clothing.

Such stores selling used clothes by weight first appeared in Poland during the communist era when they offered imported clothing that was too expensive for most Poles to buy first-hand. By the 1990s the shops had come to be seen as overcrowded unpleasant and for the less well off.

“Because mostly the poor people were buying there others didn’t want to go” says Wąsowska. “They didn’t want to be seen in those places. People bought clothes in second-hand stores because they couldn’t afford to buy them [first hand].”

Poland’s increasing prosperity and changing consumer habits have resulted in a steady stream of closures for such second-hand stores. There were 23500 operating in 2009 but that figure has decreased every year since then reaching a low of 14400 in 2021 Tomasz Starzyk from Dun & Bradstreet a commercial data company told Notes from Poland.

A new shopping model

Despite these closures the second-hand market in Poland remains strong worth around 5-6 billion zloty a year according to 2019 data from Statistics Poland (GUS) the government statistical agency cited by the Rzeczpospolita daily. Some 10 million Poles more than a quarter of the population say they buy used clothes reported the newspaper.

Many of them are doing so from online sources and the impact of the pandemic has hastened a change in habits. Nearly half of Poles had used apps and websites to purchase things from and sell things to other users in the last six months found an SW Research poll for Accenture in October 2020.

Another survey last year by the same agency on behalf of second-hand store chain Wtórpol found that 28% said they bought used clothing online more often than before the pandemic.

This “has contributed to the growth and attractiveness of the second-hand shop’s offerings” says Agnieszka Oleksyn-Wajda director of the Institute of Sustainable Development at Lazarski University in Warsaw allowing them to buy from the comfort of their homes without hunting for products on the hanger.

Green shopping

Poles’ attitude towards pre-owned clothes has also evolved. In the 1990s people chose second-hand shops for economic reasons as a place to find “branded clothing at a reasonable price” explains Starzyk. At that time there was also a relative paucity of fashion shops offering such brands he adds.

But with Poles now on average much better off than in the 1990s and with a much wider range of products available to them environmental concerns play an increasing role in driving the demand for second-hand products.

Accenture’s polling data show that 20% of respondents buy pre-owned clothes for environmental reasons and a report by KPMH found that 27% of Poles say they are willing to pay more for environmentally friendly clothes.

“Education about ecology circular fashion sustainability environment friendliness has removed a patch of ‘shame’ from the purchase of second-hand clothing” says Oleksyn-Wajda.

This trend is also forcing big brands to rethink their strategies. This year Polish clothing company 4F launched a collaboration with Ubrania do Oddania (Clothes to Give Away) an organisation that “enable clothing brands to be more circular”. 4F has also started renting ski clothes to prevent additional textile waste.

The modern second-hand shopper

Another factor in the transformation of second-hand clothing in Poland has been a move upmarket towards the “resale of unique premium clothing” says Rafał Reif Head of fashion and retail for Poland at Accenture. “The primary motivator for buying is a brand or a unique limited product available for an attractive price.”

In addition to the previous cheap-and-cheerful second-hand shops consumers can now find posh boutiques with pre-owned clothes that cost more than in fast-fashion stores and vintage shops with pre-selected clothes explains Wąsowska.

Fashion-conscious Czyż says that such pre-owned clothes “predominate” in his wardrobe. He believes they are of better quality than those sold by big brands and are cheaper than designer garments.

Before landing his current full-time job he used to go to the second-hand shop three times a week finding designer bargains that he then sold “for a good profit” he tells Notes from Poland. He mentions a 10-year-old Stone Island jacket worth around 2000 zloty which he bought in a vintage shop for 1% of its value 20 zloty and sold on to a second-hand connoisseur for 350 zloty.

“You can live off making money by selling second-hand finds” Czyż says.

Trends and influencers

Such upmarket second-hand clothing helps feed a desire – especially strong among young women – to stand out from the crowd by having original items says Starzyk. According to Accenture’s polling data a quarter of Poles aged under 25 think of how clothes will look on social media when shopping.

Polish social media are also full of influencers offering advice on finding and using vintage items such as Mateusz Leszczyński whose “Lumpfinds” is followed by over 320000 people on TikTok and 82000 on Instagram.

“Lumpeks”-related TikTok videos have been watched 286.4 million times including 31.4 million views of “Lumpeks check” videos with shop recommendations. There are dozens of Facebook groups dedicated to fans of pre-owned shops where they can exchange clothes.

The future of pre-owned clothes shops

Despite the drop in the number of stores and the move to online shopping Starzyk notes that the number of closures have begun to fall and predicts “stable demand and stable sales”.

Oleksyn-Wajda believes that vintage clothes stores will “take on new forms and non-obvious locations”. The first circular boutiques providing education on circular fashion are already being opened in shopping malls in Poland where people can leave their unwanted clothing. She suggests that the market will grow further.

“Because the zero-waste idea is something more” she says. “It’s a lifestyle. State of mind. Fashion at its best.”

Mastercard chief executive Miebach Michael said his company is planning to set up huge data centres in India and focus on training and digitisation of small businesses. Sitharaman informed Michael about India’s commitment to digital financial inclusion with emphasis on women and MSMEs.

Deloitte chief executive Punit Renjen said his company intends to expand its India operations to smaller cities like Coimbatore and Bhubaneswar. Deloitte he said has developed tools to improve the access of rural poor to health facilities.

FedEx president and CEO-elect Raj Subramanian shared his company’s expansion plans in India with the minister and showed interest in setting up R&D Centres in the country.

Accenture chairperson and chief executive Julie Sweet informed Sitharaman that the company is adding a presence in more Tier-II cities in India and focusing on imparting skills to people to prepare them for emerging opportunities.

India will continue to remain the world’s fastest-growing major economy this year and the next pipping China despite the damaging impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and other external headwinds according to the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF’s) projections. At 8.2% India’s growth rate this year is forecast to surpass China’s 4.4%. Similarly while India is expected to grow 6.9% in the next fiscal China’s expansion is pegged at 5.1%.

Investments remain critical to India’s economic resurgence as private consumption has maintained a roller-coaster ride in the aftermath of the pandemic. Gross fixed capital formation grew just 2% in the December quarter from 14.6% in the previous quarter as a favourable base effect started to wane. A recovery in private investment remains fragile and is limited to few sectors increasing the country’s reliance on sustained government spending and foreign direct investments.

Sitharaman has been on a visit to the US since Monday to attend the spring meetings of the IMF and the World Bank. She has taken part in the meetings of the finance ministers and central bank governors of the G20 nations.

Attending a ministerial dinner for development committee members in Washington Sitharaman called for addressing challenges emanating from fragility conflict and violence as necessary to achieve the twin goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity more so when about two-thirds of the world’s extreme poor will live in countries infested by these issues by 2030. Her comments came at a time when the Russia-Ukraine conflict threatens to linger on for a longer period than many had anticipated.

Issues such as livelihood education health and groups including women youth and children should always be prioritised while engaging with fragile and conflict-affected situations she said.

Separately Sitharaman participated in the ministerial meeting of the Financial Action Task Force in Washington and reaffirmed India’s commitment to fighting money laundering and terrorist financing.",,,

(Windows) or (Mac) to copy the area. Move the cursor to where you want to put the copy. Select once to apply the copied image.

Tnis article explains how to use the Photoshop Clone Stamp Tool to copy one area of an image to another area of the same image. Instructions apply to Photoshop CC 2022 through CC 2019 for Windows and Mac.



How to Use the Clone Stamp Tool in Photoshop

The Photoshop Clone Stamp tool copies one area of an image onto another area of an image. Photographers and designers often use the Clone Stamp tool to remove unwanted elements from a photograph. For example it can be used to cover blemishes on people's faces by copying from another part of the skin or to remove trees from a mountain view by copying parts of the sky over them.

Open an image in Photoshop. To use the Clone Stamp tool click and hold the rubber stamp icon in the toolbox and select Clone Stamp Tool in the flyout menu. You can adjust the brush size and shape opacity flow and blending modes in the tool options bar at the top of the workspace.

To copy an exact area leave the opacity flow and blending mode at their default settings. As you employ the tool more often you will find yourself adjusting these settings. For example when retouching a person's face an opacity of 20 percent or lower lightly blends the skin to an even tone. You may need to clone it more times but the effect is smoother.

By checking the box beside Aligned in the tool options bar the target follows the movement of your cursor as you retouch. This is often desirable because it uses multiple points for the target. To make the target remain stationary uncheck the Aligned box in the tool options.

You can quickly change the brush size and shape by right-clicking on the image.

How to Retouch Images With the Clone Stamp Tool

With the Clone Stamp tool selected move your mouse to the area you want to duplicate and Alt+click (Windows) or Option+click (Mac) on the exact spot you want to start copying from.

For example to remove the heart from the woman's finger Alt+click (Windows) or Option+click (Mac) on a similarly colored area on a different finger. Then unclick and drag the Clone Stamp Tool over the heart painting with pixels from the area you previously selected. You'll be able to see the changes as they occur. If the size setting is too large or too small adjust it in the tool options at the top of the screen.

What Does the Clone Stamp Tool Do?

If you tried to cover up part of an image using the brush tool the area would be flat lacking all dimension tone and shade. Thus the painted area would be noticeable to the viewer. Adobe developed the Clone Stamp tool to allow for more subtle image editing.

Digital photographs are made up of tiny pixels. The Clone Stamp tool paints with pixels copied from one part of an image over another part. As a result the retouched area blends seamlessly with the rest of the image. Other Photoshop tools including the Pattern Stamp Healing Brush and Patch tool all derive from the Clone Stamp so if you know how to use one of them you can use them all.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lml0cHJvLmNvbS9zb2Z0d2FyZS8zNjc0NzkvaXRzLXRpbWUtdG8tZGl0Y2gtc29mdHdhcmUtc3Vic2NyaXB0aW9uc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,It's time to ditch software subscriptions,"String me up on charges of shooting fish in a barrel if you will but I’m 99% sure we’re all sick of paying subscriptions for software.

Two companies that are having no trouble living with themselves are those who arguably swung the pendulum towards subscriptions in the first place: Adobe and Microsoft. Adobe first launched Creative Cloud back in 2012 moving from the big one-off cost of Creative Suite to the subscription model since when the company’s net income charts have taken on the appearance of Tour de France mountain stage. Microsoft financial reports meanwhile reveal that Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions have increased by almost ten million over the past year alone to 54.1 million while Office 365 commercial seat growth is up 17% year-on-year.

So subscriptions are the gift that keeps on giving for the software giants which is why almost the entire industry has latched onto the idea. If your small business files accounts you’re almost certainly paying QuickBooks Sage Xero or someone else a monthly stipend to record your financials; password managers want a monthly fee to spit out the f%djfDBbe3!d’s for you; even gaming is swinging heavily towards subscription plans.

In my experience most people won’t grumble too much if software switches to a subscription model and offers something in return. There’s a growing and obnoxious trend however for companies to switch to subscriptions and offer nothing extra – or to even withhold features from customers who previously paid for a one-off licence in full expectation of being able to use them for as long as they liked.

This was the case recently with the iPad/Mac note-taking app Notability. In a blog post with more spin on it than a Shane Warne delivery the developer announced the app was going free! Free that is except for the $14.99 per year subscription that you’d have to pay to access most of its useful features. The company would generously give customers who’d previously bought the app one year’s grace before the subscription kicked in but then they’d be expected to pay again for some features they'd already bought.

That went down about as well as a Jacob Rees-Mogg lecture on Glastonbury’s Pyramid Stage and within 24 hours the company was forced to yank the handbrake spin round and promise not to take features off customers who’d already paid for them. But the apology came with a slab of emotional blackmail. “We are a small company so we designed the original one-year access plan as a precautionary measure since we were not certain if we could support lifetime access” the Notability team wrote on its blog. “We sincerely apologise for putting our current users in this position.”

Then there are companies that justify shuffling to a subscription by throwing in features you don’t necessarily want in the first place. Acronis True Image 2021 got a five-star review even though we grumbled about the one-off £34 cost. Now however Acronis True Image is no more and is replaced by Acronis Cyber Protect Home Office which has “made the leap from backup to a complete cyber protection solution – combatting the full scope of data threats from accidents and hardware failure to device theft and cyberattack”. In other words it’s thrown in a series of security features that you might already have and is charging customers you guessed it £34 per year for the privilege.

Notability and Acronis are far from alone in being sucked into the subscriptions model – they’re just the two most recent examples I had to hand. Although there are plenty of free alternatives to subscription-based software the direction of travel is clear.

This I fear is bad for customers. Not only because there’s a finite limit to how many subscriptions most people can afford to maintain but because the monthly payout makes software firms complacent. They don’t need to tempt you every year or two with killer new features that will persuade you to buy a new version – they’ve got you in the keep net. Especially when – as with Microsoft and Adobe – their software has a virtual monopoly on their particular sectors. Name a recent addition to Microsoft Word or Excel or Photoshop that would have tempted you to pay hundreds of quid for an upgrade? Bet you can’t.",,,

A Florida teen was charged this week in a January crash that left six dead after the teen lost control while driving 151 miles per hour authorities said.

Noah Galle 18 was charged Monday with six counts of vehicular homicide for the fatal Jan. 27 crash that left six people dead Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg said in a statement.

Galle who was 17 at the time of the fatal crash had previously done racing stunts for social media attention according to a criminal affidavit obtained by The Washington Post. The teen displayed his Instagram handle on his car windows and in a video offered $25 to anyone who could correctly guess how fast he was driving.

Galle was driving a 2019 BMW at 151 mph down a Delray Beach highway when he crashed into the back of an SUV carrying the six passengers and caused the vehicle to flip multiple times police said. The victims were Filaine Dieu 46; Vanice Percina 29; Mirlaine Innocent Julceus 45; Remize Michel 53; Marriel Michelle Louis 60; and Michel Louis Saint 77 NBC News reported.

All six victims worked at Pero Family Farms which has set up a GoFundMe for the families of the victims.

Galle has entered a plea of not guilty. Each count he faces is a second-degree felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison.

If anyone can make misery look fun it's Hayley Williams and Billie Eilish.

During Eilish' headlining set on Saturday night at the second weekend of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival the 20-year-old Grammy Award winner surprised the crowd when she brought out the Paramore frontwoman.

The unexpected appearance marked Williams' first time on the Coachella stage.

She and Eilish performed a high-energy duet of the 2007 Paramore hit ""Misery Business."" As Williams 33 proved more than a decade has nothing on the timeless revenge anthem's appeal Eilish easily sailed through a series of beautiful breathy harmonies.

Eilish first hinted she may bring out a surprise guest after a mysterious second stool sat empty on stage while she and brother Finneas performed an acoustic rendition of their song ""Your Power.""

""Oh look! An empty seat. Who's that for?"" Eilish mischievously said before urging the crowd to welcome her ""friend"" Williams to the stage.

""This is my first Coachella whoa"" Williams said to the audience after she and Eilish shared an elated embrace. ""Thanks for sharing this with me. This is sick!""

The performance came as an especially rare treat because Williams has publicly distanced herself from the song in the later years of her career citing certain lyrics she interprets as problematic namely: ""Once a whore you're nothing more/I'm sorry that will never change.""

Williams first expressed her feelings looking back on the song in a post on her blog in 2015.

""Misery Business is not a set of lyrics that I relate to as a 26 year old woman. i haven't related to it in a very long time"" Williams wrote in the post. ""Those words were written when i was 17… admittedly from a very narrow-minded perspective.""

At a Paramore show in Nashville Tennessee in September 2018 Williams announced the band would no longer be performing the song live. ""This is a choice we made because we feel like we should. We feel like it's time to move away from it for a little while"" she said at the time.

This weekend at Coachella after the pair completed the duet and William's exited the stage Eilish couldn't help but express her own amazement and excitement to the crowd.

In February Rogan found himself at the centre of a controversy after hosting a podcast guest who claimed that Americans were “hypnotised” into wearing masks and getting vaccines.

Footage then re-emerged online showing Rogan repeatedly using the N-word on old episodes of The Joe Rogan Experience. Rogan apologised telling his followers: “There’s nothing I can do to take that back – I wish I could.”

While Spotify removed 113 episodes of the podcast from its catalogue they remained loyal to the podcaster amid calls to remove the show completely.

However hosting his podcast on Friday (22 April) Rogan claimed that his number of subscribers hadn’t been negatively affected by the controversy and that he’d gained two million subscribers at its height.

His guest British writer and political commentator Douglas Murray said to Rogan: ““You have been put through the wringer since we last met. They did a number on you.”

“They did. It’s interesting my subscriptions went up massively — that’s what’s crazy” he said.

“During the height of it all I gained 2 million subscribers.”

The Independent has contacted Spotify for comment.

While Spotify users can see the number of listeners for musical artists and individual songs on the platform it does not publicly release subscriber or listening figures for podcasts. It is estimated that The Joe Rogan Experience is listened to by roughly 11 million people per episode.

However sources told The Hollywood Reporter that Rogan’s show had been consistently growing in subscribers since the UFC commentator signed his reported $100m deal with the streamer and that it had never spiked due to a particular event."

84 samples of recycled rubber granules with a particle size of 0.5 to 4 mm produced for the construction of sport field surfaces were tested. The samples of rubber granules were collected from 17 sport fields and 67 samples rubber granules were supplied by recyclers. Research included 57 samples of SBR granules and 27 samples of EPDM granules. The numbers of samples in relation to their sources of origin are shown in Fig. 1.

Figure 1 Number of samples of the tested SBR and EPDM granules in relation to their sources of origin. Full size image

The samples were taken from the surface of sport fields with artificial turf in accordance with the laboratory instructions or delivered to the laboratory by recyclers. The mass of the granulate samples delivered for testing was approx. 0.5 kg. Sampling from sport fields was carried out using a scheme based on 6 sampling points shown in Fig. 2 in accordance with point 4 of the FIFA guidelines: “Quality Programme for Football Turf. Handbook of Test Methods for Football Turf”. The number and weight of granular samples and the locations of the granular sampling points on the field indicated in the aforementioned guidelines are indicated in order to obtain a representative homogenized granular sample for the tested field42.

Figure 2 Scheme of distribution of granulate sampling points on a sport field. Designation: location and numbers of granulate sampling points. Full size image

At the designated points (1 ÷ 6) 6 samples of granulate were collected. The collected and secured samples were stabilized in the laboratory conditions of natural drying in which the moisture of the sample was in equilibrium with the ambient moisture. After stabilization the samples were purified and homogenized to give a pooled sample. Images of exemplary SBR and EPDM granules used in the study are shown in Fig. 3. The average values of the physical parameters of the tested rubber granules are given in Table 1.

Figure 3 Samples taken from sport fields: (a) SBR granules (b) EPDM granules. Full size image

Table 1 Some physical parameters of the tested SBR and EPDM granules (data from the Technical Data Sheets provided by the recyclers). Full size table

Samples weighing at least 100 g were taken from the granulate samples using the quartering method. This way allowed to ensure full qualitative and quantitative compliance of the sample composition with the composition of the analyzed material. Samples for testing the content of PAHs were grounded by grinding in a cryogenic mill 6770 Freezer/Mill by SPEX SamplePrep LLC. Samples for testing other substances were not crushed.

The scope and methods of testing rubber granules

The scope of the research on rubber granules included: content determination of the PAHs leached elements organotin compounds and PAHs. In all samples of rubber granules the content of 8 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons resulting from the REACH Regulation was determined: benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) dibenz[ah]anthracene (DBAhA) benzo[e]pyrene (BeP) benz[a]anthracene (BaA) chrysene (CHR) benzo[b]fluoranthene (BbFA) benzo[j]fluoranthene (BjFA) and benzo[k]fluoranthene (BkFA). The content of indeno[123-cd]pyrene (IcdP) benzo[ghi]perylene (BghiP) phenanthrene anthracene fluoranthene pyrene and naphthalene was determined for 38 samples from recyclers additionally that the number of PAHs covered by the requirements of the document43 was increased by 7.

The leaching tests of elements and organotin compounds were carried out for 18 samples and the leachability of PAHs and elements were carried out for 4 samples. The tests were carried out with the methods listed below using the following apparatus.

The content and leachability of PAHs from rubber granules was determined by gas chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (GC–MS/MS) using a gas chromatograph coupled with a mass detector GCMS/MS/7890B/7000C. The method was chosen because of the high sensitivity and selectivity obtained for low PAHs levels when used GC–MS/MS compared to other commonly used analytical techniques such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) combined with UV fluorescence or diode array detector (DAD). In studies carried out with the use of the above-mentioned techniques trace amount of PAHs identification is easily interfered by sample matrix and other components if only based on retention44.

Determination of leaching of elements: Al Sb As Ba B Cd Co Cu Pb Mn Hg Cr Ni Se Sr Sn Zn and elution of the Cd total Cr Pb Sn Zn from rubber granules was carried out by the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) method with the use of Agilent 7900 ICP-MS (Agilent Technology Santa Clara CA USA). The selected method is characterized by a low limit of quantification which stands out among other instrumental methods used in elemental analysis such as ICP-OES or AAS (Inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry or atomic absorption spectrometry). It is also characterized by high sensitivity and precision selectivity enabling the simultaneous determination of many elements in complex matrices in a wide range of concentrations.

Leachability of Cr (III) and Cr (VI) and elution of Cr (VI) from rubber granules were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS) using Agilent 7700 Series ICP-MS with Agilent 1260 Infinity series HPLC (Agilent Technology Santa Clara CA USA). The decision to use HPLC in conjunction with ICP-MS was dictated by the need to determine chromium in two oxidation states. In the case of the selected method the speciation separation of Cr (III) and Cr (VI) takes place on the HPLC column where Cr (III) and Cr (VI) are adsorbed. In the next step it allows for the separation and determination of Cr (III) and Cr (VI) in the ICP-MS spectrometer. The HPLC-ICP-MS method is characterized by a short analysis time and a low detection limit compared to the other spectrophotometric methods used for determination of Cr (VI). The leaching of organotin compounds was assessed on the basis of the results of total Sn leaching.

Cold-vapor atomic absorption spectroscopy (CV-AAS) with the PerkinElmer FIMS 100 mercury analyser was selected for the Hg leaching study due to the use of a unique technique of mercury vapour measurement at room temperature. Among other alternative methods of Hg determination in aqueous solutions (ICP-MS or GF-AAS (graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry)) the selected method is distinguished by a low limit of quantification simple preparation of samples for analysis easy elimination of interference and short analysis time.

Tests of the content of PAHs

Shredded samples of rubber granules were subjected to the ultrasonic extraction process for 1 h with the use of toluene as a solvent. Samples were taken from the obtained extract for chromatographic analysis. The analysis was carried out for the following conditions: dispenser operation mode: splitless carrier gas: Helium: 1.8 ml/min DB-EUPAH column with dimensions: 20 m × 180 µm × 0.14 µm (the 20 m column is in the form of a coiled wire) injection temperature: 275 °C. The PAHs were identified on the basis of mass spectra and retention times—Table 2.

Table 2 Target and identification ions and retention times for the determined PAHs. Full size table

Tests of the leaching of elements and organotin compounds

Samples of rubber granules for the study of the leaching of organotin elements and compounds were extracted in a solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl) with concentration 0.07 ± 0.005 mol/dm3 in temperature 37 ± 2 °C. Solutions for the determination the Cr(VI) and Cr(III) prepared by diluting the extraction solution to obtain the pH equal to 7.0 ± 0.5 by adding 1 ml of 0.07 mol/dm3 ammonia and 60 µL of 0.1 mol/dm3 EDTA solution. In parallel a reagent blank was prepared as the test samples were. The obtained extracts were analyzed by ICP-MS and HPLC-ICP-MS. The analyzes were performed for the isotopes of the elements: Al—27 Sb—121 As—75 Ba—137 B—11 Cd—111 112 Cr—52 53 Co—59 Cu—63 Pb—206 207 208 Mn—55 Hg—201 Ni—60 Se—78 Sr—88 Sn—118 120 Zn—64 66.

Tests of the leachability of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and elements

Determination of the dry mass of the rubber granulate samples for the leachability tests was carried out in accordance with ISO 11465:199945 using a drying oven (Pol-Eco-Apparatus SLW-115 Top Wodzisław Śląski Poland) and analytical balances (SARTORIUS Kostrzyn Wlkp. i Radwag Radom Poland).

The rubber granulate samples were dynamically washed with deionized water according to EN 12457-4:200246 providing a ratio of 1 ml of liquid to 1 g of rubber granulate. The pH value of the water used for dynamic leaching did not exceed 6.7. Elution was performed using a bottle/tube roller mixer (Thermo scientific model Thermo Fisher Scientific (China) Co. Ltd. Shanghai China). After washing the effluents were left for 15 min and then filtered through 0.45 mm membrane filters using a pressure filtration device.

The leachate obtained from dynamic leaching was subjected to the process of transferring PAHs from the water phase to the organic phase using the algorithm:

SPE column: C18 bed—6 ml/1000 mg;

activation: 10 ml of methanol 10 ml of methanol:water (40:60) (v:v) flow: 1 ml/min;

sample:eluting solution of methanol (100 ml:10 ml) flow: 0.5 ml/min;

drying: minimum 15 min maximum flow;

elution: 3 × 3 ml of dichloromethane flow: 0.5 ml/min.

Collected filtrates were evaporated using a vacuum evaporator (IKA RV 05 basic IKA WERKE GMBH & CO.KG Staufen) up to 1 ml. Evaporated filtrates were subjected to the chromatographic analysis performed for the conditions as for the determination of PAHs content. The content of eluted PAHs and elements was related to dry mass of the rubber granulate in each sample.

The devices were calibrated and checked on a current basis including the analysis of control samples before starting the measurements. Calibrations of the chromatograph spectrometer and mercury analyzer were performed on solutions of certified reference materials and 2 control samples. The correlation coefficients obtained during the calibration were above 0.995 for all analyzed substances. The analysis of the control samples confirmed the accuracy of the calibration curves which are the basis for the calculations. Measurements of the content/leachability of the tested substances were carried out for two parallel samples and a reagent blank sample taking into account the results obtained from it in the analysis of analytical samples. The arithmetic mean of two parallel determinations was assumed as the result of the analytical measurement. Content/leachability conversions of test substances were performed using the GC–MS/MS MassHunter Workstation Software LCP MHLauncher HPLC-ICP-MS and ACP-MS software and WinLab32 with an AA mercury analyzer FIMS100.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The money lining up to fund early-stage carbon removal technologies is adding up so fast. After the giant tech companies revealed their almost $1 billion fund for carbon removal startups millions of capital came rushing in.

But what is more interesting is the value created in capturing CO2 and converting it into a product. Just like what Air Company is doing that attracted $30 million capital investment.

Carbon Direct Capital Management led the round along with other venture capital firms. These include Toyota Ventures JetBlue Technology Ventures and Parley for the Oceans.

How Air Company’s Carbon Conversion Technology Works

The startup makes carbon-negative alcohols and consumer products out of thin air. It does so through its proprietary technology that transforms CO2 into impurity-free alcohols.

The converted alcohol is then used to make a variety of consumer goods. Some of them are the famous ones like carbon-negative Air Vodka Air Spray hand sanitizer and Air Eau de Parfum.

The company is using only three key inputs to create its innovative products – air (CO2) water and sun. It uses 9% solar energy for the conversion process and 91% wind energy to power its production.

Here’s how Air Company’s carbon conversion technology works:

With its pioneer carbon technology Air Company made the world’s first alcoholic beverage directly from CO2 Air Vodka.

According to its CEO and Co-founder Gregory Constantine

“Our goal is to integrate our carbon technology into every applicable sector to help combat the climate catastrophe… We’ll do this by providing people with a beautiful range of products made from captured CO2.”

Air Company debuted in 2019 and started with its first factory in Brooklyn New York.

Where Will The Funding Go?

The $30 million growth capital will be for building the Air Company’s third factory. This is to ramp up its carbon conversion technology and CO2-derived alcohol production.

This new state-of-the-art factory will be home for its new commercial-scale carbon technology. By far it would be the biggest factory to date.

Such scaling up is also part of the firm’s plan to expand into the industrial and aerospace sectors. For instance it has worked with NASA for space exploration in making sugars and proteins from its CO2-derived alcohols.

Air Company’s pioneering system seems capable of scaling up across industries. If so its carbon conversion technology can help tackle up to 10.8% of global CO2 emissions. This is roughly more than 4.6 billion tons of CO2 removed and avoided each year.

By using captured carbon and replacing CO2 taken out the ground Air Company aims to really have an impact in addressing climate change.

By far Air Company is not the only carbon technology that focuses on how to use captured CO2 to make new products. There are a couple of others too recognized by Elon Musk’s $100 million Carbon Removal XPrize.

Examples include SkyNano that is using captured CO2 to make parts of tires and batteries. Another one is DyeCoo that uses reclaimed CO2 to dye textiles avoiding the use of chemicals.

When these carbon tech startups mature we can all expect to see a growing sector called “carbon to value”. This space presents a double blow of removing carbon while creating additional value.

And one way to create more value to carbon is by reusing it as an ingredient for materials like cement or consumer goods.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9tY2FsbC9uYW1lL2V2ZXJldHQtam9obnNvbi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNDQxMzk5ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Everett Johnson Obituary (2022) - Allentown PA - Morning Call,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/mcall/name/everett-johnson-obituary?id=34413998 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9tY2FsbC9uYW1lL2V2ZXJldHQtam9obnNvbi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNDQxMzk5ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8va3BlbDk2NS5jb20vaXMteW91ci1haXItZnJ5ZXItYmVpbmctcmVjYWxsZWQtaGVyZXMtd2hhdC15b3UtbmVlZC10by1rbm93L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Your Air Fryer Being Recalled?

As travelers plan summer vacations there's one question that will undoubtedly come up: do I book a hotel or a rental property like an Airbnb?

For more TPG news delivered each morning to your inbox sign up for our daily newsletter.

Of course the answer depends on a variety of factors. Availability and pricing at your destination are usually the biggest considerations. But your preference on the type of stay that you are looking for as well as loyalty and points-related factors and other considerations.

It's hard to beat staying at a resort where you enjoy the luxury of on-site pools restaurants housekeeping not to mention easy beach access and the financial benefit of either using your points for a free stay or earning points and elite night credits.

I've also had plenty of Airbnb stays with family that have been equally memorable. Sometimes a rental property like an Airbnb gives you the chance to enjoy your temporary space more like you would a home and in some cases more fully immerse yourself in the day-to-day culture of the place you're visiting.

It's also worth noting there are ways your points can help you with your Airbnb booking although you're not going to earn any free nights staying at a rental property.

Home share properties have gained a certain amount of notoriety in recent years for the fees added to the top of your nightly rate but the fees you pay at resorts – including when redeeming points in some cases – can be equally loathsome among guests.

We looked at bookings for a peak summer vacation week of July 16-23 (Saturday to Saturday) for this report.

East coast beach trip: Hilton Head Island South Carolina

Hilton Head is a popular southeast beach destination each summer. On top of the ability to stay affordably at oceanfront properties it doubles as a popular golf destination with vast shopping and dining options.

Hotel choice: Marriott Hilton Head Resort & Spa

This beachfront resort includes easy beach access with a pool situated just off the beach. The nightly rate of $469 leads to a $3286 bill for the seven-night stay. If you've got Marriott Bonvoy points to use it goes for a total of 352000 points for the stay.

European trip: Rome

We can expect a very busy summer of U.S. travelers making their way to Europe. Rome is always among the more popular destinations for tourists looking to enjoy the city's culture and countless historic sites from the Pantheon and Colosseum to St. Peter's Square in Vatican City.

Hotel choice: The Tribune Rome

This Hyatt property puts you in a nice central location in Rome – with key tourist sites easily reachable by ride share or walking if you're up to it. For a quality hotel the $249 nightly rate is a bargain compared to many other options in the area with the weekly bill coming to $1862.

At 18000 World of Hyatt points per night the award rate is not a great redemption but isn't outrageous to the point where you should avoid spending points in hopes of saving cash on the lodging portion of your trip.

I'm a big fan of the Airbnb choice in Rome. The property I found is a tenth of a mile walking distance from the Pantheon which puts you within a stone's throw of numerous key tourist attractions in the city. The property has a modern feel to it and while it comes in at a bit higher than the hotel cost -- $1958 for the week once you add the fees in – the location and cost makes this the winner.

Caribbean vacation: Costa Rica

Costa Rica allows visitors to enjoy a combination of relaxing on the beach (or by the pool) with a bit of adventure. From the wildlife to mountains and volcanoes you can spend half the trip sitting or swimming and the other half exploring.

When booking accommodations in Costa Rica be sure to check the proximity of your property to the airport – and firm up how you'll get around! Unlike some Caribbean destinations where the airport is a short drive from many resorts you can be on the road for a good hour or two here.

Hotel choice: Marriott Vacation Club at Los Suenos

(Screenshot courtesy of Marriott Bonvoy)

This is a new Marriott property that has availability for booking the week we looked at in mid-July. With multiple pools and dining options on the property you can stay for a relatively good price considering the size of the villa you get. With a nightly rate of $212 the stay comes to $1490.

(Screenshot courtesy of Marriott Bonvoy)

You really can't go wrong with the Airbnb we found with an infinity pool overlooking the ocean. For the week's stay you can save a few hundred dollars compared to the hotel booking -- $1672 is the total once you add in the fees.

Wine country: Napa California

My wife and I made our first visit to Napa in 2019 and found both the quality of the wine the views and the food to be exactly what we expected. One of the factors that comes into play as you consider a hotel or an Airbnb in Napa is what type of accommodation you're looking for.

Hotels are often within walking distance of the many restaurants wine bars and shops. We stayed in town when we visited and were able to walk to dinner each night. The downside of this: you probably have to get an Uber or Lyft to the vineyards which can add up since each leg of the trip can range anywhere from 5-15 minutes or more.

This was one of the better hotel choices for a stay in July priced at $395 per night or $3189 for the seven-night stay.

I kept my search closer to downtown on Airbnb (although you can certainly venture farther north to get closer to wineries). I found a two-bedroom cottage near downtown for $283 per night or $1984 for the week.

New England and national park trip: Bar Harbor Maine

While plenty of residents of New England travel south during the coldest winter months as a resident of the south I've always loved visiting Maine in the summer when I need a break from the heat and humidity. Bar Harbor is a popular destination among visitors to Maine as it gives you a combination of a beautiful on-the-water town and easy access to Acadia National Park.

You actually may want to consider options beyond major hotel chains and Airbnbs as you travel to this part of the country because New England is well known for its bed-and-breakfast lodging and independent hotels.

Hotel choice: Hampton Inn Bar Harbor

The property is priced at $474 a night or $3618 for the stay in July. Another Hampton Inn a bit farther outside of town goes for about half the price so consider whether you need to be in the center of things and the higher cost for that privilege.

I found a townhouse in Bar Harbor on Airbnb for a fairly inexpensive $160 per night which came to $1278 for the seven-night stay. It's a small property though and depending on the size of your party and the quality of the property you're looking for you may have to pay triple or even quadruple that nightly rate if you want more space or luxury.

Bottom line

Hotels and Airbnb properties each have their benefits and drawbacks. I enjoy both and let the destination and my goals for the trip (along with price of course) dictate which direction I take when booking.

As you plan your summer vacation it's always a good idea to consider every avenue to make sure your trip turns out exactly the way you're hoping.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5raWRzcG90LmNvbS5hdS9saWZlc3R5bGUvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9icmlzYmFuZXMtcmVhbGxpZmUtYmx1ZXktaG91c2UtanVzdC1zb2xkLWZvci1hbi1leWV3YXRlcmluZy1zdW0vbmV3cy1zdG9yeS83ZjcyMDFmZjBhZDE2MDFhYmE2NTRkYzFjYzNmNzA1MNIBogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5raWRzcG90LmNvbS5hdS9saWZlc3R5bGUvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9icmlzYmFuZXMtcmVhbGxpZmUtYmx1ZXktaG91c2UtanVzdC1zb2xkLWZvci1hbi1leWV3YXRlcmluZy1zdW0vbmV3cy1zdG9yeS83ZjcyMDFmZjBhZDE2MDFhYmE2NTRkYzFjYzNmNzA1MD9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brisbane’s real-life Bluey house just sold,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.kidspot.com.au/lifestyle/entertainment/brisbanes-reallife-bluey-house-just-sold-for-an-eyewatering-sum/news-story/7f7201ff0ad1601aba654dc1cc3f7050 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5raWRzcG90LmNvbS5hdS9saWZlc3R5bGUvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9icmlzYmFuZXMtcmVhbGxpZmUtYmx1ZXktaG91c2UtanVzdC1zb2xkLWZvci1hbi1leWV3YXRlcmluZy1zdW0vbmV3cy1zdG9yeS83ZjcyMDFmZjBhZDE2MDFhYmE2NTRkYzFjYzNmNzA1MNIBogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5raWRzcG90LmNvbS5hdS9saWZlc3R5bGUvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9icmlzYmFuZXMtcmVhbGxpZmUtYmx1ZXktaG91c2UtanVzdC1zb2xkLWZvci1hbi1leWV3YXRlcmluZy1zdW0vbmV3cy1zdG9yeS83ZjcyMDFmZjBhZDE2MDFhYmE2NTRkYzFjYzNmNzA1MD9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vaW5mb3RlbC5jYS9uZXdzaXRlbS9ob2JiaXQtdGhlbWVkLWFpcmJuYi1uZWFyLW9zb3lvb3MtbmFtZWQtb25lLW9mLWNhbmFkYXMtbW9zdC13aXNobGlzdGVkLXVuaXF1ZS1zdGF5cy9pdDkwMzE10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hobbit-themed Airbnb near Osoyoos named one of Canada's most wishlisted unique stays | iNFOnews | Thompson ...,"Penticton News Hobbit-themed Airbnb near Osoyoos named one of Canada’s most wishlisted unique stays

Second Breakfast Hideaway near Osoyoos Image Credit: Airbnb

An incredibly popular Airbnb among Lord of the Rings fans is one of Canada’s most wish-listed unique stays.

Airbnb recently announced a list of 26 unique wishlisted destinations ranging from a lighthouse in Nova Scotia to a treehouse in Chilliwack in time for the peak tourism season.

Second Breakfast Hideaway an Airbnb-themed after J.R.R. Tolkien's hobbit homes on the side of hills is a roughly 25-minute drive east of Osoyoos.

Travelers are taking advantage of unique Canadian properties like tiny homes treehouses earth homes barns and boathouses like never before according to Airbnb. Airbnb data shows that nights booked at unique listings in Canada increased by almost 70 percent last year compared to 2019.

Second Breakfast Hideaway with room for two is a roughly 25-minute drive east of Osoyoos.

Owner Christina Le Comte had no idea her Airbnb hobbit hole made the list but said it was “amazing.”

“You’re a little bit away from the world so you forget a bit about the outside world” she said.

The Airbnb attracts all sorts of visitors mostly Lord of the Rings fans who even don costumes after they arrive she said.

“The guests are a lot of fun” Le Comte. A secret wedding was even done last year at the hobbit house and engagements are quite popular at its location.

Le Comte has read The Hobbit and she’s become versed in Lord of the Rings lore since she and her husband took over the property in 2020.

For the 2022 season Second Breakfast Hideaway is mostly booked but some spots are still available due to cancellations she said.

The hobbit hole will likely be closed from mid-November to early February next year for the season but until then take a trip to Middle Earth by visiting the Second Breakfast Hideaway Airbnb's website.

Among the most popular castles available for rent on Airbnb are The Tower Thornton Castle in Aberdeenshire Craster Tower in Alnwick Yannon Towers in Teignmouth and Kinnettles Mansion in Fife.

The Scottish county of Fife is also home to Dairsie Castle with site host Etsuko saying: ""As an Airbnb Host it's fantastic to see guests exploring the castle.

""It's such a unique historical building and it's wonderful that today it's still filled with the laughter of families and friends.""

Investing for the long haul is a long-proven way to build wealth and patience is well-rewarded for those who pick well and let great companies take care of their businesses and their investors.

Heck if you had put $10000 in the S&P 500 say 20 years ago and let it run that stake would have returned a cool $58940 counting dividends and share price gain through that metric known as total return.

And if you'd rather choose individual equities you don't have to chase growth stocks with all their volatility. You can go slow and steady and just buy stocks in companies that do warehouses office buildings and shopping centers.

Here are three real estate investment trusts (REITs) that do just that and each has soundly beaten the S&P 500 over the past two decades while providing respectable dividend yields along the way.

Prologis the warehouse behemoth

Prologis (PLD 2.95%) is not just the biggest of industrial REITs; by market cap it's the largest of the more than 225 publicly traded REITs. Behind that current valuation of about $128 billion is a portfolio of nearly a billion square feet of critical warehouse and distribution space serving 5500 customers from about 4700 facilities in 19 countries.

While on a particularly hot streak like any other major owner of property in the very hot logistics space San Francisco-based Prologis also has a long record of rewarding shareholders providing a total return over the past 20 years of 1140% more than twice that of the S&P 500. It's raised its dividend for nine straight years too and is currently yielding about 1.83%.

Long-term demand for consumer e-commerce and business-to-business space doesn't appear to be abating and Prologis looks to keep growing its share continuing its internal expansion while reports circulate of possible acquisitions in Europe.

Alexandria Real Estate Equities does offices but not just any offices

Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE -0.13%) provides office and laboratory space to many of the biggest names in the biopharma business including the new Moderna headquarters near Boston.

This office REIT now has a market cap of about $33 billion has been around since the 1990s and concentrates its business in collaborative campus clusters in its hometown of San Diego and in and around San Francisco Seattle New York City North Carolina's Research Triangle and the Washington D.C. area.

Alexandria has been steadily growing for a long time and has seen increased momentum as demand grew for its current space -- and anything more it could develop -- during the pandemic. That can be expected to help the company continue a streak of 12 years of dividend increases that are rewarding shareholders with a current yield of about 2.29%.

Federal Realty Investment Trust is a Dividend King

Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT 0.95%) is a retail REIT a somewhat battered sector in which to find a Dividend King. That means it's one of about 30 members of the S&P 500 that have raised its dividend for 50 straight years.

For Federal Realty make that 54 years giving this Bethesda Maryland-based proprietor of high-quality retail-based properties the longest such record among all REITs.

The company currently has a portfolio of about 104 properties mostly in desirable areas in the Boston San Francisco Los Angeles and Washington D.C. markets. With a market cap of just shy of $10 billion this REIT is the smallest of the three here but its slow and steady performance through good times and bad stands it well for the future and currently pays shareholders a yield of about 3.50%.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The rare alignment of the four planets has not been seen in more than 1000 years since the year 947 AD.

“It’s very rare that you say that the planets are aligning and they actually do!” astrophysicist and cosmologist from the Australian National University Dr Brad Tucker told Sunrise.

“It does happen but quite rarely.

“We often get Mars Venus or even Jupiter joining but the fact that they’re all aligned and evenly spaced in the early morning sky is not only rare it’s a special treat because everyone can enjoy it as long as you have some clear weather.”

To see the planetary quartet skywatchers in the southern hemisphere should head outside about an hour before the sun comes up and gaze southeast.

“The trick here is to go out in the early morning” Tucker said from Mittagong NSW.

“What you wanna do is go about an hour or an hour-and-a-half before sunrise so about 4.30am to 5am local time.

“Look towards the east where the sun is rising and what you’ll see is you’ll have Saturn on top followed by Mars then Venus - Venus is the really bright one - and then Jupiter.”

If conditions are clear all four planets will be bright enough to see with the naked eye without the aid of binoculars or a telescope.

Over the next couple of weeks Jupiter and Saturn will get closer together Tucker said.

Jupiter will be the second-brightest planet in the celestial gathering but will appear lowest on the horizon which could make it tricky to spot. That will change as the month goes on according to NASA.

“Then next week the moon is going to get in on the action” Tucker said.

“On the 25th the moon is going to be like the celestial fifth wheel.”

Though this month’s skywatching event makes it look like the planets form a neat line in space it’s actually just a matter of perspective.

Each planet in the solar system circles the sun on the same flat plane which means that as they occasionally swing past each other in their orbits they appear to form a straight line in Earth’s skies.

This tidy positioning however would look very different from any other vantage point in space.

The planets will be viewable in the predawn sky all month and April’s alignment will set the stage for an even more spectacular skywatching event this winter.

From late June to early July five planets - Mercury Venus Mars Jupiter and Saturn - will be visible in the sky before sunrise in a major alignment that only occurs every few years.

NASA to beam human DNA code into space

NASA scientists have developed a new message that they intend to beam out into space in an attempt to reach extra-terrestrial life.

Tucker says it’s like they’re sending “a bit of an instruction code”.

“It’s like NASA’s version of an IKEA space message: Here’s how you construct our DNA and genome here’s the direction to our planet or solar system this is what makes us up.”

But we aren’t expecting any answers any time soon.

“It’s more of a sign that if there’s civilisations out there in the future and they’re wondering if they alone they can at least say ‘Hey there was something and that’s where they were and that’s what they looked like.”

Deloitte

Ernst & Young and Deloitte have landed separate contracts on the government’s ongoing GovERP project which seeks to align the SAP systems among a number of large government departments.

Services Australia has tapped the Big Four firms to support the federal government’s SAP-based overhaul and alignment of its enterprise resource planning systems.

Sharing in initial spoils of more than $20 million EY will help to deliver the unified SAP S/4 HANA platform through to the middle of next year while Deloitte has been contracted for program management services over the same period.

Underway since 2019 the GovERP project has been described as providing the APS with a common “digital backbone” in standardising ERP systems across the government’s six shared-services hubs located within the ATO the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade the Industry department Treasury and Finance and Services Australia – with five of those operating on existing SAP systems with support set to expire in 2025.

Granted in November but only recently published the $14.5 million contract awarded to EY has seen it named as a GovERP “strategic delivery partner” the first time the firm has been engaged on the stuttering project which racked up a $35 million contractor bill over its first two years for apparently little progress and has since changed oversight.

The total expected cost of the project remains undisclosed with the government citing commercial sensitivities for not disclosing details.

A spokesperson from Services Australia which last year took over the project from the Finance department due to the latter’s lack of in-house expertise (with Services Australia claimed to have the largest SAP workforce in the Southern Hemisphere) told media outlet InnovationAus that EY would work alongside its staff and “provide specialised skills across design and development enterprise architecture and release management.”

Meanwhile fellow Big Four professional services firm Deloitte has since been awarded a $6 million mandate on the project and will according to the Services Australia spokesperson provide “specialised programme management functions including programme and project governance coordination management and administration management of benefits tracking of programme risks and issues and programme scheduling.”

Alongside Accenture and strategy consulting giants McKinsey and BCG the Big Four have been significant beneficiaries of recent federal government largesse driven largely by the Covid-19 pandemic and widespread digital transformation agenda. The first year of the pandemic saw Deloitte and EY grow their federal government take by upwards of 33 percent with the latter then more than doubling its haul again in 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9jb25uZWN0ZWRjYXIuY29tLzIwMjIvMDQvZXhyby10ZWNoLWNvaWwtZHJpdmVyLXdpbnMtZ29sZC1lZGlzb24tYXdhcmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EXRO Tech Coil Driver Wins Gold Edison Award | auto connected car news,"[/caption]

It’s the largest horse fair in the country dating back to 1979.

What You Need To Know ​Midwest Horse Fair brings in about 60000 equine enthusiasts from Wisconsin and beyond





The Midwest Horse Fair has an 11 million dollar impact on the local economy





The Midwest Horse Fair began in 1979



After a two-year hiatus because of COVID-19 the Alliant Energy Center transformed into a horse lover’s paradise for the three-day event.

From clinics by top trainers to entertainment and shopping there was something for everybody.

According to Megan Hanuszczak Midwest Horse Fair’s executive director the event brings in about 60000 equine enthusiasts from Wisconsin and other parts of the Midwest.

“The Midwest Horse Fair has an 11 million dollar impact on the local economy. We are also huge supporters of the equine community in general. All of the money the fair generates goes back to the Wisconsin Horse Council and gets pumped back into the industry” Hanuszczak said.

Michelle Endries the owner of Horsey Habit Saddlery in Manitowoc Wisconsin is one of 500 vendors who has looked forward to this day for a long time.

Endries has been going non-stop since the Alliant Energy Center opened its doors.

Where You've Seen Dennis Haysbert Before,"Dennis Haysbert might be one of the most well-known people on TV but few know the actor’s name. Haysbert is the famous face of Allstate appearing in their commercials for almost 20 years now. But what do we know about the actor?

Dennis Haysbert’s Acting Career Before Allstate

Haysbert began acting after graduating from high school studying at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He began appearing on screen in the late 70s with minor roles in shows like The A-Team Dallas and Magnum P.I.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CcWeu4apdma/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link

The actor also showed up on the big screen earning roles in movies like Major League Navy SEALs and Mr. Baseball. However his biggest role was yet to come. Haysbert began appearing in Allstate commercials in 2003 and is still doing so today.

Allstate Has Made Haysbert A Millionaire

Haysbert has become known for his deep voice calm demeanor and catchphrase: “That’s Allstate’s stand. Are you in good hands?” He has appeared in dozens of the insurance company’s commercials becoming known all over the world as “the Allstate guy.”

Allstate commercials aren’t the only ones featuring Haysbert’s face and distinctive voice. In 2008 the actor appeared in a national ad campaign to raise awareness about lending discrimination. He also did some voiceover work in 2006 to promote ticket sales for Brigham Young University’s football team; his younger brother was a wide receiver on the team in the ’80s.

His Recent Acting Work

Even though he has made millions working for Allstate—the actor’s net worth is a whopping $14 million—Haysbert continues to show up in popular movies and TV shows. The actor’s recent appearances include roles on Brooklyn Nine-Nine Lucifer Kung Fu Panda 2 and The Dark Tower. Some of his most recent acting projects include the Hulu film No Exit Chip ‘n’ Dale: Rescue Rangers and the upcoming romantic comedy Silent Retreat.

While Haysbert is probably the most famous face in Allstate commercials he does have some competition. Another popular ad campaign from the insurance company features Dean Winters as Mayhem. Winters has been appearing in the commercials since 2010 and his ads are hugely popular.

Haysbert is one of the most famous faces in commercials today but few know that he has had a long and successful career as an actor all while assuring us that Allstate customers are in good hands.

The world's largest internet company said it plans to spend $750 million in Nebraska this year most of it on a new data center on the northwest side of Omaha near State Street and Blair High Road and on the continued buildout of a data center in Papillion that started construction in 2019 and is partially operational.

No mention was made however of a potential Lincoln project.

Though no one has publicly admitted Google is the company planning the huge data center complex northwest of the 56th Street exit on Interstate 80 signs point that direction.

A company called Agate LLC owns the nearly 600 acres of land where the data center is proposed but XXVI Holdings Inc. which is owned by Google's parent company Alphabet applied for tax incentives for the project.

XXVI Holdings Inc. is the same company that applied for tax incentives for the Google data center in Papillion.

The Lincoln data center was originally proposed in the summer of 2019 and documents submitted to the city at the time suggested that at full buildout it could encompass 2 million square feet of buildings and have nearly 1000 employees.

The documents estimated construction would start in 2020 with the potential for 160 people to be working in the first buildings by 2022.

However no construction activity has occurred at the site although Lincoln Electric System did confirm it has completed preliminary design work for the electrical infrastructure needed for the center.

Officials from the Lincoln Chamber of Commerce and the Lincoln Partnership for Economic Development declined to comment on the project as did a spokeswoman for the Nebraska Department of Economic Development.

Google also declined to comment on any Lincoln plans.

According to documents filed with the City of Omaha operations for the new data center there will span multiple buildings totaling more than 1.4 million square feet along with equipment yards and parking areas. A Google representative estimated construction could last anywhere from 18 to 24 months.

Google’s efforts in Nebraska are part of its plan to invest about $9.5 billion in offices and data centers across the U.S. this year. In a news release the company also said it will create at least 12000 new full-time jobs. A representative for the company said Google did not have any new job figures to share for the Omaha area.

Also you can highlight a specific row or column to emphasize in a Google Sheets document. Google Sheets does pack ample formatting options to make those tables look great.

You can either use the default formatting options use themes to add some life to those charts or opt for an add-on to make changes. Let us show you how to format tables and charts in Google Sheets without further ado.

1. Change Table Colors

Google Sheets has default formatting options to change the header footer and cell colors. Let’s check it in action.

Step 1: Open a spreadsheet in Google Sheets.

Step 2: Once you are done adding entries and making tables click on Format at the top.

Step 4: Click on the little icon beside the current range and select a custom range in which you want to apply colors.

Step 5: Select one of the default styles and you will instantly see a new style in action.

To separate them from the bunch you can apply dark theme color to the header and footer. The default themes are designed to keep one raw in white and another in light shade for enough separation between the two.

You can even change the header color 1 color 2 and footer theme to your preference. Once you make changes in default styles it will be saved as a custom theme so that you can use it in the future with a single click. Hit the Done button and enjoy your spreadsheet in a colorful avatar.

2. Use Themes

Themes are most useful for making those bar and linear charts more attractive. You can completely change the look of added charts in Google Sheets with a single click. Here’s how.

Step 1: From Google Sheets select Format in the menu bar.

Step 2: Click on Themes from the drop-down menu.

Step 3: Check a bunch of default themes from the right sidebar.

Step 4: Select your preferred theme and check the new color in action.

We’d like to thank our Arlington neighbors and the County Board for their partnership and feedback through the years-long process of designing PenPlace a project we believe will benefit the entire region. With the County Board’s approval we look forward to continuing our work with the community as we take the next steps on this journey to build an integrated innovative and sustainable second headquarters in Arlington Virginia.

We announced in late 2018 that Arlington Virginia would be home to Amazon’s second headquarters (HQ2) and that we would bring more than 25000 jobs to the region. Since then we’ve made some significant progress in our commitment to be a trusted business and community partner. We’ve continued to engage with local organizations and now work with over 100 nonprofits civic groups and small businesses providing in-kind support and charitable donations.

Our hard-working recruiting teams have crossed an important hiring milestone with more than 5000 employees now assigned to our second headquarters. Our construction partners have put in more than 2 million hours of work and recently celebrated finishing the top floor—the “topping out”—of Met Park the first phase of HQ2. And finally our architecture design sustainability and transportation teams have engaged with the local community and partnered with Arlington County to continue improving the design of PenPlace the next phase of our development.

As we prepare to take the next step in our more than $2.5 billion HQ2 investment we want to provide a snapshot of what the project will bring to the Arlington community and the wider region. Here are some highlights:

More sustainable by design

When we announced the development of HQ2 we challenged ourselves to think big and design Amazon’s buildings in a way that helps lead the industry toward net-zero carbon. In pursuit of this goal we have electrified the operations of HQ2 eliminating the use of fossil fuels for buildings systems and our food service. We’ve committed to powering 100% of HQ2’s operations with renewable energy through a combination of off-site and on-site solar projects aligning with The Climate Pledge Amazon’s commitment to be net-zero carbon across its operations by 2040.

PenPlace will provide more than 100000 square feet of retail space for dining shopping and a childcare facility. Multimodal pathways will connect throughout the site to prioritize access by foot and bike.

To do this we’ve contracted 82 megawatts (MW) of energy from a new 120 MW solar farm in Pittsylvania County Virginia which is expected to generate 172500 megawatt hours (MWh) of renewable energy annually once operational later this year. The renewable energy generated at this site will be used in part for the operation of HQ2 and other Amazon-owned buildings across Virginia including Whole Foods Market stores and Amazon fulfillment centers. The remaining portion of energy generated by the solar farm has been contracted by Arlington County and will provide clean energy for use in the region. At PenPlace we will also have rooftop solar panels installed totaling 1 MW of clean energy capacity to further support our sustainability efforts.

Our plans to focus on sustainability at PenPlace include:



Committing to achieve LEED Platinum certification the highest sustainability certification for a development issued by the U.S. Green Building Council.

Integrating strategic climate-responsive design for our office buildings including high-performance glazing and built-in solar shading that will reduce the need for building heating and cooling targeting a savings of 30% over the American Society of Heating Refrigerating Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) baseline.

Providing more than 125 electric vehicle charging stations with the ability to double capacity as needed.

Leveraging low-flow fixtures and reclaimed water usage to reduce water consumption by 50% beyond national standards.

Reducing the amount of embodied carbon in the concrete structure compared to typical construction practices by at least 10% along with a commitment to offset 100% of the remaining embodied carbon from building materials.

Using bird-safe glass where appropriate on all seven buildings at PenPlace to ensure that the development is safer for the region’s bird population.

Connecting the neighborhood

We’ve designed PenPlace to be part of the local neighborhood because we want both employees and local residents to enjoy the space equally. This means considering how people will travel to get to PenPlace and how they will utilize the space each day. Our plans prioritize access by foot bike and public transportation with a 15-foot-wide multimodal path that will be part of the Green Ribbon a network of pedestrian and shared-use pathways throughout the neighborhood. When complete PenPlace will provide more than 900 interior and exterior bike storage stalls to encourage bike commuting over the use of single-occupancy vehicles. All vehicle movements on-site will occur underground including loading docks which allows for contiguous outdoor public space with gathering areas public plazas and ample green space for the community to enjoy.

An open-air amphitheater will provide space for programming and events including concerts farmers markets and evening movie screenings.

Providing parks and public space

After engaging with the local community we heard feedback from our neighbors and shifted our designs to integrate more planting areas and maximize publicly accessible green space at PenPlace. The project will create 2.75 acres of public park space available for community use including immersive forest rooms shaded seating groves water features and many native and pollinator gardens. We will plant more than 100 native plant species and over 500 new trees throughout the site—all inspired by the natural ecosystems of the surrounding region. An open-air amphitheater will provide space for programming and events including concerts farmers markets and evening movie screenings. We will also build a dog run for Arlington’s four-legged residents.

In addition to the central green PenPlace will include immersive forest rooms shaded seating groves water features a dog run and many native and pollinator gardens all for the community to enjoy.

Adding vibrancy to the neighborhood

One of the main opportunities of designing a welcoming inviting and well-connected development will be the ability to support vibrant local small businesses. PenPlace will provide more than 100000 square feet of space for dining shopping a childcare facility and other opportunities across the main buildings and three retail pavilions. We’re also dedicating over 26500 square feet to establish a new home for Arlington County Community High School. This public school will provide an opportunity for approximately 300 students to pursue their academic goals while preparing for the future.

Building more than office space

The Helix a spiral-shaped building in the northeast corner of PenPlace will become a landmark for Arlington and the National Landing area. This distinctive building will take our biophilic-led design principles to new heights integrating nature and working to inspire innovation and invention. The interior of the Helix will provide formal and casual meeting spaces in an environment filled with more than 25000 square feet of planting areas and living walls. The exterior of the structure will feature two paths for employees to engage with colleagues in meetings or to take in views of Arlington the Potomac River and Washington D.C. The Helix will also be home to an artist-in-residence program and a meeting center and it will be open to the public and community to enjoy two days per month. We can’t wait for everyone to see this unique and thoughtfully designed space come to life.

Engaging with the local community

We know that success and scale bring broad responsibility and we strive to be good neighbors in the communities in which we operate. When we chose National Landing as the site of HQ2 we made a commitment to be a trusted business and community partner in the region and our work to become a part of the fabric of this community reflects that commitment daily.

First local retailer signs on to open shop at Amazon’s HQ2 District Dogs is the first small business to sign a lease at HQ2 as part of Amazon’s pledge to bring local minority- and women-owned retailers to its second headquarters in Arlington Virginia. Watch now

Since we announced Arlington as the site of HQ2 in 2018 we have committed more than $35 million in total investments to local nonprofits community groups public schools and businesses. This includes both monetary and in-kind donations—like school supplies to public schools across Northern Virginia and food donations to local food banks and pantries for families in need. We also know that housing affordability is front of mind for many in the community. Through the Housing Equity Fund we’ve contributed more than $800 million to support affordable housing in the Arlington and metro-Washington D.C. areas with more to come. Since the launch of the Amazon Housing Equity Fund 15 months ago our efforts are helping to create and preserve more than 4400 affordable homes. Based on data provided by Arlington County the Fund has helped to increase the affordable housing stock in Arlington by 22%.

We will continue to engage with the Arlington community to understand how we can best support the issues that matter to local residents. Our goal is to build a second headquarters that integrates into the surrounding neighborhood and benefits the entire region. We appreciate Arlington County and the community’s partnership in this process and we are excited to continue the conversation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vamFjb2Jpbi5jb20vMjAyMi8wNC9hbWF6b24tdW5pb24tc3RhdGVuLWlzbGFuZC1hbHUtY2hyaXMtc21hbGxzLWJlcm5pZS1zYW5kZXJzLWludGVydmlld9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Workers Behind Amazon's Historic First Union Explain How They Did It,"At the end of March workers at Amazon’s JFK8 facility made history: they voted in favor of a union. Much press coverage of their stunning win fails to capture the two-year road to victory from Amazon’s public firing of organizer Chris Smalls in 2020 to the corporation’s vociferous anti-union campaign. But now that Amazon Labor Union (ALU) organizers have taken on a multibillion-dollar company and won they’re eager to share their winning strategies with workers looking to unionize.

In a conversation with Jacobin contributor Eric Blanc (and guest Bernie Sanders whose remarks can be read here) ALU organizers Michelle Valentin Nieves Chris Smalls and Angelika Maldonado offer their perspectives on the tactics that helped them build solidarity created a thriving culture of organizing and convinced their fellow coworkers to support the union. Throughout the discussion hosted by Jacobin and the Emergency Workplace Organizing Committee they stress that these tactics can be applied successfully to workplaces across the country lending to the creation of a much bigger movement. The full discussion can be watched on Jacobin’s YouTube channel.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNpdHkubnljLzIwMjIvMDQvMjQvYmVybmllLXNhbmRlcnMtb2Nhc2lvLWNvcnRlei1hbWF6b24tbGFib3ItdW5pb24tc2Vjb25kLXZvdGUtc3RhdGVuLWlzbGFuZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bernie Sanders and AOC Rally With Amazon Workers Ahead of Second Warehouse Vote,"What started out as a lonesome quixotic battle to unionize workers against online retail behemoth Amazon is getting a major boost from national progressive lawmakers.

U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez rallied around Amazon Labor Union members and warehouse workers on Staten Island as the union prepares for the start of a second vote on Monday at a distribution center known as LDJ5 where some 1500 employees ready orders for delivery.

“What this struggle is about it’s not just Amazon Staten Island. This is the struggle that is taking place all across this country. Working people are sick and tired of falling further and further behind while billionaires like [Amazon founder Jeff] Bezos becomes much richer” Sanders told the crowd of more than 300 people gathered near the bus stop that’s become the nucleus for ALU’s drive.

The once-longshot organizers are hoping to replicate their success earlier this month when they pulled off a history-making upset at the JFK8 Amazon warehouse across the street from LDJ5 becoming the first Amazon union in the country.

After receiving minimal support from progressive stakeholders who remained largely silent during the unionization drive the prevailing theme for Amazon Labor Union’s leaders going forward is solidarity.

Calling the rally “Solidarity Sunday” Amazon Labor Union President Chris Smalls told THE CITY that presenting a unified front is “very important” for boosting worker morale ahead of the vote.

“You have to have politician support. We have to have the community supporting us and today was a good example and a good start to that leading up to the election that takes place tomorrow. So we couldn’t have asked for anything better than to have Bernie and AOC show up today” Smalls said wearing a red yellow and black bomber jacket embroidered with the words ‘Eat the Rich.’

The ALU’s demands remain the same at LDJ5: a $30 an hour minimum wage better working conditions including two paid 30-minute breaks and an hour-long paid lunch break better medical leave additional paid time off and eliminating productivity rates that require workers to pick a certain number of items per hour.

But organizing workers at LDJ5 comes with its own set of challenges and Amazon has no plans on relenting against the union having already filed objections to the first vote claiming that the National Labor Relations Board is giving the ALU preferential treatment.

Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

‘Lies and Rumors’

Amazon has been shutting down the LDJ5 facility for an hour each shift to pull workers into so-called captive audience meetings staged by management to discuss the pitfalls of unionizing said Maddie Wesley an LDJ5 worker since August 2021 and the treasurer of the ALU.

The mood inside the distribution center has been “very intense” in recent weeks Wesley recalled to THE CITY as she was about to begin her Sunday afternoon shift.

“It’s a smaller facility so we thought that would actually make it easier. But what’s made it difficult is that rumors spread quicker in a smaller facility and so Amazon’s method of spreading lies and rumors has been somewhat effective because everyone kind of knows each other in the building” Wesley said.

Among those rumors is that ALU leaders bought lavish cars with the money the union raised so far — almost $323000 through GoFundMe up from the roughly $100000 they received prior to the first vote at JFK8.

Wesley said she’s heard rumors that she purchased a Mercedes Benz and that Smalls bought himself a Lamborghini.

“I got a little toy one from the dollar store” Smalls joked.

Across the street at the JFK8 warehouse management has been “grabbing people” and asking them to meet privately with Amazon lawyers and human resources to question them about whether they were coerced to vote in favor of unionization said Pasquale Cioffi a process assistant at JFK8 and supporter of the ALU who has been working for the company for two years.

“They’re putting pressure on the workers” said Cioffi who’s known as “Uncle Pat” among workers and the union. “They’re grabbing people they’re taking them to the office and they want to know if they were somehow threatened.”

The unionization drive was sparked by Smalls’ termination in the spring of 2020 for allegedly breaking safety guidelines after organizing a protest over what workers alleged were inadequate COVID-protection measures.

In the months since Smalls his best friend Derrick Palmer and other current and former Amazon workers have staked out a bus stop on the sprawling Staten Island campus talking to workers about the benefits of joining a union as they go to-and-from their jobs.

The ALU’s unconventional tactics — like hosting barbecues and events outside of the facilities and deploying a robust social media presence on Instagram and TikTok — have so far proved successful against the multi-billion dollar online retailer.

In the days leading up to the Monday vote The Rolling Library a mutual aid group partnered with the ALU to offer free books and COVID tests to workers. Meanwhile members of the union stationed themselves outside of LDJ5 setting up a table outside one of the warehouse’s entrances to distribute union literature snacks and barbeque fixings.

Within the distribution center a 975000 square foot facility opened in the fall of 2020 Amazon has ratcheted up its union-busting effort deploying the same anti-union literature posters and TV images it did at the warehouse across the street workers said.

“It’s everywhere all over the facility ‘please vote no’ ‘please vote no’” said Wesley.

According to Smalls Amazon is “doubling down tripling down on union busting.”

“It’s easier for them to isolate workers so it’s a challenge. It’s definitely a challenge for organizing and they’re demonizing them and we have to withstand the onslaught of that as well. But I think the momentum is with the workers” Smalls said.

The organizing effort secured a key win earlier this week when an administrative judge ordered that Amazon would have to reinstate and pay lost wages to Gerald Bryson a JFK8 worker who helped lead the protest over working conditions at the warehouse. Bryson was fired by the company after staging another demonstration and getting into an argument with a coworker.

AOC: ‘NYC Is a Union Town’

The vote count for LDJ5 is slated to begin on May 2. In the meantime the ALU is asking Amazon to recognize the union and begin negotiating a contract which the ALU leadership considers the “real fight.”

“First and foremost Jeff Bezos Amazon everybody we got to recognize the fact that they did this thing and won a union election fair and square right here in New York City” said Ocasio-Cortez. “And now what we need to do next is make sure we support them.”

“All of us as a city need to remember that New York City is a union town. Here in New York you gotta treat our people right. If you can go to space you can give our people a bathroom break” she added referring to Bezos’ “astronaut” tourism.

Propelled into the spotlight Smalls has been a fixture on cable shows and late night TV in the weeks since the historic win — appearing on Tucker Carlson’s FOX News show and the Daily Show with Trevor Noah.

Media interest has also blossomed with dozens of cameras and reporters from major news outlets swarming to cover the ALU’s Sunday event a far bigger crowd than at their press conference two weeks ago.

“We expected that after the win. We didn’t know it would be that rapid. This is about how we balance and stay grounded and stay true to what the ALU represents and don’t get distracted by the outside” said Smalls.

“It’s been a whirlwind of things. I’m just trying to balance things as best as possible” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvdW5pb25zLXB1c2gtYXQtYW1hem9uLWFwcGxlLWFuZC1zdGFyYnVja3MtY291bGQtYmUtbW9zdC1zaWduaWZpY2FudC1tb21lbnQtaW4tdGhlLWFtZXJpY2FuLWxhYm9yLW1vdmVtZW50LWluLWRlY2FkZXMtMTE2NTA2NTczODbSAaYBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0d2F0Y2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS91bmlvbnMtcHVzaC1hdC1hbWF6b24tYXBwbGUtYW5kLXN0YXJidWNrcy1jb3VsZC1iZS1tb3N0LXNpZ25pZmljYW50LW1vbWVudC1pbi10aGUtYW1lcmljYW4tbGFib3ItbW92ZW1lbnQtaW4tZGVjYWRlcy0xMTY1MDY1NzM4Ng?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Unions' push at Amazon Apple and Starbucks could be 'most significant moment in the American labor movement' in decades,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/unions-push-at-amazon-apple-and-starbucks-could-be-most-significant-moment-in-the-american-labor-movement-in-decades-11650657386 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvdW5pb25zLXB1c2gtYXQtYW1hem9uLWFwcGxlLWFuZC1zdGFyYnVja3MtY291bGQtYmUtbW9zdC1zaWduaWZpY2FudC1tb21lbnQtaW4tdGhlLWFtZXJpY2FuLWxhYm9yLW1vdmVtZW50LWluLWRlY2FkZXMtMTE2NTA2NTczODbSAaYBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0d2F0Y2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS91bmlvbnMtcHVzaC1hdC1hbWF6b24tYXBwbGUtYW5kLXN0YXJidWNrcy1jb3VsZC1iZS1tb3N0LXNpZ25pZmljYW50LW1vbWVudC1pbi10aGUtYW1lcmljYW4tbGFib3ItbW92ZW1lbnQtaW4tZGVjYWRlcy0xMTY1MDY1NzM4Ng?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvdGhlLXJlc3VyZ2VuY2Utb2YtdW5pb25zLWFtYXpvbi1hbmQtamZrOC_SAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy90aGUtcmVzdXJnZW5jZS1vZi11bmlvbnMtYW1hem9uLWFuZC1qZms4Lw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The resurgence of unions and the fight against Amazon,"The number of Americans who belong to labor unions had been dropping for decades. But suddenly in the last year or so the winds have changed. Unionization efforts are underway at tech companies like Apple and Google; media organizations like The New York Times and Condé Nast; and among grad students delivery drivers and baristas.

Since December when a Starbucks in Buffalo was the first to vote to unionize workers at 16 Starbucks stores have followed suit. (Yes they vote one store at a time.) One Starbucks picketer in Denver said ""We've had a lot of intimidation and a lot of efforts to stop us. But we're here!""

And over 200 more have petitioned to vote.

And then three weeks ago there was news that stunned the business world about America's second-largest employer: JFK8 a massive Amazon warehouse on Staten Island that employs 8300 people voted to unionize.

""It's Amazon vs. the People and the people have spoken"" said organizer Chris Smalls. ""We want to thank Jeff Bezos for going to space 'cause when he was up there we were signing people up!""

Correspondent David Pogue asked Smalls ""Weren't there people saying 'Dude these efforts never succeed'?""

""Of course! I think everybody wrote us off. Everyone didn't believe we would even get to an election let alone win.""

Smalls a former Amazon worker led the union drive but that wasn't his original plan: ""I had no intentions on unionizing. Just trying to do the right things and protect people from dying from COVID-19.""

In March 2020 he'd organized a walkout to protest the lack of face masks and other COVID gear at JFK8. Amazon fired him and in a leaked memo an executive called him ""Not smart or articulate.""

Smalls soon learned that he wasn't the only unhappy Amazonian. Another Amazon warehouse on Staten Island begins a unionizing vote tomorrow.

Workers Brett Mat and Martha have been talking to fellow employees out front. ""They take care of the robots better than humans"" Brett told Pogue. ""They don't give you ample amount of time to go to the bathroom.""

Martha said ""You got people that's barely making enough.""

Mat said ""We want to be able to say 'These things have to change' and negotiate that in a contract.""

Smalls' strategy to unionize JFK8 involved a social-media campaign and small grassroots gestures all paid for by donations: ""We would feed them you know pizza catered food soul food different cultural food. That's what the union represents you know? Taking care of one another.""

Amazon fought back hard using the standard union-busting playbook. It spent over $4 million on consultants and required every employee to attend anti-union meetings.

Ruth Milkman a labor expert and professor at the City University of New York explained: ""They'll say 'Oh this organization they're not gonna do anything for you. They're just gonna take your money. And by the way they might make you go on strike. You might not receive any income for that period.' It can be very intimidating and very effective.""

But not this time. JFK8 voted to unionize.

Pogue said to Smalls ""So I think what you're saying is you succeeded because you were smart and articulate?""

""Pretty much!"" he laughed.

Amazon declined an interview but told ""CBS Sunday Morning"" in a statement: ""We don't think unions are the best answer for our employees. Our focus remains on working directly with our team to continue making Amazon a great place to work.""

Amazon is also challenging the validity of the JFK8 vote and points out that it already offers better-than-average pay and benefits — $15 an hour starting wage and health insurance.

But Ruth Milkman says that it's about more than dollars: ""Workers want respect. They want to be treated with dignity. And I think you can see that really clearly in the story at Staten Island. They're treated like machines.""

Pogue asked ""In what ways are these workforces and these unions different from the old union factory efforts?""

""What's different I think is the zeitgeist especially [among] young workers who've lived through a lot of turmoil"" Milkman replied. ""They have these high expectations for what their work life is supposed to be about. And then they can't afford the rents. They might have a lot of student debt. They end up living with their parents. I mean this is not what they were promised.

""The pandemic also created a labor shortage which gave people more leverage and made them less fearful of organizing"" she said. ""Unions are cool again for this generation.""

To many of the workers at JFK8 Chris Smalls is definitely cool.

One of them drove by during our interview and expressed his own thoughts on the unionization effort: ""**** Amazon!""

""What'd he say?"" asked Pogue.

""I won't say that word but I guess he's pro-union!"" Smalls laughed.

But the soaring cost of fossil fuels and unexpected disruptions in energy security are now supercharging what was already a torrid pace of growth in solar wind and battery storage projects.

IEEFA predicted last year that wind solar and hydro’s share of the U.S. electric power market would approach 30 percent by the end of 2026. IEEFA now believes the forecast reflected the low end of possible growth given the significant acceleration in expected solar and wind (particularly offshore) capacity installations through 2026. We now expect that clean energy’s share of the electric generation market could hit 33 percent or more. Together with existing nuclear generation this would push the U.S. share of carbon-free electricity to well over 50 percent—a massive transition from just five years ago.

Some of the most notable recent developments include:

Construction has begun on the first two commercial-scale offshore wind farms in the U.S. which has lagged far behind development efforts in Europe. A recent federal lease auction brought in a record $4.4 billion for development areas off the New Jersey/New York coasts and underscored investor enthusiasm for the resource’s economic potential over the coming decade. Offshore wind will have an increasing impact on power markets up and down the East Coast.

A significant shift among several of the largest traditionally coal-based utilities to completely move away from the fuel. Georgia Power Duke Energy and the Tennessee Valley Authority have all recently embraced plans for a 2035 coal plant phaseout.

An end to the decade-long run of annual increases of gas-fired electric generation. IEEFA projected last year that the increase in gas-fired capacity had plateaued; we now think that total annual gas-fired electricity generation has peaked as well. IEEFA believes that gas-fired generation in the U.S. peaked in 2020 and we expect it to decline this year and into the future as rapid growth in solar and wind output displaces both coal and gas generation. The challenges for gas have been exacerbated by the recent runup in prices and growing concerns about methane emissions from gas production and distribution which significantly reduce the fuel’s supposed environmental benefits.

Corporate renewable energy demand is climbing quickly as American businesses embrace net-zero goals pushed by consumer demand higher electricity prices and the rise in fossil fuel costs. This could drive the construction of as much as 94 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2030.

Real-world experience and research increasingly show that high levels of green energy with battery storage can be integrated into the U.S. power grid while maintaining system reliability. A recent report from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory concluded that with sufficient storage renewable generation (including solar wind hydropower geothermal and biofuel resources) could meet as much as 94% of demand on an annual basis with “no unserved energy and low reserve violations indicating no concerns about hourly load balancing through the end year of 2050.”[1]

The compelling economics and proven reliability of renewable energy and storage have changed perceptions in utility and corporate boardrooms across the U.S. driving a buildout of wind and solar generation portfolios and prompting businesses and consumers to push for greater access to green energy. With fossil fuel price volatility and energy security currently among the top concerns of executives and policymakers IEEFA finds the energy transition is tipping even more strongly toward renewables and battery storage and expects this trend will continue to drive fossil fuels out of the power market.

But help is available.,"CNN —

Each week Govonna Ingram has to decide which bills she can afford to pay while she looks for a job. Essentials like food for her two daughters and 1-year-old grandson take priority so the Chicago resident hasn’t been able to pay her utility bills since 2021.

Last month she received a notice from her gas company that it would shut off her service within a few weeks because she owed nearly $2600. That would mean the family would lose heat and hot water as well as the ability to use the stove.

“To get cut off in the wintertime we are going to be cold” said Ingram 49 a former restaurant manager. “We are not going to be able to cook or take baths because it’s chilly.”

Ultimately Ingram was able to receive help from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program which averted the gas disconnection. And she called her electric company and set up a payment plan to deal with that $2200 debt – borrowing $200 from friends to cover the first installment.

Many lower-income people have been protected from losing heat over the winter by state-based annual moratoriums. But that protection has largely ended for the season forcing consumers to contend with utility bills that have grown even bigger as the cost of energy has skyrocketed.

As of March the price for natural gas is 21.6% higher than it was a year earlier while electricity is up 11.1% according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The price of heating oil and propane is up 70.1%.

At the same time the increased costs of food housing and gasoline are crowding out some families’ ability to pay their natural gas heating oil and electric charges. Consumer price inflation hit a new 40-year high in March.

The looming wave of disconnections has alarmed consumer advocates who stress that those who have fallen behind should reach out to utility companies state agencies and local nonprofits. There’s more federal assistance for lower-income Americans than ever before – though it’s still not enough to help everyone. And many utilities are offering more generous repayment or forgiveness programs.

Many folks who lose service are later reconnected. They enter repayment plans receive assistance or borrow from friends or payday lenders to deal with their overdue bills.

Big bills accruing

The economic upheaval sparked by the Covid-19 pandemic has led to a massive increase in unpaid utility bills.

Arrearages stood at $23 billion in February up from $21 billion a year earlier and $10.5 billion in December 2019 according to Mark Wolfe executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. More than 20.1 million households have past-due bills.

“You would expect the numbers to come down a little bit faster because people are going back to work” Wolfe said. “Some of the issue is high inflation overall and families are being squeezed. This is one of the bills you can delay.”

While there was no federal moratorium to protect people from having their utilities disconnected many states put temporary ones in place at the start of the pandemic. Many utility companies also voluntarily stopped shutting off customers. Some of these measures lasted for only a few months while others continued into 2021.

Determining how many customers are being disconnected from their utilities is no easy task since there’s no nationwide clearinghouse collecting the information. An estimated 3.5 million people were disconnected in 2020 and 2021 in 32 states plus the District of Columbia according to data gathered by Jean Su director of the energy justice program at the Center for Biological Diversity.

More recently residents in the 33 states that have winter moratoriums had a brief respite. But those end between March and May.

“There will be a new tsunami of shutoffs from deferred arrearages because of the winter moratoria from the Ukraine-Russia war and increase in natural gas and from inflation and budget constraints on households” Su said. “All the really brutal choices that people are having to make are going to absolutely be the spotlight of the next coming months.”

Shutoff notices

In Massachusetts shutoff notices started going out in early April after the winter moratorium ended. Utilities will start disconnecting lower-income households at the end of the month said Charlie Harak staff attorney in the National Consumer Law Center’s Boston office.

Eversource a major natural gas and electricity provider in the Bay State is slowly restarting its disconnections of lower-income customers said Chief Customer Officer Jared Lawrence. The goal of the shutoff notices is to get residents to reach out since many haven’t paid as much attention to overdue bills during the moratorium he said.

The company offers an arrears management program to lower-income consumers where it will forgive 1/12 of their balances every time they make payments on time. It also started automatically enrolling qualified customers in January so the effort now has nearly 14300 participants up from 5600 before the pandemic.

Those with higher incomes can enter a separate program that allows them to pay off their balances within six months Lawrence said. Prior to the pandemic they had only four months to settle their overdue bills.

Some 225000 Eversource customers are delinquent down a little compared with the start of the pandemic Lawrence said. But the amount of the arrearages had grown to $279 million as of March up from $190 million in February 2020.

Other Massachusetts residents have already had their utilities shut off.

National Grid for instance has disconnected about 1100 customers so far this month said spokesman John Lamontagne. It’s an “absolute last-resort measure” he said. At-risk residents first receive a series of notices over 50 to 60 days to encourage them to join a repayment program.

The company has seen the number of Massachusetts customers at least three months behind in payments jump to roughly 203000 up from 195000 in 2020. They now owe $392 million up from $272 million in 2020.

Nearly 77000 of National Grid’s customers are in repayment plans up from 38000 in 2020.

A growing number of consumers struggling to pay their bills are higher on the income ladder and may never have received help before. The percentage increase in arrearages for lower-income Massachusetts residents was smaller than it was for those who earn more Harak said.

“Part of the problem is there’s a whole class of newly poor people who don’t know where to go” he said.

Customers who don’t meet the income criteria for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program can reach out to their utility companies about repayment plans.

But getting folks to call their providers can sometimes be a challenge because they don’t trust the companies said Jim Chilsen communications director at Citizens Utility Board a consumer advocacy group in Illinois.

The board assembled a list of how the major utilities in the state are handling disconnections and what payment arrangements they are offering. Lower-income residents will not have their power cut off through the end of July.

However most companies have started shutting off service to higher-income customers beginning with those with the largest overdue balances in April and then broadening it to more people. They are giving everyone either 12 or 18 months to pay off their past-due bills.

ComEd for instance is offering an option to higher-income Illinois customers to pay off their electric bill balances over 12 months said spokesman Tom Dominguez. Prior to the pandemic the utility typically gave residents only two or three months. Also it is waiving reconnection fees. But the option is available only until July 31.

“By putting that deadline there we’re hoping to create some urgency to get them to act” Dominguez said. “We’re trying to get them so they don’t get to the point where their electricity bill is just astronomical and it becomes really really difficult to catch up.”

Just over 11000 ComEd customers have been disconnected since the company started shutting off power again on April 5. The last time it cut off electricity in the fall enrollment in deferred payment arrangements nearly doubled.

At Peoples Gas which serves Chicago about 800 higher-income customers have been disconnected since the moratorium expired at the end of March according to spokesman David Schwartz.

Everyone who qualified for assistance and applied this year was able to receive it he noted.

More federal help available

Never before has there been so much federal aid to help struggling Americans pay their home heating bills. But it isn’t expected to meet the need.

Congress has more than doubled the amount of funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. An additional $4.5 billion in American Rescue Plan Act money is flowing into the program on top of the approximately $3.4 billion that Congress appropriated for fiscal year 2022. Also the bipartisan infrastructure law provided $100 million this year part of a five-year $500 million investment in the program.

When it released the final installment of LIHEAP money last week the Department of Health and Human Services noted the total was the largest single-year investment in the program since it was established in 1981.

In addition to LIHEAP states municipalities and community organizations can draw on certain coronavirus relief measures – including the roughly $45 billion Emergency Rental Assistance program and the $350 billion State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds – to address home energy costs.

About 5.6 million households typically receive assistance with heating bills from LIHEAP – only about 17% of those eligible Wolfe said. But that number could increase by 25% with the additional aid. Those who make either up to 150% of the federal poverty line which is around $41625 for a family of four or 60% of their state median income – whichever is higher – can qualify.

The pandemic relief funds meanwhile have different eligibility criteria and can help a wider swath of households including middle-income families who don’t qualify for LIHEAP.

Still it may not be enough to help everyone.

Illinois for instance has a total of $372 million to spend on assistance including the state Utility Disconnection Avoidance Program which launched last year to help lower-income residents according to Larry Dawson CEO of the Illinois Association of Community Action Agencies. Members of his group administer the distribution of LIHEAP funds at the local level. That’s up from $342 million last year.

The state hopes that this record level of funding will be sufficient to help all those who apply Dawson said. But the unknown variable is whether inflationary pressures will cause greater-than-expected demand for aid.

The nonprofit wants to make sure that the assistance each household receives is significant enough to prevent disconnection until the next round of LIHEAP funding is available in the fall.

“To do that you kind of have to go to that philosophy of helping fewer people more” he said. “It doesn’t help to make a payment that’s only significant enough to keep the person connected for maybe a month and then next month they get disconnected.”

“I turned my heat on very late in the winter” said Fuller-Jones 60 a widow who lives with her two children who are in their early 20s and an adult niece. “I told my kids ‘Look layer up. Bundle up.’ And I turned it off very early.”

The family was not disconnected in 2021 thanks to LIHEAP which also covered much of Fuller-Jones’ gas bill this past winter. But she is not sure she’ll be able to stay current especially since she’s paying more for housing gasoline and food.

“Thank goodness I only drive from home to work. I don’t do too much other than that. But I’ve felt the pinch” said Fuller-Jones a research analyst noting that it costs more than $50 to fill up her car. “We watch what we eat. Some things we were able to splurge on in the past is a thing of the past.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtjdXIub3JnL25ld3MvMjAyMi0wNC0yMy9sYW5kb3duZXJzLWZlYXItc2NhcnJlZC1sYW5kc2NhcGUtZnJvbS1wcm9qZWN0LXRvLWJyaW5nLWdyZWVuLWVuZXJneS1hY3Jvc3MtdGhlLW1pZHdlc3TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Landowners fear a 'scar' on landscape from project to bring green energy across the Midwest,"Loren Sprouse drove through his hometown of Braymer Missouri and noted the height of each structure he passed. The water tower loomed 100 feet high. The grain elevator was a little taller.

All were shorter than the proposed 130- to 160-foot electrical transmission towers that would cut through his property as part of the 800-mile Grain Belt Express transmission line.

The project which has been in the works for over 10 years would sit on only 18 acres of Sprouse’s farm. But he would be able to see it for miles.

“No one who owns land can’t feel a special place for that land … That’s why you want to maintain it” Sprouse said. “This line is not going to do that. It’s going to create a big obvious scar completely across the state. And it’ll be the single biggest ugliest thing in northern Missouri and with it set a precedent for more to be built just like it.”

Scar or not the line promises to connect three of the country’s regional electrical grids — Southwest Power Pool (SPP) Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) and PJM Interconnection — and would bring wind energy harnessed in southwest Kansas to other parts of the country.

Courtesy of Invenergy Landowners in the path of the Grain Belt Express would retain ownership and access to use the land beneath the transmission line.

Citing ominous warnings about the dangers of climate change national and local plans call for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. But to achieve those goals some renewable energy will have to be moved from where it’s easily harnessed to areas that need it. In the case of the Grain Belt Express that means moving wind energy from the gusty plains of Kansas to more densely populated areas.

Landowners like Sprouse say they aren’t opposed to clean energy projects. But they’re dead set against a private company using eminent domain to complete its project.

Interstate Transmission

Grain Belt Express which would cost an estimated $2 billion would stretch from just outside Dodge City Kansas across northern Missouri south central Illinois and into Indiana. The high voltage direct current (HVDC) line would transport 4000 megawatts of electricity both west to east and east to west in emergencies.

That’s the power equivalent of 15 million barrels of oil or enough to power 1.6 million homes annually. For the 39 municipalities in Missouri signed up to buy power off the line it’s an estimated $12.8 million in annual savings.

Patrick Whitty a senior vice president at Grain Belt Express developer Invenergy said the direct current (DC) transmission line is the most efficient way to transport power from where it’s generated to where it’s needed and with the smallest footprint.

DC as compared to alternating current (AC) allows a greater transmission of power that can go both directions on one line. There’s also a reduced loss of power from friction on a DC line.

“One of the major reliability benefits for Grain Belt will be the ability to also move power under emergency conditions from east to west” Whitty said. “Had Grain Belt been in place during (the winter storm power outages of February 2021) we know that some of those outage events could have been minimized or even avoided altogether.”

In both Kansas and Missouri Grain Belt has been able to prove its necessity to regulatory agencies and gain public utility status and thus the power to access private property via eminent domain.

The company said it would only use the power of condemnation as a last resort preferring instead to negotiate with landowners and establish a fair price for easements.

So far the company has secured voluntary agreements with 1200 of the 1700 parcels it will cross. To date Grain Belt has filed about 10 condemnation notices.

When Invenergy bought the project from Clean Line in 2018 Whitty said it sent out letters to landowners in Kansas and Missouri along the proposed route and informed them of the new ownership and compensation plan.

The company would pay landowners 110% of the fair market value of their land plus an additional $18000 for each tower placed on their property. Owners of “century farms” that have remained in the same family for more than 100 years would be paid an additional premium.

Courtesy of Invenergy The proposed route of the Grain Belt Express transmission line runs from western Kansas to Indiana.

“There is no transmission line that is without impacts but the best we can do is to make sure that landowners are fairly compensated” Whitty said. “In our case we are going well above and beyond what would be typical for a transmission project.”

He said the company is aware of the rising price of property as well as matters specific to one person’s property that could make it more valuable than the county averages.

“We value the dialogue with landowners when it comes to both matters of compensation as well as facility design” Whitty said. “Anytime a landowner can document (comparables) of higher land values we will consider that and very often we will revise land values upwards.”

Landowners can choose to have an upfront payment for their easement and tower or choose to have the payments spread out over the lifetime of the project. According to Whitty Invenergy has already promised $77 million in compensation agreements and has paid out $10 million of that.

Sprouse has a pretty good idea of where the line will go through his property because he knows it will follow the already cleared path of the three pipelines he hosts. Other landowners like Marilyn O’Bannon in Monroe County have less of an idea and feel shut out from the development process.

Whitty said this is because the line has to be looked at as a whole. Until all of the easements are agreed on the placement of the line through a particular parcel has to be somewhat fluid.

“Any one structure placement may have effects on adjacent structure placement so there’s a whole lot of design and engineering that has to go into that on the front end” Whitty said. “We’re still in that design and engineering phase.”

Tower placement also is dependent on conversations with the landowner and their knowledge of the land.

National Renewable Energy Laboratory The Great Plains offer the most reliable source for renewable wind energy in the United States.

“We’re getting input on areas within a landowner parcel or property that they either want to make sure we avoid or sometimes there are areas where they would prefer to see a structure … We want to understand as thoroughly as possible how we can best go about through the design and engineering phase minimizing impacts to the land” Whitty said.

Against the wind

Eight years ago O’Bannon didn’t know anything about the Grain Belt Express. Now it’s her life.

“I can’t describe what it’s like to wake up every morning and have this on your mind and go to bed with that being the last thing on your mind for eight years” O’Bannon said.

After learning from a friend that the line would cross through about five miles of her property she started digging to learn more about the project.

She found neighbors and other landowners along the route who also felt they’d been left in the dark and those who knew about the project weren’t asking enough questions. Is it safe? How will the county get money from it? Where will it go?

Through her work which has led her to an elected seat on the county commission O’Bannon has consistently felt out of the loop and disrespected by the company.

Cody Boston / Flatland Marilyn O’Bannon entered the political sphere to fight the Grain Belt Express. Now she’s a commissioner in Monroe County Missouri.

Other landowners like Wayne Wilcox of Randolph County have been involved in the project since before the route was proposed.

“The thing that I first looked at with them was ‘Were they honest?’” Wilcox said. “Would they accept comments from us? Would they work at making changes? And they did.”

He’s been attending meetings since the beginning and has had an easy time negotiating with the Grain Belt developer on his easement compensation and the placement of the line on his property.

Sprouse is waiting to hear back on his submitted counter offer and while more compensation would be great what he really wants is to not see the line.

He hopes it could be buried like the 350-mile SOO Green HDVC Link in Iowa that is following existing railroad easements. As an alternative he would proffer the Grain Belt Express follow highway right of ways in Missouri.

But Whitty said those alternatives weren’t viable.

Invenergy has experience with underground technology but existing buried lines aren’t as long nor do they carry as much power as Grain Belt would.

“That introduces a level of engineering and design considerations that simply make that infeasible” Whitty said. “With 95% of transmissions developed overhead that’s really just the most affordable way to build these projects.”

Cody Boston / Flatland Wayne Wilcox is a landowner and farmer in Randolph County who is supportive of the Grain Belt Express crossing his property.

Following the highway closest to the current route U.S. 36 would face the constraint of nearby state conservation sites as noted in Clean Line’s original route selection study .

So the route was proposed by the original developer of the Grain Belt Express. It mostly follows existing easements for pipelines or other power lines since the physical path is mostly cleared.

That is where it will go on Sprouse’s property.

He’s not against easements. He already has three pipelines and several rural water lines. But he’s against easements that he feels don’t benefit Missourians.

Sprouse remembers his father negotiating a piece of their family property for implementation of the AT&T transcontinental cable. Today his property still has an abandoned hut from the project a piece of the historical line which connected telephones across the country.

Landowners were compliant and excited for that line.

“This was built for the reason that eminent domain should exist. This was for government security” Sprouse said gesturing towards the hut. “They should have the right to eminent domain at the federal level because they were providing a service they were doing something the government needed.

“For someone who’s a private individual who’s just doing it to reap the benefits of that and in using the cheapest cost plan to do it that doesn’t justify the power of eminent domain” he said.

For the past several years opponents of the project have introduced bills in the Missouri General Assembly designed to kill the project.

If passed House Bill 2005 would retroactively strip the Grain Belt Express of its public utility status. It would increase easement payments to 150% of fair market value and require the line to deliver 50% of its transmission capability in Missouri.

Earlier this month it was reported “do pass” in the Missouri House. Opponents to the line are hopeful this year’s bill will pass.

Whitty admitted that a lot of the resentment towards the line goes back to the very beginnings of the project before Invenergy was in the picture.

“If I understand correctly there was no plan to deliver power into Missouri in the early iterations of this project and I think a lot of the perspectives may still be based around that” he said.

Since then Invenergy has come to agreements with the 39 municipalities to receive power off of the line and is looking to increase the number of Missourians who can benefit from the line.

“We are actively evaluating the opportunity not only to make sure we’re following through on delivering on the agreement with the 39 communities across Missouri … but also looking at how we can increase significantly the energy of delivery to Missouri” Whitty said.

Murky future

The 39 municipalities in Missouri were essential to Grain Belt’s public utility status.

Missouri Public Utility Alliance (MPUA) is constantly conducting studies on the power pools it buys and sells wholesale electricity for in the state.

John Twitty president of MPUA said as Grain Belt was being developed studies found the pool serving these 39 Missouri municipalities would need an additional source of power in order to meet future demands.

“The reason that we’re interested in (Grain Belt) is that we’re bringing low cost wind energy to our customers and obviously if you’re in a utility business you want to try to get really reliable electricity and you want to get it as inexpensively as possible” Twitty said.

Because Grain Belt Express is a merchant transmission line those signed to receive power off of the line will in effect help pay for the construction of the project.

The cost will be spread out over the 20-year contract the Missouri Joint Municipal Electric Utility Commission (a business unit of MPUA) has with Invenergy. Twitty said the project makes sense to join because once the upfront costs are gone the energy is cheap.

“Once you’ve spent that money there’s no fuel cost the wind is free” Twitty said. “Even though there are new upfront costs those can be defrayed over lots of energy that flows across the system.”

The 500 megawatts of power from the line are contractually obligated to these power pools meaning even if there’s higher demand in a bigger city these Missouri municipalities will keep their lights on.

Down the road Twitty foresees more Missouri cities and entities receiving the same low-cost power.

Sprouse and O’Bannon fear a future where their land is home to many transmission lines of this type. They fear the Grain Belt Express will set a precedent for crossing the Midwest via eminent domain.

When they joined the family business of farming and ranching neither of them thought a big infrastructure project would be part of their legacy.

“I don’t think that’s the legacy that I would want to see and I guess that’s the question” Sprouse said. “Is that the legacy Invenergy wants to see? Or do they just want to make a lot of money and go on?”

If the line goes in O’Bannon said her parents plan to move.

Her grandfather and father were born in the house that could soon have Grain Belt towers in the backyard. She has neighbors who she knows will move too. It’s more than just a 150-foot-wide easement that will be affected.

“It is not that we are against progress or renewables we’re against the way this business has conducted itself and the plan that they have to go through the middle of our farms” O’Bannon said. “It’s just unbelievable how that feels when you know in the end they’ve got the eminent domain as their card to play.”

Cody Boston / Flatland Billy Davies believes projects like the Grain Belt Express are crucial in mitigating the effects of climate change.

There is no perfect project.

Billy Davies conservation program coordinator with the Missouri Chapter of the Sierra Club said there always needs to be an evaluation of the people involved and the people benefiting from sustainability efforts.

”We need to be able to evaluate the good things and the bad things of every project including Grain Belt Express” Davies said. “If there are folks who are feeling left out and feeling like these solutions are not for them how are we working to support all in our community of Missouri?”

To Davies the property owners who support the Grain Belt Express by allowing the transmission line on their land are “kind of heroes.” Rather than think narrowly about the consequences of the towers on their land Davies urges opponents to think of the consequences for a nation that doesn’t make big moves toward a sustainable future.

That’s the approach Wilcox takes.

He’ll be able to see the tower from his house and will pass under it each day as he drives to town. Rather than look at the line as an eyesore Wilcox said he thinks of the benefits it will have on his community.

No municipalities in Randolph County are currently contracted to receive power off of the line but the tax revenue from a big infrastructure project will positively impact the public schools and libraries.

Wilcox reckons there’s no sense in avoiding the opportunities this line brings to Missouri. Ultimately he thinks the project will do more good than harm.

“I believe the project will go through and I believe that anybody that hasn’t negotiated with them needs to step up to the plate” Wilcox said. “I think they will find people that are reasonable to talk to and can work things out.”

One of the world’s most powerful whirlpools the currents and eddies (or “piglets”) have been known to separate divers from their chase boats by hundreds of yards and shoot upwellings that rock even the sturdiest of vessels.

Those currents may be treacherous for mariners but could be perfect for tidal energy. That’s the thinking of Maine-based Ocean Renewable Power Co. which plans to install a tidal generating device in the area as part of a microgrid that will serve as backup power for the city of Eastport.

If all goes according to plan the full-scale device which looks a bit like a giant DNA double helix anchored to the ocean floor would be installed by 2025 just east of Dog Island as long as the company can secure permits from state and federal agencies.

This is not the first time ORPC has tested the tides in the area. The company sank a similar earlier version of its tidal generator in the waters of Cobscook Bay on Eastport’s western shores a decade ago. That project which had a maximum output of 150 kilowatts of electricity enough to power about 25 homes became the first commercial tidal energy project in North America to connect to the grid.

But the success was short-lived: The unit stopped delivering electricity less than a year later after salt water infiltrated its electric generator. The apparatus was hoisted from the water and plans were made to reinstall it but ORPC ran into difficulties finding a replacement generator supplier a problem that persisted for several years.

The Cobscook Bay project never did get reconnected but the company learned a lot in those few months — about bolted connections shrinking in seawater weather delays and more cost-effective ways to deploy and retrieve the unit all changes that have been incorporated into the new design said John Ferland the ORPC president.

“I’m talking about things that aren’t glamorous like bearings and struts” said Ferland of the changes made to the device to address saltwater intrusion and other issues. “If I showed you two pictures one of what our device looked like 10 years ago and what it looks like now I think you would say ‘gosh there’s not much difference.’ Behind the curtain a lot of things are different.”

Eastport at the end of a single 40-mile transmission line used to rely on three decades-old diesel generators to provide power to residents if storms or accidents interrupted the power supply.

But after the electrician servicing the generators retired no one got them running again said Will Hopkins a longtime resident and president of the Cobscook Bay Resource Center and Versant Power turned its efforts into reinforcing the existing line.

Those who can afford it now have home generators and “the people that don’t have any money sit in the dark” said Hopkins. “Given that so much of Eastport’s population is very elderly that’s a lot of people that are not set up to survive for very long without electricity.”

A microgrid a smaller version of the mainland grid that could run on its own using localized energy generation (solar tidal power) and energy storage in the form of batteries was an attractive option to replace the town’s diesel generators. But it would require a lot of engineering and resources too expensive for the town to pursue alone.

With help from the Island Institute Eastport was selected to participate in the Department of Energy’s Energy Transitions Initiative Partnership Project (ETIPP) which provides free technical assistance to communities working to become more energy resilient. Islesboro was also one of the 11 communities nationwide selected to participate in the 12- to 18-month program.

Alongside ORPC the Island Institute and Versant Power the DOE is working with Eastport to locate and size a microgrid. Planning is still in the early stages but the ORPC’s tidal power device would be an integral part of the backup power generation along with solar and battery storage.

It doesn’t appear the grid will need any upgrades to accommodate the additional energy input said Judy Long a communications manager for Versant but the company wants to make sure that whatever is installed can handle the anticipated increase in electricity needs in the future.

The system also must be able to take in energy from resources that generate intermittently (solar tidal) and balance that with feeding the energy back out when the town is in “island mode” disconnected from the larger grid.

Engineers have long dreamed of harnessing energy from the tides but getting entirely submerged projects running has proven difficult. France and South Korea have long-running tidal energy projects but while they use turbines to generate energy from the movement of the tides both look more like traditional dams than the device designed by ORPC.

That’s one of the selling points for ORPC’s technology said Ferland.

“Our footprint is quite small” said Ferland. “If you took a megawatt of tidal energy and compared it with a megawatt of traditional hydro or even a solar farm or wind farm we’re using a percentage of the land area with our device.”

The project ORPC has planned for Eastport would eventually consist of a 5 megawatt project with three to five devices each measuring 122 feet wide by 71 feet high installed in a submerged array. That’s similar in size to a commercial solar array but with more consistent and predictable power generation one of the advantages of tidal energy. The company will start by testing a smaller similar unit in the area.

That reliability said Ferland along with redesigns over the years have helped ORPC’s projects demonstrate energy output comparable to more traditional hydropower projects such as dams and higher than wind or solar.

Tidal power also has its drawbacks. Today’s designs are only commercially viable where large volumes of water move extremely swiftly which also means increased wear and tear on components and makes installation and working on devices a challenge.

“There’s not a volume of product in the marketplace so we haven’t hit the point in the curve where we’re drastically reducing our costs” said Ferland.

Most hydrokinetic devices are also expensive to produce and have a shorter lifespan than traditional hydropower dams which are far more environmentally disruptive to build but with maintenance can often stay in place for more than 100 years.

Cobscook Bay is one of the most biologically diverse bodies of water on the eastern seaboard said Hopkins who for many years has taken a skiff out in the fall to watch marine mammals eat and play.

Cold water flooding in from the Bay of Fundy warm water from the gulfstream and fresh water from the St. Croix River all flow into the Cobscook creating temperatures suitable for “critters comfortable in the high end of the Arctic temperatures and others suited for the low end of the gulf temperatures” he said.

Minkes finback and humpback whales can be seen diving and broaching and on a really hot day you might even catch a tuna jumping said Hopkins. Leatherback and Loggerhead sea turtles both endangered have also visited the area.

Given that the idea of putting a series of spinning blades below the surface of the bay raised more than a few eyebrows when it was first suggested. So in 2012 alongside researchers from the University of Maine ORPC set out to study the behavior of fish birds and marine mammals in the area both before and after the installation of the Cobscook Bay test project.

Some tidal power projects including the Annapolis Royal in Nova Scotia have caused serious harm to fish but little was known about devices like the one ORPC planned to employ.

Using underwater cameras acoustic monitoring devices and observation researchers examined fish behavior in the area over several years including with the turbine in operation. Results were promising: After hundreds of hours of observation the group saw no deaths related to the turbine. The company has also been studying the behavior of marine and aquatic animals in nearby Western Passage before deploying a device there.

“As it turns out fish are really pretty good at sensing objects on the ocean floor or floating on the surface or objects with big teeth” said Hopkins. “They just flowed around it.”

Similar results were observed with the tidal generator ORPC installed in the Kvichak River near Igiugig Alaska which recently became the longest operating device of its kind in the Americas. That design which the company calls RivGen is similar to the one ORPC plans to sink in the Western Passage.

The Kvichak River the only connection between Lake Iliamna and Bristol Bay has the world’s largest run of sockeye salmon with millions returning each year to spawn. Igiugig residents rely on the river for drinking water tourism and subsistence fishing and were wary of anything that might disrupt that.

“It’s the purest water on earth” AlexAnna Salmon president of the Igiugig Village Council told Frontiers 180 in 2019. The council was the first tribal government to get a federal license for this type of hydro project.

Several years of monitoring the Igiugig device according to ORPC have not shown “a single injury or mortality to marine or aquatic life.”

Word of ORPC’s plans has yet to reach most residents in Eastport. Community meetings are scheduled for the coming months and there are still a number of steps before ORPC can install the device including obtaining permits from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

The device also will require state agency approval including from the Maine Department of Environmental Protection and the Bureau of Public Lands.

ORPC wants to test its device in Cobscook Bay this year and next before moving into full-scale deployment in the Western Passage scheduled for 2025 said Susy Kist the company’s director of communications in an email.

Hopkins doesn’t expect much local opposition given ORPC’s history and the Western Passage location where few fishermen set traps “but you never can tell.”

Both Hopkins and City Council President William “Billy” Boone said ORPC has worked with the community over the years.

“There’s been no shady dealings or backyard stunt pulls. They’ve been upfront with us and we have with them” said Boone.

View the current offers here.

I'm not a huge fan of the Marriott Bonvoy program. However when I was shopping for a new credit card to add to my insane collection of cards I realized that my supply of Bonvoy points was pretty depleted. Despite not loving the Marriott loyalty program I end up staying at a lot of Bonvoy properties and I can always find ways to use the points. For instance I used Bonvoy points to stay at the Sheraton Kauai Resort last year.

I already have the Hilton Honors Aspire Card from American Express and the Delta SkyMiles® Reserve American Express Card which carry hefty annual fees. So why would I want to open another high-annual-fee card?

I read my colleague Benji Stawki's review of the Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant® American Express® Card and it had me intrigued.

The card currently has a welcome offer of 100000 Bonvoy points and a free night award (worth up to 85000 points) after you use your new card to make $5000 in eligible purchases within the first three months of cardmembership.

Unfortunately I opened my account back in February so I missed out on this new and improved offer. Still I earned 75000 Marriott Bonvoy points.

While that's not a huge amount of points especially after Marriott has repeatedly devalued the program TPG still pegs the value at about $600 and I knew I could get that much value out of the welcome offer.

The Bonvoy Brilliant™ card also has a $450 annual fee (see rates & fees).

What really allowed me to justify the card however was the $300 in statement credits. I figure I'm really only paying about $150 for the card since I'll get $300 of the fee back as a credit from Amex. Those 75000 bonus points I earned are easily worth $150.

Benefits of the Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant card

While I don't consider Marriott Bonvoy points the most valuable hotel currency it still has its uses. Sure it's now costing more to stay at some of our favorite Marriott properties but I can still always find a way to use Bonvoy points.

Related: Why I'm not so nervous about Marriott's upcoming switch to dynamic award pricing

I mentioned some of the benefits of the card above but there are several others worth talking about. Unlike me you'll get 100000 Marriott Bonvoy points as a welcome offer and that $300 statement credit for staying at any Marriott property. You'll also get a free night certificate valid for up to 85000 points. That opens up some nice hotels.

The card includes a Priority Pass Select membership which gives you free entry to airport lounges worldwide. You also receive a $100 Global Entry or TSA PreCheck application fee credit once every five years.

You can earn quite a few Bonvoy points using the card too. You'll earn 6 points per dollar at eligible hotels (Marriott Bonvoy program hotels). You also get 3 points per dollar at restaurants in the U.S. and on flights booked directly with the airlines. You'll get 2 points per dollar for all other purchases.

You'll also receive a free night award worth up to 50000 points each year when you renew the card. I did a quick search and found I'd be able to stay a night at the brand new AC Hotel in downtown Bozeman or even the Wilson Hotel in Big Sky Montana (a fancy Residence Inn). Or you could stay at the Courtyard in Paris Gare de Lyon.

Note that Marriott's shift to dynamic pricing may make these a bit harder to use now. However the program does plan to add the ability to top off these certificates with up 15000 points from your Bonvoy account. This could open up even more luxurious (and expensive) properties.

You also get Marriott Gold Elite status just for holding the card which could give you a few extra benefits at your next Marriott stay.

Speaking of status if you're aiming a little higher you also get 15 elite-qualifying night credits per year. So if you want the extra benefits that come with Platinum status you'll need just 35 nights instead of 50 nights. Open a Marriott Bonvoy Business® American Express® Card and you'd only need 20 nights to hit Platinum.

Opening the Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant

Opening the card was easy. I applied for the card via TPG's application page (of course) which you can access via this link: Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant® American Express® Card.

It takes you to a dedicated page with the welcome offer and other details.

Getting the bonus points for the Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant

I was able to get the spend done on the card in just a few weeks and I've already earned more than 79000 Bonvoy points. That includes 211 bonus points for dining and of course those points from the welcome offer.

I've also already booked my first stay on the card that will earn me that $300 statement credit with two nights at the Westin Book Cadillac Detroit in May. The bill will come to just over $400 so I'll end up paying just about $100 for a two-night stay at one of the nicest hotels in Detroit. Score.

Bottom line

Even with many of the best Marriott Bonvoy properties now costing more points due to dynamic pricing I still find that Bonvoy points come in handy in my travels and I'm always looking to stock up. The welcome offer and the $300 statement credit for hotel stays made getting the Bonvoy Brilliant card a no-brainer for me.

It's an even better idea now that Marriott has increased the welcome offer.

I'm already enjoying holding the card. I won't make a decision on keeping or canceling until the annual fee comes due in February of 2023. That's plenty of time to see how the card is treating me. Knowing my track record though it's another one I could keep long-term. I think I'm now up to more than a dozen cards.

What can I say? I'm definitely a credit card junkie.

The reward is offered on every purchase and can be received via direct deposit or a statement credit.

While Bread may be limited by American Express's audience they plan on reaching more people than the traditional Amex users who tend to be high net worth consumers with a great credit score according to Select.

Bread Financial's executive vice president Val Greer told Select that the company's ""large amount of consumer data and excellent underwriting practices allow it to provide greater access for the new cash-back product.""

The benefits

Two percent cash back on every purchase is just the beginning when it comes to the Bread Cashback American Express Credit Card.

The benefits of this card include:

Two percent cashback on all purchases with no limits

My wife was targeted again after getting it two months ago (she applied again and we got the new card yesterday). Both times there was no hard pull. This offer has an expiration date of 7/31 so it appears there’s time but who knows when and if Amex will target or untarget individuals.

If you can make the (significant) spend this is the best Business Platinum offer in recent memory.

This morning Nick found a new American Express welcome offer for the Business Platinum card on his wife’s account under Amex Offers. Upon looking my wife discovered it on her account as well. It’s a significant improvement on the best publicly available offer and does not include AMEX’s once-in-a-lifetime language. If you’re targeted this could be a another good option for folks looking to pay their taxes via credit card.

The Offer

If you see this message it means you’re not targeted:

Quick Thoughts and Key Card Details

The Business Platinum is a terrific card that’s loaded with perks. The current best public offer is below:

This targeted offer is a huge improvement on the current publicly available even without adding the AU card. Keep in mind that both the Dell and airline credits reset on the calendar year. This means that in the first year of card membership you can get 3x Dell credits and 2x Airline Incidentals adding an additional ~$400 in value if you only pay the annual fee once. While the various perks and credits on Amex cards can feel a little “coupon booky” I find it pretty easy to get full advantage of these two and the wireless service credit as well.

This is obviously a terrific welcome offer if you can use the card and make the spend. Without even considering the additional perks and credits it will end up being 160K MR (~$2500 based on our RRV) for around .4 cents each after taking into account the annual fee. My wife was approved for the targeted Gold offer with no hard-pull which can be another YMMV benefit of these NLL targeted offers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lbnNqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9mb29kLWRyaW5rL2hlYWQtb24tZG93bi10by1taWFtaS10aGlzLW1heS10by1leHBlcmllbmNlLXRoZS1jYXJib25lLWJlYWNoLXN1cHBlci1jbHVi0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Head on Down to Miami This May to Experience the CARBONE BEACH Supper Club,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.mensjournal.com/food-drink/head-on-down-to-miami-this-may-to-experience-the-carbone-beach-supper-club on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lbnNqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9mb29kLWRyaW5rL2hlYWQtb24tZG93bi10by1taWFtaS10aGlzLW1heS10by1leHBlcmllbmNlLXRoZS1jYXJib25lLWJlYWNoLXN1cHBlci1jbHVi0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

(USA) – 15:37.34 FINA ‘A’ Standard: 16:29.57

The World American U.S. Open and Olympic Record Holder: Katie Ledecky

Anyone who has been paying attention to swimming in the last 10 years knows Katie Ledecky is often in a field of her own in the women’s distance events. The 25-year-old hasn’t lost in a 1500 final at a major competition since at least 2012. However Ledecky isn’t the reigning world champion in the event but that’s not because she was defeated in 2019. At the 2019 World Championships Ledecky came down with an illness and ended up pulling out of many of her events including the 1500.

To give you an idea of just how dominant Ledecky is in the 1500 she’s not only the fastest swimmer in history by 18.4 seconds she holds the 12 fastest performances in history. Here are the top 13 performances all-time in the women’s LCM 1500 free:

Ledecky has swum well since her move to Florida to train under Anthony Nesty and alongside men’s freestyle stars like Bobby Finke and Kieran Smith. Having already swum a 15:39.45 in 2022 Ledecky is far and away the favorite to win this event at U.S. Trials as well as the World Championships. However it will be interesting to see if Ledecky is able to better her 2022 best at this meet. If she were to go under 15:30 at this meet it would be her first time under the mark in a little over two years.

The Sandpipers of Nevada

It’s not often that a club team would get its own section in one of our previews but the Sandpipers of Nevada are on a whole other level with this group right now. Leading the way is 16-year-old Katie Grimes who notably qualified for the U.S. Olympic Team last summer in the 800 free. Grimes is the only swimmer other than Katie Ledecky who is entered under 16:00 at this meet. Grimes finished 3rd at the Olympic Trials last summer coincidentally behind fellow Sandpiper Erica Sullivan who of course would go on to win Silver in Tokyo. Grimes’ time of 15:52.12 makes her the # performer all-time in the 15-16 age group. She sits just 0.02 seconds behind Janet Evans’ #2 in the age group (15:52.10) meaning Grimes not only stands an excellent chance of qualifying for the Worlds team in this event she could very well move up in the age group rankings as well.

Before we continue with the other Sandpipers girls in the 1500 at this meet we should note that Olympic Silver medalist Erica Sullivan will not be competing at these Trials. Sullivan who currently competes collegiately for Texas but is also a Sandpiper is dealing with a shoulder injury though we have few details on the nature of the injury or the timeline for her return. Sullivan raced the women’s 10k at Open Water Nationals earlier in the month where she led the race for the first 3 laps but ultimately did not end up finishing the race presumably due to her shoulder injury. After clocking a 15:41 in the 1500 at the Olympics last summer a healthy Erica Sullivan would likely be our #2 pick in this event at these Trials.

Next up is another Sandpipers Olympian Bella Sims. Sims has a personal best of 16:21.22 which she swam in March of 2021. While her best LCM event is probably the 200 free Sims is also a serious threat in distance races having an 8:23.55 in the 800 as well as her 16:21 1500. Additionally Sims swam a 15:48.70 SCY 1650 free in December of 2021 just 4 months ago. Notably Sims is entered in 7 events at this meet and with the 1500 so late in the meet it’s a possibility she could end up scratching although that’s far from a guarantee. Sims is used to busy meet schedules. She swam 6 individual events and 5 relays in the span of 4 days at the Speedo Winter Junior Championships – West this past December.

Paige Kuwata a Louisville-bound 17-year-old out of Sandpipers is the #5 seed at this meet coming in with a 16:27.73. The LCM 1500 is Kuwata’s top event and her personal best came at last summer’s Olympic Trials earning her a 10th-place finish in prelims. The field at this meet isn’t quite as deep as the Olympic Trials last summer allowing Kuwata plenty of room to move up in the ranks. Additionally Kuwata swam personal bests in 8 SCY events this past fall including the 1650 so she has a bit of momentum coming into this meet.

The last Sandpiper entered in this event is 15-year-old Claire Weinstein who comes in as the #18 seed with her personal best of 16:45.42. While that’s not necessarily a head-turning time in a U.S. Trials meet such as this one Weinstein is primed for a huge race. She swam a massive personal best at the Speedo Winter Junior Championships – West meet in December taking 2nd with a 15:52.84. Weinstein will be something of a wildcard in this event since she’s going to be racing in the early heats. It would take an incredible race from Weinstein for her to swim a time which would put her in contention to qualify for the Worlds team however she’s leading among the most likely qualifiers for the Junior Pan Pacs team and Mel Zajac team.

The Best of the Rest

Sierra Schmidt a University of Michigan alum who now trains at Scottsdale Aquatic Club is the #3 seed coming in with a 16:06.85 a time which she swam at a Pro Swim Series last May.

With the field being considerably thinner at this meet than the Olympic Trials last summer it appears as if this is shaping up to be a three-woman race in terms of World Championships qualification. One of those women is Katie Ledecky so we can just pencil her in for one of the Worlds spots. So behind Ledecky it looks as though the race for 2nd is probably going to shake out between Katie Grimes and Sierra Schmidt. The gap between Schmidt and #4 seed Bella Sims is 15 seconds.

Another junior swimmer in the field is Sarasota Sharks’ 17-year-old Michaela Mattes who enters as the #6 seed. Mattes has a personal best of 16:29.86 which she swam in late February.

A pair of collegiate swimmers round out the top 8 seeds. Lola Mull coming off a great season at Northwestern is the #7 seed coming in with a 16:31.41. Elise Bauer a Florida swimmer comes in at #8 with a 16:32.55.

Blocks-long lines for pepper spray in Manhattan Chinatown. Children kept home from school by fearful parents. Elderly people who have stopped leaving their homes. A warning to Filipinos in the US issued by the Philippine embassy in DC.

Across the US Asian American communities have been gripped by anger and despair as hate crimes against them have increased sharply – rising by 339% last year compared with 2020 according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism. As early as March 2020 the FBI issued a report predicting a “surge” in hate crimes against Asian Americans due to the Covid-19 pandemic which happened to originate in an Asian country. Adding fuel to the fire: incendiary and racist language – used by irresponsible politicians and repeated across social media – and geopolitical tensions with China.

“All of those are conditions that have led at other times to terrible anti-Asian violence” says author and activist Helen Zia.

But what’s different this time says Zia is that more people recognize the problem. In the 1980s Zia helped bring about the first federal civil rights case involving an Asian American: Vincent Chin a Chinese American man was beaten to death by two white auto-workers who took him for Japanese and blamed Japan for the car industry’s struggles. They were merely fined $3000 each for the killing.

Today Asian Americans the fastest-growing racial or ethnic group in the US are finally in a position to do more than stock up on pepper spray and hope for the best. Meanwhile academic research on implicit and unconscious bias improvements in data collection and social movements like Black Lives Matter have contributed to greater understanding about racism and bias and the ways that can translate into hate speech and violence. From the local through federal level community advocates and other leaders have been organizing debating and building support aimed at combating the ongoing epidemic of anti-Asian hate.

After the Atlanta-area shooting deaths of eight people six of them Asian women by a white gunman in March 2021 President Joe Biden announced a set of actions to respond to anti-Asian violence and xenophobia and in May further established the White House Initiative on Asian Americans Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders “to advance equity justice and opportunity for AA and NHPI communities”. Among other actions the initiative will improve data collection methods that have left Asian people underrepresented in government statistics and by extension the resulting programs and policies.

Long-term many agree that the answer lies in education. In January Illinois became the first state to require that Asian American history be taught in public schools. New Jersey soon followed and at least nine other states are considering the same. “Members of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community have made countless contributions to our state and country yet they are made virtually invisible by our history books” said four NJ assembly sponsors of the bill in a joint statement. “This erasure … not only prevents students from gaining a full understanding of our nation’s history but also opens the door for racial biases that can turn into violence and hatred.”

Kani Ilangovan a parent and psychiatrist of Make Us Visible NJ which spearheaded the movement said she was haunted by events like the 2017 shooting death of Srinivas Kuchibhotla an engineer from India at a Kansas restaurant by a white man who called Kuchibhotla and the friend he was with “terrorists” and “Iranians” and asked whether they were in the country illegally.

In 2020 as anti-Asian violence swelled anew Ilangovan took comfort in learning about AAPI history and racial justice movements through a book club formed partly in response to the murder of George Floyd. “It gave me a deeper sense of identity and belonging and helped me learn a lot of history that I was not aware of” she said.

She realized that even in her children’s predominantly Asian school – let alone the predominantly white school she had attended growing up – Asian Americans were not reflected in the curriculum contributing to their image as “forever foreigners” – not part of the American story and therefore not deserving of the same treatment as other Americans. She reached out to members of her book club and formed Make Us Visible NJ. They were further galvanized when Stop AAPI Hate issued a 2021 report stating that one in three AAPI parents said their child had experienced a hate incident in the past school year. More than 1500 signatures 60 partner organizations and several rallies later they helped pass the historic legislation.

Another less widely embraced response to anti-Asian hate has been the 2021 passing of the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act. It builds on the 1990 Hate Crimes Statistics Act which required data collection “about crimes that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race religion sexual orientation or ethnicity” and prompted the FBI to begin publishing its annual report on hate crime statistics. The 1990 act “was a positive development but the statistics that came out showed that law enforcement agencies weren’t really reporting incidents of violence against Asians” said Stanley Mark a senior staff attorney with the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund. Even after 9/11 he said many of the resulting attacks against Sikh South Asian Middle Eastern and Muslim Americans were not classified as hate crimes. (As it was recorded anti-Muslim hate crimes increased 1600%.)

The new hate crimes act aims to fill some of those gaps by making it easier to report incidents and incentivizing local police forces to improve their data collection methods for example through better training around how to identify hate crimes. (It also includes provisions named after Heather Heyer the woman run over and killed by a neo-Nazi in Charlottesville Virginia in 2017.) “You’re not going to find anti-Asian bias if you’re not looking for it so this bill does help train police to look for it better” said Mark.

However critics say it does not address the root causes of hate and fear the statistics will merely result in over-policing of Asian and other ethnic minority communities. “The community is divided about the role of police” says Jo-Ann Yoo executive director of the Asian American Federation an umbrella organization for non-profits in NYC. In New York City for example people reluctant to interact with police can instead report incidents to the Commission on Human Rights which collects data about (and sometimes acts on) bias harassment and discrimination incidents in general – a wider array than hate crimes which are narrowly defined.

“Dedicate resources to local communities” wrote Stop AAPI Hate in a response to the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act. Existing grassroots efforts that have sprung up during the pandemic offer a glimpse at what locals feel is needed: new community groups focusing on everything from mutual aid to activism to organizing volunteers to patrol the streets to stoking pride in Asian American culture have proliferated.

But the depth of the need is daunting. In New York the most pressing issues Yoo has seen include food insecurity financial struggle and lack of healthcare access among the many Asian workers whose industries were disproportionately affected by the pandemic (eg nail salons restaurants and other service-based industries). Elderly people are afraid to leave their homes and isolated by language and technological barriers to accessing social service programs. Domestic violence has increased.

Yoo also says there is widespread fear and burnout among non-profit workers themselves who have spent the past two-plus years on the frontlines: feeding people organizing grief circles going door-to-door setting up Zoom for elderly people meeting with victims of violent attacks and struggling “to figure out what we are going to do”.

This country is going through this major crisis on a global level and it provides a breeding ground for racism for hatred Dr DJ Ida

Moreover they and many other Asian Americans continue their work while feeling unsafe themselves. “I get a lot of emails saying my boss is asking us to come back to work but I’m afraid to ride the subway” Yoo said. “I’m calling on corporations to come up with a plan to protect their staff because the fear is very real.”

Yoo sees an enormous need for mental health services – for victims of racially motivated violence bystanders who witness such crimes the communities traumatized by fear and perpetrators themselves. “Many of the assailants were homeless with severe mental illness. Where’s the help for them?” she says. (New York City’s unhoused population is at its highest level since the Great Depression and the city under the new Eric Adams administration has been forcibly removing unhoused people from the city’s subways and tearing down homeless encampments.)

“This country is going through this major crisis on a global level and it provides a breeding ground for racism for hatred and oppression of all sorts” says Dr DJ Ida executive director of the National Asian American Pacific Islander Mental Health Association. “When people are stressed the ugliness rears its head.”

What makes hate crimes insidious for victims she explains is that while a random mugging or attack can be deeply traumatizing there remains “a sense of ‘I was in the wrong place at the wrong time’”. With hate crimes by contrast there is no escaping the situation “because it’s escaping who we are. The psychological implications of that can be very profound.”

Ida said that for those working in mental health the Biden administration’s proposed 2023 budget has been a source of hope. It allocates an unprecedented billions upon billions to expand access to mental health services – for example $1bn to double the number of school counselors and other school health professionals over the next 10 years.

Ultimately many agree that whatever the federal policy and big-picture solutions combating hate boils down to individuals taking action. “Legislation helps but you can’t legislate away hate. You have to deal with it on a local day-to-day level” said Stanley Mark the AALDEF lawyer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzL21hZ2F6aW5lLzIwMjIvMDQvMjQvY29uZnVjaXVzLWluc3RpdHV0ZXMtY2hpbmEtbmV3LW1leGljby0wMDAyNzI4N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Far Does China's Influence at U.S. Universities Go?

We’d like to thank our Arlington neighbors and the County Board for their partnership and feedback through the years-long process of designing PenPlace a project we believe will benefit the entire region. With the County Board’s approval we look forward to continuing our work with the community as we take the next steps on this journey to build an integrated innovative and sustainable second headquarters in Arlington Virginia.

We announced in late 2018 that Arlington Virginia would be home to Amazon’s second headquarters (HQ2) and that we would bring more than 25000 jobs to the region. Since then we’ve made some significant progress in our commitment to be a trusted business and community partner. We’ve continued to engage with local organizations and now work with over 100 nonprofits civic groups and small businesses providing in-kind support and charitable donations.

Our hard-working recruiting teams have crossed an important hiring milestone with more than 5000 employees now assigned to our second headquarters. Our construction partners have put in more than 2 million hours of work and recently celebrated finishing the top floor—the “topping out”—of Met Park the first phase of HQ2. And finally our architecture design sustainability and transportation teams have engaged with the local community and partnered with Arlington County to continue improving the design of PenPlace the next phase of our development.

As we prepare to take the next step in our more than $2.5 billion HQ2 investment we want to provide a snapshot of what the project will bring to the Arlington community and the wider region. Here are some highlights:

More sustainable by design

When we announced the development of HQ2 we challenged ourselves to think big and design Amazon’s buildings in a way that helps lead the industry toward net-zero carbon. In pursuit of this goal we have electrified the operations of HQ2 eliminating the use of fossil fuels for buildings systems and our food service. We’ve committed to powering 100% of HQ2’s operations with renewable energy through a combination of off-site and on-site solar projects aligning with The Climate Pledge Amazon’s commitment to be net-zero carbon across its operations by 2040.

PenPlace will provide more than 100000 square feet of retail space for dining shopping and a childcare facility. Multimodal pathways will connect throughout the site to prioritize access by foot and bike.

To do this we’ve contracted 82 megawatts (MW) of energy from a new 120 MW solar farm in Pittsylvania County Virginia which is expected to generate 172500 megawatt hours (MWh) of renewable energy annually once operational later this year. The renewable energy generated at this site will be used in part for the operation of HQ2 and other Amazon-owned buildings across Virginia including Whole Foods Market stores and Amazon fulfillment centers. The remaining portion of energy generated by the solar farm has been contracted by Arlington County and will provide clean energy for use in the region. At PenPlace we will also have rooftop solar panels installed totaling 1 MW of clean energy capacity to further support our sustainability efforts.

Our plans to focus on sustainability at PenPlace include:



Committing to achieve LEED Platinum certification the highest sustainability certification for a development issued by the U.S. Green Building Council.

Integrating strategic climate-responsive design for our office buildings including high-performance glazing and built-in solar shading that will reduce the need for building heating and cooling targeting a savings of 30% over the American Society of Heating Refrigerating Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) baseline.

Providing more than 125 electric vehicle charging stations with the ability to double capacity as needed.

Leveraging low-flow fixtures and reclaimed water usage to reduce water consumption by 50% beyond national standards.

Reducing the amount of embodied carbon in the concrete structure compared to typical construction practices by at least 10% along with a commitment to offset 100% of the remaining embodied carbon from building materials.

Using bird-safe glass where appropriate on all seven buildings at PenPlace to ensure that the development is safer for the region’s bird population.

Connecting the neighborhood

We’ve designed PenPlace to be part of the local neighborhood because we want both employees and local residents to enjoy the space equally. This means considering how people will travel to get to PenPlace and how they will utilize the space each day. Our plans prioritize access by foot bike and public transportation with a 15-foot-wide multimodal path that will be part of the Green Ribbon a network of pedestrian and shared-use pathways throughout the neighborhood. When complete PenPlace will provide more than 900 interior and exterior bike storage stalls to encourage bike commuting over the use of single-occupancy vehicles. All vehicle movements on-site will occur underground including loading docks which allows for contiguous outdoor public space with gathering areas public plazas and ample green space for the community to enjoy.

An open-air amphitheater will provide space for programming and events including concerts farmers markets and evening movie screenings.

Providing parks and public space

After engaging with the local community we heard feedback from our neighbors and shifted our designs to integrate more planting areas and maximize publicly accessible green space at PenPlace. The project will create 2.75 acres of public park space available for community use including immersive forest rooms shaded seating groves water features and many native and pollinator gardens. We will plant more than 100 native plant species and over 500 new trees throughout the site—all inspired by the natural ecosystems of the surrounding region. An open-air amphitheater will provide space for programming and events including concerts farmers markets and evening movie screenings. We will also build a dog run for Arlington’s four-legged residents.

In addition to the central green PenPlace will include immersive forest rooms shaded seating groves water features a dog run and many native and pollinator gardens all for the community to enjoy.

Adding vibrancy to the neighborhood

One of the main opportunities of designing a welcoming inviting and well-connected development will be the ability to support vibrant local small businesses. PenPlace will provide more than 100000 square feet of space for dining shopping a childcare facility and other opportunities across the main buildings and three retail pavilions. We’re also dedicating over 26500 square feet to establish a new home for Arlington County Community High School. This public school will provide an opportunity for approximately 300 students to pursue their academic goals while preparing for the future.

Building more than office space

The Helix a spiral-shaped building in the northeast corner of PenPlace will become a landmark for Arlington and the National Landing area. This distinctive building will take our biophilic-led design principles to new heights integrating nature and working to inspire innovation and invention. The interior of the Helix will provide formal and casual meeting spaces in an environment filled with more than 25000 square feet of planting areas and living walls. The exterior of the structure will feature two paths for employees to engage with colleagues in meetings or to take in views of Arlington the Potomac River and Washington D.C. The Helix will also be home to an artist-in-residence program and a meeting center and it will be open to the public and community to enjoy two days per month. We can’t wait for everyone to see this unique and thoughtfully designed space come to life.

Engaging with the local community

We know that success and scale bring broad responsibility and we strive to be good neighbors in the communities in which we operate. When we chose National Landing as the site of HQ2 we made a commitment to be a trusted business and community partner in the region and our work to become a part of the fabric of this community reflects that commitment daily.

Since we announced Arlington as the site of HQ2 in 2018 we have committed more than $35 million in total investments to local nonprofits community groups public schools and businesses. This includes both monetary and in-kind donations—like school supplies to public schools across Northern Virginia and food donations to local food banks and pantries for families in need. We also know that housing affordability is front of mind for many in the community. Through the Housing Equity Fund we’ve contributed more than $800 million to support affordable housing in the Arlington and metro-Washington D.C. areas with more to come. Since the launch of the Amazon Housing Equity Fund 15 months ago our efforts are helping to create and preserve more than 4400 affordable homes. Based on data provided by Arlington County the Fund has helped to increase the affordable housing stock in Arlington by 22%.

We will continue to engage with the Arlington community to understand how we can best support the issues that matter to local residents. Our goal is to build a second headquarters that integrates into the surrounding neighborhood and benefits the entire region. We appreciate Arlington County and the community’s partnership in this process and we are excited to continue the conversation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS9ldmlsLXdlc3QtcHJldmlldy1wYXgtZWFzdC0yMDIwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Evil West Preview: Darkwatch Meets God Of War With A Splash Of Doom Eternal,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS9ldmlsLXdlc3QtcHJldmlldy1wYXgtZWFzdC0yMDIwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtjdXIub3JnL25ld3MvMjAyMi0wNC0yMy9sYW5kb3duZXJzLWZlYXItc2NhcnJlZC1sYW5kc2NhcGUtZnJvbS1wcm9qZWN0LXRvLWJyaW5nLWdyZWVuLWVuZXJneS1hY3Jvc3MtdGhlLW1pZHdlc3TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Landowners fear a 'scar' on landscape from project to bring green energy across the Midwest,"Loren Sprouse drove through his hometown of Braymer Missouri and noted the height of each structure he passed. The water tower loomed 100 feet high. The grain elevator was a little taller.

All were shorter than the proposed 130- to 160-foot electrical transmission towers that would cut through his property as part of the 800-mile Grain Belt Express transmission line.

The project which has been in the works for over 10 years would sit on only 18 acres of Sprouse’s farm. But he would be able to see it for miles.

“No one who owns land can’t feel a special place for that land … That’s why you want to maintain it” Sprouse said. “This line is not going to do that. It’s going to create a big obvious scar completely across the state. And it’ll be the single biggest ugliest thing in northern Missouri and with it set a precedent for more to be built just like it.”

Scar or not the line promises to connect three of the country’s regional electrical grids — Southwest Power Pool (SPP) Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) and PJM Interconnection — and would bring wind energy harnessed in southwest Kansas to other parts of the country.

Courtesy of Invenergy Landowners in the path of the Grain Belt Express would retain ownership and access to use the land beneath the transmission line.

Citing ominous warnings about the dangers of climate change national and local plans call for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. But to achieve those goals some renewable energy will have to be moved from where it’s easily harnessed to areas that need it. In the case of the Grain Belt Express that means moving wind energy from the gusty plains of Kansas to more densely populated areas.

Landowners like Sprouse say they aren’t opposed to clean energy projects. But they’re dead set against a private company using eminent domain to complete its project.

Interstate Transmission

Grain Belt Express which would cost an estimated $2 billion would stretch from just outside Dodge City Kansas across northern Missouri south central Illinois and into Indiana. The high voltage direct current (HVDC) line would transport 4000 megawatts of electricity both west to east and east to west in emergencies.

That’s the power equivalent of 15 million barrels of oil or enough to power 1.6 million homes annually. For the 39 municipalities in Missouri signed up to buy power off the line it’s an estimated $12.8 million in annual savings.

Patrick Whitty a senior vice president at Grain Belt Express developer Invenergy said the direct current (DC) transmission line is the most efficient way to transport power from where it’s generated to where it’s needed and with the smallest footprint.

DC as compared to alternating current (AC) allows a greater transmission of power that can go both directions on one line. There’s also a reduced loss of power from friction on a DC line.

“One of the major reliability benefits for Grain Belt will be the ability to also move power under emergency conditions from east to west” Whitty said. “Had Grain Belt been in place during (the winter storm power outages of February 2021) we know that some of those outage events could have been minimized or even avoided altogether.”

In both Kansas and Missouri Grain Belt has been able to prove its necessity to regulatory agencies and gain public utility status and thus the power to access private property via eminent domain.

The company said it would only use the power of condemnation as a last resort preferring instead to negotiate with landowners and establish a fair price for easements.

So far the company has secured voluntary agreements with 1200 of the 1700 parcels it will cross. To date Grain Belt has filed about 10 condemnation notices.

When Invenergy bought the project from Clean Line in 2018 Whitty said it sent out letters to landowners in Kansas and Missouri along the proposed route and informed them of the new ownership and compensation plan.

The company would pay landowners 110% of the fair market value of their land plus an additional $18000 for each tower placed on their property. Owners of “century farms” that have remained in the same family for more than 100 years would be paid an additional premium.

Courtesy of Invenergy The proposed route of the Grain Belt Express transmission line runs from western Kansas to Indiana.

“There is no transmission line that is without impacts but the best we can do is to make sure that landowners are fairly compensated” Whitty said. “In our case we are going well above and beyond what would be typical for a transmission project.”

He said the company is aware of the rising price of property as well as matters specific to one person’s property that could make it more valuable than the county averages.

“We value the dialogue with landowners when it comes to both matters of compensation as well as facility design” Whitty said. “Anytime a landowner can document (comparables) of higher land values we will consider that and very often we will revise land values upwards.”

Landowners can choose to have an upfront payment for their easement and tower or choose to have the payments spread out over the lifetime of the project. According to Whitty Invenergy has already promised $77 million in compensation agreements and has paid out $10 million of that.

Sprouse has a pretty good idea of where the line will go through his property because he knows it will follow the already cleared path of the three pipelines he hosts. Other landowners like Marilyn O’Bannon in Monroe County have less of an idea and feel shut out from the development process.

Whitty said this is because the line has to be looked at as a whole. Until all of the easements are agreed on the placement of the line through a particular parcel has to be somewhat fluid.

“Any one structure placement may have effects on adjacent structure placement so there’s a whole lot of design and engineering that has to go into that on the front end” Whitty said. “We’re still in that design and engineering phase.”

Tower placement also is dependent on conversations with the landowner and their knowledge of the land.

National Renewable Energy Laboratory The Great Plains offer the most reliable source for renewable wind energy in the United States.

“We’re getting input on areas within a landowner parcel or property that they either want to make sure we avoid or sometimes there are areas where they would prefer to see a structure … We want to understand as thoroughly as possible how we can best go about through the design and engineering phase minimizing impacts to the land” Whitty said.

Against the wind

Eight years ago O’Bannon didn’t know anything about the Grain Belt Express. Now it’s her life.

“I can’t describe what it’s like to wake up every morning and have this on your mind and go to bed with that being the last thing on your mind for eight years” O’Bannon said.

After learning from a friend that the line would cross through about five miles of her property she started digging to learn more about the project.

She found neighbors and other landowners along the route who also felt they’d been left in the dark and those who knew about the project weren’t asking enough questions. Is it safe? How will the county get money from it? Where will it go?

Through her work which has led her to an elected seat on the county commission O’Bannon has consistently felt out of the loop and disrespected by the company.

Cody Boston / Flatland Marilyn O’Bannon entered the political sphere to fight the Grain Belt Express. Now she’s a commissioner in Monroe County Missouri.

Other landowners like Wayne Wilcox of Randolph County have been involved in the project since before the route was proposed.

“The thing that I first looked at with them was ‘Were they honest?’” Wilcox said. “Would they accept comments from us? Would they work at making changes? And they did.”

He’s been attending meetings since the beginning and has had an easy time negotiating with the Grain Belt developer on his easement compensation and the placement of the line on his property.

Sprouse is waiting to hear back on his submitted counter offer and while more compensation would be great what he really wants is to not see the line.

He hopes it could be buried like the 350-mile SOO Green HDVC Link in Iowa that is following existing railroad easements. As an alternative he would proffer the Grain Belt Express follow highway right of ways in Missouri.

But Whitty said those alternatives weren’t viable.

Invenergy has experience with underground technology but existing buried lines aren’t as long nor do they carry as much power as Grain Belt would.

“That introduces a level of engineering and design considerations that simply make that infeasible” Whitty said. “With 95% of transmissions developed overhead that’s really just the most affordable way to build these projects.”

Cody Boston / Flatland Wayne Wilcox is a landowner and farmer in Randolph County who is supportive of the Grain Belt Express crossing his property.

Following the highway closest to the current route U.S. 36 would face the constraint of nearby state conservation sites as noted in Clean Line’s original route selection study .

So the route was proposed by the original developer of the Grain Belt Express. It mostly follows existing easements for pipelines or other power lines since the physical path is mostly cleared.

That is where it will go on Sprouse’s property.

He’s not against easements. He already has three pipelines and several rural water lines. But he’s against easements that he feels don’t benefit Missourians.

Sprouse remembers his father negotiating a piece of their family property for implementation of the AT&T transcontinental cable. Today his property still has an abandoned hut from the project a piece of the historical line which connected telephones across the country.

Landowners were compliant and excited for that line.

“This was built for the reason that eminent domain should exist. This was for government security” Sprouse said gesturing towards the hut. “They should have the right to eminent domain at the federal level because they were providing a service they were doing something the government needed.

“For someone who’s a private individual who’s just doing it to reap the benefits of that and in using the cheapest cost plan to do it that doesn’t justify the power of eminent domain” he said.

For the past several years opponents of the project have introduced bills in the Missouri General Assembly designed to kill the project.

If passed House Bill 2005 would retroactively strip the Grain Belt Express of its public utility status. It would increase easement payments to 150% of fair market value and require the line to deliver 50% of its transmission capability in Missouri.

Earlier this month it was reported “do pass” in the Missouri House. Opponents to the line are hopeful this year’s bill will pass.

Whitty admitted that a lot of the resentment towards the line goes back to the very beginnings of the project before Invenergy was in the picture.

“If I understand correctly there was no plan to deliver power into Missouri in the early iterations of this project and I think a lot of the perspectives may still be based around that” he said.

Since then Invenergy has come to agreements with the 39 municipalities to receive power off of the line and is looking to increase the number of Missourians who can benefit from the line.

“We are actively evaluating the opportunity not only to make sure we’re following through on delivering on the agreement with the 39 communities across Missouri … but also looking at how we can increase significantly the energy of delivery to Missouri” Whitty said.

Murky future

The 39 municipalities in Missouri were essential to Grain Belt’s public utility status.

Missouri Public Utility Alliance (MPUA) is constantly conducting studies on the power pools it buys and sells wholesale electricity for in the state.

John Twitty president of MPUA said as Grain Belt was being developed studies found the pool serving these 39 Missouri municipalities would need an additional source of power in order to meet future demands.

“The reason that we’re interested in (Grain Belt) is that we’re bringing low cost wind energy to our customers and obviously if you’re in a utility business you want to try to get really reliable electricity and you want to get it as inexpensively as possible” Twitty said.

Because Grain Belt Express is a merchant transmission line those signed to receive power off of the line will in effect help pay for the construction of the project.

The cost will be spread out over the 20-year contract the Missouri Joint Municipal Electric Utility Commission (a business unit of MPUA) has with Invenergy. Twitty said the project makes sense to join because once the upfront costs are gone the energy is cheap.

“Once you’ve spent that money there’s no fuel cost the wind is free” Twitty said. “Even though there are new upfront costs those can be defrayed over lots of energy that flows across the system.”

The 500 megawatts of power from the line are contractually obligated to these power pools meaning even if there’s higher demand in a bigger city these Missouri municipalities will keep their lights on.

Down the road Twitty foresees more Missouri cities and entities receiving the same low-cost power.

Sprouse and O’Bannon fear a future where their land is home to many transmission lines of this type. They fear the Grain Belt Express will set a precedent for crossing the Midwest via eminent domain.

When they joined the family business of farming and ranching neither of them thought a big infrastructure project would be part of their legacy.

“I don’t think that’s the legacy that I would want to see and I guess that’s the question” Sprouse said. “Is that the legacy Invenergy wants to see? Or do they just want to make a lot of money and go on?”

If the line goes in O’Bannon said her parents plan to move.

Her grandfather and father were born in the house that could soon have Grain Belt towers in the backyard. She has neighbors who she knows will move too. It’s more than just a 150-foot-wide easement that will be affected.

“It is not that we are against progress or renewables we’re against the way this business has conducted itself and the plan that they have to go through the middle of our farms” O’Bannon said. “It’s just unbelievable how that feels when you know in the end they’ve got the eminent domain as their card to play.”

Cody Boston / Flatland Billy Davies believes projects like the Grain Belt Express are crucial in mitigating the effects of climate change.

There is no perfect project.

Billy Davies conservation program coordinator with the Missouri Chapter of the Sierra Club said there always needs to be an evaluation of the people involved and the people benefiting from sustainability efforts.

”We need to be able to evaluate the good things and the bad things of every project including Grain Belt Express” Davies said. “If there are folks who are feeling left out and feeling like these solutions are not for them how are we working to support all in our community of Missouri?”

To Davies the property owners who support the Grain Belt Express by allowing the transmission line on their land are “kind of heroes.” Rather than think narrowly about the consequences of the towers on their land Davies urges opponents to think of the consequences for a nation that doesn’t make big moves toward a sustainable future.

That’s the approach Wilcox takes.

He’ll be able to see the tower from his house and will pass under it each day as he drives to town. Rather than look at the line as an eyesore Wilcox said he thinks of the benefits it will have on his community.

No municipalities in Randolph County are currently contracted to receive power off of the line but the tax revenue from a big infrastructure project will positively impact the public schools and libraries.

Wilcox reckons there’s no sense in avoiding the opportunities this line brings to Missouri. Ultimately he thinks the project will do more good than harm.

“I believe the project will go through and I believe that anybody that hasn’t negotiated with them needs to step up to the plate” Wilcox said. “I think they will find people that are reasonable to talk to and can work things out.”

They argued county officials offered a misleading report and failed to properly look at the impacts of the bottling plant on the environment.

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor

The groups filed two lawsuits one against the city and one against the county.

A long-dormant water bottling facility owned by Crystal Geyser Water Company outside of Mt. Shasta CA. In May the company announced it would no longer pursue plans to operate the facility. Liam Moriarty

Crystal Geyser abandoned plans to open the plant last year facing pressure from the public and the group’s lawsuits.

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor

That means these judgments won’t have a real-world effect but will still set a precedent for local environmental reviews done in the future.

The appellate court ruling sends this case back down to the lower courts and requires the courts to specify what the city and county must change on the reports to comply with the law.

The reports also need to recirculate the through the public; though their approval won’t impact the bottling plant at this point.

After abandoning plans to build the plant Crystal Geyser sold the land and facility to a California-based developer. The new deed contains a stipulation forbidding the use of the land for the bottling of water.

In a statement both plaintiffs were happy to see victory after this drawn-out fight.

“The wins in these two cases demonstrate that when we come together we can protect our water our environment and the web of life we all depend on” the groups say.

Attorneys for the U.S. Department of Defense notified the state and federal courts of its decision. The move comes more than a month after Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the military would permanently shut down the tanks and drain all of their fuel.

The Hawaii Department of Health which issued the order said the decision regarding the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility was a “step forward.”

“While today’s announcement is good news the work continues” the department said in a statement. It said it would “continue to act expeditiously and proactively to oversee the safe defueling and decommissioning of Red Hill and restoration of the aquifer.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbnRlcmV5aGVyYWxkLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA0LzIzL2hhcmJvci1zZWFsLXB1cHBpbmctc2Vhc29uLWluLXBhY2lmaWMtZ3JvdmUtZGlzdHVyYmVkLWJ5LXJvYWQtd29yay_SAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb250ZXJleWhlcmFsZC5jb20vMjAyMi8wNC8yMy9oYXJib3Itc2VhbC1wdXBwaW5nLXNlYXNvbi1pbi1wYWNpZmljLWdyb3ZlLWRpc3R1cmJlZC1ieS1yb2FkLXdvcmsvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Harbor seal pupping season in Pacific Grove disturbed by road work,"PACIFIC GROVE — Road construction along Ocean Boulevard in Pacific Grove was temporarily halted recently after disturbing nursing harbor seals which are protected under federal law.

“We had more failed deliveries and miscarriages in March than we’ve ever had” says Thom Akeman a long-time volunteer harbor seal monitor with Bay Net the shoreline docent group for the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary Network.

These doe-eyed marine mammals give birth between February and June and are particularly sensitive to human disturbance during this time says Akeman. Birthing mothers haul out on beaches spending 10-12 hours per day onshore to nurse pups and rest.

Pacific Grove has several beaches where harbor seals return year after year particularly along Ocean View Boulevard between Berwick Park and Hopkins Marine Station.

Loud noises and human encounters stress the seals and can drive them back into the water and even cause abandonment of seal pups. According to the Marine Mammal Center which rehabilitates and releases harbor seals and other marine mammals many of the seal pups they treat were abandoned by their mothers after being disturbed by humans.

One day in early April Akeman counted a total of 42 seals on a beach that hosted 125 seals on the same day last year. And he says that births have also been affected.

Construction began Feb. 14 and stretched between 2nd and 11th streets along Ocean View Boulevard – the same stretch that adjoins critical harbor seal pupping habitat. Crews from California American Water were replacing the aging water mainline beneath the road with the city planning to follow with paving and road improvements before the start of the busy tourist season. A notice that the company sent to customers in February stated that work was expected to continue until mid-April.

“We anticipated being further away from the harbor seal colony before the commencement of pupping season” says Daniel Gho Pacific Grove’s Director of Public Works.

As road work stretched into March harbor seal monitors became alarmed as they observed the impacts of the construction noise on the seals. At the March 2 City Council meeting several community members made impassioned pleas on behalf of the harbor seals asking for work to be halted until after the pupping season.

Nursing seals are protected under local city ordinance which considers pupping season to continue from February through May. All marine mammals are also protected under the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act which makes disturbing the animals a federal offense.

When Councilman Chaps Poduri raised the question of whether the road work would potentially violate these regulations at the March 2 meeting Gho responded “I’m not familiar with the Marine Mammal Act and any violations that would be occurring with this project … I don’t see how maintenance of a roadway and sewer systems would be violating a marine mammal act. There’s nothing in our policy or our codes that specifies that we’re not allowed to perform this work.”

Following deliberation the City Council voted 6-1 to move ahead with the planned work with some adjustments to try and minimize seal disturbance citing scheduling limitations for funding and the looming summer tourist season. Councilman Luke Colletti was the sole dissenting vote.

Thom and Kim Akeman took their concerns to Karen Grimmer Resource Protection Coordinator with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration which is responsible for enforcing the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Grimmer contacted Gho to remind him of the city’s responsibilities under the federal law.

“I said this shouldn’t be happening now and I explained the whole Marine Mammal Protection Act to him and that there should have been some communication with NOAA Fisheries. And that for future projects we really needed to have more communication” says Grimmer.

Gho agreed to temporarily halt the road work projects from April 11 until the end of pupping season.

“I thought the actions that the city took were appropriate” says Grimmer. “I just wish they had taken those actions a little sooner.”

According to Akeman the first successful birth of the season at the Fifth Street rookery happened a few days later.

The Marine Mammal Center hasn’t yet seen any abnormalities in harbor seal rescues in the Pacific Grove area which typically peaks in May. However the Center has documented a substantial increase in human disturbances to seal and sea lion pups in Santa Cruz and Monterey County in recent years.

To avoid disturbing the seals in the future Grimmer emphasizes clear and early communication. “We understand there’s a need for maintenance to occur… the city needs to do that upkeep and we just want to be able to work with them and figure out a schedule that works for everybody. Including the seals.”"

If your digital devices are pinging you nonstop with calendar reminders and your apps are rife with unread notifications it’s important to know that you can take control of your daily schedule without adding to your screen time. The best daily planner is a refreshingly analog way to organize your life break down big projects and keep your focus on what matters most to your personal and professional aspirations. With the right planner keeping track of your time and both short-term and long-term goals will become second nature. Here’s how to pick the best daily planner for your lifestyle.

What to consider as you select the best daily planner

So much of our time each day is already spoken for before we can decide what to do with it. Work meetings health appointments and family duties can easily fill schedules and make them feel overwhelming. Calendars and to-do lists can help but serve different purposes: calendars show you precisely when you’re doing something and to-do lists tell you what you want or need to accomplish without allocating an exact time to achieve your goals.

If you’re using these two productivity tools separately it’s easy for other people’s terms to dictate your schedule. After all it’s much harder to say no to inbound requests if you haven’t already blocked out time for tasks that help you reach your personal goals. The best daily planners provide a solution that combines all the facets of a dynamic life to put you in the driver’s seat as much as possible.

Daily schedule makers come in a variety of types from high-performance planners perfect for people who thrive on leveraging popular productivity methods to academic planners students and teachers can use to organize assignments and meet study goals. As you learn more about the top planners on the market the most important thing to consider is that you are the ultimate expert in what styles and methods you’ll actually want to use. Instead of being just one more obligation deciding how to spend your time ahead of time should help you feel motivated and confident.

If you’re a procrastinator most daily planners can seem intimidating for the simple reason that they are issued on an annual basis. You might still be tackling your New Year’s resolutions to create a half-marathon workout strategy in April but if you buy a January – December planner a quarter of the year has already elapsed. On the other hand eager achievers with goals to map in the fourth quarter of the year may have a harder time finding the planner they want when their favorite brand is just about to release a new edition.

There are two main kinds of planners tailor-made for this dilemma. An undated daily planner is the most flexible and provides templates you can fill in with the day of the week day and year. An 18-month planner starts in July of a given year which is especially useful for students and educators using their summer to envision the upcoming school year and beyond.

Best minimalist planner: Moleskine Classic 18-Month Daily Planner

The Moleskine Classic 18-Month Daily Planner is made from high-quality paper and comes in a range of colors. It begins in July and goes through December of the following year so you can make some long-term plans. The binding lies flat so you can reference a full day broken down between the left- and right-hand pages. Plus those who appreciate structure will like the ruled lines for recording tasks events and pertinent details.

Academic planners are designed for education

While 18-month planners that start in July of a given year can be useful for anyone in the education field academic daily planners offer additional customized features for teachers and students. At a minimum academic planners begin in July of one year and go through June of the following year thus covering the entire academic calendar.

If you’re a teacher maintaining both an academic planner and a personal planner can help you maintain a better work/life balance. A daily hourly planner may offer space to detail activities based on a typical teaching schedule—for example covering a period starting at 7 a.m. and ending at 7:45 p.m. on weeknights with limited hours on the weekend. Other features teachers may benefit from is space for lesson plans and recording student birthdays.

Students who are night owls or take evening classes should make sure the academic planner they like covers the full spectrum of their class schedule and study time. Both students and teachers may enjoy academic planners with stickers for decoration graph paper for computations and blank paper for jotting down notes.

The AT-A-GLANCE Daily Appointment Book and Planner is a no-frills academic planner with hours broken down into 15-minute increments. This spiral-bound daily planner comes with a faux leather cover.

Don’t forget to consider size and materials

When you think about the role a planner will play in your life it’s helpful to take into account where you’ll be using it. Will you be referring to your schedule and goals predominantly at an office or is it essential you have your planner at your fingertips throughout the day? Full-size planners can be about the size of a sheet of letter-sized paper giving you plenty of room to fill them in by hand without having to print microscopic letters. However for people who use their planner predominantly to stay on top of appointments a pocket-sized or mini daily planner may be more efficient to pack when you’re on the go.

If you love highlighting special events or adding accents to your planner with colored markers look for high-quality paper that prevents ink from seeping through to the other side of the page. Consider an elastic closure to prevent your planner from opening inside a backpack or handbag to keep loose papers like sticky notes or receipts from slipping out. Some brands of planners have optional covers that offer your content extra protection from spills tears and creases.

Bindings for daily planners range from simple staples to glue wire spirals and ringed metal clasps. While binder-style clasps add weight and bulk to a planner they allow you to rearrange pages to suit your needs and are often compatible with customized inserts like templates designed for project management or specific productivity methods.

Best daily planner notebook: LUX Productivity PRO A5 Planner

The LUX Productivity PRO A5 Planner features an attractive faux leather binder that comes with a six-month set of templated pages. Undated daily planning pages weekly reflection pages and more are included. Plus you can purchase additional inserts designed for specific tasks like storyboarding or using the Pomodoro Technique.

Daily planners for productivity balance inspiration and accountability

If you’re an avid reader of the latest scientific research on productivity methods practicing gratitude and the neuroplasticity of the human brain you’ll love productivity planners. Any planner can optimize your ability to get things done but productivity planners include extra prompts and systems for you to follow. Designated space to identify a key focus for each day and to write down what you’re grateful for are just some of the features you can find with this type of planner.

To get the most out of these tools it can be helpful to think of them as a life planner that complements the larger habits and practices you are cultivating to meet your goals. If you journal to start your day—something we recommend as part of a DIY morning routine—a productivity planner can double as a mini-journal with room for affirmations and quotes.

Before you purchase this type of daily agenda setter review which special features it contains and assess whether or not it will feel uplifting to use them or like extra homework that distracts you from your most important goals. Creative and abstract thinkers may find they get more out of a bullet journal system that’s infinitely customizable.

Best daily planner for productivity: Panda Daily Planner

The Panda Daily Planner incorporates gratitude affirmations and introspection into the mindset of maximizing productivity. Unique page layouts feature prompts to review progress and build habits over a three-month period.

Smart planners work with your favorite digital devices

Non-digital paper planners offer the tactile sensation of setting pen to paper away from the tyranny of screens. However if your daily planner is an outlier in a home full of the latest tech you might find yourself using some awkward workarounds to fit an analog device into your digital lifestyle.

Smart daily planners are a fun compromise worth considering. You can still have the pleasure of writing on the pages of these unique smart notebooks but your efforts can be uploaded to the cloud and integrated with other apps you use on a regular basis like Google Drive or Evernote. You can also erase and reuse the pages to save paper and space in your desk drawers.

Best smart daily planner: Rocketbook Panda Planner

The Rocketbook Panda Planner is a smart notebook collaboration between Rocketbook and Panda planners. This colorful set includes an erasable pen and a spiral-bound notebook. Scan and digitize your daily agenda and goals with the Rocketbook app for use with Dropbox Slack Evernote and more.

FAQs

Q: How do I choose a planner? To choose a planner that’s right for you you’ll want a good understanding of your existing work habits and time management skills. Other factors to consider are whether you want a planner for work school or to maximize productivity in every area in your life. Size materials and customization are also important to think about.

Q: What size planner is best? When determining what size planner works best for your lifestyle consider both the dimensions of the planner and how each page is divided. A large planner full of blocks for reflection or affirmations might feel cramped if your top priority is ample room to detail what’s happening in each hour of the day. A pocket-sized planner could be just right for remembering all of your appointments.

Q: Do planners really help? Yes planners really can help with organization and productivity. The best daily planners are invaluable tools for achieving long-term and short-term goals in manageable steps that fit your schedule. However a planner is not a “set it and forget it” type of tool. It’s up to you to continuously evaluate your goals allocate your time and then stick to the tasks and schedule you’ve put in writing.



A final affirmation about the best daily planners

Productivity tools appeal to our loftiest aspirational goals about the lives we dream of living vs. the life we are currently living. At the end of the day it doesn’t really matter whether you use a Moleskine daily planner Panda planner or an app to stick to your agenda. The best daily planner for you is always going to be the one that inspires you to cultivate routines and habits that make your dreams a reality.",,,,,,,,,,,,

On 20 April 2022 the sixth and last scorpene-class submarine was launched by Indian Defence Secretary Dr. Ajay Kumar in Mumbai. This brings to an end the Project 75 contract with Mazgaon Docks Limited Mumbai.

The submarine has to undergo setting to work on various equipment followed by harbor trials. Indian Naval crew will take her to sea for rigorous sea trials before it is officially handed over to the Navy by late 2023.

The submarine carries the name Vagsheer and is a reincarnation of an earlier submarine. In the Indian Navy ships and submarines get rechristened after their earlier versions have been decommissioned.

These six submarines were built by MDL under ToT (transfer of technology) from Naval Group of France in a contract of $3.75 billion.

The Indian Navy has a 30-year submarine building program which entails designing and building submarines indigenously. The entire program is many years behind the envisaged schedule.

Harnessing an indigenous design has remained an unachieved target for the Navy. There were opportunities to develop upon the SSKs 209 (German Design HDW) as also on Kilo-class whose Medium Refit Life Certification was done by our yards.

Even at this stage the hunt for Project 75(I) is in progress. It will be built under the Strategic Partnership Model for which MDL and L&T shipyards have been shortlisted.

Four original manufacturers are in the fray. It can be safely expected that commencement is a few years away. What happens in the interim when the MDL building line is without work? The expertise obtained in building Scorpene could get lost by the time a submarine of 75(I) begins production.

Considering the situation that India is in both geopolitical and technological few options are worth examining. That we are short on submarines is a reality. The 30- year submarine building program has become history because we haven’t got an indigenous design yet.

Project 75(I) AoN was obtained in 2011/12. During the discussions an alternate proposal was suggested to increase the number of diesel submarines under Project 75 from 6 to 9 and future investments are made to construct 6 SSNs (Nuclear powered but not nuclear-armed attack submarines).

Instead the option of the mid-life upgrade of Kilo Class and building 75(I) submarines was chosen. The Government could not have afforded funding for mid-life upgrade of Kilo-class and building submarines under Project 75(I) simultaneously.

Therefore in 2022 India is in the same situation due to Scorpene having been built and yard left without work on the submarine building line and 75(I) not in close vicinity.

Few alternatives could be considered subject to acceptance by the Navy and the backing of the Ministry Of Defence (DoD).

MDL could be contracted to build another three Scorpene submarines. In the meanwhile indigenous AIP (Air Independent Propulsion) could be retrofitted onto the six submarines already built and three new Scorpenes could be constructed with AIP.

This would keep the MDL line going and trained manpower gainfully employed. A new set of technicians could be trained by the existing skilled workers.

As far as Project 75(I) is concerned it could be converted to SSN construction for which government-to-government agreement should be explored expeditiously.

The selected submarine could be built jointly by the shortlisted shipyards L&T and MDL. The time is also ripe to obtain technology for miniaturized nuclear reactors for SSNs to keep abreast with the present times.

SSNs can cover a much larger area and conduct stealth reconnaissance in the IOR (and possibly Indo Pacific) in a lesser duration. Therefore a lesser number of submarines may be deployed leaving diesel submarines for near coast deployments.

Meanwhile the collusion between China and Pakistan is resulting in Pakistan getting 8 submarines from China (3 to be built in Karachi Shipyard). The induction has already begun.

In addition 3/4 Frigates/ destroyers will result in Pakistan having a different Navy and being a proxy to the Chinese PLA Navy. It is time to be prepared for emerging scenarios.

India’s strategic partnerships with a number of technologically advanced countries could be put to test for acquiring this newer technology.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vbmV0ZmxpeGxpZmUuY29tLzIwMjIvMDQvMjQvYmF0dGxlLWtpdHR5LWNhc3QtbmV0ZmxpeC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Battle Kitty cast: Who's in the Netflix show?,dark.

But Officer Monday and the caption were worlds apart. “Fuel business is easy” the police officer told TheCable during visits to Seme and Owode-Apa two of Nigeria’s border towns with the Benin Republic where fuel smuggling thrives and sustains the local economy.

“I did it for more than a year before I decided to concentrate more on transporting people (smugglers)” Officer Monday continued as he provided insight into the fuel smuggling business costing Nigeria billions of naira annually.

Daily at least 42 million litres of petrol are smuggled out of Nigeria at a resultant cost of about N2 billion according to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). With millions of Nigerians grappling with periodic fuel shortages and amid the clamour for the removal of fuel subsidy which is said to gulp N150 billion monthly investigations by TheCable reveal a black market of subsidies; one in which individuals smuggle thousands of gallons of fuel to Nigeria’s neighbours in well-coordinated operations with support from security operatives.

From Benin Republic to Niger and Cameroon TheCable documented how security operatives like Officer Monday pave the way for the lucrative fuel smuggling business or in the least turn a blind eye for the crime to continue unabated.

In Ikom Cross River state where Nigeria’s border with Cameroon lies the business of smuggling fuel into the neighbouring country is controlled by an “elected government” made up of a chairman and other members of an executive council. Their key responsibility according to some members residents and as TheCable observed is to coordinate the illegal business and pay “settlement” fees running into millions of naira to security operatives to look the other way.

“If I buy fuel of N5000 (per gallon) from Nigeria which I usually load inside a sack I’ll make something close to that amount as profit after selling it in Benin Republic” said Officer Monday who said he is attached to the Badagry division of the Nigerian police.

THE BENIN REPUBLIC ROUTE

The Seme/Owode-Apa axis of Lagos state is smugglers’ choice route for illicit trade despite the heavily-armed security personnel and checkpoints that dot the road.

“With your car no one will disturb you and even if they do N500 is all you need to pay” said Monday King a smuggler based in Seme. “Just fill your tank and cross to Benin where you will sell it.”

Smugglers moving fuel through this and other routes are on the safe side only if they know a security officer according to a police personnel identified as Sir K who like Monday is also involved in fuel smuggling and transporting smugglers. “You have to know the police customs army and others if you want to do the business successfully on this route (Badagry/Seme/Owode-Apa)” he said his hand spreading out towards the dusty path.

His account turned out to be true when TheCable’s reporter transported fuel in a 10-litre gallon along the route in the company of one Paul an ex-soldier who’s an acquaintance of Officer Monday.

And despite carrying the fuel and not having a passport there was no confrontation from any of the personnel in the nearly 20 security checkpoints counted from Badagry to the Owode-Apa border.

“Here anything goes” said Paul who is known in the area as Bishop. “You can transport guns to Ghana Togo if you work with the right person” he continued before adding that “they didn’t disturb us because you’re with me”.

At Kpoguidi which is about 50 kilometres from Badagry the 10-litre gallon of fuel was sold at N220 per litre – more than the N165 it was bought leaving a profit of N55 for each litre. But there is even a bigger deal for the Beninese: a litre of petrol in the country is sold for XOF 520 ($0.899 and N368.45) according to data from the tracking platform Globalpetrolprices.com which means that for each litre bought in Nigeria there is a gain of at least N200 to be made if the smuggler sells directly to the Beninese market.

In Owode a border town in Ogun state TheCable found that all one needs to move petrol with ease to Benin Republic is to pay N67000 for a ‘pass’ issued by unidentified officials of Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) according to smugglers who ply the route.

It is a “very lucrative” business and often done at night said one Akeem who works as both a smuggler and a motorcyclist.

Plying one of the many routes through which fuel is smuggled into Benin Republic TheCable reporter paid N800 at four checkpoints manned by Nigerian security officials — including the immigration police soldiers and customs.

“The customs officials on the road they’re not there to catch (arrest) smugglers” said Saheed who said he has been smuggling fuel along the route since 2017. “As you’re looking for money they are also doing the same.”

Atiku Samuel a public policy analyst told TheCable that the trend of fuel smuggling shows that agencies such as the customs “have failed” because “they fixate on how much revenue is being generated while their core mandate — which is to protect our borders — have been jettisoned”.

THE BUSINESS OF ILLEGALITY

Fuel smuggling has become the mainstay of several inhabitants of border communities and security operatives some of who are directly involved while it has created indirect employment for many others.

“If you have the money and understand the business very well you’ll make up to N200000 to N400000 per week” said Iya Ibo also known as Psalm 91.

Iya Ibo is among those who have made fortunes from the illicit business. She has reportedly bought two cars with proceeds from fuel smuggling.

In various border communities an obvious trend was how residents particularly youths appeared to have found succour in the business.

In Benin Republic TheCable found that buying and reselling fuel from Nigeria is a major occupation for residents in various towns including Seme Krate Kpoguidi Hovidokpo and Igolo where trucks and other private vehicles from Cotonou were stationed at various points to buy smuggled fuel from Nigeria.

Apart from directly running the business as a manager and transporting fuel along the various routes there is almost an opportunity for everyone interested: There are those who sell the gallons and sacks used; some who load the fuel while others provide cover and act as informants for the smugglers.

There are even artisans who construct additional tanks for vehicles used for smuggling petrol often at the cost of between N40000 to N80000 for a tank that could take 300 litres of petrol.

But while the direct and indirect players are thriving as a result of the illicit trade Nigeria’s petroleum sector continues to bleed with a system that appears to be rewarding the most fraudulent despite the government subsidy in place.

CROSS RIVER-CAMEROON: THE NITRATE UNION

In Ikom LGA in Cross River state Nigeria’s border with Cameroon it is a widely-held belief that some fuel smugglers are “far richer” than most senior government officials.

“Nitrate chairman is richer than the local government chairman because of the money they make” said former fuel smuggler Joshua Obaji in reference to the Nitrate Union a body of fuel smugglers in Cross River state which demands about N1 million as registration fee from screened and “well-connected” members.

“If you are the chairman of the Nitrate Union and business is moving very well in a week you are entitled to N20 million” added Obaji who is currently out of business.

Smugglers moving fuel from Cross River to Cameroon operate under the organised cartel known as Nitrate Union a branch of the United Border Across the umbrella union that oversees the smuggling of all kinds of commodities across the Cameroon border.

“They supervise the carrying of fuel from here to Cameroon they also have a body in Cameroon. The head of the union is rotated between Ekpache Ekome in Ikom Ajaso in Etung and Ekok in Cameroon” said Obaji whose house is just a stone’s throw from Ikom River from where the fuel is transported to Cameroon.

Here smuggling to Cameroon is through road by night and river by day mostly with the support of security agencies — according to smugglers union leaders residents and local authorities.

“Some J5 (cars used to transport the fuel) carry as many as 250 twenty-five litres (gallons) and we pumped 2000 gallons the last time” said one member of the male-dominated union who refused to disclose his name.

At N180 per litre the gain for each gallon – bought during his last sale at N4500 and sold for N7500 – is around N3000. With 2000 gallons that would yield N6 million leaving a profit of around N3.5 million for each sale when transportation and settlement fees of about N2.5 million put together are subtracted.

It is a simple but secretive process explained a business manager of a Nitrate Union member who simply identified himself as Odey. “If you have 1000 rubber (jerrycans) we have what is called declaration; you will declare with the chairman – one rubber is N800 so you will calculate N800 by 1000” he said.

“That money na for Ghana Must Go you go drop am for petrol chairman table he go now give you pass to pump. When you pay chairman is in charge to go and see customs see immigration; all the forces; they have an amount they will collect and share within themselves.”

“Seizing (of gallons of fuel when smugglers are caught) is only when you don’t settle them (the security personnel) or when they do not permit you to go and pump and you are pumping. It is only after the security agencies give go-ahead to the chairman that he can declare with his people” Odey continued.

“They already have an understanding and they have collected the money they are to collect so people can then pump (fuel)” he said noting that the operation is carried out between four to seven times a month and that smugglers still settle security personnel while transporting the petrol from the filling stations to Ikom River — and onto the warm embrace of large canoes.

Bribes paid to security agencies for such transportation can vary “from N2 million N5 million or N1.5 million” said a driver who helps the smugglers to transport their product. Popularly known as Safi he said “we normally start our business (transporting fuel to the river from the filling stations) by 1am in the night. When it is 6am in the morning we stop it. When you settle the police you do your business and find your way out”.

Whenever pumping is “declared” for members of the union they go in batches mostly at night and across the span of three days with wealthier ones buying at least 1500 to 2000 twenty-five-litre gallons according to Odey and several fuel attendants.

Filling stations turn out to be the engine of the smuggling business. Within Ikom town smugglers identified at least five where fuel is being pumped steadily to be illegally transported to Cameroon.

“Before they come to do pumping at the filling station we see their receipt used to declare” said one fuel attendant at Bodagri Nigeria Limited a station along Ikom-Ogoja road. “If you don’t have receipts that means you didn’t declare and you want to be doing it secretly.”

The Nitrate Union system ensures there is compensation for members who run into any trouble while transporting fuel just as there are penalties for those who buy fuel outside of approved days or above the “declared” quantity.

“We have task force both for water and land… if you pump more than … (or) if you don’t show your pass they will seize it” Odey added.

From local government areas like Ikom and Obubra smugglers buy fuel in 25-litre gallons and transport them to Ajaso and Mfom communities from where they are loaded into canoes heading to Ekok a bustling Cameroonian town situated less than five kilometres from the border.

Once the gallons of petrol are offloaded from the canoes in Ekok they are taken to the point of sale referred to as Petrol Market.

Over the course of two days in the town TheCable observed that the economy is largely driven by smuggling; from the youths carrying gallons to and fro the river to transporters informants as well as traders selling gallons of petrol.

Apart from members of the smuggling cartel who deal in thousands of gallons young boys often smuggle one or two gallons along the Ikom border.

Underneath tree shades inside uncompleted structures and around the bushes along the border TheCable found gallons tucked away some of which were filled with petrol.

To escape security operatives and the union task force within Ikom the young smugglers go to Obubra LGA about 90 kilometres away where they are able to pump as many gallons as they want but face a higher risk transporting them to the river.

For such persons who don’t belong to the union the penalty is stiffer said Odey. “If they seize your fuel they auction it…customs can auction each gallon N3000 and people will be rushing. Some of the officers buy and resell.”

Tengi George-Ikoli a petroleum public policy expert said to end fuel smuggling Nigeria must strengthen process reforms to accurately track end-to-end transportation of fuel products within the country ensure stronger border controls and adopt a whistleblower policy.

Tengi who is the program coordinator at Nigeria Natural Resource Charter (NNRC) added that “implementation of the deregulation policy declared in 2020 and the legal framework incorporated in the Petroleum Industry Act 2021 to aid deregulation will go a long way towards eradicating the price distortions that make it attractive to smugglers”.

THE DUSTY DANGEROUS ROUTE TO NIGER

For four days TheCable monitored the smuggling of fuel and other contraband through Nigeria’s poorly-policed border with the Niger Republic.

As previously reported the Niger border is grossly under-policed such that large swathes of land exist with no single security operative on sight as the personnel in charge including a joint security team known as border patrol are overstretched.

Smugglers described how jerrycans are transported in large quantities with the aid of woven sacks. This helps in carrying “a large number of jerrycans on a trip” through the porous border said 30-year-old Jamiu Ali.

Ali added that while weekends and nights are suitable for rickety vehicles with extra tanks motorcycles and tricycles are used during the daytime adding that “there is no presence of law enforcement” along notorious routes such as Gidan Kamin Bakin Dutse Geti Babadede and Gidan Ketsu.

At Illela a border community in the northern part of Sokoto state Kabiru Dan-Ilela is so popular that he needs no introduction to any of the travellers and drivers plying the route between Nigeria and Niger.

“I started this business long ago when I decided not to continue with my studies” said Dan-Ilela 25 before adding that he earns good money moving contraband across Nigeria’s border with Konni in Niger.

“I dropped out (of school) and joined others selling fuel in gallons at the roadside before I started using a car” he added.

Shuaibu Mohammed a resident in Sokoto said he has been witnessing the smuggling of fuel into Niger for years. “Most of these boys learn the illicit trade at a tender age” said Mohammed. “They see the idea of going to school at the elementary level as a waste of time.”

To assist the TheCable reporter in transporting petrol along the Illela route Dan-Ilela broke down the process: “We package our products in woven sacks if they are transported by motorcycle. If you want to sell to me I will buy twenty litres of jerrycan at N5200 but if you have someone in Konni I will tell my boys to collect N600 each for transporting a jerry can of fuel to Konni.”

The “boys” he spoke of TheCable would later learn are among dozens of 20-year-olds who run all sorts of errands for smugglers.

Dan-Ilela’s house serves as his depot with not less than 150 jerrycans filled with petroleum products packed in woven sacks and ready for transportation.

Apart from the smugglers who transport fuel in their cars motorcyclists are also key beneficiaries of the illegal trade. Posing as a stranded truck driver the reporter got one Dahiru Sani a motorcyclist to transport three jerrycans of fuel from Illela in Sokoto to Konni.

It is a brisk business in which the motorcyclists charge as much as N600 to transport a 20-litre jerrycan.

“On a motorcycle trip we can load between 17 and 20 jerry cans with fuel depending on the rider” Sani said.

“Any vehicle like 504 or Toyota Carina can load between 80 to 90 jerrycans depending on the vehicle and its extra tank. Even a bicycle can load three jerrycans.”

According to residents security operatives are endangered species along the route with some sharing stories of how they are often overpowered by smugglers leading them to stay away.

While travelling with Sani to Konni TheCable came across two vehicles belonging to the Nigerian customs which had been set ablaze. Some residents said the customs officials had stopped a vehicle carrying some contraband infuriating youths and motorcyclists plying the road.

“It is a regular occurrence” said a co-traveller. “The smugglers always have the upper hand against any law enforcement agencies that come their way because villagers will always support them.”

‘WE ARE HELPLESS‘

In November 2021 the Sokoto government signed an executive order prohibiting the sale of petroleum products in jerrycans in a bid to tackle the menace of insecurity.

But despite the fact that the order is still in place TheCable found that it is being breached on a daily basis particularly in border communities.

Ibrahim Magaji Gusau chairman Sokoto State Petroleum Monitoring Committee said the smuggling of fuel across the Illela border is not unknown to the state government and security agencies.

“We are aware that petroleum products are being smuggled at the border but we are helpless. Our committee always ensures that there is no hoarding of fuel and ensures its dispels at official price to the public” he said.

“But the Illela scenario is not part of our mandate. The security agencies are in the best position to answer such enquiry.”

Ibrahim said while other local government areas adhered to the directive against the sale of petrol in jerrycans border communities refused to comply.

“Some politicians who are owners of the affected filling station lobbied the APC federal lawmaker representing the area who secured the federal government permit for them to be excluded from the governor’s order” Ibrahim alleged.

Abdullahi Balarabe Salame the APC lawmaker representing Illela/Gwadabawa federal constituency admitted that he assisted in reopening some petrol stations due to the “hardship faced” by the owners but he queried the efforts of the security agencies who he says should be responsible for preventing the smuggling of petrol.

“I assisted some of the stations to be reopened due to the hardship faced by the farmers motorists etc to alleviate their suffering” he said.

“But no good citizen will give a helping hand to smugglers talk less of myself who is representing both the government and the people in the area.”

When contacted by TheCable Onyema Nwachukwu army spokesman said an investigation would be carried out to determine the involvement of its officials in the aiding of smuggling adding that it is an “illegitimate and a punishable infraction”.

Joseph Attah Nigeria customs spokesperson said the agency “will not deal kindly with any operative found remotely connected with petroleum smuggling” noting that the service has been “recording high volume seizures of petroleum products in recent times while strictly enforcing the 20km radius of the border for petroleum stations”.

On his part Olumuyiwa Adejobi police spokesperson requested the names of officers involved in the “act of economic sabotage” to enable the force to investigate the matter.

“You will need to mention names or teams being caught in such act of economic sabotage then we know how to channel our investigations. I am not so sure that any policeman will descend so low to have been involved in such” he said.

“However in case we have some of them who are deviants kindly do us good by availing us more information about them and their modus operandi.”

We may receive a commission on purchases made from links.

Have you ever looked at your iPhone iPad or Mac and wondered just why Apple is called Apple? The name certainly makes the company stand out among its rivals. We've got Microsoft NVIDIA IBM AMD Atari and thousands of other names that either don't mean anything or that relate to technology in some way. In that crowd Apple is a whole different story. Is there a deep meaning behind the name or did it just happen to be the one that stuck in the company's early days?

To find the answers we'll have to go all the way back to when Apple Computers Inc. was founded. Two college dropouts and friends Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak created Apple on April 1 1976 (via Library of Congress). According to Ann Brashares author of ""Steve Jobs Thinks Different"" both Jobs and Wozniak wanted to create a computer that regular people could keep in their homes and offices. Back in 1976 computers were enormous mainframes that took tremendous amounts of space — entire rooms even. Jobs and Wozniak teamed up to build a computer that was simple and small enough that everybody in the world could have one if they wanted to.

As per that same book Jobs and Wozniak set their plan in motion by creating Apple Computers and setting up shop in the Jobs' family garage. Equipped with not much else but their enthusiasm for the idea they were eventually able to build their first machine dubbed ""Apple I"" — thus only reinforcing the naming and the brand. Does that imply ""Apple"" was something meaningful to them and something they felt strongly about? Not necessarily.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZm9iYWUuY29tL2VuLzIwMjIvMDQvMjMvdGhpcy1zdG9yeS1kZW1vbnN0cmF0ZXMtd2h5LWEtcGV0LXNob3VsZC1ub3QtY2FycnktYW4tYWlydGFnLWFzLWEtbG9jYXRvci_SAYQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5mb2JhZS5jb20vZW4vMjAyMi8wNC8yMy90aGlzLXN0b3J5LWRlbW9uc3RyYXRlcy13aHktYS1wZXQtc2hvdWxkLW5vdC1jYXJyeS1hbi1haXJ0YWctYXMtYS1sb2NhdG9yLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcC10eXBl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This story demonstrates why a pet should not carry an airtag as a locator,"A tabby cat with brown nose and green eyes looking into the camera. The background is green and matches the cat's eyes.

Airtags are small devices from Apple that help locate keys a car a bag or anything else. Thanks to this ability to find objects some have used them to put them on their pets mainly cats so they know where they are when they go for long walks.

However some stories show that they are not useful for tracing where the pussy went for a walk as they tend to fall halfway or expose it to getting stuck in tight spaces.

The following story told by a Reddit user demonstrates how dangerous and unhelpful it can be to place an airtag on a pet when he goes for a walk outside the home.

19 days ago the user helenkellerlives made a post asking for help finding her 7-month-old kitten who wore an airtag on her collar. He said that the little animal would have left his house through the door of the dog and later jumped the fence during the early hours of the morning.

“We last saw him on our security camera during the morning and we thought it was strange that he didn't come back for breakfast.”

After the first hours of waiting they checked the airtag information finding that at 9:34 in the morning it was about four blocks away so they relaxed thinking that it was about to arrive. However half an hour passed and according to the airtag he was still in the same area.

Since it didn't make sense that the cat had spent half an hour in the same place the person decided to go out to the location marked by the device. There he found something that stole his breath for a few seconds.

The necklace with the airtag was lying in the middle of the street near a house. Faced with this he decided to go talk to the neighbor to ask him if he could watch the recording of his security camera and leave him a number in case he saw the cat pass by.

He explained that the situation seemed strange to him because “the detachable collar is very difficult to remove unless the cat is stuck on something it can be removed with force so as not to catch the cat where it is stuck”. In response to the concern he proceeded to print some advertisements and affix them throughout the area to receive information in case anyone knew his whereabouts.

Thanks to its quick action the story had a happy ending. A neighbor saw the cat so he called the owner to let him know that he had found it a few blocks away. When they arrived at the site they could not find it immediately however the hungry pussy appeared and they took him back home.

After the incident between the collar and the airtag the Reddit user said that now the kitten will always live inside his house to prevent him from going out again and having an accident happen to him. In this case Apple's device helped him get an idea of where the pet had been but it didn't help him find it.

Fortunately the cat did not get stuck in a fence either or someone took it maliciously to steal the device (which in stores costs about US 39 dollars). For the reasons mentioned here pets should not wear collars with airtags and should opt for chip implants or simply take care that they never go out alone.

The semiconductor equipment manufacturer started moving material into the new location at the beginning of the month Gradwohl said.

Applied Materials took ownership of the former Shopko building at 1370 U.S. 2 East in 2021.

With the expansion into the new facility which will be used for manufacturing Applied Materials plans to add as many as 200 new jobs the company’s general manager for Montana told the Inter Lake in November.

The building which has been vacant since Shopko declared bankruptcy in 2019 is about 98000 square feet. It sits on more than eight acres of land.

The county valued the building at $4.3 million in 2020.

Applied Materials manufactures equipment for semiconductors that are used in a variety of electronic devices including smartphones and computers.

The Santa Clara California-based company has locations around the world including in Japan Israel India and across Europe.

Applied Materials acquired its former competitor Kalispell-based Semitool in 2009. Semitool sold for $364 million.

""Applied Materials is in the process of expanding our Kalispell facilities to support our growing business"" Brian Aegerter the company's general manager for Montana said in a statement in fall 2021 when the company announced the purchase of the Shopko building.



""The work that we do has roots dating back over 40 years in the Kalispell community and today our teams at Applied are making some of the most innovative products for the semiconductor industry.”

In 2015 a third Montana Applied Materials facility closed in Libby. All of its 17 employees were offered positions in Kalispell.

Highland Campus will house state-of-the-art classrooms four incubators a Creative Digital Media Center performing arts venues STEM Regional Simulation Center and a student-run restaurant.

“Our main goal here is to provide students with the experiences so they can safely and confidently care for patients” Audra Lewis director of the ACC Regional Simulation Center said.

The simulation center features six simulation rooms three specialty rooms that include an emergency room a surgical room and a trauma room.

“It doesn’t replace clinical but it’s a great compliment so students can practice over and over again and they are not going to harm anybody” Lewis said. “They can make mistakes [practice] how they act as a health care professional what they should what they shouldn’t do. How they’re thinking and their decision-making really can affect patient outcomes.”

Phase 2 of the Highland Campus is funded by the November 2014 bond election.

According to the district voters approved two bond proposals representing $386 million in college-wide capital improvements with approximately $152.8 million allocated for Phase 2.

The building of the Highland Campus timelines goes back to 2010 when ACC formed a partnership with RedLeaf Properties and began purchasing sections of what used to be Highland Mall.

The mall closed in 2015.

Parts of the original infrastructure can still be seen throughout the campus.

Another program in Phase 2 is the Manufacturing IMPACT Lab. The lab works to get students into jobs with high-tech manufacturers.

“They could start an entry-level job at pretty much any manufacturer in the region be it Samsung Applied Materials Tesla — they all hire our CPT students in entry-level positions” Eric Hepburn ACC IMPACT lab manager said.

The ACC Highland Campus will be 1200000 square feet and will house 21000 students according to the college.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2NhZXNhcnMtZWxpbWluYXRlcy1sb3lhbHR5LXBlcmstbGF1cmVsLWxvdW5nZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Caesars Quietly Eliminates a Well-Loved Loyalty Perk,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/caesars-eliminates-loyalty-perk-laurel-lounge on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2NhZXNhcnMtZWxpbWluYXRlcy1sb3lhbHR5LXBlcmstbGF1cmVsLWxvdW5nZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The White House also said it would expedite the opening of a US embassy in Honiara the island nation's capital and the two countries agreed to initiate a strategic dialogue and a programme on maritime domain awareness as well as advance a range of other initiatives.

The delegation led by National Security Council Indo-Pacific Coordinator Kurt Campbell flew to Honiara after it was announced this week that China and the Solomons had signed the security agreement. While details have not been released a draft of the deal - leaked in March by political opponents of Sogavare - would allow the Chinese navy to dock in the islands and Beijing to deploy its police and armed forces there.

According to the White House Solomon officials emphasised that the pact with China ""had solely domestic applications""; Sogavare tried to assure the delegation that ""there would be no military base no long-term presence and no power projection capability"" as a result of the agreement.

Even so the security pact is seen as a major inroad for China in the Pacific - where the Solomon Islands occupy a strategic position - and troubles other Pacific powers as well including Japan New Zealand and especially Australia which pressed the Solomon Islands to scrap the deal. The distance between Australia and the Solomons is roughly 2000km (1200 miles) or nearly half that between Australia and mainland China.

The US delegation met with senior officials from those three countries in Hawaii during the first leg of the delegation's Pacific tour.

China has long courted the Solomons through economic diplomacy. In 2019 the island nation broke diplomatic ties with Taiwan and recognised Beijing. At the time Sogavare said the switch put his country ""on the right side of history"" but opposition was strong in some parts of the Solomons; violence erupted late last year when protesters clashed with police causing millions of dollars worth of damage.

Story continues

Sogavare who narrowly survived a no-confidence vote in December said the deal would allow Chinese police to protect Chinese-financed infrastructure projects.

Campbell had been expected to push Sogavare to back out of the deal but it was signed before the US delegation arrived.

China says that the deal is meant to promote peace and stability in the region. Its ambassador to the Solomon Islands Li Ming defended the pact on Friday.

""Development and security are two sides of a coin. Without safety and security countries cannot enjoy sustainable development and economic growth"" he said.

Honiara was the final destination on the US delegation's Pacific tour following stops in Hawaii Fiji and Papua New Guinea. The China-Solomon Islands deal was discussed in Fiji and Papua New Guinea as well according to the US embassy in Papua New Guinea.

Besides Campbell the delegation included Daniel Kritenbrink the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs and deputies from the Indo-Pacific Command and the Agency for International Development.

According to reports New Zealand and Tonga plan to bring up the deal at the next meeting of Pacific Islands Forum leaders while Japan may send a vice-minister to the Solomon Islands to relay its concerns later this month.

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Gallagher & Co.'s (NYSE:AJG) Stock?,"Most readers would already be aware that Arthur J. Gallagher's (NYSE:AJG) stock increased significantly by 11% over the past three months. Given the company's impressive performance we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Specifically we decided to study Arthur J. Gallagher's ROE in this article.

Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.

See our latest analysis for Arthur J. Gallagher

How To Calculate Return On Equity?

The formula for ROE is:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So based on the above formula the ROE for Arthur J. Gallagher is:

12% = US$987m ÷ US$8.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2021).

The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has the company made $0.12 in profit.

Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?

So far we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"" we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged the higher the ROE and profit retention the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.

Arthur J. Gallagher's Earnings Growth And 12% ROE

To begin with Arthur J. Gallagher seems to have a respectable ROE. Further the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 11%. Consequently this likely laid the ground for the decent growth of 15% seen over the past five years by Arthur J. Gallagher.

As a next step we compared Arthur J. Gallagher's net income growth with the industry and pleasingly we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 12%.

Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is AJG worth today? The intrinsic value infographic in our free research report helps visualize whether AJG is currently mispriced by the market.

Is Arthur J. Gallagher Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?

Arthur J. Gallagher has a three-year median payout ratio of 45% which implies that it retains the remaining 55% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered and given the decent growth seen by the company it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.

Besides Arthur J. Gallagher has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 31% over the next three years. As a result the expected drop in Arthur J. Gallagher's payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 15% over the same period.

Summary

In total we are pretty happy with Arthur J. Gallagher's performance. Particularly we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

(Barcelone) Il y a exactement 17 ans un Espagnol de 18 ans du nom de Rafael Nadal a commencé à attirer l’attention du monde du tennis en gagnant l’Omnium de Barcelone et en se hissant dans le top-10 pour la première fois.

Associated Press

Carlos Alcaraz a imité son compatriote et idole dimanche récoltant également son premier titre à Barcelone et en assurant son entrée dans le top-10 pour la première fois au même âge.

Alcaraz a continué son impressionnante poussée en prenant la mesure d’un autre compatriote Pablo Carreno Busta en deux manches de 6-3 6-2 pour son troisième titre de la saison.

PHOTO JOSEP LAGO AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE Carlos Alcaraz a célébré sa victoire en plongeant dans la piscine.

Cette victoire est survenue quelques heures après qu’il eut complété son match de demi-finale qui avait été interrompu samedi à cause de la pluie.

« Ça signifie beaucoup. Je regarde ce tournoi depuis que je suis un enfant a déclaré Alcaraz. J’ai toujours voulu jouer dans ce tournoi et bien sûr d’être capable de gagner ce tournoi. Je suis vraiment vraiment heureux de faire partie du palmarès espagnol. »

Alcaraz a réussi deux bris de service lors de chacune des deux manches pour se sauver avec la victoire qui fait suite aux triomphes qu’il a enregistrés à Rio de Janeiro en février et à Miami plus tôt en avril.

L’an dernier il avait gagné le tournoi d’Umag en Croatie pour son premier titre en carrière.

Pour la première fois de sa jeune carrière lundi Alcaraz verra son nom dans le top-10 du classement de l’ATP au neuvième rang devant celui du Montréalais Félix Auger-Aliassime.

Du coup il deviendra le plus jeune joueur à y accéder depuis que Nadal a réalisé l’exploit après avoir gagné l’Omnium de Barcelone pour la première fois de sa carrière en 2005.

Tout comme Nadal il y a 17 ans Alcaraz s’est présenté à la compétition au 11e rang du classement mondial. Vainqueur de 21 tournois du Grand Chelem en simple en carrière Nadal n’est jamais sorti du top-10 depuis ce moment.

La victoire sur le court central Rafa Nadal à Barcelone a couronné une longue journée pour Alcaraz qui avait eu besoin de 3 h 39 minutes pour éliminer l’Australien Alex de Minaur 6-7 (4) 7-6 (4) 6-4 en demi-finale en matinée.

An influential group of medical experts the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended last week that most women receive a mammogram starting at age 40. Women should continue to get a mammogram every other year to screen for breast cancer until age 74 the task force said.

This is a marked difference from the task force’s previous guidance which was to start biennial mammograms by age 50. Women in their 40s were counseled to make individual decisions together with their health care provider but there was no explicit recommendation for them to start until they turned 50.

I wanted to learn more about why these changes were made. Who should follow this updated guidance and are there women who need to receive screening even earlier or more often? What other tests besides a mammogram may be needed? And are there preventive measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer?

To help us with these questions I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.

People should now starting getting mammograms at age 40 according to new recommendations. yacobchuk/iStockphoto/Getty Images

CNN: How common is breast cancer?

Dr. Leana Wen: In the United States breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women and it is the second leading cause of cancer death in women. According to the American Cancer Society 1 in 8 women will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in their lifetimes. About 42000 women die every year from this cancer.

It’s crucial that women know their risk factors and receive screening accordingly. Screening by definition is done before there are any symptoms. Screening can help detect cancers at an early stage before it has spread when there is the best chance for successful treatment.

CNN: Why did the US Preventive Task Force make these changes?

Wen: In recent years there has been a disturbing trend of cancer diagnoses increasing among young people. This is the case with colon cancer as well as with breast cancer.

In fact breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in women ages 20 to 49. Younger women tend to have more aggressive cancers upon diagnosis compared to older women.

This is especially true for Black women. the rate of deaths from breast cancer among Black women in their 40s was 27 per 100000 person-years compared to 15 per 100000 person-years among White women according to a 2023 JAMA Network Open study.

According to a study in the journal Lancet Oncology the mortality from breast cancer could be lowered by starting mammograms earlier at age 40.

The US Preventive Task Force’s change now makes its recommendations closer to those of other major national organizations. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for instance recommends screening every one or two years starting at age 40 and continuing until at least age 75. The American Cancer Society gives women ages 40 to 44 the option to receive a mammogram every year and recommends those 44 and 55 to get them annually. (Those over 55 can switch to every other year or can continue annual mammograms.)

CNN: Who should follow this updated guidance?

Wen: I would encourage woman to be aware of this updated guidance and discuss it with their physicians. The key is that this guidance is for women at average risk of breast cancer. Those at average risk should begin mammograms by age 40.

This guidance does not apply to people with higher risk. Everyone needs to evaluate their own risk to see if they may be at elevated risk; if so they may need additional tests and at greater frequency than these recommendations.

The updated guidance also applies to all people assigned female at birth which includes not only cisgender women but also transgender men and nonbinary people. These individuals should also have discussions with their health care providers to evaluate their risk factors and therefore how frequently they should receive screenings.

CNN: How should people determine if they need screenings more often or earlier in their lives?

Wen: The most important factor is personal or family history of breast cancer. If someone had breast cancer themselves they need to consult their oncologist or primary care provider to figure out what testing they need and at what frequency to monitor for cancer recurrence. The same goes for individuals who had prior radiation to the chest from other cancers.

Family history is also a key determinant of risk. A woman who has a sister mother or other first-degree relative with breast cancer has double the average risk of breast cancer. A woman who has two first-degree relatives has five times the risk of developing breast cancer.

CNN: What should women expect at their first mammogram?

Wen: A mammogram is an x-ray of the breasts. Generally what happens is that a technician will lead to you to a room where you take off your bra and shirt wipe off deodorant from your armpit area that could interfere with results and change into a gown that will cover you from the waist up (you don’t need to remove your underwear pants or shoes). You are then led to a mammogram machine. The technician will position you so that the machine can best capture images of your breasts.

The part of the mammogram that may cause some discomfort is when the technician positions your breasts between two plastic imaging plates that apply pressure while the images are being taken. However the discomfort is generally over within seconds. Those who are concerned about potential discomfort could consider taking Tylenol or ibuprofen an hour before the mammogram.

CNN: What other tests besides mammograms may be needed?

Wen: Someone who has a family history of breast cancer may be recommended for genetic testing. They and others at higher-than-average risk of breast cancer may need to start mammograms at an earlier age or may need them at more frequent intervals. Other tests may be used along with the mammogram. These include breast ultrasound breast MRI or both.

I want to mention that there are experts who advocate for additional testing to be done in women who have average risk but have dense breast tissue. Mammography remains the screening test of choice in these women but there are instances where they need additional imaging to better look for possible masses.

The American College of Radiology for example recommends a breast MRI in some women at intermediate risk but who have dense breast tissue. The US Preventive Services Task Force did not make this recommendation which has implications for insurance coverage for imaging. Someone very concerned about breast cancer risk should be sure to discuss this situation with their physician who can help decide what is best for them based on personal and family medical history and whether it is the worth additional cost they may incur.

CNN: What about women over 74? Why are they supposed to stop screening for breast cancer?

Wen: The US Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against mammography in women 75 years or older. However other major medical societies have continued to recommend mammography in people 75 or above especially if they are in generally good health and have long life expectancies. This once again is an issue to be discussed with one’s individual provider who can take into consideration other aspects of health and the patient’s wishes.

CNN: Are there steps younger people can do to reduce their cancer risk?

Wen: Risk factors for developing breast cancer include smoking and heavy alcohol use so quitting smoking and reducing alcohol consumption will help to reduce risk. Studies have shown that exercise can lower cancer risk in general as well as eating more whole foods and less ultraprocessed substances.

Women should also seek care if they develop any concerning symptoms such as a new mass or lump in the breast or armpit redness or flaky skin on the breast nipple discharge other than breast milk or pain or swelling anywhere in the breast.

Roofs were ripped off homes and barns in Franklin County he confirmed.

The weather service plans to send a team out to survey as many tornado-suspected areas as possible on Wednesday he said.

However they will be somewhat limited because more severe weather is expected Wednesday night.

Damage from a possible tornado was also reported in the Clarksville area of Clinton County along U.S. 22 and State Route 350 according to the Ohio State Highway Patrol’s Wilmington post.

The Met Gala Vogue's annual celebration of fearless fashion was held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York on Monday night. It's a big night for fashion and celebrities which include a number of athletes. Tom Brady Steph Curry Russell Westbrook Simone Biles Carmelo Anthony and other major sports stars have been invited in the past.

The theme for 2024 was ""Garden of Time"" to celebrate the opening of the ""Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion"" exhibit at the Met. Let's see how this year's chosen athlete-stars (the gala is by invitation only) interpreted that theme.

It seems fitting to start with Angel Reese the college basketball star who was drafted by the Chicago Sky in late April and is currently one of the biggest stars on the planet. She celebrated her 22nd birthday on Monday by making her Met Gala debut in a stunning low-cut seafoam green gown adorned with an ostrich feather tutu and embroidered tulle.

The most talked-about look of the night came from Ben Simmons. He's still playing for the Brooklyn Nets (though you're forgiven if you hadn't noticed) but since they're not in the playoffs he was free to attend. He came solo wearing a black suit and black coat with panels of plaid fabric at the top and a vine down the side. The outfit wasn't bad but his literal interpretation of the ""Garden of Time"" theme involved a clock briefcase.

Are We Not Aroused?,"Watching the red carpet at Monday night’s Met Gala I couldn’t help but recall a prediction I’d heard from Emily Kirkpatrick who writes the Substack newsletter “I <3 Mess.” She’d told me recently that before the end of 2024 it’s possible that “someone is going to show up fully nude on a red carpet.”

That didn’t happen at this year’s gala but it got very close as Doja Cat — who appeared earlier this year at the Grammy Awards in what was called “the most naked dress ever” — presented at the Met Gala in a long clinging soaking wet transparent and entirely revealing white T-shirt by the label Vetements.

Near-nudity is everywhere at least on celebrities and the celebrity adjacent. Bianca Censori Kanye West’s 29 year-old partner wandered around Paris wearing a cropped jacket with sheer pantyhose and seemingly nothing on underneath her modesty preserved only by the stockings’ single center seam. Julia Fox attended a fashion launch with three silver medallions covering her private parts under a long — and frequently parted — trench coat.

Source File Not Found""?","You may experience this error while installing AutoCAD software according to our research the error appears on the screen when Autodesk is unable to find the source file during the installation of AutoCAD however if you check the file it is present.

There are multiple causes for this error to occur we have listed some of them below:-

Corrupted files- The AutoCAD files might get corrupted during the installation process and it might be the cause for this error to occur.

The AutoCAD files might get corrupted during the installation process and it might be the cause for this error to occur. Third-party software- If you are trying to crack AutoCAD software and you have downloaded it from a third-party source then that could be the reason for the 1308 error to appear on the screen.

If you are trying to crack AutoCAD software and you have downloaded it from a third-party source then that could be the reason for the 1308 error to appear on the screen. Antivirus- Antivirus can prevent the downloading process of AutoCAD make sure to disable the Windows defender or the antivirus.

Antivirus can prevent the downloading process of AutoCAD make sure to disable the Windows defender or the antivirus. Permission denied- There is a chance that you have no longer access to C:\Autodesk for that reason Autodesk is unable to read the source file and it throws a 1308 error.

Disable Antivirus

Antivirus and firewalls protect our data and information from online resources such as applications and webservers. and it also protects us from hackers and malware bytes.

Sometimes the antivirus prevents the downloading process of the launchers and also it is advised by the Autodesk developers is to disable the antivirus from your computer when you attempt to download AutoCAD.

Note- If you are using third-party Antivirus software then disable it manually.

Follow the steps to disable antivirus:-

Go to settings by pressing the Windows + I keys together to open the settings. Click on Update & Security. Click on Windows Security on the left sidebar then click on Open Windows Security on the right pane. Go to Virus & threat protection then Click on Manage settings under the Virus & threat protection settings. Here turn off real-time protection by clicking on it. Once done check if the error persists.

Modify the Permissions of the Autodesk folder

If you don’t have full control permission on the Autodesk folder which is located in C:\ drive then you may get a 1308 error however you can fix this by just doing some changes to the permission settings.

Here is how you can modify the permissions of Autodesk:-

In case you have other Autodesk products then It is recommended to delete the Autodesk folder from the C:\ drive and then download the software again by the browser method. Exit the installation and open the explorer go to C:\ drive. Right-click on the Autodesk folder and select the properties option. Go to the security tab on the top and click on the Edit button to make changes to the permissions. Check the Full Control option and click on Apply to save changes and then press OK. Once done check if the error persists.

Download Autodesk via AVA ( Autodesk Virtual Agent )

Autodesk provides us an alternative option to install their products via Autodesk virtual agent basically it is a bot that helps us to download Autodesk products that we can install on our system we use this method when we get errors while installing Autodesk products with the browser methods.

Autodesk Virtual Agent is developed as an alternative option to download Autodesk products recently users have reported that they are getting errors while installing Autodesk products. for that reason they introduced us to AVA ( Autodesk Virtual Agent ).

Here is how you can download AutoCAD via virtual agent:-

First uninstall Autocad and all the Autodesk products from the control panel then follow the installation instruction of AutoCAD via a virtual agent. Open your favourite browser and search Autodesk virtual agent and press enter. Once all the search results are loaded then open the first link and make sure the link belongs to Autodesk. Here you will describe what product you want but before you start describing you have to sign in/signup to download Autodesk products. if you have an existing account then sign in to your account and skip to the 8th step. Click on the Sign-in button on the top right then click on create an account.

Fill out the details that are required to create your account once done they will send you a verification link on your Gmail account that you provided go to the Gmail and open the Autodesk mail click on Verify Email then sign in to the Autodesk account. Once you sign in go back to the Autodesk virtual agent. Type AutoCAD download and press enter. Click on the Start button to proceed to the next step. Now It will ask what you want carefully choose the one option according to your situation if you have an existing key you can go for it and on the next step it should ask for the product key if you don’t have a product key then you can proceed with the trial version like us. Once you selected the option then it will ask if you want to run AutoCAD on multiple computers or only on this computer. You can choose multiple but we will go for This Computer option. Click on Continue with AVA to get the link from Autodesk Virtual Agent. Select the version of AutoCAD you want to download In my case I have selected the trial version for that reason it shows the latest AutoCAD versions but if you have a product key then you can download older versions of AutoCAD but if you haven’t and you want old versions of Autocad such as 2014 2016 then you can buy a product key to download older versions. After selecting the AutoCAD version it will give you the Download button click on it to download the AutoCAD installer. Once the AutoCAD installer is downloaded double click on it to run it. It should start the downloading process once done the Autodesk download manager will come up on the screen that is used to download Autodesk products. Click on I Agree to accept the agreement then click on Next to download the Autodesk download manager. Once the installation is done it will ask about the installation directory of Autodesk to save it on the computer you can also change the directory by clicking on the Change button. After selecting the directory the downloading process of AutoCAD software will start and hopefully it will not get you into the errors.

If you followed the steps carefully one by one you will not face the 1308 error again.

AI Development Cycle for Edge AI

In the last decade AI research has brought astonishing results in many fields and undoubtedly AI is nowadays a central technology in many aspects of our life. As new ideas are proposed every day this continuous research usually comes with infinite applications: from the algorithms assisting surgeons in complex operations to the one which allows unlocking our phone using just our face. In this evolution from the idea to the actual implementation it is often ignored how hard the passage between theoretical research and working application is.

We can refer to this process as AI Development Cycle for Edge AI and can be divided into three phases related to 1) data 2) model and 3) evaluation.

Many aspects must be considered: first each different AI application requires a specific dataset. For this reason in this step the aim is to prepare the data which as is well known is one of the crucial topics of AI: a good algorithm always relies on a good dataset. This phase can be divided into data collection curation labeling and preparation.

Once the dataset is ready the correct model has to be chosen and trained for the specific task. These two first steps are the basis for every AI application and most research papers stop here. But for Edge AI i.e. AI on embedded devices the hard part comes now. Indeed the model that has been trained before could be utterly useless if it could not run on the target hardware (HW). The first idea to avoid this step could be to use servers and the cloud: this unfortunately comes with other problems such as the high-cost performances the network connectivity issues and the always present problem of data privacy.

Thus the model must be re-think to be embedded in a particular device. For this reason the next step should aim at reducing as much as possible the latency of the model (a metric that refers to the time taken to process one unit of data provided only one unit of data is processed at a time) while increasing the accuracy. For this purpose an essential and costly aspect is the search for the appropriate neural network architecture among the thousands existing. In addition compression techniques (such as pruning and filter decomposition) must be considered to reduce the computational resources needed by the model. Thirdly all these modifications must be tested in a real environment dealing with edge case data i.e. scenarios in which the systems do not perform as required or as expected.

This whole process is repetitive and could take an insane amount of time.

But time is not the only issue: we should also consider the precision needed with data organization the difficulty of meeting performance requirements for production the troubles in finding and setting up optimization methods the problem of meeting performance requirements for production the difficulty of finding and setting up optimization methods and the difficulty of optimizing AI models to name a few.

Introducing Nota AI’s NetsPresso

This is where NetsPresso from Nota AI comes in. NetsPresso is an end-to-end AI optimization platform that builds and optimizes AI models for a target HW drastically reducing development time from months to weeks. NetsPresso requires no expertise and automatically searches trains and optimizes models based on the input dataset and tests their performance on actual HW. It relies on modularized features to minimize overlap with the default pipeline and it utilizes state-of-the-art technologies for production-level AI models. This leads to an exponential decrease in cost and increased model performance.

Overview of Model Search Compression Toolkit Model Packaging

As already described NetsPresso takes as input the raw data and returns an optimized AI model. To do so three main sub-applications take care of the different phases: Model Search Compression Toolkit and Model Packaging. The first one automatically searches for optimized models for the target device the second one makes the compression process easy and fast and the third one converts and benchmarks the model to deploy on devices immediately.

Focus on Model Search and Compression Toolkit

The Beta versions of the first two steps are already available while for the third we should wait until July 2022.

Source: Nota AI

The Model Search toolkit uses a neural architecture search (NAS) technique to select the correct model given a dataset (which can be uploaded or chosen from those offered by NetsPresso) and a target device. In this set it is possible to choose between various options based on your needs (such as detection classification and segmentation) and select a model in accordance with different priorities such as accuracy latency or trade-off. In addition it supports three types of output models (TensorRT TensorFlow Lite and OpenVINO) and can be selected with awareness of the actual HW on which they will run. More precisely it supports target hardware both for edge (NVIDIA Jetson and Raspberry Pi) and server (Intel Xeon) deployment. Currently the search process can be performed in the “quick search” modality which returns one single well-performing model and takes 1 to 3 days. An “advanced search” feature is also in development which returns multiple models with excellent performances but may take from 1 to 2 weeks.

In the next release of July 2022 the list of the available target device will be updated adding ARM virtual hardware and NVIDIA T4 for edge and server deployment respectively.

In addition two fundamental techniques in Deep Learning fine-tuning and transfer learning will be made available. The former involves taking a model trained on a large dataset and applying it to a new and usually similar dataset. It is mainly performed for tasks where the dataset has too little data to train a complete model from scratch and for this reason it is becoming the standard approach for many areas where you cannot rely on enough data.

The latter consists of unfreezing part of the previously obtained model and re-training it on the new data with a small learning rate. This can potentially achieve significant improvements by incrementally adapting the pre-trained features to the new data.

Source: Nota AI

The second step the Compression Toolkit handles the compression process of the model which can be uploaded or selected from the NetsPresso model zoo. It supports all convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures of the two most popular deep learning frameworks PyTorch and Tensorflow thus eliminating the usual months spent implementing the technology.

The toolkit can be used to apply several methods to make the model lighter with minimal information loss. The two methods supported are 1) structured pruning and 2) filter decomposition. Briefly structured pruning concerns the removal of network group entities such as neurons layers or channels while filter decomposition is the study of representing filters as a combination of smaller matrices and tensors. The available techniques associated with the first group are index pruning L2 norm pruning geometric median pruning and nuclear norm pruning while those in the second group are Tucker and CP decomposition.

Often it can be not trivial for non-expert users to choose how to perform the correct compression. For this reason NetsPresso offers two solutions for assistance: the first is the Model Visualization feature which allows displaying the model layers as graphs in order for the user to be able to check the model configuration; the second is the Model Profiling feature which enables profiling models in layers and provides information that aid decision making regarding the compression configuration.

In addition if the user has still some doubt about the configuration after utilizing these two features NetsPresso also offers a powerful recommendation system to complete the configuration automatically along with the option to show the different compressed model versions.

Different ways to utilize NetsPresso

One of the most formidable features of NetsPresso is its modularity. Handling the three toolkits separately or in succession makes it possible to build several pipelines designed following your needs. A graphical representation of 5 potential use cases is shown in the image below. If you have a dataset you can search a model using Model Search based on it. After this step you can simply download the model or continue the pipeline. The model can be compressed using the Compression Toolkit (or not if you don’t need to) and passed to Model Packaging for deployment. But the starting point of this pipeline does not have to be the dataset; you can also start from your pre-trained model using NetsPresso for compression or even directly for the packaging.

Introducing Nota AI’s Edge Solutions

Through NetsPresso it is possible to build a customized pipeline to deploy your model on specific HW. But Nota AI also offers ready-to-use Edge solutions which can be directly integrated into your application. The two leading-edge AI-driven solutions they provide are DMS (driver monitoring system) and ITS (intelligent transportation system).

DMS

The former could be used to monitor the driver and detect drowsiness and distraction. In addition it also allows customization to process automatic adjustments. It has high real-time performance on low-cost edge devices such as CortexA53 and Ambarella CV25 and is available for various camera types such as IR RGB and hybrid IR-RGB. Last but not least it supports multiple types of installation positions on the car (windshield cluster and rear-view mirror).

Taking advantage of several indicators such as eye status head position and the number of yawns it is able to give an automatic alarm to warn the driver. Plus it can also be personalized to detect specific driver actions for example smoking or making a phone call.

ITS

The goal of ITS is to improve and make the transportation system safer. It can be integrated directly into devices and its applications are countless. For example smart cameras can monitor traffic in real-time while being very resilient to environmental conditions (weather and sunlight). Another type of device on which AI cameras can be deployed is traffic lights: through reinforcement learning ITS can optimize vehicle interactions especially in isolated intersections and road networks. Finally ITS can also be used for smart crossing and real-time incident prediction people detection parking lot monitoring and many others.

It further solidifies our long-term relationship with both QatarEnergy and Qatargas for whom we have been doing offshore projects to support the development of the country’s critical energy infrastructure for several decades.“To be involved in this flagship project a project which as McDermott we have been working on for several years via the FEED makes us all very proud” Gunnion said in an interview in Doha.Providing an overview of McDermott operations in Qatar he said “We continue with our clearly stated goal to become the largest standalone EPCI delivery organisation here in Qatar starting with the very earliest stages of project development (concept + Pre-FEED) via our IO (a joint venture between McDermott + Baker Hughes) team here in Doha through to full EPCI delivery including fabrication of offshore infrastructure in Qatar at our fabrication facility in Ras Laffan Industrial Complex – QFAB.“QFAB is a joint venture between Nakilat and McDermott. We continue to grow all the necessary project team and support organisations to materialize this vision. This now includes the ability to fully execute large complex offshore projects entirely from Qatar – from start to finish. This has required growth in our Burj Doha execution office for which we continue to recruit candidates locally mainly in the engineering field but we are looking at supply chain and business candidates as we stabilise and focus on execution excellence for our customers.”Operationally Gunnion noted “We are ramping up QFAB to start various projects during 2022 and will be up and running in a few months which is exciting to see. It truly is a first class facility and we look forward to fully harnessing her potential.”On the benefits of establishing QFAB Gunnion said: “The benefits are many as we work to broaden and strengthen the local supply chain to support energy projects in Qatar. Over and above the recruitment and training of several hundreds of skilled workers at various levels of expertise we are also heavily engaged with the local supply chain to support our operations.“The ability to locally source support materials and services is crucial to the successful operation of the yard. As these in-country services grow the ability to support more and more local development in the energy sector is a natural by-product. We are working hard to develop this long-term capability in Qatar.”Gunnion also highlighted McDermott’s focus on reducing emissions and managing the carbon footprint.He said: “As an EPC contractor in the energy industry we believe we are uniquely positioned to influence the full value chain of emissions starting with our own global fabrication construction and marine operations and working with our suppliers and customers to reduce their operating emissions. McDermott has published sustainability goals to reduce emissions in our own operations (scope 1 & 2) and our suppliers (upstream scope 3) and customers (downstream scope 3).“In line with our commitment to reduce supply chain emissions across 10 key categories we are actively engaged with key suppliers such as steel suppliers in identifying opportunities to lower the carbon intensity of their manufacturing process through sustainable solutionsIn January McDermott launched ‘ArborXD’ which gives the project the capability to estimate the lifecycle emissions of the operating facility and identify low emissions pathways through engineering design.Gunnion said: “The introduction of these monitoring and assessment tools at the earliest stages of projects allow us to be aware of our environmental impact and work to select solutions with long term gain. Of particular focus during the EPC lifecycle is the main GHG emitting phases of projects which are fabrication and offshore installation.“As we operate our own fabrication yards we are working to significantly reduce the GHG impact of our operations. McDermott has short term targets set around renewable energy as we actively work towards increasing our renewable energy usage through installation of onsite solar and accessing offsite renewable energy through energy attribute certificates (EACs) or power purchasing agreements (PPAs) where available.”,,,,,,,,,

MUNCIE Ind.—The Delaware Advancement Corporation City of Muncie and Muncie Sanitary District have awarded three individual contracts to E&B Paving 3D Construction and DC Construction Services to install a pedestrian trail repave Riverside Avenue and reconstruct the Riverside-Jackson Street Intersection. Each project includes extensive stormwater infrastructure improvements and will begin soon. Additionally Indiana American Water has begun upgrades to the water infrastructure along Riverside Ave between Brentwood Avenue and Timber Mill Way.

“After careful planning based primarily on the public input meetings in 2019 a broad community partnership has formed to address stormwater issues automobile travel speeds and traffic back-ups—all concerns of the public —that will further enhance the pedestrian trail being built along Riverside Avenue” said Elizabeth Rowray President of the Delaware Advancement Corporation.

The trail addition will connect Morrison Road to Tillotson Avenue/Ball State University including a new sidewalk connection to the Catalina Swim Club on Clarkdale Avenue.

The aggregate construction cost for the three projects is $2.25M.

Funding for each of the projects varies. Delaware Advancement Corporation was awarded a Department of Natural Resources Next Level Trail Grant and an East Central Indiana Regional Development Authority trail grant out of its funding from the Indiana Economic Development Corporation’s Regional Cities Initiative. The Muncie Sanitary District is funding the stormwater improvements through its stormwater utility program and the American Recovery Plan. Finally the City of Muncie is using an INDOT Community Crossings grant to cover road improvements at the Riverside and Jackson Street intersection.

FlatLand Resources and IXOYE engineering have been providing project management and design services for the projects. There is a substantial completion date of fall 2022 for the three projects.

A unique feature of this project is a road diet at the Jackson and Riverside intersection. One travel lane will be eliminated on Riverside that will help slow the travel speeds of vehicles at Jackson Street.

Given the scope of the project residents in this area of town should plan for construction inconveniences for several months once the project begins.

“This is Muncie at its best” said Rowray. “We are making ‘quality of place’ improvements in an area of town where owner occupied housing demand is high—an area lacking in safe pedestrian travel routes. We are closing gaps in Muncie’s incredible existing trail network. We are using limited local tax dollars to leverage state and federal financial resources. All of this is in response to public input gathered at the onset of the trail project.”

Dharmendra recalled the day he discovered his eldest daughter Hiteshi’s talent in shooting ball: “Kisi ne mujhe bataya ki aapki beti toh bahut achha khelti hai toh main uske school gaya aur peeche se chup chaap isko khelte dekha (After someone told me about her [Hiteshi] talent I went to her school and observed her game).” And the apple did not fall from the tree he quipped noting that Himanshi took to shooting ball like fish to water.

While initially supportive of his daughter Dharmendra was forced to ask her to quit for financial reasons. “He said: ‘Padhai karo itna kharch nahi utha sakte (Study now. We cannot afford [training for shooting ball])’” recalled Himanshi. A family of six sports has been an important part of the Chhikaras. Their eldest daughter Hiteshi had won medals in national and international-level shooting ball tournaments from 2002-2009 before settling down in Mumbai with a job in the Indian Railways.

Jhajjar: On 27 March a team of 12 women from Haryana won a silver medal in the National Women Shooting Ball competition held in Abohar Punjab. But for most of these women the path to the tournament was tough and one among them was 20-year-old Himanshi who hails from the Khedi Asra village of Haryana’s Jhajjar district. Daughter of a DTC (Delhi Transport Corporation) driver Himanshi was unsure if she would even be able to participate in the national-level tournament after her family hit a rough patch. However when the father was unable to pay the bills sports enthusiasts leaders and the village community stepped in to pave the way for the tournament for Himanshi.

Himanshi’s story is just one among the 12 girls who played for the Haryana shooting ball team. Of these 12 seven girls belong to the Jhajjar district. Besides Himanshi Sudha also hails from the Khedi Asra village. Pooja and Kajal belong to the adjacent Chhudani village. Kritika Deepika Anshu are from Dulheda village. While Kajal’s father works in Delhi Police the remaining girls’ fathers are daily wage workers. And several of them could not afford the costs of participating in the tournament.

“We were not doing well financially that’s why we had asked Himanshi to stop playing but then they came forward to help” said Dharmendra. The ‘they’ here refers to the girls’ coaches at the time — Balwan Sandeep Sangwan and Ramesh Hooda — former education minister of Haryana and MLA from Jhajjar Geeta Bhukkal Jai Prakash Kadian General Secretary of Shooting Ball Federation Haryana as well as villagers from the Khedi Asra village.

A village and the social support

According to Kadian the team received aid from several people — leaders and villagers. “Net ball kit — jo bhi zaruratein thi khiladiyon ki hum sabne milke madad ki kyunki jab itna achha khel rahi hai toh support toh milna hi chahiye (We helped the players with whatever help was needed. After all if they are playing so well then we must support them)” said Kadian. The federation also helped the girls in securing scholarships at schools and colleges. Each time the girls of Khedi Asra won a tournament the villagers welcomed them back with open arms and garlands. Especially the women were beaming with pride while speaking about the achievements of the young girls of their village.

Kadian especially made note of the support offered by Congress leader Geeta Bhukkal the MLA from Jhajjar. He also noted that the earlier Congress-ruled state government used to help athletes in need under former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda. When asked if there is enough support from the incumbent BJP government in the state Kadian said “Khiladi ki koi sarkaar nahi hoti (An athlete has no government)”.

However he highlighted the need for accreditation for shooting ball at the state level. He added that they have submitted a plea with the Haryana Sports Minister Sandeep Singh a two-time hockey Olympian for the same.

Shooting ball — the less costly volleyball

Similar to volleyball shooting ball is an indigenous sport of India. It is also comparatively less costly than its more famous counterpart. According to Himanshi the balls used for the two games are quite different. The ball used in shooting ball is made of soft leather and has a bladder inside. It weighs 320 gm for the men’s category and 270 gm for the women’s category. For service the player resorts to under-hand in shooting ball while in volleyball one sees a smash service.

It is believed to be a sport that belongs to the pre-Independence era. Initially it was played with a rope which was soon replaced by the net and the leather ball replaced the cloth ball according to Sports Authority of India’s (SAI) Manjushree Dayanand.

After the Shooting Ball Federation of India was established the first national championship was held in 1976 at Ambedkar Stadium Delhi. In 1985 the Shooting Ball Federation received recognition from the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports Government of India. Several tournaments are organised nationwide under the Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat initiative to promote indigenous sports of India. The central government also incorporated shooting ball among 20 new disciplines eligible for central government jobs under the sports quota in 2020.

It is still finding its place in the larger national space especially women teams. According to Nirmala Devi a villager from Khedi Asra and Himanshi’s aunt when her elder sister Hiteshi began playing the sport there was no female team for the game. Things are rapidly changing however. Several families are in fact encouraging their daughters to play. Kajal a 17-year-old student in Class 12 from Chhudani village wishes to continue the sport even after school. And her father Dashrath who works for the Delhi Police is extremely supportive of her sport.

“We never asked Kajal to quit. We’d rather want her to play for as long as she can” said Dashrath.

Shooting game — a distant cousin of volleyball (visibly) — is an indigenous sport of India. In comparison the sport is also cheaper than its more famous counterpart.

Although the two sports are similar in nature little differences make all the difference. According to Himanshi the balls used for the two games are quite different. The ball used in shooting ball is of soft leather with a bladder inside. It weighs 320 gm for the men’s category and 270 gm for the women’s category. For service the player resorts to under-hand service in shooting ball while in volleyball one sees a smash service.",,,,,,

America’s Federal Reserve has suffered a hair-raising loss of control. In March consumer prices were 8.5% higher than a year earlier the fastest annual rise since 1981. In Washington inflation-watching is usually the preserve of wonks in shabby offices. Now nearly a fifth of Americans say inflation is the country’s most important problem; President Joe Biden has released oil from strategic reserves to try to curb petrol prices; and Democrats are searching for villains to blame from greedy bosses to Vladimir Putin.

It is the Fed however that had the tools to stop inflation and failed to use them in time. The result is the worst overheating in a big and rich economy in the 30-year era of inflation-targeting central banks. The good news is that inflation may have peaked at last. But the Fed’s 2% target will remain a long way off—forcing agonising choices on the central bank. Apologists for America’s policymakers point to annual price rises of 7.5% in the euro area and 7% in Britain as evidence of a global problem driven by the soaring price of commodities especially since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Nearly three-quarters of the euro zone’s inflation is attributable to rocketing energy and food prices.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYXJsb3R0ZW9ic2VydmVyLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L211c2ljLW5ld3MtcmV2aWV3cy9hcnRpY2xlMjYwNTQxMzk3Lmh0bWzSAVhodHRwczovL2FtcC5jaGFybG90dGVvYnNlcnZlci5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9tdXNpYy1uZXdzLXJldmlld3MvYXJ0aWNsZTI2MDU0MTM5Ny5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: It took 2 years for Billy Joel to get to BofA Stadium.

It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

The redeveloped complex at the corner of Front and Summer streets called The Uptown after a movie theater that was once there will be reserved for residents who are 55 and older. In total it will add 50 rental units to 10 that were in the structure before it was redeveloped.

Forty-two of them will be for low-income renters according to the project’s developer The Szanton Company.

The housing shortage that’s affecting all Maine communities is particularly serious in the midcoast making it harder for workers in the region to find places to live. Among other communities trying to build more housing is St. George where voters will decide next week whether to give away town-owned land to build new homes.

The new development in Bath which will have a grand opening on Wednesday joins another project that Bath Housing has been working to develop at 520 Centre St. in recent years.

The first phase of the Bath Housing project will bring 18 rental units for low-income residents and the second phase is expected to include an additional 24 units of single-bedroom rentals for a range of incomes according to Executive Director Debora Keller.

Any additional housing will go a long way to easing the crisis Keller said.

She noted that The Uptown will help preserve the historic Moses and Columbia Block buildings which were constructed in 1893 and redeveloped for the project after Bath Housing acquired the properties in 2019 and sold them in 2022 to The Szanton Company.

The buildings have also hosted shops the movie theater and a YMCA over the years and they will continue to maintain six retail spaces now that they’ve been redeveloped. Keller says the new housing option will make it easier for residents to live within walking distance of a number of downtown amenities.

“I just think this is one of the neatest housing projects I’ve seen in years” Keller said.

Rental prices on the apartments will range from $794 to $1495 per month depending on residents’ income according to The Szanton Company. Most of the units are one-bedroom apartments while six of them are two-bedrooms.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocmlzdGlhbml0eXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jdC8yMDI0L2FwcmlsLXdlYi1vbmx5L2phenptZW4tbG91aXMtYXJtc3Ryb25nLWR1a2UtZWxsaW5ndG9uLWNvdW50LWJhc2llLXR5ZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Duke Ellington Read His Bible in the Bath,"“Does Jazz Put the Sin in Syncopation?” asked a 1921 Ladies Home Journal article. Whimsical wordplay aside the question would become a serious one for mid-century America as parsons and priests blamed jazz for soaring juvenile crime rates drugs and extramarital sex. A 1960 poll found that among Black preachers just 1 in 5 wanted to let jazz or blues into their services. Decades before a religion editor at the Pittsburgh Courier had denounced Louis Armstrong’s “sacrilegious desecration of Spirituals.” Duke Ellington’s music was “considered worldly” counseled the Rev. John D. Bussey explaining why the local 1966 Baptist Ministers Conference had unanimously passed his resolution opposing a performance.

But whatever commandments they were breaking—and there were plenty from slighting the Sabbath to serial adultery—Duke Louis and king of swing Count Basie all seemed to take the Christian faith they’d been raised in seriously. And that faith found its way into their music.

For Louis Armstrong the connection was there from the very beginning when he learned to sing in his mother’s Sanctified church. “The ‘whole ‘Congregation would be “Wailing—‘Singing like ‘mad and ‘sound so ‘beautiful” he wrote with his characteristic expressive idiosyncratic punctuation. “I’d have myself a ‘Ball in ‘Church especially when those ‘Sisters ‘would get ‘So ‘Carried away while ‘Rev’ would be ‘right in the ‘Middle of his ‘Sermon. ‘Man those ‘Church ‘Sisters would ‘begin ‘Shouting ‘So—until their ‘petticoats would ‘fall off. … My heart went into every hymn I sang” he added. “I am still a great believer and I go to church whenever I get the chance.”

With Saturday night performances that stretched into Sundays that wasn’t often. But nearly half a century later Armstrong released an album the church sisters would have loved Louis and the Good Book with gassed-up versions of spirituals including “Go Down Moses” and “Nobody Knows the Trouble I’ve Seen.” He recorded “When the Saints” the anthem of the Big Easy more than 100 times.

Count Basie was raised in the Black church too. Two of his uncles were ministers; his father was a founder and pillar of Pilgrim Baptist Church in Red Bank New Jersey. In oral histories and writings fellow musicians and friends use the word spiritual to describe what Basie brought to the band. Sideman Harry “Sweets” Edison compared their group to church organists and singers who inspire congregants to “get up to shout.” Basie was a spiritual presence offstage too. “Prior to eating he would do this elaborate silent prayer” recalls tenor saxophonist Eric Schneider. If the food came before he was finished “it was understood that we should go ahead and eat.”

Duke Ellington was perhaps the most pious of the three maestros. Growing up he attended two services each Sunday: African Methodist Episcopal Zion with his father Baptist with his mother. As a young man he consulted the Bible twice a day sometimes taking the book into the bathtub and reading until the water got cold. Though he shunned most jewelry he wore a gold crucifix around his neck and carried a St. Christopher medal in his hip pocket. His Christmas card bore a simple message in gold lettering: LOVE GOD.

In the last ten years of his life Ellington devoted himself to a series of sacred concerts performances that brought together jazz and classical music spirituals gospel and the blues. Suddenly he was getting more invitations to play in churches than in dance halls. Synagogues too. “These are things people don’t know about him” said singer-songwriter Herb Jeffries. “He had a great ministry. It was hidden in his music. … He was practicing his ministry moving about here and there making people happy!” When a reporter asked how he “as a religious man” could “play in dark dingy places where depravity and drunkenness reign” Ellington whispered “Isn’t that exactly what Christ did—went into the places where people were bringing light into darkness?”

He also pushed back against preachers who accused him of defiling their churches with his concerts. “Some people ask me what prompted me to write the music for the sacred concerts. I have done so not as a matter of career but in response to a growing understanding of my own vocation” Ellington wrote in his memoir. “I think of myself as a messenger boy one who tries to bring messages to people not people who have never heard of God but those who were more or less raised with the guidance of the church.” The sacred concerts this most accomplished of composers and bandleaders added were “the most important thing I have ever done.” They were important to audiences too. Take the girl who approached Ellington after one performance telling him “You know Duke you made me put my cross back on!”

Sacrilegious then isn’t the word to describe these jazzmen. Yes their faith was unorthodox and imperfect. But it also was warmly ecumenical and personally sustaining. You can hear it not just in their Christmas tunes but in all of their jazz music rooted in the gospels and Negro spirituals they grew up with. Their abiding belief in God all three maestros made clear is what emboldened and empowered them to write the soundtrack to the Civil Rights revolution to shape the soul of America.

According to his son Mercer Duke Ellington “was quite taken with the story of the ‘Juggler of Notre Dame.’” It’s a parable that applies to Armstrong and Basie too. “The man was a great juggler who would sneak into the church and juggle before the altar. As the story goes the priests found out about it and kicked him out. God intervened and told the priests to leave him alone. The man was celebrating His presence by using the gifts that He gave him.”

When we all were looking forward to the Britain in Bloom improvements for 2022 with great sadness we received the news that a number of the existing Ottery in Bloom team had decided to resign.

We thought a little bit of history would help to highlight the efforts of those who said Ottery 'doesn’t believe in standing still' and despite the setbacks from the weather and Covid-19 picked up a silver award for Ottery at the Britain in Bloom presentations in 2021.

In around 1996 the group finished up with just Roy Wright the pharmacist in Ottery Square and Roger Giles when the then chairman Paul Williams moved on.

The President at the time was Oliver William-Powlett. A new President was never appointed when Oliver died.

In the 1990’s the town entered Britain in Bloom and won a cup for the best small town in South West. The town also entered in 2001 and 2010.

Keith Spittlehouse joined Ottery in Bloom in 2004 when the team led by Sarah Clarke from Riverside Motors and Joy Richardson held a plant sale at the Old Boys School and Keith happened to pass by.

He was co-opted on to the committee and became Secretary in 2006 adding treasurer to his portfolio when Roy Wright died in 2015.

Keith resigned as Secretary in 2017 but continued as treasurer and along with Brian Nelson and John Maybery upgraded the planting and displays in town entering Britain in Bloom last year and becoming award winners.

Brian Nelson first got involved with Ottery in Bloom when he noticed plants in containers being grown in the garden of the old town council offices.

The next time he bumped into John Maybery he asked what the plants were for John explained they were for OIB and the difficulty of growing the plug plants on to the planting out stage outside.

Having two greenhouses Brian volunteered to help John out for several years John sourced the plug plants and they would pot on at Brian’s house then grow on half and John the other half.

At that stage Brian wasn't on the committee. On the agreed date for planting out around the first Tuesday in June the Guides Brownies and Rainbows met to help with the planting.

Brian would load his estate car several times and they would meet on the forecourt of the Fire Station to distribute them.

It was only in January 2018 that Keith invited Brian to a committee meeting and shortly after he became chairman.

John Maybery got involved after he moved back into Ottery in 1998.

When John started he was contracted to cut the grass at St Saviour’s and he looked after the shrub bed there and cut the beech hedge.

He also planted up the troughs on Tipton Bridge for a couple of years on behalf of the TC. Plants in those days were sourced from Jacksons at Combe Raleigh.

When they downsized they let OIB know Ball Colegrave was their supplier which OIB continued with.

So it’s fair to say that John has been around for a good 20 years.

We wish good luck to the new team. Who knows perhaps the more intensive long term steps towards creating an opportunity for more varied and diverse planting including edible planting options will encourage us to consider healthier eating habits.

In the meantime our gratitude goes to Keith Brian John all the OIB volunteers Rotary and Inner Wheel Clubs the Guides Brownies Rainbows Ottery Garden Centre and many others that for so many years gave their time to Ottery in Bloom.

Wishing them the best for the future on the knowledge that Ottery will always be grateful for the happiness and beauty they brought to this town.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiugFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVzb3V0aGFmcmljYW4uY29tL3Nwb3J0L3NvY2Nlci9wc2wtc291dGgtYWZyaWNhL3N0dWFydC1iYXh0ZXItd2lsbC1uZXZlci1jb2FjaC1rYWl6ZXItY2hpZWZzLWFnYWluLWRzdHYtcHJlbWllcnNoaXAtbmF0dXJlbmEtZXhjbHVzaXZlLXRyZW5kaW5nLXBzbC1yZXN1bHQtbGF0ZXN0LXRlYW0tbmV3cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stuart Baxter will NEVER coach Kaizer Chiefs again!,"It was clear from Kaizer Chiefs’ statement confirming the firing of coach Stuart Baxter that he will never be returning for a third stint.

It was clear from Kaizer Chiefs’ short statement confirming the firing of Stuart Baxter as Amakhosi coach this week that the 68-year-old Englishman will not ever be returning for a third stint at Naturena!

Fool me once shame on me. Fool me twice shame on you!

Kaizer Chiefs sacked Baxter on Thursday bringing to an end his second spell at the club which lasted just 10 months and 23 league matches.

READ | STUART BAXTER’S SACKING GOOD NEWS FOR ITUMELENG KHUNE?

Baxter’s win percentage in those matches (9 out of 23) actually isn’t that bad at 39%.

It was certainly more than his predecessor Gavin Hunt (21%).

The record is held by Baxter himself in his first stint at the club when he won an incredible 61% of his matches in charge.

READ | SUPERSPORT UNITED TO SACK UNVAXXED BAFANA BAFANA STAR!

However the manner in which Kaizer Chiefs’ statement ended in particular suggests there will be no third welcoming of Baxter.

Amakhosi signed off by saying: ‘We wish him well in the future’.

Which basically means “So long farewell. Good luck to whichever club hires you going forever but it won’t be Kaizer Chiefs ever again”.

Although Baxter is a true football man at heart there’s probably no desire on his part to return to Kaizer Chiefs.

The Englishman parted ways with the Glamour Boys on Thursday with the club confirming they agreed to mutually terminate his contract.







Zwane and Dillon Sheppard will be in charge of the team until the end of the season and have a first tough task in Stellenbosch ahead of them on Saturday.

The former Chiefs player has now spoken for a first time since Baxter left telling the club’s site it was “a knock” to see Baxter leave.

“It’s been quite difficult losing the head coach at a crucial time of the season. With football it’s the nature of the game these things do happen” he said.

“The remaining technical staff have been trying to encourage everyone to encourage the boys to give their best – knowing very well how equally important the remaining games are.

“We’re looking forward to the game in Cape Town against Stellenbosch and we are hopeful we can collect maximum points. Having said that it comes with that knock where one of our technical members our leader had to part ways with the club.

“We hope it won’t take its toll on our players but that it will give the boys some strength to look forward to get things going with the hope that things can get better and better.”

Chiefs will face Stellenbosch FC at 17:00 at the Dannie Craven Stadium on Saturday.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is on track to invest more than $33 billion in the space of 18 months.

This year the famed investor's company has plowed about $7 billion into Occidental Petroleum stock in 11 days and snapped up $4 billion of HP shares. Buffett also struck a deal to acquire Alleghany for $11.6 billion in under two weeks.

James Shanahan a senior equity analyst at Edward Jones expects a couple more deals to materialize over the next year. Berkshire is likely to spend about $4 billion to raise its ownership of Pilot Flying J to 80% in early 2023 he told Insider.

Moreover Buffett's company may soon buy the 8% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy owned by the family of Walter Scott Jr. a Berkshire director until his death last September. That would raise its ownership to over 99% Shanahan said.

If Berkshire shells out $33 billion that would exceed the $30 billion it piled into stocks in 2020 and dwarf the $8 billion it invested in equities last year (ignoring stock sales in both years).

It would also surpass the $25 billion it spent on share buybacks in 2020 and the $27 billion it plowed into repurchases last year.

Regardless Berkshire might still struggle to put a dent in its cash pile. The company generates about $33 billion of free cash flow every five quarters Shanahan told Insider.

""There is a good chance that Berkshire is still holding $150 billion in cash by mid-2023 unless there are additional investments"" he said.

Berkshire shares have climbed 14% this year bucking the S&P 500's 8% decline over the same period. Shanahan downgraded the stock to a ""hold"" rating this week asserting its current price already reflects the likelihood it outperforms its financial-services peers this year its recent strong earnings and its flurry of purchases.

The conglomerate owns scores of businesses including Geico See's Candies and the Burlington Northern Railway. It also holds multibillion-dollar stakes in Apple Coca-Cola Kraft Heinz and other public companies.

Buffett whose nickname is the ""Sage of Omaha"" is expected to field questions for several hours at Berkshire's yearly shareholder gathering in his hometown next week. The centibillionaire investor recently touted the event as a ""very very important meeting.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hcGxlc25ld3MuY29tL3N0b3J5L21vbmV5L3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlLzIwMjIvMDQvMjMvYnJpZWZzLzczNzIwMzgwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Briefs,"Naples Daily News

Despite his roughly $125.1 billion net worth according to Forbes the eight-wealthiest man in the world enjoys a life of simple taste frugal living and generous philanthropy. Here's a look at Warren Buffett's tips for living frugally.

1. Warren Buffett's House Is the Same One He Bought in 1958

Billionaires live in mansions right? Not Buffett.

He lives in the same residence in Omaha Neb. that he bought in 1958 for $31500 the equivalent of roughly $285000 in 2020 dollars. Buffett has no intention of putting his own home up for sale. ""I wouldn't trade it for anything"" he told CNBC earlier this year.

In today's money Buffett would have paid about $43 per square foot for the 6570-square-foot home. But these days the home is worth about $161 per square foot according to the home's current value listed by the tax assessor's office in Douglas County Nebraska where Buffett lives.

If you want to live like Buffett consider buying less home than you can afford. Instead of paying pricey mortgage payments you'll be able to put more of your money toward savings retirement or vacations.

And if you must take out a loan perhaps get a 30-year mortgage -- it's ""the best instrument in the world"" Buffett told CNBC. In fact Buffett took out a 30-year mortgage in 1971 when he bought a vacation home in Laguna Beach California.

""If you're wrong and rates go to 2% which I don't think they will you pay it off"" he said. ""It's a one-way renegotiation. It is an incredibly attractive instrument for the homeowner and you've got a one-way bet.""

2. Buffett Starts His Day With a Cheap Breakfast

You might assume billionaires brunch at the most extravagant restaurants ordering eggs Benedict and bottomless mimosas. Or they hire a personal chef who can whip up whatever and whenever they want -- right?

Wrong. Adopting Buffett's lifestyle doesn't include paying high prices for daily gourmet French toast prepared in the comforts of your own home.

Story continues

When it comes to food the billionaire investor has been known to save money by taking the fast-food route. In fact he might kick off his day with a trip to McDonald's during his five-minute drive to work reports CNBC.

If he's feeling rich he'll splurge by spending $3.89 on a bacon egg and cheese biscuit sandwich. If the market's down he might spend $3.19 on a sausage egg and cheese sandwich instead. On a really bad day he buys two sausage patties for $2.38 puts them together and washes it down with a Coke he pours himself.

Buffett also is known to opt for cheap food when he's on the road -- but forget the cholesterol-soaked bacon and eggs at a local restaurant. Buffett's travel breakfast might consist of a pack of Oreos his friend Bill Gates -- yes his good buddy is the Microsoft founder -- wrote on his blog.

""One thing that was surprising to learn about Warren is that he has basically stuck to eating what he liked when he was 6 years old"" Gates wrote. ""He did move past baby food of course but he mostly eats hamburgers ice cream and Coke.""

Buffett explained his diet in a 2015 interview with Fortune: ""I checked the actuarial tables and the lowest death rate is among 6-year-olds. So I decided to eat like a 6-year-old. It's the safest course I can take.""

3. Buffett Buys Reduced-Price Cars

Although some CEOs drive around in million-dollar cars you'll likely find Buffett driving something much more modest.

In a BBC documentary his daughter Susie Buffett said he bought cars that he could get at reduced prices -- like those that had been damaged by hail. The cars were fixed and didn't look hail-damaged and became a regular part of the Buffett lifestyle.

""You've got to understand he keeps cars until I tell him 'This is getting embarrassing -- time for a new car'"" said his daughter in the documentary.

Buffett also told Forbes in 2014 about his car-buying habits -- or lack thereof. ""The truth is I only drive about 3500 miles a year so I will buy a new car very infrequently"" he said.

Remember this the next time you're in the market for a car: Cars tend to depreciate quickly so it can be better for your finances if you try to keep your well-working car for as long as possible -- or at least opt to buy a used car instead of new.

4. Buffett Enjoys Affordable Hobbies

A commitment to live like Warren Buffett doesn't mean all work and no play. After all even billionaires have hobbies. But compared to other famous CEOs investors and entrepreneurs Buffett's hobbies are much more affordable. For example he enjoys playing bridge.

""If I play bridge and a naked woman walks by I don't even see her"" laughed Buffett during a CBS News ""Sunday Morning"" interview. Yep Buffett is a self-proclaimed bridge addict and you might even catch him playing the game about 8 hours a week according to a Washington Post interview from 2017.

""I one time said that I wouldn't mind going to jail if I had the right three cellmates so we can play bridge all the time"" he also said in the interview.

When Buffett's not busy being a business mogul you might find him strumming his ukulele and singing as well. He's played for investors and at charity events. A video of him playing the instrument with Gates even went viral after it was posted on Gates' blog in 2016.

5. Buffett Treats His Friends Well but Not Extravagantly

What do you give a friend who's also a billionaire? Buffett's long-standing friendship with Gates is legendary. In honor of Buffett's 90th birthday the Microsoft magnate explained on his blog what's kept their friendship strong over the years:

""Of all the things I've learned from Warren the most important thing might be what friendship is all about"" Gates wrote. ""A person that I admire as well as like -- that's the perfect description of how I feel about Warren. Happy birthday my friend.""

And Buffett didn't earn Gates' gratitude through grandiose and expensive gestures. Instead it's simply about how he treats others. In his 2016 blog post Gates gave examples of how Buffett is a kind and thoughtful friend such as driving personally to the airport to pick up Gates whenever he's in Buffett's hometown town calling frequently and sending news clippings by mail that he thinks Gates and his wife will enjoy.

Those special touches that mean a lot to friends just might be the best takeaway for those seeking to live the Warren Buffett lifestyle.

6. Buffett Used a Nokia Flip Phone Long After Smartphones Existed

Buffett likely won't be shelling out big money for the newest iPhone even though he's now using one. The billionaire revealed in a February 2020 CNBC Squawk Box interview that he has been given several iPhones including by Tim Cook.

He stated the Nokia flip phone which he had held on to for years is permanently gone and he now uses the newest model iPhone which was an iPhone 11 at the time of the interview.

While it's tempting to always splurge on the latest technology take a page from Buffett's book and only upgrade your phone when you really need to. If you insist on buying the latest iPhone to hit the market look for other ways to save on your phone expenses such as using a no-contract phone plan or buying a family plan to share data.

7. Buffett Doesn't Splurge on Designer Suits

Buffett shuns high-end designer suits. Instead he exclusively wears suits created by a Chinese sewing entrepreneur named Madam Li whom he met in 2007.

""They fit perfectly"" he said of the suits in a 2017 CNBC interview. ""We get compliments on them. It's been a long time since I got compliments on how I looked but since I am wearing Madame Li's suits I get compliments all the time.""

The takeaway: Opt for quality goods that will last you a long time rather than buying something just because it has a brand name attached to it.

8. Buffett Clips Coupons

Buffett proves that even billionaires still appreciate an opportunity to save money. In Bill and Melinda Gates' 2017 annual letter Bill recalled a trip he took with the investor during which Buffett paid for their fast-food lunch using coupons. He even provided photographic proof of this.

""Remember the laugh we had when we traveled together to Hong Kong and decided to get lunch at McDonald's? You offered to pay dug into your pocket and pulled out ... coupons!"" Bill wrote. ""Melinda just found this photo of me and 'the big spender.' It reminded us how much you value a good deal.""

Save on your next purchase -- even if it's something as inexpensive as a McDonald's meal -- by using applicable discounts which you can easily find on online coupon sites.

9. Buffett Has Worked in the Same Office Building for More Than 50 Years

Buffett has remained in the same office building since he joined Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s.

""It's a different sort of place"" Buffett said of the company's Omaha headquarters in the 2017 HBO documentary ""Becoming Warren Buffett"" CNBC reports. ""We have 25 people in the office and if you go back it's the exact same 25. The exact same ones. We don't have any committees at Berkshire. We don't have a public relations department. We don't have investor relations. We don't have a general counsel. We just don't go for anything that people do just as a matter of form.""

Even if you're not a business owner you can still benefit from Buffett's way of thinking. It boils down to the old saying: If it ain't broke don't fix it.

10. Buffett Thinks Outside the Box To Save Money

In Roger Lowenstein's biography of the businessman ""Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist"" the author says that after Buffett's first child was born he converted a dresser drawer into a space for the baby to sleep instead of spending money on a bassinet reports Forbes. When it came to the family's second child he borrowed a crib rather than buying one.

Perhaps making your baby sleep in a drawer seems a little extreme but it's just an example of thinking outside the box. Use resources that are already available to you to prevent unnecessary spending.

11. Buffett Values Relationships Over Material Things

Buffett explained his choice to live frugally during a 2009 Q&A session he conducted with a group of business school students.

""You can't buy health and you can't buy love"" said Buffett according to the Underground Value blog. ""I'm a member of every golf club that I want to be a member of [...] I'd rather play golf here with people I like than at the fanciest golf course in the world. [...] I'm not interested in cars and my goal is not to make people envious.""

And in a 2017 interview with People Susie Buffett said of her father: ""...it's really true that he does not care about having a bunch of money."" Instead she said he emphasizes family.

""I don't think people realize he's got a bunch of great-grandchildren and he could tell you everything about what they're all doing. He knows every one of those kids and he knows about their lives"" she said.

We’ve got a roundup of the titles that we’re most excited about right here. In celebration of the event Meta has slashed prices on several VR games that see discounts only on a few occasions each year. So whether you just bought a Quest 2 or you just want to fill out your library a little more check out these deals.

I’ve highlighted a few deals that I think are particularly good:

Photo: Dan Seifert / The Verge

In case you’re in the market for a compact yet capable smart speaker Google’s Nest Audio may fit the bill. Normally $99.99 this model is price-reduced at Google’s Store as well as at Best Buy and Walmart to $79.99.

As someone who got a little tired of reserving counter space for a giant Google Home Max the upgrade (or downgrade technically) to the smaller Nest Audio was a smart move for me. It provides crisp sound that can get loud without degradation to its low or high-end delivery so I’m not missing that more powerful speaker as much as I thought I would. Read our full review of the Nest Audio by Dan Seifert.

Best Buy is hosting a slew of Earth Day promotions that aim to get you into one of its stores with your old computer accessories in tow. And there’s good reason to if you have the chance this weekend as the retailer will give you one 20 percent off coupon toward a new Logitech accessory like its excellent Logitech StreamCam or the G435 wireless gaming headset when you hand over an old PC or gaming accessory. This in-store offer ends on May 6th. You can read the details here.

Also at Best Buy you can trade in your old modem router or modem/router combo to receive a 15 percent discount on a new model. This is another in-store-only offer and unfortunately Google’s networking products are excluded from the deal. Though it should help you get a great price on a product from other recommended brands in the space like Eero Orbi and others. Details are here.

Lastly for Best Buy’s in-store Earth Day promos you can take any hard drive or SSD to the retailer for recycling and receive a coupon that’ll knock 10 percent off the cost of a Western Digital or SanDisk Professional hard drive. Note that these are high-capacity disk drives and not speedy SSDs. Still it could be worth it if you need some extra storage for big files. Here are the details and here are the eligible models that can be discounted.

Google Nest’s battery-powered Doorbell is seeing a major discount and it’s happening at Amazon and other retailers. Normally $179.99 for this slender model you can pick one up for $149.99 in various colors. This might be a great product for first-time smart doorbell owners. To that end my colleague Dan Seifert praised its great people and package-detecting capabilities as well as its longer-than-average battery life.

Though this battery-powered option leaves a few features on the table compared to prior generations. Namely it shoots at a lower resolution and it lacks 24/7 continuous recording. Still this deal lessens the sting of those flaws. Read our full review.

But in a sea of look-alike black boxes deciding which is right for you can require learning some terminology. That's why I like Polk's new Signa S4: It’s the Volvo station wagon of soundbars—simple and boring and it does exactly what you need.

It might not leap out as a great option at first plus it's a bit spendy at $399 but after a few weeks of listening to this soundbar and subwoofer combo it's now the system I recommend for anyone looking for an easy audio upgrade. Don’t want to mess around with satellite speakers tricky menus or quite frankly any setup? The Signa S4 just might be for you.

Out of the Box

The new Polk soundbar is a black fabric-wrapped stick that’s about 3 inches high 4 inches deep and 41 inches long easily slim enough to fit below the bezel of every TV I tested it with. It comes with a wireless subwoofer (wireless in that it only needs to be connected to a wall outlet) a small black box that’s easy to hide wherever the power source is most convenient.

Polk Audio Signa S4 subwoofer Photograph: Polk Audio

Once you’ve placed the soundbar below your TV the subwoofer near an outlet and plugged them both into a power source all you need to do is plug the included HDMI cable into the HDMI ARC (audio return channel) port on your TV; most modern TVs have an HDMI port labeled as “ARC.” The soundbar should automatically connect and be ready to play—at least that’s how it worked on the various Vizio and LG TVs I tested it with.

If it doesn't just instantly work you may have to set it up in your TV's audio settings menu under “ARC settings” especially if your set is older. If you don’t have an ARC HDMI port don't fret! You can also use the Signa S4's optical input to grab high-quality digital sound. (It comes with both optical and HDMI cables.) Universal mounting holes on the back make it easy to put below a wall-mounted TV but I tested the S4 on a wide TV stand.

This simplicity extends to the remote too. You can pick between Music Film and Night mode settings (denoted by clip art on the buttons). Otherwise you’ve got volume controls and bare-bones EQ adjustment for bass. Night mode limits the bass so you don’t annoy your neighbors watching Keanu Reeves movies at 3 am. My only gripe? I wish the buttons had a backlight—it's hard to know what you're pressing in a dark room.

Atmos Sound

It might look like a super-basic 2.1 soundbar but the Signa S4 is plenty powerful under the hood. It can do digital surround sound by bouncing audio off the walls of your room but it’s also capable of Dolby Atmos object-based surround sound thanks to two up-firing speakers that bounce audio off the ceiling.

You won’t hear the same level of immersion that you’d get from a system with dedicated surround speakers and more drivers in the bar like the much pricier Samsung HW-Q950A but the Signa S4 delivers significantly better sound quality than its peers without Atmos capability. You’ll hear some audio behind you and sound spread out farther to the sides which really helps pull you into the action when watching sports playing FIFA 22 or catching up on the latest episode of Halo.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9vdmVyLTcwMDAwMC1haXItZnJ5ZXJzLXJlY2FsbGVkLWFmdGVyLWNoaWxkLW90aGVycy1odXJ0LWZpcmUtbWVsdGluZy0xNzAwMzQ30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Over 700000 Air Fryers Recalled After Child Others Hurt by Fire Melting,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.newsweek.com/over-700000-air-fryers-recalled-after-child-others-hurt-fire-melting-1700347 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9vdmVyLTcwMDAwMC1haXItZnJ5ZXJzLXJlY2FsbGVkLWFmdGVyLWNoaWxkLW90aGVycy1odXJ0LWZpcmUtbWVsdGluZy0xNzAwMzQ30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRhdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2dvb2dsZS1waXhlbC01LWFsdGVybmF0aXZlcy0xMTYzMjk3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google Pixel 5 alternatives: Galaxy S21 OnePlus 9 iPhone 13 more!,"David Imel / Android Authority

When launched the Google Pixel 5 was a good smartphone at a reasonable price. It sacrificed a bit of power on paper to deliver a lower price 5G and flagship-level features in other areas. The only issue is that the phone is aging and is now harder to find especially if you want it new. Maybe it’s time to finally let it go and get one of the best Google Pixel 5 alternatives instead.

We’ll be listing the phones that make the most sense as Pixel 5 alternatives in this post. All of these should offer similar price points features and specifications. Let’s dive right in. Our take: Google Pixel 5 review

Editor’s note: We will regularly update this list of the best Google Pixel 5 alternatives around.

1. Google Pixel 6

Robert Triggs / Android Authority

Improved design and build quality.

Much better overall specs and performance.

MSRP is lower! If you’re a fan of the Pixel 5 why not get the next best thing? The Google Pixel 6 is one of the best Google Pixel 5 alternatives for a few main reasons. Likely the most important factor to consider is the price as the base Pixel 6 version is pretty affordable. Its MSRP starts at just $599 which is less than the $699 MSRP the Pixel 5 costed at launch.

You’ll also have to factor in all the improvements Google made with its latest devices. The Pixel 6 design experienced a major aesthetics revamp featuring a more premium glass and aluminum build. The design is much more colorful and fun. It also makes no sacrifices on performance as it’s the first phone to come with a capable Google Tensor chip. The camera is as good as you would expect a Pixel shooter to be. Read: Google Pixel 6 review

The Pixel 6 is a much better phone overall and it comes at a lower price than the Pixel 5 did. You won’t regret going with the latest from Google. If you want something even better and don’t mind paying extra the Pixel 6 Pro also has a larger screen bigger battery and improved specs.

Google Pixel 6 See price at Best Buy

2. Google Pixel 5a

Jimmy Westenberg / Android Authority

It’s the most similar to the Pixel 5.

Significantly cheaper.

Includes 5G speeds and an IP67 rating. The Google Pixel 6 series is excellent but maybe you want something more similar to the Pixel 5 experience. Nothing gets closer to the Pixel 5 than the Google Pixel 5a. It’s also significantly more affordable considering its $449 MSRP. While we think the Pixel 6 offers more value per dollar a $150 difference can make a difference for those on a tight budget.

The Google Pixel 5a has been the best offering in Google’s A-series lineup. It’s the first to offer an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance. It’s identical to the Pixel 5 in terms of SoC memory and camera setups. Performance and battery life are outstanding for the price and the device supports 5G data speeds. Also: Google Pixel 5a review

Overall there’s very little to complain about with the Pixel 5a. We wish it had a higher-end processor and higher screen refresh rates but those improvements would have probably increased the price significantly.

Google Pixel 5a See price at Amazon Save $54.00

3. OnePlus 9

Robert Triggs / Android Authority

More powerful processor for advanced games and apps.

Faster wired and wireless charging.

Available in many major markets. The OnePlus 9 isn’t the biggest leap in the brand’s smartphone history but you’re still getting a good flagship phone for just a little bit more than the Pixel 5 in the US ($729 MSRP). It matches the Pixel device by packing 5G and 128GB of base storage and upgrading the screen to 120Hz over 90Hz.

OnePlus’ phone steps things up over the Google flagship by offering a more powerful Snapdragon 888 chipset 65W wired charging (versus 18W charging) a slightly bigger battery and higher resolution primary and selfie cameras. OnePlus also offers three Android version updates to its flagships in line with Google. Read more: OnePlus 9 review

Google’s phone does have a few upsides compared to the OnePlus 9 though such as an IP rating and a reputation for better camera quality. Meanwhile the Pixel 5 offers IP68 water and dust resistance.

If you don’t mind spending a bit more you might want to look at the newer OnePlus 10 Pro. It’s significantly more expensive than the Pixel 5 (and most other phones on this list) but it might be worth the upgrade.

4. Samsung Galaxy S21 FE

Eric Zeman / Android Authority

Great Samsung design.

High-end specs on a mid-tier budget.

Large battery. Samsung’s Galaxy S21 FE is the best way to dip your phone into One UI and save money in 2022. It comes in at just $699 MSRP making it one of the best value-per-dollar offerings coming from Samsung. Especially considering everything you get from this device.

Samsung managed to create a relatively affordable high-end smartphone without sacrificing much. Specs include a powerful Snapdragon 888 a 6.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate up to 8GB of RAM a 4500mAh battery and a pretty capable camera system. More: Samsung Galaxy S21 FE review

All of those inclusions are worthy of phones that cost over $1000. We’re confident to say this is definitely one of the best Pixel 5 alternatives and it’s actually a much better offering for a similar price.

5. Apple iPhone 13

Eric Zeman / Android Authority

Ticks many boxes for a flagship (powerful water resistance wireless charging)

Apple tends to support its iPhones for roughly five years.

Available in a wide variety of locales. The iPhone 13 is one of the best Google Pixel 5 alternatives… if you don’t mind switching to iOS. The two phones share features like water resistance wireless charging and a dual rear camera setup (main+ultra-wide). More: Eight things iOS does better than Android

The iPhone 13 differs thanks to its use of the iOS platform in place of Android while also offering a more powerful processor that dukes it out with the best Android chipsets. Otherwise Apple’s device lacks a high refresh rate display (unless you go for one of the Pro versions) and fingerprint unlock so the choice might not be clear-cut for many.

Like the idea of an iPhone but want to go even cheaper? Then the $699 iPhone 13 Mini or $429 iPhone SE 2022 are for you. The former is just a smaller iPhone 13 while the latter strips back some features for the sake of affordability. The iPhone SE may have a dated design LCD screen and single rear camera but it does bring wireless charging water resistance fingerprint unlock and Apple’s flagship A15 Bionic processor.

6. Xiaomi 12

Eric Zeman / Android Authority

Flagship horsepower.

Big battery and fast charging.

Comes with a gorgeous 120Hz display. Are you looking to give Xiaomi a try? Then you’ve also got a great Pixel 5 alternative in the Xiaomi 12. For starters you get a powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 which is second to none in today’s industry. It also comes with 8-12GB of RAM and up to 256GB of storage.

Xiaomi’s handset also packs a triple rear camera (50MP main 13MP ultrawide and 5MP telephoto macro) 8K recording and a 32MP selfie camera. The battery is also pretty large at 4500mAh but what’s more impressive is its charging speeds. The device can handle 67W wired charging and a whopping 50W with wireless charging. Here: Our thoughts on the Xiaomi 12

It’s not as readily available in the US as Google’s phones but if you want an ultra-fast phone that should last a while this is worth considering as an import.

7. Samsung Galaxy A53

Ryan Haines / Android Authority Galaxy A53 5G

Large crisp fluid display.

Large battery and 25W wired charging.

5G support on a budget. Samsung’s mid-range Galaxy A53 is a solid competitor to the Pixel 5 on several fronts. It’s the larger of the two devices and it packs a bigger battery. Both phones can achieve all-day battery life and you can take your pick between One UI and the breezy Pixel skin. Read more: The best 5G phones you can buy right now

The Galaxy A53 also packs a quad-camera array. Other specs include a Super AMOLED 120Hz panel up to 8GB of RAM and up to 256GB of storage. Not to mention aesthetics which Samsung is known for. It’s overall deserving as one of our favorite Pixel 5 alternatives and it offers far more value than the previous Galaxy A phones.

You’ll also love the huge 5000mAh battery and faster 25W charging. All things considered you’re getting a lot for the $449 starting MSRP in the USA.

8. ASUS Zenfone 8

Eric Zeman / Android Authority

Stands among the best small flagship phones much like the Pixel 5.

Simple glass and metal slab design.

Packs the powerful Snapdragon 888 chipset. ASUS may have ditched the flip-up selfie camera for the Zenfone 8 but it’s still a worthy small flagship alternative. While the design and camera options won’t thrill you the internals are tough to beat.

You’ll find Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 chipset tucked away onboard along with up to 16GB of RAM. Storage tops out at 256GB non-expandable but at least you get a headphone jack. ASUS added plenty of top flagship features yet it’s the omissions that might have you scratching your head. Also read: ASUS Zenfone 8 review

Condensates are membraneless organelles formed by the concentration of collaborative biomolecules such as transcription factors and DNA. The first condensate was described in 1835 and dubbed the nucleolus since it speckled the nucleus (1). Although we know now that the nucleolus is a liquid filled bag of translational machinery including rRNA and protein and the site where protein pumping machines known as ribosomes are made and assembled no one paid the nucleolus much attention until 1950 when an understanding of its function started to emerge. The term “condensate” wasn’t coined until nearly 60 years later.

In 2008 during a course at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cliff Brangwynne a biophysicist at Princeton University and his students noticed that RNA in fertilized worm embryos aggregated and dissociated into droplets; it was like looking into a cellular lava lamp. These condensates now known as P granules which contain specific germline RNA in worm eggs inspired Brangwynne to pen a letter to Science about how P granules might form via a phenomenon called liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) where biomolecules like rRNA and proteins coalesce into a liquid like droplet resembling wax in a lava lamp (2).

“It’s not a crazy new idea; it just wasn’t deployed in biology. It’s actually a property of polymers and remarkably biologists like me had simply not studied that fundamental polymer chemistry and physics that would have told us that the three key biopolymers DNA RNA and protein tend to form these condensates. It’s a basic property of matter that math and physics would predict” said Richard Young a condensate researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and co-founder of Dewpoint Therapeutics.

But few others felt inspired by the application of this basic concept in physics at least at first. In 2011 Brangwynne published a more detailed description of how LLPS may drive the formation of condensates (3). And the next year Michael Rosen a biophysicist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center reported in Nature that his team had replicated these proteinaceous lava lamps in a test tube by using signaling proteins (4).

A flurry of research followed suggesting that condensates have their hand in everything from transcription to neuronal signaling. Growing evidence even shows that drugs can’t always penetrate condensates to reach targets that reside inside which decreases their efficacy (4). And sometimes drugs concentrate in the wrong condensate causing unwanted side effects. New biotech companies like Dewpoint Therapeutics and Nereid Therapeutics have emerged in the past five years to design better drugs that localize to the right condensate.

“I firmly believe that targeting condensates is going to change the way we think about developing drugs and really change the way we think about human disease” said Isaac Klein chief scientific officer of Dewpoint Therapeutics.

Defining a condensate

Klein became disenchanted with the cancer drug discovery process after beginning his oncology fellowship about five years ago. He noticed that most drugs were designed for a small subset of patients with a specific mutation. He wondered if there was a way to design drugs that targeted a more conserved disease mechanism across more patients.

“When I heard about condensates I realized that they provide a way of attacking the most important undruggable targets. And they allow us to think about how the cell integrates multiple signaling abnormalities into one” said Klein. “It’s exactly the opposite of how all cancer biologists and the entire cancer drug discovery community think about developing drugs. I thought ‘wow that’s a much more powerful approach to help cancer patients than any other.'

Klein decided to leave the clinic to join the academic world to study condensates. He joined Young’s lab and soon published a paper in Science that reported that some cancer drugs localize in nuclear condensates which can positively or negatively affect their efficacy (4).

In this study Klein and Young tagged two chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin and tamoxifen so that they could watch how the drugs interacted with condensates composed of transcription factors and DNA.

Cisplatin accumulated in condensates that contained the transcriptional coactivator Mediator Complex Subunit 1 (MED1) while it simply diffused through other transcriptional condensates. Cisplatin which kills cancer cells by binding DNA and blocking transcription was more active in MED1-containing condensates as well.

The researchers found a biological basis for cisplatin’s preference. MED1 contains many aromatic amino acids which possess a type of carbon arrangement that forms a decentralized ring of electrons. These aromatic amino acids attracted other molecules including cisplatin that contain aromatic rings exemplifying how drugs could be chemically modified to preferentially accumulate in a particular condensate. This could make drugs more effective and limit unintended side effects wreaked by unsuspecting small molecule drugs stumbling into the wrong condensate.

Young and his team also discovered how a common cancer mutation may prevent tamoxifen from effectively localizing in its target-containing condensates. Tamoxifen targets a protein commonly overexpressed in breast cancer estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) for degradation. The researchers discovered that when tamoxifen enters condensates containing ERa it evicts the protein. But when an ERa protein containing a mutation known to cause tamoxifen resistance was present in the condensate tamoxifen was evicted instead. Tamoxifen then concentrated into MED1- containing droplets which unlike cisplatin made the drug less effective.

This landmark study is part of the basis of Dewpoint Therapeutics’ strategy to create new drugs and manipulate existing drugs to target the right condensate.

“Now that we know that small molecules can distribute within cells in a way that they either simply passively transfer through condensates they’re excluded or they concentrate we can modify small molecules so that they have this selective property of concentrating in the condensate where their target lies” said Young.

Designing drugs with condensates in mind

Dewpoint Therapeutics isn’t only interested in cancer. In addition to oncology they are investigating drugs in neuromuscular disease cardiac disease and virology. They’ve teamed up with several well-established pharma companies like Pfizer Merck and Bayer to accomplish their lofty goals. They’ve developed a broad platform to discover which diseases are condensate related and what malfunctioning condensates could be targeted in disease.

“Many different mutations and expression level changes in seemingly disparate proteins can all impact the function of one condensate. So by addressing a single condensate rather than by addressing the many alterations that occur in different proteins you can potentially address a much greater patient population with one molecule rather than dividing it up into a whole bunch of subpopulations and then pursuing a drug discovery campaign for those individually” said Klein.

Dewpoint Therapeutics is developing condensate-directed drugs for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Although many people with ALS have different disease-causing mutations in a variety of proteins 97% of patients have mislocalized aggregates of the RNA processing factor known as trans-activating response element DNA-binding protein of 43kDa (TDP43) in some of their neurons (6). This aggregation affects the function and formation of TDP43-containing nuclear condensates (7).

“By targeting the condensate you can treat all of the patients regardless of the etiology of their disease. This is in direct contrast to the more common more predominant drug discovery strategy which is ‘oh they have a mutation let’s target that.’ That’s predominantly failed” said Klein.

Dewpoint Therapeutics isn’t the only new biotech company with their eyes on condensates. Other companies such as Faze Medicines Transition Bio and Nereid Therapeutics have emerged in the last couple of years and are gearing up to develop condensate-targeted therapies each with their own unique spin.

“Most of our competitor companies are either very focused on particular disease areas or technologies and haven’t taken this very broad platform approach” said Klein.

Nereid Therapeutics takes a more technology-based physics driven approach. The company was co-founded by Brangwynne who identified and established LLPS as a driving force behind condensate formation.

“The approach that we are taking is a very biophysically based approach. Some folks in the field are taking a more descriptive approach whereas our approach is more quantitative” said John Reilly chief scientific officer of Nereid Therapeutics.

Spiros Liras chief executive officer of Nereid Therapeutics said that their approach really is a “marriage of physics with cellular biology.” They plan on using optogenetics to visualize the formation of condensates through LLPS which will allow them to understand how this process is affected in disease and how therapeutics can target this physics-driven process. (It will also produce the ultimate biological lava lamp.)

“It actually allows us to visualize the formation of these droplets and consider what their function is and what quantitatively influences it. It’s a different way to actually do drug discovery. It’s not really about targeting a specific target with inhibition or activation. It’s more about understanding what happens in the reaction in the cell” said Liras.

Gary Karpen a condensate biologist from the University of California Berkeley who is not involved in any of the new condensate biotech start-ups is excited to see how these new companies will move condensate research from the bench to the clinic.

“The issue is what is it you're trying to target? Is it a good thing to target the solution of this particular condensate? All the companies need to demonstrate that they can find ways to manipulate formation or dissolution of these condensates in a way that's useful for disease therapeutics. That's going to be challenging” said Karpen.

Liras thinks that it can be done. He views the other biotech start-ups popping up left and right as fellow travelers on a journey to bring condensate-based therapeutics to patients although they are taking different paths.

“It’s reassuring that there’s not just one company in it and yet the field has not grown to the point yet where it’s saturated. I think there’s a lot of opportunity for all the companies to bring to the forefront what is a novel approach for drug discovery” said Reilly.

The world’s largest asset manager Blackrock Inc is planning to launch its first China ETF product in Q4 2022 Reuters says citing people related to the matter. Blackrock will be the first wholly-owned foreign fund manager to tap the onshore Chinese ETF market the news agency added. On February 10 BlackRock disclosed ownership of over 64 million shares of NIO valued at $2.03 Billion as of December 31 2021 — being the Institution with the second largest position after Baillie Gifford & Co.

According to the people that talked with Reuters the fund manager hasn’t decided yet which index to track for the first ETF product. Options under consideration include a carbon neutrality-themed index composed by China Securities Index Co one of the people told Reuters. China has seen dozens of environment-linked ETF launches in the last two years betting on buoyant new-energy stocks.

“Options under consideration include a carbon neutrality-themed index composed by China Securities Index Co one of the people said. China has seen dozens of environment-linked ETF launches in the last two years betting on buoyant new-energy stocks.”

“BlackRock is committed to helping more Chinese investors achieve their financial goals by bringing them a broader suite of investment products and solutions including ETF and index investments” — the company said in a statement to Reuters.

Blackrock increased its position on NIO during the last quarter of 2021 via iShares ETFs. The company responsible for iShares ETFs is BlackRock which acquired the brand and business from Barclays in 2009. Blackrock created the first world’s first index strategy more than 30 years ago. Currently 25 out of the 392 ETFs that iShares has have a stake on the US-listed Chinese EV maker NIO.

NIO and WWF announced on Friday that reached a strategic cooperation on Clean Parks ecological co-construction. Clean Parks is a global ecological co-construction plan initiated by NIO to implement the vision of Blue Sky Coming. It is also the world’s first open platform initiated by an automobile company to support the construction of national parks and protected areas — the EV maker said.

Earlier this week a white NIO ET7 Model was seen charging in Munich Germany. The vehicle was using a charger from EWE Go Station a German subsidiary of the fifth-largest energy supplier in the country EWE AG. On January 22 NIO’s founder William Li and Manager of NIO Norway Marius Hayle revealed that the ET7 Model will arrive to Norway during Q4. The model has seen a great demand in the Chinese market having a 6 months waiting list for the sedan unveiled on January 2021 during NIO Day.

On April 19 a leaked image unveiled that BMW shooted the promotion video for its 2021 X4M model… using a NIO ES6. The German automaker is one of the main rivals for the Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO in Europe. By the end of May NIO will launch a new SUV model named NIO ES7 that will rival with the 2022 BMW X5 in the Chinese Market.

If a firm could announce juicy profits healthy cashflow and a perky dividend at the annual general meeting ( AGM ) applause was assured and few hard questions would be asked. But in recent years these meetings have shifted from routine talk of balance-sheets to loud battles over companies’ broader purpose. Where once it was enough for bosses to nod to some vague notion of “stakeholder capitalism” now some investors demand that they present detailed strategies on everything from the environment to racial justice and even abortion. More too are highlighting the dissonance between companies’ stated values and their political donations. Shareholders at American firms face a record volume of proposals on environmental and social issues: 576 resolutions as of April 12th up from 499 last year. In the coming weeks an unprecedented number will be put to a vote.

This reflects investors’ growing and understandable interest in mitigating risks that could threaten a wide variety of firms such as climate change. It is also a side-effect of gridlock in Washington. Frustrated at the near-impossibility of getting bills through Congress many activists are seeking change by passing motions at AGM s instead. This year the number of climate-related proposals faced by American firms has jumped by more than 40%. This is not the only lever that environmentalists can pull. In Europe they are increasingly using the courts to sway fossil-fuel firms and other big emitters. In California the state government is seeking to re-establish its credentials as a green pioneer. Nonetheless shareholder activism is potent and likely to intensify.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vdHJ1dGhvdXQub3JnL2FydGljbGVzL2NvbXBhbnktcmVzcG9uc2libGUtZm9yLXRhaW50ZWQtYmFieS1mb3JtdWxhLWhhcy1tb25vcG9seS1vdmVyLWFpZC1wcm9ncmFtLXNhbGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Company Responsible for Tainted Baby Formula Has Monopoly Over Aid Program Sales,"Corporate negligence has worsened an ongoing infant formula shortage and the company responsible has the exclusive rights to sell its formula to the parents of almost half of all newborns who receive federally funded nutritional assistance in the U.S.

Abbott Nutrition is the sole provider of infant formula for U.S. government aid programs in 34 states seven Indian tribal organizations four territories and Washington D.C. according to data obtained from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

Beneficiaries in those jurisdictions include 589295 infants or 47.42 percent of all infants in the so-called Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children (WIC) according to the records. The agency numbers were acquired through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.

Most public health experts recommend that newborns subsist on breastmilk because it has better nutritional value than formula and because it helps bolster infants’ fragile immune systems. Breastfeeding is associated with lower rates of infant mortality which hits Black and Indigenous communities hardest.

Infant formula however is an acceptable alternative to breastfeeding for parents who can’t or don’t nurse their babies many of whom don’t have the luxury of taking the time to breastfeed. Academic research has found that most breastmilk formula sales in the U.S. are financed by WIC which is the primary nutritional assistance program in the United States available to low-income expecting parents and parents of newborns.

Federal law requires state agencies administering WIC to grant one company the exclusive rights to sell infant formula to program beneficiaries through licensed supermarkets. The framework has been in place since 1989 when Congress changed the law in an effort to save money.

Abbott makes the widely used formula brands Similac Alimentum and EleCare. The company’s facility in Sturgis Michigan which is at the heart of the shortage makes all three among other nutritional products for infants. The plant has remained shuttered since a voluntary recall of products made at the factory was issued by the firm in February amid investigations by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the issuance of a consumer advisory from the agency.

The recall has exacerbated a nationwide infant formula shortage initially caused by supply chain issues that have impacted numerous industries during the COVID-19 pandemic as several media outlets have reported in recent days. The formula shortage has been most acutely felt in Minnesota Connecticut Hawaii Iowa Louisiana Maryland North and South Dakota Rhode Island and Texas where between 40-54 percent of baby formula products have been out of stock in recent weeks.

Four “environmental samples” collected by the agency tested positive for the deadly bacteria amid an investigation that revealed lax attitudes by management toward product safety.

Abbott is the sole-source contractor to WIC programs in all of those states as the records disclosed by USDA demonstrate. In other words low-income parents in those states must buy Abbott products if they want their infant formula purchases reimbursed by the government.

The advisory and the recall happened because deadly foodborne bacteria were found at the Abbott plant in Sturgis. The presence of Cronobacter sakazakii which can give newborns fatal bouts of sepsis and meningitis was detected at the facility by FDA officials after four cronobacter hospitalizations were traced back to the plant. Two of the patients linked to the Sturgis contamination died. The FDA said that cronobacter “may have contributed” to their deaths.

Problems with the Sturgis facility were known to the company the FDA and other regulators long before the February recall. Consumer complaints related to cronobacter and products manufactured at the plant were lodged with the FDA the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state and local officials as far back as September 2021.

Officials in Minnesota made federal officials aware of the problem last September after an infant in the state contracted cronobacter. The baby was hospitalized for 22 days and ultimately survived according to Politico.

Though product samples collected by FDA officials at the Sturgis facility tested negative for cronobacter four “environmental samples” collected by the agency tested positive for the deadly bacteria amid an investigation that revealed lax attitudes by management toward product safety.

An FDA inspector found in February 2022 that Abbott “did not establish a system of process controls … designed to ensure that infant formula does not become adulterated due to the presence of microorganisms in the formula or in the processing environment” and that the company failed to “ensure that all surfaces that contacted infant formula were maintained to protect infant formula from being contaminated by any source.”

The FDA has also taken heat itself for failing to act on this issue until earlier this year. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Illinois) chair of the House Oversight Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy wrote to the agency on March 24 asking why it waited to warn the public of the problem. Krishnamoorthi noted that the FDA detected cronobacter at the Abbott facility in Sturgis eight times between 2019 and 2022.

“FDA must do more to ensure no lives are lost or babies sickened due to delayed inspections and late consumer warnings” the lawmaker said.

The sole-source contractor system has succeeded in saving public money spent on WIC by forcing manufacturers to aggressively compete on offering rebates to public administrators. Policy analysts say that this system has allowed the U.S. government and its state partners to expand the program to 2 million additional beneficiaries annually. Unlike Social Security and Medicare — programs that by law have to pay benefits to all those who are eligible — WIC is only available to those who qualify if Congress has allocated funding for the program.

But the sole-source system has had unintended consequences. One academic study found companies that win state auctions are able to mark up the prices of their infant formula products by between 26-35 percent. Another academic study which was funded by USDA found that the winners of state auctions end up dominating the market for infant formula and that not all of those who end up buying the company’s product receive WIC benefits.

This so-called “spillover” effect happens in part because the auction winner inevitably dominates retail shelf space — a reality exposed by the current supply shortage. USDA responded to the Abbott recall by enabling states where the company has won sole-source auctions to reimburse WIC beneficiaries who purchase substitutes. Shortage numbers and the geographic locations where shortages are most acute indicate however that alternatives have been hard to come by in jurisdictions where Abbott has exclusivity rights to WIC beneficiaries. Retailers have reacted by limiting customer purchases of formula.

In other words the system has helped dominant suppliers consolidate their oligopoly power. Three corporations sell the vast majority of the infant formula in the U.S. — Abbott Mead Johnson and Nestlé — and those who don’t qualify for WIC benefits including many low-income people suffer as a result. The WIC eligibility cutoff is 185 percent of the federal poverty level. Though the threshold varies by household size a single parent working 40 hours per week would only be able to make $15.50 per hour to qualify for the program.

Many retailers keep their infant formula behind lock-and-key in response to the desperation that drives formula theft which has likely gotten worse because of shortages. The price of all major formula brands nationwide has spiked 18 percent in the last year outpacing inflation by a margin of more than two-to-one.

The system doesn’t have to be structured like this. In many European countries the price of formula is about half of what it is in the United States suggesting the presence of stronger consumer protections against monopoly power. And the U.S government could encourage breastfeeding by joining the vast majority of countries in the world which make employers give their workers some form of paid parental leave.

Some strides have been made in recent years. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 amended labor law to give breastfeeding parents the right to pump breastmilk at work in a private location “other than a bathroom.” Advocates say however that many workers who don’t receive basic workplace protections were excluded — roughly 9 million or 60 percent of all breastfeeding parents.

Even if the U.S. government didn’t enact new labor laws there are still steps that it could take to encourage the consumption of breastmilk by infants. The public health system in Brazil for example has developed a national network of breastmilk banks that sustains more than 180000 babies on an annual basis.

But some incredibly powerful institutions profit from the incumbent system. Several of the world’s largest asset managers — including Vanguard BlackRock State Street and Morgan Stanley — are among Abbott’s largest shareholders. The company’s pediatric nutrition products made around $2 billion in the U.S. alone in 2020. Revenue growth Abbott’s annual report from that year noted “was led by share growth of Similac® Abbott’s infant formula brand.”

Investing giant Blackstone is buying up real estate at a rapid rate.

Just this past week it bet $13 billion on student housing with a deal to buy American Campus Communities. In the past few months it acquired Australia's Crown Resorts for $6.3 billion and reinvested in its European logistics real-estate company.

It's working. Blackstone smashed its earnings records earlier this year largely thanks to its booming real-estate business.

Insider set out to identify the key people driving the land grab and landed on 17 executives focused on everything from investing in life-sciences office buildings to Hollywood studios to multifamily apartment buildings.

Here Hana Alberts one of the editors on the story gives us a look at the work that went into creating this list.

What prompted you to make this list?

On recent investor calls where Blackstone has reported record earnings executives like Jon Gray and Stephen Schwarzman chalked them up to the firm's real-estate business. We wanted to identify the influential people leading that division the largest arm of the private-equity giant with $280 billion of its $915 billion of assets under management.

Did any of these power players really stand out to you?







I was struck by how Nadeem Meghji the head of real estate for the Americas led Blackstone to nab a 49% stake in a cluster of Hollywood studios in June 2020 when the pandemic had thrown the economy for a loop.

I am also amazed by how much these folks can accomplish at young ages. Katharine Keenan became CEO of Blackstone's Mortgage Realty Trust at age 36 and 33-year-old David Levine has been involved with $100 billion in transactions since 2010 and is now cohead of Americas acquisitions.

What are the trends they're keeping an eye on this year?

These leaders are investing in various forms of real estate right now from apartment complexes in South Florida to college-campus housing. Other hot areas include warehouses (thanks ecommerce and next-day delivery!) and biotech lab space — but there's a notable lack of investment in major office complexes another sign of the times.

Amazon's projection to open 280 Fresh stores in the US by 2022 has turned out to be woefully off with just 27 Fresh stores open so far. The company's struggle to reach its Fresh store-expansion goals is emblematic of the challenges it's faced in the physical-retail arena.

While Amazon has perfected the art of e-commerce efficiency it's facing a much tougher reality in the brick-and-mortar space driven by the high cost of the stores a dysfunctional internal culture and tension with Whole Foods. Some employees question whether the company will ever excel in the offline-shopping space.

Live Gig Review: Shadow Editor

We are nearing the beginning days of summer here in the South and as the muggy wave of heat steamrolls through its course and into our everyday living we are finally beginning to see an uptick in concert rock tours and more fans coming back out to the shows. I guess you could argue that it never truly left it just slowed down while we worked our way through the difficult last couple of years it has been for all. Maybe we can get some sort of normalcy back in our lives. What’s a great Thursday night without some great Rock infused in your life? Gotta have it.

The local rock station The Rocket 95.1 sponsored this following gig with headliners everybody’s favorite Kentucky Southern Hard Rockers Black Stone Cherry as they once more come to Huntsville to rock their faces off. It was just earlier in the week that we told you about their new release Live From The Royal Albert Hall… Y’All On June 24 Via our friends on Mascot Records. While last time they were here a few years ago they played as Sidetracks Music Hall this time things shift over to Shagnasty’s Grubbery & Pour House. Simila venue in terms of size with a little room to breathe with an open patio deck in the back never ceases to amaze me how bands like BSC can play small venues and hit arena tours. You go get a sense of tightness when they do shows like these and you have the added benefit of witnessing a freaking great live band in the flesh. What a great night it became.

But first proving that one headliner is not enough we also get the very talented and gritty and dirty sounds of newcomer Ayron Jones. The Seattle product has been trail-blazing through the music scene with its patented gritty dirty Hendrix/Grunge-influenced Rock sound with impunity. I have to say while not having covered his band before for the mag this was truly an enjoyable ride to witness them perform live for the first time. Truly impressed with his subtle way of playing the band around him is firm and their sound is instantly their own.

They open the night with frantic yet subtle “Boys from the Puget Sound” a great way to introduce the brand to new fans of their sound. We get to witness “Supercharged” and here is where you can feel the new influences and old as Ayron keeps things flowing with its addictive chorus and tight rhythm and bass section. Another hot track comes via “Killing Season” where the drums resonate very dominantly. Another impactful soulful track comes via “Baptized in Muddy Waters” and “My Love Remains” just hit you in the face with straight-up razor emotion and blissful words.

Finally he ends the night with the excellent “Take My Away” as he does his best Hendrix meets the modern age nitty and gritty version of this excellent song. What a way to welcome BSC a great opener and one that we look forward to covering for many years to come. You already know highly recommended to check out Ayron Jones!!!

Black Stone Cherry are no strangers to bringing it live they remain consistently one of the best live Rock bands in the world they just don’t disappoint. These smaller size venues are truly a great way to get to know the band if you have never seen them live. Chris Robertson is a terrific guitar player with plenty of soul and firepower to boot. Between himself and the frantic aerials of axeman Ben Wells it has been a winning energetic combination for years. You add the terrific fledge pounding of stalhorse drummer John Fred Young and you have a full pledge winning combination.

They start the night with the captivating sounds of “Me and Mary Jane” a sure firestarter at any BSC gig. Was looking forward to hearing “Ringin’ In My Head” and true to their live euphoric energy it sounds bloody fantastic!!! The guitar solos in this one are an epic blend of the symphonious divine. When you hit “Evil” and the crowd favorite of “Cheaper to Drink Alone” you have a complete Thursday night party the crowd is hitting on all levels. Towards the end of the set we hear another pleaser in “Blame It On The Boom Boom” as the hits keep coming. Another thing to note is the band’s new bass player Steve Sewell Jr who comes in replacing long-time bass player John Lawhon who has taken a permanent hiatus from music in general. I will admit that bass did not miss a beat as Steve comes in and provides some power and with his animated charisma you have a competent replacement.

This Thursday night ends with a magnificent way to supercharge yourself into what looks to be a dynamite-laden summer of finally rocking we all used to before the pandemic days. It was good to see the locals and the ones who made the trek to Huntsville for this one look forward to many more to come. Meanwhile don’t forget to check out Ayron Jones on tour you won’t be let down trust me. And if you want more details on the new live release from BSC check our post from earlier in the week here. All hail RocknRoll’ let the summer begin and music never stop!!!

In an earnings call executives highlighted the firm’s $1.9 billion in earnings distributable to shareholders during the first three months of 2021 representing a 63 percent year-on-year surge. That upswing came even as net income attributable to the NYSE-listed group fell 30 percent year-on-year to $1.22 billion on softening investment returns.

Stephen Schwarzman Blackstone’s chairman CEO and co-founder noted that while nearly every major asset class outside commodities declined Blackstone funds delivered a strong performance as the Manhattan-based firm’s flagship real estate strategies appreciated by 8 to 10 percent in the first quarter alone.

“Blackstone reported an exceptional start to the year with the first quarter representing one of the two best in our 36-year history” Schwarzman said. “This was despite increasing interest rates and ever higher inflation driving major declines in equity and debt markets.”

APAC Deployment Begins

The company’s opportunistic APAC fund Blackstone Real Estate Partners Asia III reached $7.5 billion in committed capital in the first quarter after amassing $6.38 billion by the end of 2021.

Blackstone is targeting $9 billion in equity for the closed-end BREP Asia III which began its investment period last month and is scheduled to run until September 2027. The pan-Asia fund focuses on opportunities in China Japan India Australia South Korea Hong Kong Singapore New Zealand and Taiwan.

In Thursday’s call president and chief operating officer Jonathan Gray said that across its strategies the group focused its capital deployment during the first quarter on hard assets and businesses where revenue could grow faster than inflationary pressures including logistics life sciences rental housing enterprise software and digital and energy infrastructure.

“The tremendous value of what we own today is further highlighted by our realisation activity” Gray said. “Nowhere is that more apparent than in logistics our largest investment team comprising 40 percent of the global real estate portfolio.”

Gray who leads Blackstone’s global real estate push and is widely viewed as Schwarzman’s heir apparent said the group began investing in logistics at scale in 2010 as e-commerce took off and today owns $170 billion worth of warehouses.

Fund Management Flourishes

Chief financial officer Michael Chae said Blackstone’s perpetual assets under management more than doubled year-on-year to $338 billion across 18 vehicles.

“These strategies now comprise 43 percent of the firm’s fee-earning AUM and their impact on the repeatability of our capital metrics and earnings can’t be overstated” Chae said.

Such strategies continually fundraise and generate management fees that compound with both inflows and appreciation in net asset value bolstering the resiliency of earnings.

Blackstone’s management fees rose 25 percent year-on-year to a record $1.5 billion in the first quarter as fee-related performance revenue more than tripled to $558 million Chae said."

The company once stuffed a gas turbine engine into a 1955 Thunderbird.

Ford archivist Ted Ryan posted a photo of the turbine-powered Thunderbird and testing notes on Twitter on Tuesday. They're artifacts from a time when automakers considered turbines as a possible alternative to conventional piston engines.

The project began in August 1955 and the car was ready for testing in March 1956. The goal of the project was ""to obtain experience with gas turbine engine packaging and operation"" according to the testing notes. Ford also sought to learn ""the special advantages and problems associated with this type of powerplant.""

To that end Ford invested $188000 (in 1955 dollars) in the turbine-powered Thunderbird prototype. Sourced from aircraft manufacturer Boeing the turbine was mounted where a conventional engine would normally go but with a massive exhaust outlet just behind the front wheels.

1955 Ford Thunderbird gas turbine prototype

Results were mixed. Positives included good medium-speed acceleration a good power-to-weight ratio a lack of vibration and low maintenance requirements. However the notes also mentioned ""serious acceleration lag in startup"" as well as problems with the front-mounted exhaust and ""numerous other characteristics that represented problem areas.""

Needless to say Ford never put a turbine-powered Thunderbird into production but it wasn't the only Detroit automaker experimenting with turbine power. The Chrysler Turbine Car appeared in 1962 and Chrysler even distributed 50 cars to customers for real-world evaluation.

Chrysler didn't get much further than Ford however and most of the Turbine Cars were scrapped after their loans ended. Nine survive today mostly in museums. Two are known to be in private hands including one in Jay Leno's collection.

Meanwhile the Thunderbird continued on for decades in many different forms but never a turbine engine. Production of the last retro-styled T-Bird ended after the 2005 model year though Ford has kept the trademark current to maintain control over the iconic nameplate.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vY2EubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vYm9laW5nLTc2Ny10cmFuc2Zvcm1lZC12aXAtcHJpdmF0ZS0xMjA1MDAyMTYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Boeing 767 has been transformed into a VIP private jet complete with a bedroom and home cinema — see inside,"A Florida-based aviation design company has refurbished a Boeing 767 private jet that can sleep 17 people.

The manufacturer is deciding prioritize 737 MAX 10 certification and the return of 787 deliveries and to focus teams on these programs it must postpone certification of the 777X.

This decision is related to a bill that reduces the influence of Boeing and other aircraft manufacturers in the certification process allowing the FAA to carry out work without 'pressure'.

In addition another FAA internal procedure determines a new standard for alerting the crew in case of failure or malfunction in the airplane's systems and the last year to certify airplanes with the old system is this one.

With the new efforts Boeing should be able to certify the 737 MAX 10 in 2022 and resume 787 deliveries in the second half as we previously announced. The movement ensures that Boeing will be able to deliver all the products already produced by the company a few years ago.

The certification of the Boeing 777X will need to rely on a new Engine Indication and Crew Alert System (EICAS) and is now expected to have a delay of 9 to 12 months due to this focus on products that are already being produced.

It is thought that with the certification of the 737 MAX 10 the increase in the production of airplanes of the 737 MAX family and the resumption of deliveries of the 787 Boeing will be able to return to profits.

Currently the Boeing 777X which will have deliveries starting in 2025 has about 330 firm orders and is trying to gain space in the Airbus A350 market which it leads. The 737 MAX 10 is one of the greatest successes of this aircraft family with more than 450 firm orders.

The 787 which has yet to cover its design costs currently has 406 firm orders. But Boeing is betting on more orders with the rapid resumption of deliveries after production problems."

It’s what the money says.,"My favorite scene in the movie adaptation of Michael Lewis’ “Moneyball” occurred during 2003 in the darkened Oakland A’s locker room where Billy Beane the team’s general manager reluctantly slid a folded piece of paper across a table to his math genius assistant Peter Brand.

Unfolding the paper Brand stared at the number written telling Beane after a pause the offer from the Boston Red Sox would make Beane the highest-paid general manager in sports.

“So?” So what? Beane replies somewhat annoyed.

“You’re not doing it for the money” Brand says. “You’re doing it for what the money says.”

Before the credits roll we learn that Beane turned down an offer of $12.5 million a year to run a Red Sox team that would win a World Series a year later in 2004.

What you may be rightfully wondering does that have to do with electric infrastructure and the future of supply chains?

Maybe nothing. But stay with me here.

DOE doles out infrastructure dough

The Michael Lewis bestseller Moneyball was made into a 2011 movie starring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill. It is a true story of Oakland A’s general manager and current executive vice president Billy Beane a speaker at the FreightWaves Future of Supply Chain event May 9-10 in Northwest Arkansas.

For just a couple hundred thousand dollars more than Red Sox owner John Henry offered Beane the Department of Energy is granting two major auto suppliers and one university a total of $12.7 million to develop fast-charging infrastructure for electric vehicles.





If commercial electric vehicles — especially heavy-duty trucks — are going to be viable they need to be able to charge quickly. Otherwise they could become a future supply chain obstacle. Ready access to low-cost fast-charging infrastructure is essential for fleet electrification and broader EV adoption. Scaling current charging technology is pricey.

I missed the specifics of these grants late last year. And I wondered why BorgWarner Inc. just got around to announcing its $4.09 million award on April 14. Eaton Corp which picked up $4.9 million in the “Fiscal Year 2021 Low Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Vehicle Technologies Research Development Demonstration and Deployment” program issued its release four months ago.

North Carolina State University received $3.9 million. In total the DOE gave out more than $68 million across eight infrastructure-related areas including $5 million to Achates Power whose opposed-piston 2-stroke hybrid commercial vehicle system was featured in Truck Tech on Friday.

What the money says (and buys)

BorgWarner (NYSE: BWA) is leading a team on a36-month project to design and develop a cost-effective advanced direct current fast charger (DCFC).

It is coordinating with U.S.-based suppliers and research partners including Michigan State University eTransEnergy Cityfi the State of Michigan and the construction firm Barton Malow. Component supplier support is coming from Wolfspeed Inc.

The goal is to develop the next-generation DCFC system for 20-30% lower cost than current systems. BorgWarner’s flexible and adaptable single-stage power conversion and power module architecture will allow up to five vehicles to share 150 to 350 kilowatts of juice in 25kW modules. Five other EVs can be plugged in and ready to be charged.

Initially the charger won’t help trucks much since they need more power because of the size of their battery packs. But BorgWarner is confident it can get there.

Solid state transformer

Eaton (NYSE: ETN) is developing a compact and turnkey solution for DC fast-charging infrastructure. It is expected to reduce costs by 65% through improvements in power conversion grid interconnection technology charger integration and modularity and installation time.





A solid-state Eaton transformer design and modular chargers packaged on a compact skid will speed installation and reduce the amount of equipment and space needed both of which should reduce cost. It will connect directly to a utility’s medium-voltage distribution system eliminating the need for additional power conversion devices.

Eaton is leading the project. Partners include the National Renewable Energy Lab N.C. State the University of Pittsburgh ITC Holdings and Calstart the national nonprofit focus on clean transportation.

Eaton NCSU and Pitt are collaborating on the technical development of the solid-state transformer. NREL will validate the technology. ITC Holdings will provide a demonstration site for fleet charging and CALSTART will independently validate costs and performance.

One more coincidence

Oh and one more coincidence. Beane who remains with the A’s as executive vice president nearly two decades after the Moneyball story was told in Lewis’ 2003 bestseller will speak at the FreightWaves Future of Supply Chain event in Northwest Arkansas on May 9-10.

In the 19th century it was home to the elegant American aristocrats painted by John Singer Sargent and written about by Edith Wharton (who lamented that while in New York she was too intelligent to be considered fashionable in Boston she was too fashionable to be considered intelligent).

The city has nurtured some of America's most formative thinkers and writers — Thoreau Emerson Hawthorne and Alcott all lived in Concord now a commuter-train ride from downtown—as well as a few of our era's funniest talents: Steve Carell John Krasinski and B. J. Novak of The Office all attended high school in the area. Boston is also the setting of great love stories (including of course Love Story) unforgettable gangster drama (most famously the tenure of Whitey Bulger) and crucial scientific breakthroughs (Moderna which developed one of the COVID-19 vaccines is based across the river in Cambridge).

Boston's grand hotels are another integral part of this illustrious history. The Omni Parker House the city's oldest was founded in 1855; the Fairmont Copley Plaza opened in 1912. The ironically named Liberty Hotel is housed in the former Charles Street Jail built in 1851. Recently three stars have joined or rejoined the firmament. (A fourth Raffles Boston will open later this year in a 35-story high-rise.)

The Langham Boston which occupies the old Federal Reserve Bank building in the financial district and the Newbury Boston (once the Ritz-Carlton and later the Taj) have both been renovated and reopened in the past year. The Four Seasons Hotel One Dalton Street a newly built tower with residences debuted in May 2019 less than a year before the pandemic threw the hospitality industry into crisis. Each of these properties offers a distinctly Bostonian experience an affirmation of the city's blend of old and new local and cosmopolitan.

The Langham

The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston now The Langham was constructed between 1920 and 1922 as the city emerged from the influenza pandemic. It remained a bank until 1977 was declared a landmark in the 1980s and operated as a Le Méridien hotel from 1981 to 2003. Since then it's been part of the small Hong Kong-based group of luxury hotels that takes its name from the Langham in London one of Europe's first grand hotels whose 1865 opening was attended by the Prince of Wales.

During the past two years the Langham has undergone a lavish makeover that ultimately topped $200 million. The resulting décor is thoughtful and witty. Glancing references to the original bank abound: in the safety-deposit boxes that line the concierge wall; in the high-ceilinged Grana restaurant where the emblem of the Federal Reserve is emblazoned in the terrazzo floor; even in some of the rugs which evoke the tweed of 1920s bankers' suits. A meeting room once the magnificent office of the bank's president has imposing N. C. Wyeth paintings that depict among others Abraham Lincoln and Alexander Hamilton.

Working with the grand scale of the original two-story arched windows on the second floor the Langham has created Loft Suites with a sitting room and powder room downstairs and a bedroom and full bath on a balcony above. The room I stayed in on the top floor also felt loftlike its high slanted windows affording a glorious view of the skyline with the occasional seagull soaring past. The palette was a soothing combination of neutrals — dove gray light tan — with slate blue and plaid accents while the cabinets that housed the safe and mini-bar resembled a cream-leather steamer trunk.

There's a huge focus on being local. You know you're in Boston when you wake up here.

The hotel may be modeled on the London flagship but its pleasures are framed in a Bostonian context. ""There's a huge focus on being local"" says managing director Michele Grosso. ""You know you're in Boston when you wake up here."" The walls of the Fed the stylish bar are covered with paintings by local artists. Instead of a typical lobster roll the Fed offers a lobster BLT accompanied by house-made potato chips. Still the British influence is in evidence: there's also a cheese-and-mustard toastie a favorite at the Langham in London.

Above all Boston is best represented by the warmth of the staff. At the Fed our waitress revealed that she'd been with the hotel for many years then exuberantly told us about a recent team treasure hunt. Unsurprisingly she who knew every corner of the hotel so well had been on the winning team.

The Newbury

Where the Langham is intimate The Newbury radiates vivacity. Maureen Albright the hotel's longtime historian and director of engineering told me ""I've been here 20 years and the reason I stayed was for this moment."" Invited to work with the design and branding teams on the renovation she is exhilarated by the result. ""Girl"" she says to her beloved building ""you just got Botox like nobody's ever seen. Now you get to take us along for the ride.""

The walls of the lobby area have been lacquered a delicious slate blue; the floor is veined black marble. The Art Deco staircase overhung by an imposing contemporary chandelier leads to the second-floor salon where the hotel shows its collection of art that riffs on other art — such as large photographic portraits by Amy Arbus who dresses her subjects up like people in famous paintings by Cézanne and Modigliani. In the grand ballroom which overlooks the park the drapery is now simpler but the massive chandeliers are still glamorous. (During the Great Depression founding owner Edward Wyner had his staff dress in ball gowns and dinner jackets and waltz behind the sheer curtains so that Bostonians looking on from across the road could be reassured that elegance continued.)

Everywhere there is a sense of exuberant delight from the paneled bar (where Winston Churchill and Sylvia Plath both drank though not together) with its fringed lamps and leather and velvet sofas to the gorgeous library with its shelves of books of local interest and iconic Karsh portraits of cultural luminaries. On a late-summer weekday evening when I called the elevator it arrived filled with laughing young women and men dressed to the nines and in full festive mode. Luxury here equals fun. ""I love that we're opulent I love that we're everyday"" Albright enthused. ""We're making memories already.""

Perhaps my favorite thing about the Newbury is Contessa...the squash carpaccio served with arugula pumpkin seeds and agrodolce is almost miraculous.

Perhaps my favorite thing about the Newbury is Contessa the rooftop restaurant created by chef Mario Carbone and the team at New York's Major Food Group. The patterned marble floor is beautiful as are the chairs and banquettes upholstered in blue and rose. The views are ravishing. Carbone's menu is largely based on traditional Italian dishes: the savory ""meatballs Aldo"" come in a sauce made with whole-grain mustard; the squash carpaccio served with arugula pumpkin seeds and agrodolce is almost miraculous. My husband James had grilled branzino that was delicately flavored and simply cooked while my veal Milanese was rich crisp and light. Patrons ranged from tanned and expensively dressed with an air of Miami Beach to a sweet suburban couple on a fancy date; the late seating brought in a stylish crew in their late twenties. The restaurant is ideal for special occasions but it's also unfussy — no tablecloths knowledgeable and welcoming servers and plenty of less expensive dishes including pizza.

Four Seasons Hotel One Dalton Street

Few hotel chains are as known for their commitment to tasteful opulence as Four Seasons. One Dalton Street which opened in May 2019 is the brand's second outpost in the city. While its companion the Four Seasons Hotel Boston overlooks the Common and offers a more traditional experience One Dalton Street well located on the edge of Back Bay within walking distance of Boston's prime shopping district is an expression of the city as cosmopolitan and future-facing.

The hotel has literally altered the skyline: its imposing triangular 61-story tower stands near the Prudential Building and rivals it in height with private residences on the upper floors. Inside the atmosphere is hushed and discreet with the assurance that intuitive service attends your every whim. I found myself whispering in the corridors feeling a bit like Greg the provincial cousin on Succession.

That night from our room on the 19th floor we looked out over the skyline. It was possible to picture the smaller city that once was its historic buildings tucked between skyscrapers and to see the vital city that is.

Reed Kandalaft the general manager as elegant and dapper as his hotel told me that he was proud of the fact that One Dalton Street remained open through the pandemic. He said his staff swiftly became experts at adapting to unforeseen circumstances. (Having been a manager of the Four Seasons in Damascus at the time of the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011 Kandalaft knows how to deliver grace under pressure.)

He is eloquent about the hotel's unique features from its high-ceilinged rooms with their panoramic windows to the intimate bar Trifecta which on weekends serves afternoon tea. My flawless Earl Grey was served in a beautiful individual teapot; the Prosecco and liqueur that accompanied the tea were rather less British. Many of the guests who were predominantly women had outfitted for the occasion in frilly dresses and high heels.

In the evenings Trifecta becomes a subdued spot dimly lit that offers small plates (the lobster roll is just right) and cocktails designed to complement the hotel's — and the city's — cultural landscape. James ordered an Arabesque a blend of champagne gin and grapefruit and bergamot liqueurs. Decorated with a rose petal it is intended to express the spirit of dance in honor of the nearby Boston Ballet. I had a rum and pineapple drink the Melting Pot a mixologist's response to the hotel's glorious installation by British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare in which books by immigrants and first-generation Americans are bound in colorful Dutch wax-printed cotton.

While all of the hotels I visited take their collections seriously One Dalton Street displays in its public areas works of international caliber. Along with Shonibare's books at the entrance Trifecta features the British artist Tacita Dean's series of cloud portraits LA Exuberance. Behind the reception desk is Duke Riley's monumental mosaic They Say on a Really Hot Day depicting the Great Molasses Flood a piece of local history. In 1919 the streets of the North End Boston's lively Italian district ran with more than two million gallons of molasses after a storage tank exploded. Tucked into the mosaic among the waves are witty images of local symbols: Kenmore Square's Citgo sign; a pigeon; a parking ticket; a rat rowing along in an open can of baked beans.

One Dalton Street has become a destination for Bostonians as well as visitors thanks to its excellent izakaya-inspired Japanese restaurant Zuma. Located on the hotel's second floor it occupies a dynamic open space where diners can see much of the food being prepared. The décor at once glamorous and soothing involves vast monkeypod-wood and woven-rattan panels illuminated to create a convivial but discreet atmosphere. We took part in a spectacular omakase that included light flavorful shrimp dumplings; fine slivers of sea bass sashimi; a bountiful impeccably fresh sushi maki and sashimi platter; plates of Zuma's signature black cod and beef tenderloin; and to finish an elegantly presented assortment of desserts that included the best chocolate mousse I've had in years. The meal's great triumph was to leave us not unpleasantly overfed but perfectly satisfied.

Chris Carey the organizer of the Brockton Fair says there is a good chance it will not come back.

The Brockton Fair has been closed for the last two years because of the pandemic and just this week they announced it would be canceled again this year. The Fair had been a city staple since 1874.

Carey who owns the Fairgrounds says there is only a ""slim"" chance it would be back in 2023. And Carney says the heyday of the Brockton Fair has passed.

""I saw some decline at the end of it and then COVID hit. And I thought it might be difficult to bring it back to what it was. I remember the 80s. They were great and then the 90s were good too. After that it took a little decline of attendance. People found other things to do. They went away. They had different interests.""

As for the property itself he says he would work with the city of Brockton to find a way to redevelop it that benefits the community.",,,,,,,,,

The claimed element presented for prosecution is pure function and not structure. This type of claiming is used often with software patents which recite function via a series of computer implemented steps to carry out a means.

In Nevro v. Boston Scientific decided in April 2020 Nevro appealed from a district court ruling that the following claim for a spinal cord modulation system was indefinite:

means for generating a paresthesia-free therapy signal with a signal frequency in a range from etc. etc.;

Nevro argued that its specification disclosed sufficient structure – a signal generator that accomplished the claimed function of generating a paresthesia-free therapy signal. The district court found Nevro’s argument unconvincing finding that since “signal generators” are already known in the prior art the signal generator in the disclosure wasn’t sufficient structure here. The Federal Circuit reversed. To the Federal Circuit the specification clearly recited a “signal or a pulse generator” not just a general-purpose computer to accomplish the claimed function. The Federal Circuit unlike the district court did not assess whether a signal generator is known or routine. Rather they looked at the term from a specificity standpoint asking whether the patentee disclosed a specific computer that is programmed for the function that is in the claim not just a general-purpose computer.

The test for definiteness under a means-plus-function context is whether there is sufficient corresponding structure in the specification that links the structure in the specification to the function in the claim.

In SPEX Technologies v. Western Digital Corp. decided in May 28 2021 the district court found the following claim term indefinite:

means for providing to a host computing device in response to a request from the host computing for information regarding the type of peripheral device information regarding the function of the target means.

The claimed function is providing specific information to a host computing device in response to a request from that host computing device. The issue came down to a “memory section 612a” which the patentee cited as being the structure for this claimed function. The district court found that the specification just did not support how the memory section 612a performed this claimed function. The Federal Circuit ended up reversing this case as well finding that the specification clearly linked how the memory 612a stored data and provided that data to the host computing device when the host computing device requested the information. In this case the structure was the memory 612a device that could store data and provide that data to the host computing device when the host computing device requested it (i.e. the function of the claim).

So what’s good patent practice? Make sure every one of your claims is in the specification! Start with the claims; have them be the groundwork for your application. And have an algorithm! Drawings are a good thing.

The creative if unconventional perk helped attract and keep younger tech talent but it was out of reach to all but a tiny slice of the U.S. workforce.

Now at a time when companies will do just about anything to recruit and retain workers fertility benefits have gone from novelty to a must-have for many companies.

Thanks to the pandemic which brought on today’s tight labor market corporations have had to find unusual ways to attract and keep prized employees said Rachael McCann senior director at Willis Towers Watson an insurance advisory and brokerage firm. The fertility benefit has become one of the more popular approaches she said. “It’s absolutely grown.""

In the U.S. demand for workers is far outstripping supply. There are currently about 1.8 open jobs for every unemployed worker well above the pre-Covid ratio of 1.2. As a result employers are ratcheting up pay and offering perks that were unheard of prior to 2020 -- including covering college tuition and paying bonuses to employees who don’t miss work.

Plusher Packages

Employers are also offering plusher health-care packages including providing expanded mental-health coverage to compete for talent.

Companies are finding that fertility benefits are increasingly popular among female employees -- particularly those between the ages of 25 and 40. The benefit is also important for couples with a diagnosis of infertility same-sex couples and single individuals as well as those who have been unable to conceive naturally or are starting families later in life.

“In the five years before the pandemic we saw a lot of interest but not a lot of buying"" said Kate Ryder chief executive officer of Maven Clinic a family planning provider whose clients include Snap Inc. BuzzFeed Inc. and Boston Scientific Corp. The loss of valuable staff in the so-called “Great Resignation"" the desire to provide more help to burnt-out parents and the push to have more-inclusive workplaces all led companies to consider fertility benefits she said. “Now everyone’s buying.""

The most prevalent type of fertility package caps benefits per employee. One example is a $25000 lifetime benefit which would cover about two rounds of in-vitro fertilization treatments or slightly more than one cycle of egg freezing.

But $25000 can run out quickly. Three IVF cycles for example are the most clinically effective approach for women under 40 according to some studies. Patients can also experience added costs including egg or embryo storage and medications needed for IVF.

Survey data from workforce consultant Mercer showed that as late as 2015 just under a quarter of large employers (500 or more employees) covered IVF. But in 2020 the figure rose to 27%. And last year it jumped to 36%.

The percentage of large employers covering egg-freezing benefits meanwhile climbed to 15% in 2021 from just 5% in 2015 the Mercer data show.

Beyond Tech

The breadth of companies offering fertility benefits has also spread far beyond tech. Carrot Fertility a global fertility-benefits provider mostly saw interest from companies also in financial services and consulting prior to the pandemic said Chief Executive Officer Tammy Sun.

In the last two years Carrot has added clients in the food and beverage retail automotive and manufacturing industries. They’re also working with labor unions and municipalities. Revenue has grown by about 400% in the last year Sun said. The closely held company declined to provide further financial details.

“This has been a huge part of our attraction campaign"" said Aja Harbert human resources director at B Capital Group a Los Angeles venture capital firm that started offering a fertility benefit through Carrot in 2021. She said it helped convince four candidates to accept job offers. “It kind of pushed them over the edge when they had competing offers"" she said.

Increased employer investment in fertility benefits has also helped vendors offer a more holistic approach to family planning. Two years ago many of the family-planning vendors “felt more like tech startups"" and have since “grown by leaps and bounds"" said McCann of Willis Towers Watson.

Maven Clinic for example offers fertility treatments and education as well as physical and mental support from preconception through postpartum.

When Priscilla Martinez a senior industry account manager at Microsoft Corp. in Chicago was having trouble conceiving she was able to get pregnant after using Maven Clinic’s nutrition and fertility counseling services. She had her first child in early 2021 and has continued to use Maven’s new-parent support classes.

Martinez said she didn’t put much thought into benefits when looking for jobs in the past. But now that she’d like to have a second child her mindset has changed. “It’s definitely something that has helped"" keep me in the job Martinez said.

Controlling Costs

In the past employers didn’t want to offer fertility benefits because of concerns about higher costs given how expensive treatments like IVF and egg freezing are said Samantha Purciello senior associate at Mercer. But 97% of employers surveyed by Mercer said that adding the benefit didn’t lead to a significant increase in their costs according to the company.

One way employers can keep costs down is by capping benefits and the vast majority do. The most common is a lifetime dollar maximum and of those $16250 is the median amount Mercer data show. About 13% of companies restrict the number of IVF and egg-freezing cycles to three.

Companies won’t bear the brunt of the costs unless employees take advantage of the benefits and very few actually do. Mercer estimates that less than 3% of women might need such treatments.

Still as more Americans postpone starting families fertility benefits have become “one of the most important talent retention and attraction tools on the table"" said Carrot Fertility’s Sun.

The CHOICE study which was published in The Journal of Rheumatology also found improvements in patients who received secukinumab 150 mg but the response was generally higher for the 300 mg dose.

The randomized double-blind controlled trial included a total of 258 patients with PsA who had not previously used biologics. Patient age ranged between 19 and 82 years and the mean time since PsA diagnosis ranged between 3 and 3.9 years. The mean body mass index at baseline was greater than 30 kg/m2 indicating the sample population was generally obese. Additionally at baseline 73.3% of patients had enthesitis and 48.1% had dactylitis.

In a 2:2:1 ratio 103 patients received secukinumab 300 mg 103 received secukinumab 150 mg and 52 received placebo. All groups received their treatment every 4 weeks for 16 weeks in treatment period 1.

At week 16 patients who were receiving secukinumab 300 mg continued receiving the same dose during treatment period 2 up to week 52 and patients receiving placebo began receiving secukinumab 300 mg every 4 weeks up to week 52.

Patients in the secukinumab 150 mg group who reached less than 20% improvement in tender and swollen joint counts at weeks 16 28 or 40 compared with baseline were considered nonresponders and received the 300 mg dose every 4 weeks. Meanwhile patients who did respond by achieving at least 20% improvement continued with the 150 mg dosage every 4 weeks.

The authors noted that if the dose was stable patients were allowed to receive concomitant treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids up to week 16 or with methotrexate up to week 52. About a third of patients were receiving methotrexate at baseline.

Proportionally more patients in the 300 mg group completed treatment up to week 52 (80.6%) compared with the 150 mg group (74.8%) or originally placebo group (76.9%).

According to the authors the main reasons for discontinuation in treatment period 1 were withdrawal of informed consent and loss to follow-up while the main reasons for discontinuation in treatment period 2 were withdrawal of informed consent and experience of adverse events (AEs).

At week 16 higher proportion of patients who received secukinumab 300 mg (51.5%) achieved a 20% improvement in American College of Rheumatology score (ACR20) compared with patients who received placebo (23.1%) which the authors deemed statistically significant (OR 3.51; 95% CI 1.65-7.45; P =.0011).

While patients who received secukinumab 150 mg (36.9%) also achieved a higher ACR20 response rate compared with the placebo group OR was not considered statistically significant (OR 1.92; 95% CI 0.89-4.15; P = .0961).

Both secukinumab 300 mg (28.2%) and 150 mg (24.3%) also led to higher ACR50 response rates at week 16 compared with placebo (5.8%) both with significant ORs. They also both led to higher ACR70 response rates compared with placebo but only the 300 mg dose resulted in a significant OR.

Regarding Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores patients receiving either dose of secukinumab also had substantial improvements in psoriasis and achieved higher PASI75 PASI90 and PASI100 response rates compared with patients receiving placebo with significant ORs.

In terms of safety the authors noted that the most common AEs among patients in either secukinumab group were upper respiratory tract infection and. At week 52 serious AEs were reported in 9.6% of patients receiving secukinumab 300 mg and in 7.8% of patients receiving secukinumab 150 mg. However AEs were generally mild or moderate and were not found to be related to secukinumab dosage.

According to the authors these findings were consistent with those of prior research and suggest the 300 mg dosage of secukinumab is safe and efficacious as afirst-line biologic treatment for patients with PsA.

“Further studies will also help determine the optimal dose of secukinumab for treating overweight patients or those with high disease activity at treatment initiation” they wrote.

On May 17 1954 the nine justices unanimously ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that schools segregated by race did not provide an equal education. Students could no longer be barred from a school because of the color of their skin. To commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Brown decision I wanted to look at how far we’ve come in integrating our schools and how far we still have to go.

Two sociologists Sean Reardon at Stanford University and Ann Owens at the University of Southern California have teamed up to analyze both historical and recent trends. Reardon and Owens were slated to present their analysis at a Stanford University conference on May 6 and they shared their presentation with me in advance. They also expect to launch a new website to display segregation trends for individual school districts around the country.

Here are five takeaways from their work:

The long view shows progress but a worrying uptick especially in big cities

Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

Not much changed for almost 15 years after the Brown decision. Although Black students had the right to attend another school the onus was on their families to demand a seat and figure out how to get their child to the school. Many schools remained entirely Black or entirely white.

Desegregation began in earnest in 1968 with a series of court orders beginning with Virginia’s New Kent County schools. That year the Supreme Court required the county to abolish its separate Black and white schools and students were reassigned to different schools to integrate them.

This graph above produced by Reardon and Owens shows how segregation plummeted across the country between 1968 and 1973. The researchers focused on roughly 500 larger school districts where there were at least 2500 Black students. That captures nearly two-thirds of all Black students in the nation and avoids clouding the analysis with thousands of small districts of mostly white residents.

Reardon’s and Owens’s measurement of segregation compares classmates of the average white student with the classmates of the average Black student. For example in North Carolina’s Charlotte-Mecklenburg district the average white student in 1968 attended a school where 90 percent of his peers were white and only 10 percent were Black. The average Black student attended a school where 76 percent of his peers were Black and 24 percent were white. Reardon and Owens then calculated the gap in exposure to each race. White students had 90 percent white classmates while Black students had 24 percent white classmates. The difference was 66 percentage points. On the flip side Black students had 76 percent Black classmates while white students had 10 percent Black classmates. Again the difference was 66 percentage points which translates to 0.66 on the segregation index.

But in 1973 after court-ordered desegregation went into effect the average white student attended a school that was 69 percent white and 31 percent Black. The average Black student attended a school that was 34 percent Black and 66 percent white. In five short years the racial exposure gap fell from 66 percentage points to 3 percentage points. Schools reflected Charlotte-Mecklenberg’s demographics. In the graph above Reardon and Owens averaged the segregation index figures for all 533 districts with substantial Black populations. That’s what each dot represents.

In the early 1990s this measure of segregation began to creep up again as depicted by the red tail in the graph above. Owens calls it a “slow and steady uptick” in contrast to the drastic decline in segregation after 1968. Segregation has not bounced back or returned to pre-Brown levels. “There’s a misconception that segregation is worse than ever” Reardon said.

Although the red line from 1990 to the present looks nearly flat when you zoom in on it you can see that Black-white segregation grew by 25 percent between 1991 and 2019. During the pandemic segregation declined slightly again.

It’s important to emphasize that these Black-white segregation levels are tiny compared with the degree of segregation in the late 1960s. A 25 percent increase can seem like a lot but it’s less than 4 percentage points.

“It’s big enough that it makes me worried” said Owens. “Now is the moment to keep an eye on this. If it continues in this direction it would take a long time to get back up to Brown. But let’s not let it keep going up.”

Even more troubling is the fact that segregation increased substantially if you zero in on the nation’s biggest cities. White-Black segregation in the largest 100 school districts increased by 64 percent from 1988 to 2019 Owens and Reardon calculated.

School choice plays a role in recent segregation

Why is segregation creeping back up again?

The expiration of court orders that mandated school integration and the expansion of school choice policies including the rapid growth of charter schools explains all of the increase in segregation from 2000 onward said Reardon. Over 200 medium-sized and large districts were released from desegregation court orders from 1991 to 2009 and racial school segregation in these districts gradually increased in the years afterward.

School choice however appears to be the dominant force. More than half of the increase in segregation in the 2000s can be attributed to the rise of charter schools whose numbers began to increase rapidly in the late 1990s. In many cases either white or Black families flocked to different charter schools leaving behind a less diverse student body in traditional public schools.

The reason for the rise in segregation in the 1990s before the number of charter schools soared is harder to understand. Owens speculates that other school choice policies such as the option to attend any public school within a district or the creation of new magnet schools may have played a role but she doesn’t have the data to prove that. White gentrification of cities in the 1990s could also be a factor she said as the white newcomers favored a small set of schools or sent their children to private schools.

“We might just be catching a moment where there’s been an influx of one group before the other group leaves” said Owens. “It’s hard to say how the numbers will look 10 years from now.”

It’s important to disentangle demographic shifts from segregation increases

There’s a popular narrative that segregation has increased because Black students are more likely to attend school with other students who are not white especially Hispanic students. But Reardon and Owens say this analysis conflates demographic shifts in the U.S. population with segregation. The share of Hispanic students in U.S. schools now approaches 30 percent and everyone is attending schools with more Hispanic classmates. White students who used to represent 85 percent of the U.S. student population in 1970 now make up less than half.

Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

The blue line in the graph above shows how the classmates of the average Black Hispanic or Native American student have increased from about 55 percent Black Hispanic and Native American students in the early 1970s to nearly 80 percent Black Hispanic and Native American students today. That means that the average student who is not white is attending a school that is overwhelmingly made up of students who are not white.

But look at how the red line which depicts white students is following the same path. The average white student is attending a school that moved from 35 percent students who are not white in the 1970s to nearly 70 percent students who are not white today. “It’s entirely driven by Hispanic students” said Owens. “Even the ‘white’ schools in L.A. are 40 percent Hispanic.”

I dug into U.S. Department of Education data to show how extremely segregated schools have become less common. The percentage of Black students attending a school that is 90 percent or more Black fell from 23 percent in 2000 to 10 percent in 2022. Only 1 in 10 Black students attends an all-Black or a nearly all-Black school. Meanwhile the percentage of white students attending a school that is 90 percent or more white fell from 44 percent to 14 percent during this same time period. That’s 1 in 7. Far fewer Black or white students are learning in schools that are almost entirely made up of students of their same race.

At the same time the percentage of Black students attending a school where 90 percent of students are not white grew from 37 percent in 2000 to 40 percent in 2022. But notice the sharp growth of Hispanic students during this period. They went from 7.6 million (fewer than the number of Black students) to more than 13.9 million (almost double the number of Black students).

Most segregation falls across school district boundaries

Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

This bar chart shows how schools are segregated for two reasons. One is that people of different races live on opposite sides of school district lines. Detroit is an extreme example. The city schools are dominated by Black students. Meanwhile the Detroit suburbs which operate independent school systems are dominated by white students. Almost all the segregation is because people of different races live in different districts. Meanwhile in the Charlotte North Carolina metropolitan area over half of the segregation reflects the uneven distribution of students within school districts.

Nationally 60 percent of the segregation occurs because of the Detroit scenario: people live across administrative borders Reardon and Owens calculated. Still 40 percent of current segregation is within administrative borders that policymakers can control.

Residential segregation is decreasing

People often say there’s little that can be done about school segregation until we integrate neighborhoods. I was surprised to learn that residential segregation has been declining over the past 30 years according to Reardon’s and Owens’s analysis of census tracts. More Black and white people live in proximity to each other. And yet at the same time school segregation is getting worse.

All this matters Reardon said because kids are learning at different rates in more segregated systems. “We know that more integrated schools provide more equal educational opportunities” he said. “The things we’re doing with our school systems are making segregation worse.”

Reardon recommends more reforms to housing policy to integrate neighborhoods and more “guard rails” on school choice systems so that they cannot be allowed to produce highly segregated schools.

Moore Brown and Sullivan also chatted with PEOPLE to discuss what they're most excited about what episodes they're feeling a bit anxious to revisit and why the NBC show's impact remains years later.

Mandy Moore Sterling K. Brown and Chris Sullivan are ready to get in touch with their Pearson and Pittsburgh roots!

The trio is just one week away from launching their This Is Us rewatch podcast aptly titled That Was Us — and Moore Brown and Sullivan tell PEOPLE they can't contain their excitement!

""I’m very much looking forward to a Pearson family reunion"" says Moore 40 noting that they're ""excited to get everybody in the studio with us.""

""I don’t think any one of us was ready for the show to end"" continues the actress who played matriarch Rebecca Pearson. ""This show will forever hold a special place in my heart and I think a lot of people feel the same way.""

Brown who played Randall Pearson says he was in London promoting his film American Fiction when he realized the widespread impact of This Is Us.

""I realized that folks over there were kinda just discovering the show and it was moving them the same way folks in America were moved when we were on the air"" he recalls. ""And I just realized whenever folks come to it wherever they’re from they are impacted. And it made me want to revisit it again.""

Sullivan who played Toby Damon adds: ""We missed each other! Nobody was ready for the show to end when it did even though it was wrapped up to perfection. And fans were telling us that they had started rewatching and so we figured why not watch along with them? I’m excited to see everybody again and share in our love for the show.""

This Is Us aired on NBC from Sept. 2016 to May 2022. The family drama centered on the lives of siblings Kevin (Justin Hartley) Kate (Chrissy Metz) and Randall (Brown) and their parents Rebecca (Moore) and Jack (Milo Ventimiglia). The series used multiple timelines showing stories that took place in the present as well as flashbacks to the siblings’ childhood and flash-forwards to later years.

The NBC drama earned numerous accolades throughout its run. It received 39 Emmy nominations winning four. Additionally it also received the Television Academy Honors Award in 2017.

The trio tells PEOPLE they've already recorded episodes with show creator Dan Fogelman as well as Susan Kelechi Watson who played Randall's wife Beth Pearson. They also have plans to welcome Hartley and Jon Huertas (Miguel Rivas) as guests on the podcast.

The podcast — which PEOPLE can exclusively debut its new trailer — will also feature an emotional support hotline for fans to call and share their thoughts about the show and its impact.

Brown 48 says knowing how much the show has meant to people and continues to resonate is ""incredibly gratifying.""

""While the show was incredibly timely when it was on the air it also has a certain sense of timelessness. So whenever folks come to it it can’t help but move you"" he says.

Sullivan 43 echoes his costar noting ""The themes of this show are eternal and they are presented in a way that allows the audience to explore these subjects within themselves and gives them the context to discuss these topics with the people they love. The show is about connection providing its audience with the opportunity to connect.""

Moore who has since welcomed two little boys of her own says she's particularly excited to now rewatch the series from a mother's perspective.

""It’s been such a thrill to rewatch this series. The cast and the writers are just so incredibly talented that each episode has copious amounts of takeaways"" she explains. ""There’s obviously a lot of excitement in reigniting conversations that meant a lot to fans as well as excitement in reuniting and reminiscing.""

""But what I’m seeing as we rewatch is that my viewing perspective has shifted and it’s like watching it all unfold for the first time"" she notes. ""It’s been eight years since This Is Us premiered and I’ve lived a lot of life since then. I’m now a mom with two little boys and so I’m excited to rewatch all the episodes and rediscover the stories from a new perspective.""

Another special moment for the cast has been revisiting episodes of their costars who are no longer alive and honoring their legacy. (Ron Cephas Jones who played Randall's biological father William Hill died in August 2023 at age 66.)

""We try to honor Ron at every turn. Rewatching his performance is an education on acting and humanity. He is one of the most self-realized people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing"" says Sullivan.

""Oh boy it’s gonna hit hard! I can’t tell you exactly how I’ll react but it’ll be powerful. It was powerful shooting it and powerful watching it the first time"" adds Brown. ""I don’t anticipate it being any different.""

Ultimately the cast is just looking forward to fans finally being able to hear their new project and reigniting the bond they had for so long during the NBC hit's six-season run.

""It’s human nature for us as a society to seek connection and This Is Us connects people all around the world with the storylines themes and topics that are presented in every episode"" says Moore. ""Fans continue to watch and rewatch sharing what This Is Us means to them how it helped them navigate life differently not feel alone and even heal from trauma. Revisiting the Pearson’s stories can help us all do a bit of collective healing I think.""

The Sister Wives star took to her Instagram Stories on Sunday to share a snapshot of her special day.

She first posted a photo of her outdoor gardening area in North Carolina where she spends part of her time when she's not in Flagstaff Arizona.

""The NC garden adventure begins (technically I'm at the last part of planing seasons but that's life lol)"" Janelle wrote.

After reposting several birthday messages from friends and family Janelle also shared a photo of herself grinning as she sat in front of what appears to be a homemade German chocolate cake.

""A little red faced from working in the garden"" the TLC star wrote noting that the cake -- which her daughter Madison Brush made -- was mouth watering.

On Monday Janelle shared a video of herself with her new garden and planters boxes writing ""I'll be spending a lot of the summer in NC with Maddie Caleb and the kids so Maddie and I have made big plans for a garden. I am looking forward to learning how to grow veggies in a climate that has such a long season and way more moisture than I'm used to.""

It's been a challenging few months for Janelle whose son Garrison Brown died of suicide in March at the age of 25. Garrison was one of Janelle and her ex Kody Brown's six biological children.

Last month Janelle took to Instagram to honor what would have been Garrison's 26th birthday with a touching tribute video.

""Happy Birthday Sweetheart"" she wrote at the time. ""We are missing you terribly today. It’s hard to believe you aren’t here anymore.""

The Brown family has been estranged in recent years in the wake of Christine Janelle and Meri Brown's splits from Kody. Kody's relationship with his only remaining wife Robyn Brown and his presumed favoritism toward her has also caused friction between the former polygamist and his older children.

This was thoroughly documented on Sister Wives particularly his fractured relationship with his sons Garrison and Gabriel.

ET spoke with Janelle and Christine in November 2023 about Kody's estrangement from some of his family members. Janelle said that Kody wanted to have a better relationship with his kids.

""I think that's probably the goal right? He will eventually figure out how to have a relationship with his children. I mean I hope it will over time"" she told ET at the time.

Appearing on Jason Whitlock’s Fearless podcast Tuesday afternoon Brown reflected on what Tomlin meant to him on and off the field.

“Mike Tomlin…that dude was like my pops to be honest” an emotional Brown told Whitlock. “Ever since I met Mike Tomlin I always knew I’ll have success. I feel like when I went to the Steelers Mike Tomlin once I saw him and talked with him I knew I was going to the Steelers. Mike Tomlin was that father figure for me. Outside of coach. Obviously as a coach and the minutia as a coach he was always challenging me at the utmost to make sure I was better.”

Brown had a winding journey to the NFL. A Florida kid who played his college ball in the MAC at Central Michigan becoming a sixth round pick of the 2010 NFL Draft. Scouts questioned his level of competition his slight frame his 4.57 40-yard Combine time.

Pittsburgh took the chance on him late in the draft. He found the end zone on his first regular season touch taking a reverse for a touchdown on a kickoff against the Tennessee Titans. His role as a receiver was limited in the early goings but he made his name known in his debut playoff game. Tied 24-apiece against the Baltimore Ravens Brown made a 58-yard helmet catch down the right sideline on a 3rd and 19 heave from Ben Roethlisberger setting up the game-winning touchdown.

From there his career took off. He finished second on the team in receptions yards and touchdowns in 2011. His breakout year came in 2013 leading the team with 110 receptions for 1499 yards and eight touchdowns. His numbers became video-game like in 2014 leading the NFL in receptions (129) and yards (1698) and in his prime was essentially uncoverable. For six straight seasons he posted at least 100 receptions 1200 yards and eight touchdowns. In NFL history no one else has done it more than four times consecutive or not.

In his now famous interview with The Pivot in 2022 Mike Tomlin acknowledged Brown would never play for the Steelers again but spoke well of him.

“We had nine great years” Tomlin told Ryan Clark Fred Taylor and Channing Crowder. “I appreciate that dude in ways that I can’t explain to y’all that I won’t even bother to attempt to explain to y’all because it sounds like I’m defending him in some way…the nature of our relationship and what we all did together requires no defense.”

The feeling seems mutual.

“That guy Mike Tomlin always had my back always believed in me” Brown said. “So I’m always indebted to Mike Tomlin. He was one of those guys that’s stood in the foxhole for me. And that meant a lot to me.”

But Brown eventually felt like his time was up in Pittsburgh and he made a loud exit forcing the team to trade him. Brown hasn’t said he regrets the move telling Whitlock he was chasing a Super Bowl ring he eventually received with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. But had Brown stayed with Tomlin he might’ve gone down as the greatest receiver in NFL history. Instead he’ll be remembered for as much what he did off the field than on it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDI0LzUvdHJhdmlzLXNjb3R0LWFpci1qb3JkYW4tMS1sb3ctb2ctc3AtdmVsdmV0LWJyb3duLWRtNzg2Ni0yMDItcmVsZWFzZS1pbmZv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Travis Scott X Air Jordan 1 Low OG SP ""Velvet Brown"" Rumored To Be Arriving Soon","A new Travis Scott and Jordan Brand shoe is on its way and it looks like the partnership will be hitting the classic Air Jordan 1 Low OG SP.

During the second transatlantic dialog this week the UK Government said talks will focus on “priority areas” including digital and innovation green trade supporting small and medium enterprises and supply chain resilience.

Anne-Marie Trevelyan the International Trade Secretary said: “This dialogue gives us a platform to explore more modern digital ways of trading.

With progress stalled on a UK-US free trade deal the Government has switched its focus to making agreements with individual states in a bid to assist UK businesses.

Britain is expected to sign its first economic pacts with American states next month and secure an arrangement with Texas by October trade minister Penny Mordaunt told the House of Commons on Thursday.

“The first eight we have in the pipeline will be equivalent to 20% of the United States economy” she told MPs.

Ahead of the US-UK talks which begin on Monday the Department for International Trade said the discussions will pave the way for further engagement with the US including ongoing work at a state-level and removing barriers to trade.

In Aberdeen the International Trade Secretary will host her US counterpart Ambassador Katherine Tai with leaders from Scottish and UK governments as well as trade unions and business set to attend.

On Sunday the pair met with representatives from Scotland’s food and drink industry including Walker’s shortbread and Clootie McToot alongside leaders from US spirits company Brown-Forman which owns three of Scotland’s top distilleries GlenDronach Benriach and Glenglassaugh.

Shevaun Haviland director general of the British Chambers of Commerce described the UK and US as “natural trading partners”.

“Smaller businesses make up the majority of our membership and the UK economy so it’s vital they are given a voice in these talks and that they get to reap the benefits of both sides of the Atlantic” she said.

“Supply chain disruption and soaring inflation have reduced the operating margins of many small firms to almost nothing so reducing the costs of trade with the US would be a huge boost for them.

“This would then help communities right across the UK to see the benefits that improved trade with the US could bring.”

According the the trade department US investment supported more than 100000 jobs north of the border and generated nearly £50 billion for the Scottish economy.

Nearly a quarter of Scotland’s service exports are to the US and according to EY the US is its number one foreign investor.

And Scotch whisky continued to play a vital role in US-UK trade with almost two thirds of beverages exported to the United States coming from Scotland.

Allan Hogarth executive director of the Scottish North American Business Council said: “These discussions will cover vital areas to the Scottish UK and US economies – it is a great opportunity to make sure Scottish voices are heard on this our single biggest export market and to try and make it simpler for us all to continue to prosper and strengthen the transatlantic relationship for our mutual benefit.”

Iain Stewart UK Government minister for Scotland said: “At a time when we face immense global challenges joining with our friends in the US to lift barriers improve communication and encourage new and innovative ways of working together will support jobs across Scotland and beyond benefiting businesses of all sizes.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Hundreds of college football players will have a life-changing experience this week when they hear their names called by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell in the 2022 NFL draft staged for the first time in Las Vegas Thursday through Saturday.

A former UNLV quarterback Glenn Carano — now a retired Caesars Entertainment Inc. executive — enjoyed that experience in 1977 when he was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys serving primarily as a backup to Roger Staubach and Danny White in his career.

When drafted by the Cowboys Carano signed four years for $255000. Today’s minimum NFL salary is $660000 a year.

Carano whose family’s Reno gaming company formerly known as Eldorado Resorts Inc. acquired Caesars Entertainment in 2020 for $17.3 billion was a senior vice president for the company until his retirement last year.

More than 40 years after his draft experience Carano now sees the company he worked for in an important host role. He spoke with the Review-Journal about his draft experience UNLV and Caesars. The interview has been edited for clarity and length:

Review-Journal: Getting drafted by the Dallas Cowboys must have been a great thrill for you. What’s your greatest memory of your NFL draft experience?

Glenn Carano: As far as draft day goes the greatest experience and biggest anticipation is getting the phone call. It’s a TV event nowadays but back then it wasn’t. So to sit around with all your family and friends waiting to get that phone call was a big anticipation. And there probably were a couple of prank phone calls in there too. So sitting around waiting for that phone and finally getting a call from the Dallas Cowboys and them saying “Welcome to the Dallas Cowboys” that was big because the Dallas Cowboys were one of my dream teams growing up. After hearing that phone ring the party was on. My family threw a great party I got a big 10-gallon cowboy hat and a pair of cowboy boots in the deal.

Was that in Reno?

No it was in Las Vegas. I had an apartment right across the street from UNLV and we couldn’t fit enough people in it so because everybody was 21 at the time we actually moved downtown and rented a bar out and had a big party.

Eldorado Resorts and the Carano name are among the most familiar in Northern Nevada. How was it that you went to school at UNLV and not the University of Nevada Reno?

As a senior in high school you want to get away from home. You want to go someplace. I was recruited by Notre Dame USC Arizona State Washington and UNLV. Oddly enough UNR offered me only a half scholarship because they knew I wanted to go out of the city. I was actually going to go to Arizona State but at that time UNLV had a new head coach Ron Meyer and Coach Chris Ault was an assistant coach in Las Vegas. They put the full-court press on me and they even had the governor Mike O’Callaghan give me a call.

The full-court press worked. It kept me in the state of Nevada. The governor told me how important it was to stay in the state so it all worked out for me really well. It got me drafted in the second round by the Dallas Cowboys in 1977. I was the No. 54 pick. It was tough as you might imagine leaving Reno and going to Vegas.

What is your greatest memory playing football with the UNLV Rebels?

There are a lot of them. Probably the biggest memory that really encompasses everything was my sophomore year we went undefeated 11-0 the only undefeated team in UNLV history with an 11-game record. That team was so incredible because we had such a great nucleus of Nevada players. We had players from Reno and Las Vegas on that team and the Nevada nucleus is what made that team. We beat Boise State which as you know is always tough to beat and we beat Reno to go undefeated.

Once you became an executive with Caesars Entertainment you were on the other end of the NFL draft as a host to what is expected to be one of Las Vegas’ biggest special events. What’s the significance to Caesars of being a draft host.

I was in Nashville a couple of years ago when they had the draft down there. I actually left right before that draft started because we knew the party was going to be so big. When you take Nashville and put it on steroids you get Las Vegas. The Las Vegas draft is a great thing to hit the city. And the Caesars properties are right in the middle of everything the 50-yard line of the entire event. The draft as you know is such a huge spectacle itself it’s the big show or as Ed Sullivan would have said “It’s the really big shew.” The NFL Experience will be a great experience for Caesars with all our properties right there. Guests will have access to everything right there. The Linq the Caesars Forum conference center … it’s going to be a fantastic event.

What are some of your expectations for the draft days — Thursday through Saturday — at the Las Vegas Caesars properties? Robust room rates? Higher gaming revenues? Greater retail sales with some of the company’s many attractions?

I heard someone today say 500000 people are coming. This is a convention that’s come to town but this convention of people are not spending eight hours in a meeting room. They’re going to be spending 24 hours a day participating in the draft and everything that goes along with it. These people are coming to town to have a great time and naturally they’ll be spending a lot of time at the great restaurants that all of Las Vegas and Caesars properties have to offer. I had dinner at Bobby Flay’s restaurant last night. Amalfi is just a great restaurant right there at Caesars. People coming to the draft aren’t spending time in meetings; they’re spending time participating in our products. That’s going to drive revenue up in all different areas including restaurants bars entertainment and room rates. Everything will go up.

How important was it for Caesars to be one of the early partners of the NFL in sports wagering and how has that relationship grown since it first began?

It’s been incredibly important for Caesars and also for the NFL. Caesars is the largest gaming company in the United States. We have somewhere around 52 casinos around the country. To be linked in with the NFL and the NFL to be linked in with us and our partnerships with other teams throughout the league was important for both Caesars and the league. It shows that the NFL has great leadership there and Caesars’ leadership was smart enough to put it together and keep Caesars No. 1. Being represented throughout the country we had a great success kicking off our sportsbooks in the state of New York. We’ve had great success with our NFL partnership.

The Caesars marketing campaign with actors J.B. Smoove Halle Berry and the Manning family seems to have been a huge success. Will they continue to be a part of Caesars’ draft branding?

First of all I loved J.B. Smoove when I first saw him on “Curb Your Enthusiasm.” There’s no better Caesar than J.B. Smoove. I hope I get the chance to meet him in person. I just want to shake his hand. And Halle Berry as Cleopatra. She was Miss Teen All-American and Miss Ohio USA and first runner-up for Miss USA. She deserves to be Miss America but she’s been a beautiful Cleopatra.

I saw Peyton Manning speak in Las Vegas a few years ago. When I was a football player I really wasn’t that fond of Peyton until I saw him in a “Saturday Night Live” skit. When I saw that skit that sold me on Peyton.

And I’m probably one of the few guys you know that played flag football against Archie Manning. I played with him in a fund-raiser in Dallas and I was covering Archie and he was covering me because both teams had a number of different quarterbacks so he played receiver. He told me “You know I’ve got this kid going to Tennessee (Peyton) but my youngest kid could be the best one of all” and he was talking about Eli. So I don’t know how many people you know that have played against Archie Manning in flag football. A lot of people played against him in the NFL because he played many years for the New Orleans Saints. Poor guy didn’t have a great team around him there. I sure hope we have the Mannings as partners because they’re great ambassadors for football and our responsible gaming messages.

Caesars really hit a home run when they did those commercials with all of them.

Is Caesars already gearing up for Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas in February 2024? Do you expect Caesars to have a prominent role in that event?

Everybody is so enthused about the NFL draft here in Las Vegas everybody is looking so much forward to that I don’t see how you can think about the Super Bowl yet. This is going to be a big big week. The draft is Thursday Friday and Saturday and some things will actually get started Tuesday. I think the focus for the Caesars team has been making this event a huge success. Once the draft comes and goes the Raiders with Devante Adams and Derek Carr reuniting their college relationship will perhaps bring the Raiders to the Super Bowl right here in Las Vegas. Now that would be exciting.

Do you expect any UNLV athletes — or perhaps University of Nevada quarterback Carson Strong — to be drafted this year?

Most definitely Carson Strong will be drafted. He’s listed as one of the top six quarterbacks. The draft is a funny thing. When you start taking players in the draft and someone takes a quarterback the others start to fall in line faster. They’re talking about Malik Willis from Liberty going as soon as No. 6 or No. 8. If he goes soon then the other quarterbacks from Pittsburgh and Cincinnati if they go soon Carson Strong could be the fourth quarterback gone. I think he’ll be drafted in the top four rounds. I think he was hoping to be in the top two rounds.

Nevada-Reno has two receivers Romeo Dubbs a wide receiver and Cole Turner a tight end-slot receiver. They’re both very very good receivers. I believe they’ll be drafted in the top five rounds.

In Las Vegas the best prospect is running back Charles Williams. He’s got a good chance but it may be later because this doesn’t look like a big running back draft. Oddly enough when you look at positions teams are looking at quarterbacks naturally and wide receivers and offensive linemen and defensive edge rushers cornerbacks and safeties. Teams may not spend high draft picks on running backs because you have to amortize it over a longer period of time and running backs don’t tend to last that long.

In my draft in 1977 the top two picks were running backs Ricky Bell went to Tampa Bay and Tony Dorsett went to Dallas with me. It’s a different draft right now. Running backs aren’t really thought off as high picks. But good luck to Charles Williams. I’d love to see someone from UNLV drafted.

Seeing Nevada players drafted in an event in Nevada would be good.

The draft is a life-changer for these players. They go from making no money in college to making millions of dollars.

On Friday night the 12-time Grammy Award winner kicked off his Las Vegas residency Love in Las Vegas and he brought a slew of soul with him.

In the lead-up to the residency launch Legend promised that the show would be a spectacle and it was as it included a full band and vibrant set pieces. Throughout the concert Legend 43 sang smash hits from his entire catalogue including ""Used to Love U"" ""Ordinary People"" and his new yet-to-be-released song ""Dope.""

The two-hour show fluidly changed settings giving a different feel to portions — a church setting felt spiritual and impassioned whereas a block-party setting felt more boisterous.

The show inside Zappos Theater at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino featured elements from his 2021 tour Bigger Love Tour including intimate piano-centric moments but with an only-in-Vegas flare. An 18-member choir and band backed Legend as he gave a musical dissertation of his lengthy career.

After reflecting on the trying times during his quest to get a record deal he realized where his journey eventually led him. ""You're my dream come true Las Vegas"" he said.

The wide-ranging setlist was no doubt an accumulation of his career as he touched on both records he wrote and songs he was featured on — a special section of the show was dedicated to artists he worked with in his early days including Lauryn Hill JAY-Z Alicia Keys Kanye West and Slum Village.

The most sentimental moment of the show was arguably his stirring cover of Simon & Garfunkel's ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" which he performed on piano following a story about his late grandmother.

""When you hear me play and sing today you're hearing my grandmother through me"" he said. ""I always wished she was here to see all that she inspired.""

Denise Truscello/Getty for Caesars Entertainment

Never one to ignore his family Legend included wife Chrissy Teigen in a video vignette and even said hello to his 3-year-old son Miles who was in attendance and flanked by his mom mid-song. Prior to singing his smash hit ""All of Me"" he said of his wife ""She's inspired a lot of good songs. This might be the best one.""

Although Legend lives in Los Angeles he's obviously at home on stage.

While walking out of the theater as confetti rained down Legend thanked the opening-night crowd and called the show ""an act of love."" There's no question it was legitimately an act of Love… in Las Vegas.

Caesars Entertainment’s Caesars Rewards — one of the gaming industry’s largest customer loyalty offerings — won two awards at the 31st annual Freddie Awards.

The event was held on April 21 in New Orleans. Caesars Rewards took home “Best Customer Service” and “Best Promotion” in the Americas region.

The Freddie Awards are voted on by millions of frequent flyers and reward program members to honor excellence in the travel loyalty industry” according to a statement.

Caesars Rewards isn’t a stranger to accolades. With more than 65 million members it is the largest loyalty program in the gaming industry and has previously garnered awards from the Global Gaming Awards and in the USA Today Readers’ Choice Awards in addition to Freddie recognition.

In the 2022 edition of the Freddie Awards Caesars was the only gaming company to win in any of the three regions — Americas Europe Africa Asia and the Middle East.

Caesars Rewards Growth

Caesars Rewards achieved significant scale and dramatically expanded its membership roster by way of the 2020 acquisition of the casino by Eldorado Resorts which created “new Caesars.”

In 2019 prior to the aforementioned acquisition Caesars said it had “more than 55 million members worldwide” on its benefits roster. Eldorado’s One Club program had more than 10 million participants at the time that the takeover of Caesars was announced in mid-2019.

In terms of membership total the perks plan jumped by 20% thanks to the addition of 18 properties following Eldorado’s $17.3 billion acquisition of Caesars.

“Caesars Rewards is a fully connected ecosystem where members can earn and redeem credits on gaming hospitality entertainment nightlife dining and shopping at more than 50 destinations and through the Caesars Sportsbook app across the US” according to the gaming company.

Other Avenues for Caesars Rewards

Caesars Rewards members earn points through casino play hotel stays dining entertainment and other activities. At least one credit is earned for every dollar spent and there are six tier levels: Gold Platinum Diamond Diamond Plus Diamond Elite and Seven Stars.

Thanks to the US sports betting boom Caesars has another avenue for leveraging its customer loyalty program and it’s doing just that. Commentary from gaming industry executives indicate that rewards club members that bet on sports online or play at internet casinos are increasingly likely to visit an operator’s land-based casinos.

“Caesars Rewards members also have access to exclusive benefits and member rates at all Caesars Rewards destinations invitation-only events and once-in-a-lifetime experiences thanks to an extensive collection of sports entertainment celebrity chef and travel partnerships” according to the Harrah’s operator.

Caesars Rewards partners include hotel chains and Sun Country Airways among others."

But ghosts?

Even in paradise those beyond the grave are among the living if you know where to look. And for those who want to know more there is a tour experience that looks deeper into Hawaii's ghost stories.

""It's a cultural experience things that they never knew about historical things that they were not aware of that they can't find in any tour magazine or pamphlet"" said master storyteller Lopaka Kapanui of Mysteries of Hawaii a company that offers several walking tours to Hawaii's most haunted places.

""That's the advantage of being a cultural practitioner and a native of a place where you know a lot of the information that is not written down. Because we Hawaiians had a spoken language everything was transmitted"" he added.

Experience vs Tour

While they are labeled as ""tours"" Kapanui said the more accurate descriptor for the walking tours he offers through Mysteries of Hawaii are ""experiences.""

""I'm a storyteller not a tour guide so I'm not working for tips. The reason why it's an experience is because it becomes about the people who show up and much less about myself. And so according to people's capacity as far as spiritual reception or perception depends upon how the thing goes. Sensitive people will experience things"" he said.

Kapanui took over the experience from his former boss Glen Grant who started a Honoulu ghost tour in the 1970s. Kapanui said it's been quite a journey since he took over the business.

""It was very strict about getting everything straight facts"" he said. ""I had to listen and remember a tour that was from 7 p.m. in the evening to 2 a.m. in the morning. There are seven stops and every stop had two hours of stories which I had to memorize"" he said. ""And my mother trained me in the same way which sort of freaked me out when I first met my boss. But you know now I realize it was meant to be.""

It's the reason why Kapanui said his tour experiences are different because they are drawn from Hawaiian oral traditions.

Mysteries of old Honolulu

During a Saturday in early March I took the monthly ""Ghosts of Old Honolulu Walking Tour."" This 90-minute experience started in downtown Honolulu. My group was small but very engaged as Kapanui laid out some ground rules before we followed the paths once walked by royalty.

Kapanui emphasized they do not use scare tactics: ""There is no one hiding in the bushes to frighten you"" he said. ""We don't pretend to see things that are not there.""

From the state library building where we started the group walked over to the Iolani Palace where we heard stories about sightings of Queen Lili'uokalani from an upstairs bedroom where she was once imprisoned for months after the overthrow of the Hawaiian government.

From there we walked across the street to see the Kamehameha Statue Banyan trees the courthouse and the post office also known as the King David Kalakaua building which all have historical backstories and are supposedly filled with ghostly appearances.

The post office for example is believed to be haunted by the ghost of a postal worker named Benedict Westkaemper. At several points during the experience we were were asked to take pictures of each other in front of the Banyan trees and in the post office and some of the pictures later revealed something or someone in the shadows.

Kapanui also asked us to record ourselves near the Banyan trees and the courthouse where major events have taken place and ghostly sightings continue to haunt the grounds. ""That's why I tell people that this is really about you and how your energy your mentality and the things you bring with you right now"" said Kapanui.

Bottom Line

Instead Plotkin said he planned to take the next few weeks to decide on next steps before closing his hedge fund.

“I am sorry. I got this one wrong. I made a mistake. I apologize” wrote the hedge-fund mogul — who famously got slammed by “meme stock” investors on Reddit last year who had targeted his fund for being a prominent short seller.

On Wednesday Plotkin angered investors when he suggested a plan that would return investors their capital at the end of June — and then allow them to reinvest in the beginning of July.

Melvin which was down 21% in the first quarter said he wouldn’t try and make investors whole. Instead he’d demand performance fees of potential clients including those who previously lost money with him. According to reports Plotkin said he would keep the new fund small — under $5 billion and focus on shorting stocks.

Plotkin added in the Sunday email that after speaking with investors he realized his suggestion to shut down Melvin was “tone deaf.”

Melvin Capital got slammed last year for its position on GameStop. INA FASSBENDER

“Some of you feel that we were not being a good partner. Upon reflection you are right” Plotkin wrote.

Investors were left scratching their heads after the initial note. But now they’re more confused than ever sources told The Post. One investor griped that the email was “f***ing wacky.” This investor added he had “no clue what the email actually meant.”

“I just want my money back” the investor fumed.

While the mea culpa Plotkin sent Sunday may have struck a more deferential tone than his note Wednesday investors still don’t appear to be happy. “He lost a lot of us a lot of money” the source adds

Plotkin is evidently still licking his wounds after the now-famous short squeeze on meme stock GameStop crushed his fund in January 2021.

The full text of the letter is below:

To our fellow partners

I am sorry. I got this one wrong. I made a mistake. I apologize.



As we noted in our letter last week we tried to balance several objectives when determining a path forward. Our focus was on getting back to a size at which we could again generate industry leading returns for our investors while retaining the team we have built over a decade. After exploratory conversations with several investors in which we had received positive feedback we decided to move forward with the approach we outlined in our letter.



In hindsight and despite our intentions we recognize now that we focused on future returns and team continuity without sufficient consideration of your investment losses. We appreciate how difficult January 2021 was for all of you and are pained that we have not acknowledged this enough. After numerous conversations with our investors on Thursday Friday and Saturday it is clear to me that I was initially tone deaf. I especially want to thank our day one investors for their candid thoughts. Some of you feel that we were not being a good partner. Upon reflection you are right.



Integrity is a fundamental value at our firm. My grandfather Melvin after whom our firm is named lived by the highest ethical standards and he imparted those values to me. There is sufficient interest and critical mass to move forward with the plan laid out in last week’s letter. That’s now completely irrelevant to me. At this time our go-forward structure needs to be about partnership and principle. We are taking the next two to three weeks to process the input we have received from all our investors and we will come back with a more balanced proposal that better aligns our collective interest.



I try to teach my kids that everyone makes mistakes but ultimately it is about how you handle them. Accountability is critical. I got this wrong and for that I apologize to each of you.

Sincerely

Gabe

The Washington Capitals fell to the Toronto Maple Leafs 4-3 in the shootout Sunday night at Capital One Arena. The shootout loss drops the Capitals record to 44-23-12 (100 points) on the season. They remain one point behind the Penguins for third place in the Metropolitan Division with one game in hand.

The Capitals opened the scoring with a goal from T.J. Oshie less than six minutes into the contest but the Maple Leafs would answer less than seven minutes later for the 1-1 tie at the first intermission.

After a scoreless middle frame the Capitals regained the lead on Lars Eller’s 13th goal of the season and stretched the lead to 3-1 on Marcus Johansen’s 9th goal of the season. The Leafs would answer late in the period to make it 3-2 and would tie it late at 6-on-5 sending the game to overtime.

After a scoreless overtime period the Maple Leafs would win it in the 7th round of the shootout.

From 2010 to 2019 opioid overdoses claimed the lives of more than 23700 Ohioans with countless others having had their lives torn apart by opioid addiction in other ways.

It’s not clear when the money will start to be distributed. Details are still forming day-to-day on how the money will be handled as the state and each region develops their committees and boards.

The state has been carved up into 19 regions.

There’s also a state board selecting projects that are submitted for approval.

The settlement which is scheduled to be paid over 18 years also calls for a continuous annual flow of settlement money meaning that the distributors can pay extra in a given year but that additional money will come off the back end so that there is no disruption of payments.

OneOhio the state’s plan to jointly approach settlement negotiations and litigation with the drug manufacturers and distributors of opioids has been incorporated into the settlement with 85% of the settlement money targeted for local distribution:

55% goes to a foundation created to disburse the money and fund programs that benefit Ohioans affected by opioids and/or prevent addiction.

30% is earmarked for community recovery programs at the local level.

15% goes to the state of Ohio.

In addition to the monetary settlement Cardinal McKesson and AmerisourceBergen must also make significant internal changes to help prevent a similar crisis such as give an independent clearing house their aggregated data on where the drugs are going and how often.

OneOhio regions

Ohio was carved into 19 regions which will each recommend what gets local funding from the opioid settlement. Counties in Southwest Ohio are part of three of those regions.

Region 8: Montgomery County

Region 15: Preble Darke Miami Champaign Allen Mercer Logan and Auglaize counties

Special to The Columbus Dispatch

In its exhibits Franklin Park Conservatory and Botanical Gardens has a knack for finding art works that speak to the human connection with the natural world.

“SPOKE: The Visual Poetry & Environmental Art of Artist Olga Ziemska” on view through May 30 in the Conservatory’s Cardinal Health Gallery is an impressive and thought-provoking display of wall sculptures made with natural materials and photographs of outdoor sculptures throughout the world and close to home.

Visual arts:Aminah Robinson's flair for capturing stories and people shared in exhibit

Ziemska 45 the first in her Polish family to be born in the United States began her education studying political science and English at Cleveland State University then earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts at the Columbus College of Art & Design. Her master’s degree in sculpture is from the Rhode Island School of Design.In between in 2002 she studied in Poland on a Fulbright Fellowship. All aspects of her background are evident in her works which blend masterful sculptures with poetry.

One of the chromogenic prints of her sculptures is of “Listen” an outdoor piece in the Centre of Polish Sculpture Oronsko Poland. Nine tall and slender birch logs culminate at their tops with plaster human hands. Part of Ziemska’s accompanying poem reads: “Long thin birch log limbs/Hands perched atop/Signaling signing saying L-I-S-T-E-N.”

Three wall sculptures (“Matrix 01 02 and 03”) are built with reclaimed wood slices willow branches and burnt text. The installations look like they were built with Tinker Toys with a single letter placed on each wood slice. The letters and words are slightly difficult to decipher causing viewers to take their time reading Ziemska’s poem.

“In a lot of my work I try to slow people down make them more aware of their surroundings and themselves” Ziemska said in a telephone interview from her home in Cleveland.

Part of her poem in “Matrix 03” (2021) reads: “The body is nothing without that which surrounds it” emphasizing the bond between humans and nature that is a familiar refrain in her work.

Other sculptures include “Unicellular” (2018) an oval-shaped map of the world created with reclaimed wood slices willow and pine and “Czarna Madonna (Black Madonna)” (2022) a huge woman’s profile built of pine charred pine and pyrite gemstones.

In 2018 Ziemska completed “Feather Point” a public sculpture for the Thaddeus Kosciuszko Park in Dublin Ohio. The photograph of the sculpture shows a 20-foot-tall sand-cast stainless-steel feather inspired according to the artist by the intersection of Polish and Wyandot Native American cultures in central Ohio.

The work she said blends the stories of Bill Moose the last Wyandot Native American who lived in the area and Kosciuszko a Polish general who aided the Americans in the Revolutionary War. The feather she said represents “the universals that are common to all humans on earth.”

Another Ziemska sculpture for central Ohio is underway. The large-scale public art piece “1000 Eyes” should be completed and installed this summer on Parsons between Broad and Oak streets in Olde Towne East. The 13-foot-tall piece was inspired by area history including the work of woodcarver Elijah Pierce and a Native American mound that gave Mound Street its name.

In the meantime viewers can sample Ziemska’s sculptures and get a glimpse of her outdoor pieces that can be found in places around the world in her striking exhibit at the conservatory.

“There was a gathering of people out in the parking lot as far as I know it was just a gathering people were all over the parking lot so nobody had an inkling it was going to escalate into a problem” said William Patrick Davis Owner of Davis Shows Northwest Carnival.

According to Davis the shooting occurred on the southside of the carnival. He and his staff cleared all the attractions and directed patrons to the northside of the parking lot away from the incident.

Since last night Davis Shows Northwest Carnival has added extra security and briefed all employees on their safety precautions in case another incident occurs.

“We're taking every single precaution we can every single day. There's no reason to be afraid to come to a fair the most that we can do is keep our heads up stay aware and have a good time” said Mariah St. Germaine carnival staff.

Rogue Valley Mall has added extra security to patrol in the carnival and throughout the parking lot for today and throughout next week.

The carnival will remain open until next Sunday with their only days off being Monday and Tuesday.

His destination: a beach-sidestreet party called the Cosmic Trumpets where hundreds of half-clothed revellers had gathered to celebrate their first carnival since Covid. His message: that the scandal involving the purchase of tens of thousands of erectile dysfunction tablets by President Jair Bolsonaro’s defense ministry was an intolerable affront.

“Carnival is politics too” said Silva a 43-year-old psychologist for Brazil’s health service as he prepared to spend the day denouncing Bolsonaro’s “completely fascist” government by disguising himself as a packet of 50mg impotence pills.

Silva was not the only one with politics on his mind this week as bacchanalia gripped Rio’s streets for the first time since February 2020.

With a bruising electoral battle for Brazil’s soul less than six months away many saw carnival as a chance to vent their spleen at Brazil’s far-right president who retains a ferociously loyal support base but is repudiated by more than half of voters.

Loud cries of “Bolsonaro out!” erupted at Rio’s Sambadrome on Friday night as the city’s top samba schools held their first processions since the coronavirus pandemic began. The president’s son Senator Flávio Bolsonaro was stalked and taunted by angry revellers while trying to watch the parades while a banner demanding his father’s removal was unfurled from one of the stands.

Spectators in one of the Sambadrome’s exclusive “luxury boxes” shouted insults about Bolsonaro’s main presidential rival the former leftist president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. But on the working-class terraces and at the roaming street parties known as blocos there was support for Lula.

“I feel hopeful because I believe democracy must prevail over authoritarianism – and there’s only one candidate who can achieve this and it’s Lula” said Angelo Morse 43 who woke up at 4.30am on Thursday to join a bloco called What a Lovely Wetland.

Morse an educator who claimed to be a distant relative of the North American inventor Samuel FB Morse came to carnival wearing an alligator costume designed to protest at Bolsonaro’s handling of a Covid outbreak which has left more than 660000 Brazilians dead.

“President Bolsonaro is a moron and said that if you got vaccinated you’d turn into an alligator” he said by way of explanation as the square around him filled with inebriated partygoers dressed as pirates devils nuns superheroes sea creatures and in one case a bottle of Heinz Yellow Mustard. One carried a portrait showing Bolsonaro spewing a river of green sewage.

On a nearby lawn the art director Maria Estephania spoke despondently about the social cultural and economic decline she believed had played out since Bolsonaro’s shock 2018 election victory.

“We fucked ourselves” by electing Bolsonaro Estephania 34 said with a sigh as she took a break from partying at Liquid Loves a bloco inspired by the work of the sociologist Zygmunt Bauman.

Estephania’s outfit – a scarlet cape plastered with stickers promoting Lula and Marcelo Freixo a leftist ally she hopes will be elected Rio’s next governor – identified an alternative future. “It’s an election year and we need to reaffirm our values which bear no relation to those of the political group which currently holds power” Estephania said. “Our values have absolutely nothing to do with Bolsonaro.”

Not everybody wanted to talk politics as carnival returned after a two-year Covid hiatus.

At a bloco outside Rio’s Museum of Tomorrow Eduardo Faria a portly motorbike courier in a turquoise tutu busied himself filling a penis-shaped water-pistol with mineral water. “I’m just here to have fun! No politics please!” the 39-year-old giggled. “It’s carnival!”

Farther west in Vila Mimosa Rio’s red light district another raucous procession was about to begin led by sex workers and samba musicians. The most modestly dressed partygoer was Everson Almeida a former seminarist wearing the black cassock he used before ditching plans to join the priesthood. A sticker beneath his clerical collar declared: “Bolsonaro out!”

“He’s a sore on our society” said Almeida 29 who balked at Bolsonaro’s portrayal of himself as a God-fearing Christian. “Christ came to deliver a message of shelter and inclusion not segregation selfishness and conflict.”

As the drummers warmed up Almeida voiced confidence that the Bolsonaro era was entering its final chapter with Lula leading in the polls.

“God willing [he’s finished]” he said pointing heavenwards. “And this must be what He wants.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzL3dvcmxkLzIwMjIvMDQvMjMvYnJhemlsLWNhcm5pdmFsLXBhcmFkZXMtcmlvLXNhbi1wYXVsby1jb3ZpZC83NDIyODgzMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brazil's Carnival parades return to Rio Sao Paulo after COVID delay,"David Biller and Mauricio Savarese

The Associated Press

RIO DE JANEIRO — Colorful floats and flamboyant dancers are delighting tens of thousands jammed into Rio de Janeiro's iconic Sambadrome putting on a delayed Carnival celebration after the pandemic halted the dazzling displays.

Rio de Janeiro’s top samba schools began strutting their stuff late Friday which was the first evening of the two-night spectacle.

Ketula Melo 38 a muse in the Imperatriz Leopoldinense school dressed as the Iemanja deity of Afro-Brazilian religions was thrilled to be back at the Sambadrome.

“These two years were horrible. Now we can be happy again” Melo said as she was about to enter Friday night wearing a black and white costume made of shells that barely covered her body.

Rio's Sambadrome has been home to the parade since the 1980s and is a symbol of Brazil's Carnival festivities. During the pandemic it was a shelter for more than 400 homeless people and also served as a vaccination station.

Brazil confirmed its first cases of the coronavirus in mid-March 2020 just after that year's Carnival festivities came to an end. The 2021 edition was swiftly cancelled due to the rise of the delta variant. More than 663000 people have died from COVID-19 in Brazil the second highest of any country in the world according to Our World in Data an online research site.

Entire communities rally around the competing samba schools whose shows are not only a source of pride but also employment since preparations require countless seamstresses welders costume designers and more. There are months of rehearsals for dancers and drummers so participants can learn the tune and the lyrics for their school's song. The pandemic upended these samba schools' way of life for two years.

Sao Paulo also kicked off its Carnival parade Friday evening. Both cities' parades usually take place in February or March but their mayors in January jointly announced they were postponing Carnival by two months due to concerns about the proliferation of the omicron variant.

Drop in cases:As COVID-19 cases fall experts are optimistic but for how long?

The number of COVID-19 cases and deaths has plunged since then and more than three-quarters of Brazilians are fully vaccinated according to the country's health ministry. Local authorities have allowed soccer matches with full attendance since March.

Rio authorities said earlier this week those attending the parade would have to show proof of vaccination but media reports showed that attendees had no trouble getting tickets or entering the Sambadrome without showing the required documents.

A seat in the bleachers cost about $50 and the most expensive seats can cost more than $1260. Going out in one of the samba schools costs a lot for tourists but it is often free for people who are involved with the parade all year round like 66-year-old Juciara do Nascimento Santos. She was among the revelers starting this year's parade with the Imperatriz Leopoldinense samba school.

“We had to take care of ourselves during this time so we could be here today celebrating life” said Santos who has paraded with Imperatriz Leopoldinense since 1984. This time she was in the section of the baianas often reserved for the oldest women of each samba school. Many of these samba schools reported they lost many of their baianas to the virus.

For those unwilling to shell out for the price of admission there were street parties across Rio – despite City Hall denying authorization for them to take place citing insufficient time to prepare. Some organizers couldn't care less arguing that celebrating Carnival wasn't contingent on authorities' consent and partiers hit the streets in force.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYnJvd25hbmR3aGl0ZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNC8yNC91bml2ZXJzaXR5LXByb2R1Y3Rpb25zLWhvbGRzLXNwcmluZy1jYXJuaXZhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,University Productions holds Spring Carnival,"Lehigh University Productions held a Spring Carnival on the UC Front Lawn for students to have fun and enjoy the warmer weather.

The event took place on April 22 and featured food music and a variety of booths hosted by student clubs volunteers or outsourced vendors. Students played games to earn tickets that could be used to purchase prizes ranging from candy to LED Lights to hammocks. Other attractions included a mechanical bull fortune telling and an inflatable obstacle race course.

Emily Randolph ‘24 one of the event directors for University Productions wanted to plan the event for students on campus to enjoy and engage with each other. Originally she said she wanted to host the carnival during the fall semester but underestimated the amount of time planning took.

“The planning just started back in January while we were still on winter break – it was a lot of deciding what we wanted the carnival (to be like)” Randolph said. “We basically had to choose our vendors see how much everything would be. We looked at food truck options Lehigh dining options and then other vendors.”

The event proved to be popular as many booths created lines of 10 or more students and found themselves running out of tickets.

Alex Creamer ‘25 took notice of how busy the carnival was. He said he thought the big turnout might have been partially attributed to the carnival being on the same day as many admissions tours.

“It’s great stuff man” Creamer said. “It’s actually pretty nice and refreshing that the university goes out of their way to put all this stuff here.”

Despite the amount of people present the vendors like Jessie Reyes ‘25 did not feel discouraged. Reyes volunteered for the sand art booth which gave out clear plastic containers in various shapes such as shells and whales which students then filled with different colored sand. The booth gave students three tickets for participating and found that they sold out nearly an hour and a half after the event began.

“I think that at first they did it for the tickets” Reyes said. “When they realized how fun the sand art was and the little things that we filled they actually had a lot of fun with it.”

The carnival also allowed students to represent their clubs and their respective cultural backgrounds.

The Southeast Asia at Lehigh (SEAL) club’s booth featured a play on a Vietnamese fishing game where participants had to catch as many fish as possible within a minute. Participants then received prizes depending on how many fish they caught. The prizes included Choco Pies and sticker packs.

“It’s been good we’ve actually had a lot of traction” said Kellia Nguyen ‘24 co-president of SEAL. “Obviously there’s a lot of students here but it’s kind of nice to see everyone so interested in our Vietnamese fishing game because we’re so underrepresented here at Lehigh.”

Many students and those involved alike expressed hopes that University Productions and Lehigh hold large-scale events similar to the carnival in the future.

“It should be something that’s done every semester” Joshua Nsubaga ‘25 said.

Nsubaga said that his favorite parts of the carnival included the food people the festive atmosphere and the inflatable obstacle race course.

“I totally think this is actually one of the best things they’ve done all year” said Brian Nguyen ‘22 co-president of SEAL. “This is a lot of fun especially if the weather keeps holding up throughout most of the month and right before finals. It’s a good way to destress.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3NwYWNlY29hc3RkYWlseS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNC9wb3J0LWNhbmF2ZXJhbC13ZWxjb21lcy1jYXJuaXZhbC1mcmVlZG9tLXByZXBhcmluZy1mb3ItaW5hdWd1cmFsLXNhaWxpbmctZnJvbS1jcnVpc2UtdGVybWluYWwtNi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Port Canaveral Welcomes Carnival Freedom Preparing for Inaugural Sailing from Cruise Terminal 6,"Port Canaveral Welcomes Carnival Freedom Preparing for Inaugural Sailing from Cruise Terminal 6

The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy celebrated its 73rd anniversary on Saturday by announcing over the past days the commissioning of half a dozen powerful warships and two types of advanced vessel-based helicopters which have already started training to form combat capabilities. These achievements are a reflection of the Navy's rapid tremendous growth over the recent years which is enabling the naval force to resolutely safeguard national sovereignty security and development interests top officers on some of the country's mightiest warships said in exclusive interviews with the Global Times.An official video introducing China's aircraft carrier program released on Friday also gave a very obvious hint that the country's third aircraft carrier will be officially revealed soon.Media reports revealed before the Navy's birthday that at least six new surface vessels were commissioned namely a Type 075 amphibious assault ship three Type 055 large destroyers and two Type 052D destroyers.Having just recently entered service as China's second Type 075 amphibious assault ship the Guangxi will soon join the Hainan the first ship of this class that was commissioned exactly a year ago on April 23 in dual-ship formation training reported the China Central Television (CCTV) on Saturday.This has significant meaning to the fast development of the PLA's amphibious combat capabilities as it shows that the PLA is rapidly achieving the capability of multi-domain multidimensional landing Senior Captain Wang Yanguang political commissar at a naval vessel training center said in the report.While the first Type 075 amphibious assault ship Hainan entered service with the Southern Theater Command that faces the South China Sea the second ship Guangxi entered service with the Eastern Theater Command which is in charge of the East China Sea and the Taiwan Straits according to a press release by the PLA Eastern Theater Command.The Guangxi has already started basic training including navigation organization combat rescue and damage control as well as integration practices with helicopters amphibious armored vehicles and air-cushioned landing craft CCTV reported. Military analysts told the Global Times that the ship will gain combat capability very fast as the first ship has already gathered valuable experience.A total of three 10000 ton-class Type 055 large destroyers were announced and are now in service with the Navy namely the Anshan and the Wuxi with the Northern Theater Command and the Yan'an with the Southern Theater Command taking the total number of Type 055 in service to six.The Anshan and the Wuxi recently joined the Lhasa the second ship in the Type 055 class in a series of examination drills in the Yellow Sea meaning that three new powerful large destroyers were gathered in the same region at the same time reflecting how fast China has been building new warships CCTV reported on Friday.Having just entered service a month ago the Wuxi aims to achieve operational capability within 2022 the report quoted Senior Captain Zhao Shuqian the skipper of the ship as saying.The Navy also revealed the commissioning of two Type 052D destroyers namely the Shaoxing and the Baotou. The Shaoxing recently joined a series of realistic combat drills organized by the Eastern Theater Command Navy while the Baotou recently joined a five-day live-fire drill in the Yellow Sea according to official media reports.Senior Captain Zhou Minghui skipper of the Nanchang the first Type 055 told the Global Times in an exclusive interview shortly before the Navy anniversary that his ship is taking every opportunity to carry out a wide diversity of missions to test the ship's reliability and find problems so future ships can be improved.Over the past 10 years warships of the Navy have seen great developments and the concepts of how they are used have also changed as new vessels are bound to sail to far seas and face more challenges Zhou said.Zhou used to be the executive officer on the Type 052 destroyer Qingdao and skipper of the Type 052D destroyer Xining and is now the skipper of the Type 055 Nanchang. He said that China's fast speed of shipbuilding reflects its high level of industrial strength and the growing capability of national defense.The Navy has also recently enlisted a number of auxiliary vessels like replenishment ships rescue ships and new-type aircraft the CCTV said.Two shipborne variations of China's domestically developed Z-20 medium-lift helicopter were revealed for the first time in a CCTV report on Saturday.It shows a vessel-based utility version of the Z-20 taking off from the helicopter deck of a Type 055 large destroyer then a vessel-based anti-submarine version of the Z-20 also leaving a Type 055.The Z-20 is more capable than the smaller Z-9 while more flexible than the larger Z-8. The utility version can be tasked with missions including transport landing assault reconnaissance and search and rescue while the anti-submarine version can carry out missions like patrol as well as the search and attack of submarines experts told the Global Times noting that they will be found not only on the Type 055 but also the Type 075 the Type 052D and others.

The Navy is transforming itself from small boats to large ships from coastal regions to far seas from individual sailors to the whole system from airfields to carriers and from maritime only to all-terrain making strides in the process observers said.Vessels and aircraft of the Navy patrol the South China Sea East China Sea and the Taiwan Straits all day long the Global Times learned. They often encounter provocations by foreign vessels and aircraft that sometimes even point fire-control radars at them but the PLA forces always take resolute measures and do not let them do what they please. It has also become routine that vessels of the Navy break the island chains and conduct drills in far seas.Since 2008 the Chinese Navy has dispatched 40 task forces with more than 100 vessels for escort missions in the Gulf of Aden and waters off Somalia safeguarding more than 7000 Chinese and foreign vessels saving nearly a hundred from danger the Navy said in a press release sent to the Global Times. This means the growing PLA Navy not only safeguards its motherland but also makes important contribution to world peace analysts said.

One day ahead of the founding anniversary the Navy on Friday released a promotional video on China's aircraft carrier program in which it gave a very obvious hint that the country's third aircraft carrier will be officially revealed soon.Jointly produced by the PLA Navy Political Publicity Bureau and the PLA News Broadcasting Center the promotional video is the first of its kind as it introduces the progress of China's aircraft carrier program including the development of the country's first carrier Liaoning the second carrier Shandong and the carrier-based fighter jet J-15.At the end of the video a naval officer had a phone call with his mother who urged him to have a ""third child"" and the officer replied ""That's the plan."" As the phone call went on the camera moved from a picture of the Liaoning to the Shandong and stopped at a blank space of the wall.This is a very clear implication that the country's third aircraft carrier is coming soon observers said.The new carrier likely to feature new technologies including electromagnetic catapults could be launched within 2022 experts said.

It will likely also get a new type of fighter jet from the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China a major contractor of PLA's aircraft which sent birthday celebration to the Navy on Saturday on social media by posting a cartoon drawing depicting what seems like a FC-31 stealth fighter jet operating from an aircraft carrier dubbed ""No. 3.""In terms of personnel China's first aircraft carrier the Liaoning has trained more than 1000 backbone talent for the second carrier Shandong and more carriers to come said Captain Wang Zesen political commissar of the Liaoning on the CCTV on Friday.The Chinese Navy will have more pilots more aircraft carriers and more carrier-based aircraft as well as more powerful measure and more reliable instruments in the future to resolutely safeguard national sovereignty security and development interests Senior Captain Xu Ying executive officer of the aircraft carrier Shandong told the Global Times in an exclusive interview shortly before the Navy's anniversary.China's carrier development has passed the initial exploration phase and has entered the phase of improvement and acceleration said Xu who is also one of the first Chinese carrier-based pilots.""We need to sail to more unfamiliar waters face more complicated weather and sea conditions in more complex missions and have more accompanying forces"" Xu said.The PLA Navy will continue its development that aims at becoming a world-class navy the Navy said in the press release sent to the Global Times.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFyZXZpZXcuY29tLzI0MDQyMDIyLWNoaW5hLW1pbGl0YXJ5LXByLXZpZGVvLWhpbnRzLWF0LXRoaXJkLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWNhcnJpZXItbGF1bmNoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China: Military PR Video Hints At Third Aircraft Carrier Launch,"By RFA

A newly released military propaganda video suggests that the third aircraft carrier of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) could be launched soon Chinese media and experts said.

A six-minute video produced by the PLA Navy Political Publicity Bureau and the army broadcaster was posted on Friday. It provides a glimpse into China’s aircraft carrier program and how the PLA carriers and personnel operate.

China already has two aircraft carriers in operation named Liaoning and Shandong. The third is being built and the promotional video seems to give a hint that its launch is imminent.

At the end of the video timed for China’s Navy Day which falls on Saturday an officer is shown taking a call from his mother who appears to urge him to have “the third child” to which the man replies: “That’s being arranged.”

The camera then moves to two photos of a carrier’s flight deck – an apparent reference to the first two aircraft carriers – before shifting to a blank screen and closing credits.

This bizarre hint nevertheless got some Chinese media excited. The state-run tabloid Global Times wrote: “This is a very clear implication that the country’s third aircraft carrier is coming soon.”

The Global Times quoted Song Zhongping a Chinese military expert and TV commentator as saying that the third carrier known as Type 003 could be launched “in the second half of 2022.”

The paper said the carrier may be named Jiangsu after the province in eastern China.

Covid lockdown

“From the video it does seem that the third Chinese carrier would be launched in the near future” said Sheu Jyh-Shyang a military expert at the Taiwan’s Institute for National Defence and Security Research (INDSR).

The U.S. think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a report last November that the launch “could be as soon as February 2022” but it has been delayed several times as China is struggling with the Covid pandemic.

Recently severe lockdown measures have been imposed in Shanghai home of the Jiangnan Shipyard where the Type 003 is being constructed – and where the Covid situation has disrupted shipping and may have caused delays in arrival of components for the vessel.

Compared to the first two carriers the Type 003 appears to be larger and it has some new important components including catapult systems used for launching aircraft from the ship.

“It is the first CATOBAR (Catapult Assisted Take-Off Barrier Arrested Recovery) carrier that China has” said Sheu from INDSR.

“CATOBAR carriers have much better capabilities but they still need to have enough operating experience” he added.

The CSIS report last November also said that after launch it would still be years before the Type 003 is commissioned into the PLA Navy and achieves initial operating capability.

China already has the biggest naval fleet in the world according to the US Office of Naval Intelligence. But the U.S. has far more aircraft carriers: 11 compared to China’s two.

Vulnerable as the ‘Moskova’

Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense which is watching China’s military developments closely said in a report published earlier this year that the Type 003 would enable the PLA Navy to project power past the “first island chain.”

The first island chain conceptualized during the Cold War commonly refers to the major archipelagos that lie off the East Asian mainland coast. The chain stretches from the Kamchatka Peninsula in the northeast to the Malay Peninsula in the southwest and includes the territory of U.S. allies Taiwan and the Philippines.

Taiwanese observers also pay attention to the PLA’s plan to procure new warplanes for the Type 003.

“The first two (aircraft carriers) have only J-15 fighters and maybe some helicopters but the third one may have some airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) KJ-600 aircraft” military analyst Sheu said.

The Xian KJ-600 is said to accurately detect and track other airplanes and so greatly increases the effectiveness of carrier-based combat aircraft.

Meanwhile Taiwanese media have been looking at the sinking of Russia’s flagship “Moskva” reportedly by Ukrainian Neptune missiles last week. Russia said it was damaged in an unexplained fire.

The missile cruiser Moskva was built in the same Black Sea Shipyard Mykolaiv in Ukraine as China’s first aircraft carrier back in the Soviet days. Beijing bought the ship then called Varyag and renamed it to Liaoning.

The Liaoning regularly patrols the Taiwan Strait and may be deployed in the event of armed conflict with the self-governing island. China considers Taiwan a breakaway province that shall be united with the mainland.

Taiwanese newspaper Liberty Times quoted an analyst as saying that “Taiwan has a bigger and more powerful anti-ship missile arsenal than Ukraine.”

The Chinese aircraft carriers could be “as vulnerable as the ‘Moskva’ to Taiwan’s anti-ship missile” it said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9ob3ctZXRoaW9waWFuLWFpcmxpbmVzLXJlbWFpbmVkLXByb2ZpdGFibGUtZHVyaW5nLXRoZS1wYW5kZW1pYy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Ethiopian Airlines Remained Profitable During The Pandemic,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9ob3ctZXRoaW9waWFuLWFpcmxpbmVzLXJlbWFpbmVkLXByb2ZpdGFibGUtZHVyaW5nLXRoZS1wYW5kZW1pYy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHRpbWVzLmNuL3BhZ2UvMjAyMjA0LzEyNjAxODUuc2h0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China’s home-built aircraft carrier Shandong starts 1st maintenance refurbishment: media reports,"The picture shows aircraft carrier Shandong berths at a naval port in Sanya.

The Shandong China's second aircraft carrier and the first developed domestically reportedly started its first scheduled maintenance and refurbishment that is expected to enhance the flattop's usability after more than two years of active service. The procedure could involve the painting of new non-skid coating as well as repairs and upgrades for some subsystems and the carrier would come back stronger than ever in a few months observers said on Sunday.



Moored in a berth at Dalian Shipyard in Northeast China's Liaoning Province where the carrier was constructed the Shandong was receiving painting of new non-skid coating to its flight deck on Saturday the 73rd founding anniversary of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy Hong Kong-based news website wenweipo.com reported on the day.



This is the first scheduled usability enhancement maintenance of the Shandong back at its shipyard since its commissioning into the PLA Navy in December 2019 in Sanya South China's Hainan Province and the workers at the shipyard are working extra shifts for the refurbishment according to the wenweipo.com report.



The main dock of the Dalian Shipyard has been cleared after a civilian ship left on April 13 but the Shandong has not yet entered the dock the report said.



On March 18 the Shandong sailed through the Taiwan Straits from south to north without aircraft on its flight deck Reuters reported at the time citing the island of Taiwan's defense authority and an anonymous source. Analysts said then that the carrier was likely on its way from its homeport in Sanya to its shipyard in Dalian for a regular maintenance.





In addition to refreshing the non-skid coating of the flight deck the maintenance could also feature the refurbishment repair and upgrade of some subsystems that tends to wear and tear like the arresting gear the power system pipelines and electronics systems a military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Sunday.



A comprehensive examination to the carrier could be carried out and upgrades and overhaul could be made to those parts that encountered problems or can be optimized based on the experiences gained over the past two years the expert said.



It is totally normal for aircraft carriers to conduct this kind of regular maintenance and this procedure could take a few months the expert said noting that the Shandong would become more powerful and combat-ready after the refurbishment.



A refurbishment to the Liaoning China's first aircraft carrier took about six months from July 2018 to January 2019 also in the Dalian Shipyard according to media reports.

Cricket Wireless at a glance

As we’ve alluded to Cricket Wireless is an MVNO that joined the AT&T family in 2014 as part of a merger with AIO wireless. The carrier currently serves a base of 12.4 million subscribers up from five million before the merger. Cricket isn’t Better Business Bureau accredited though it does have an A-plus rating. The page is also in the process of being updated which may impact the accreditation as well as the customer reviews.

5GB Plan Simple name simple plan — at least that’s the idea behind the 5GB option. As the name suggests you’ll get 5GB of 4G LTE or 5G data access per month along with unlimited talk and text. Cricket’s 5GB plan also supports HD Voice and Wi-Fi calling if you have a compatible phone. Beyond that you can add another gig of data as needed for a fee. Each line of 5GB service runs at a constant $30 per month rate. Cricket has also added 5G access to all of its plans and removed the long-standing 8Mbps speed cap from its most affordable options.

Highlights: Enough data for low-limit users.

Unlimited talk and text at a low price. Best for: Users who want to talk and text on a budget.

Users who spend most of their time on Wi-Fi.

10GB Plan 2GB of data isn’t enough for everyone so you may want to jump to the 10GB Cricket plan if you need to stay connected on the go. Luckily each line is more affordable than the last so five times the data is well worth the extra fee. Additional data and the per-line discount are the only differences though — there’s still no streaming or hotspot available. However you still get access to 5G as mentioned above without the 8Mbps cap.

Highlights: Five times more data at a low cost.

Discount for each line you add. Best for: Users who plan to use data and don’t want to pay per gig.

Users who don’t need a hotspot and would rather stream on a TV.

Core includes standard definition (480p) streaming and international texting to 37 countries and unlimited LTE data access. You can also use your talk text and data in Canada and Mexico as long as you just more than 50% of your plan in the US.

Highlights: Unlimited data talk and text.

Streaming in standard definition. Best for: Users who plan to text other countries.

Users who want the option of hotspot and streaming.

Cricket More Plan The most expensive Cricket plan of the lot Cricket More is just like Core except it includes 15GB of hotspot access for just $5 more. It’s the more affordable option if you know you’ll need that extra data each month and it packs all of the same perks as Cricket Core. Streaming is still limited to standard definition but it’s always nice to know that your plan will work for trips to Canada or Mexico. Cricket More also comes with a new slate of perks at just $60 per month. You can test out ad-supported HBO Max and get your shopping on with a one-year membership to Sam’s Club.

Highlights: Usage in Canada and Mexico up to 50%.

15GB of included hotspot access. Best for: Users who plan to make the most of the included hotspot.

Bark Jr and Bark Premium Cricket’s new partnership with Bark means that you can get free access to manage your kids’ screen time and filter websites to keep them safe. You can even sign up for Bark Premium which adds email monitoring and monitoring across more than 30 apps to the mix for just $9.99 per month.

International As long as you’ve set up a plan that costs $40 per month or more Cricket International will let you dial landline numbers in 35 countries. You can cancel at any time.

International Extra International Extra adds pictures and video calling to the mix for all 35 countries and you can dial mobile numbers in 31 of those countries for up to 1000 minutes.

Individual Countries If you have relatives in a particular country that does not fall within the 35 international options you can add select nations for a varying fee. Available countries include much of Central America as well as the Philippines and Vietnam. Plans include varying talk minutes and typically unlimited texting.

Add 1GB of data Mainly designed for limited data plans this add-on kicks your cap from 2GB to 3GB or from 10GB to 11GB. You can add it just once or on a recurring monthly basis.

Hotspot Although Cricket More includes 15GB of hotspot data this add-on grants the same amount to the Core plan. It’s helpful if you only want to use a hotspot for one month but you may be better off with the More plan if you’re going to use a hotspot often.

Hotspot add-ons If 15GB isn’t enough for your needs you can add another 15GB to either the Core or More plans. Like the standard hotspot addition you can add it once or regularly.

Does Cricket have any perks?

While there are no fancy perks on Cricket like free Netflix or anything one of its more important perks is its Group Save discount.

It’s not as generous with savings as it once was but you can save $10 on a second line and $20 more per line after that. There is a limit to the savings — after the fifth phone there are no more discounts. When it’s all said and done you’re looking at four lines of data for your family with a monthly bill of just $100 — not an easy price to top.

Which Cricket Wireless plan is right for you?

If you’re ready to make a move it’s tough to top the Cricket Core — or basic unlimited — plan. There’s the obvious draw of unlimited data but you also benefit from standard-definition streaming and usage in Canada and Mexico that can’t exceed 50%. You can text your friends in 37 countries and once you have more than three lines the Cricket Core plan costs less than the 10GB alternative. Cricket’s affordable plans are now more enticing than ever with 5G and the removal of the 8Mbps cap.

You won’t get a hotspot with the $55 per month Cricket Core but you can always add one for an extra monthly fee. If you know that you’ll need that hotspot opt for Cricket More as it will save you $5 per month and give you access to sweet perks like HBO Max.

Cricket Wireless vs the competition

As an MVNO it seems unfair to compare the best Cricket offers with the best that Verizon and AT&T can do. Instead we’ll stack it against a few of the other MVNOs on each network. We’re comparing all of the plans featured in the Best prepaid and no-contract plans in the US if you want to do a bit more research.

There’s only one plan to choose from and it offers unlimited talk text and data. The plan also allows for hotspot access and you can finally call internationally and tap into Verizon’s Nationwide 5G.

Party Pay is what sets Visible apart as you can join as many friends as you please and each of you will pay as little as $25 per month. One late payer doesn’t hurt the others and you’ll all save money. Visible has no physical stores so customer service can be a challenge.

What phones can you use on Cricket Wireless?

Ryan Haines / Android Authority Galaxy A53 5G

Cricket Wireless is an MVNO making it a great way to get your hands on a budget device. There are certainly plenty to choose from but Cricket has many of the latest and greatest devices on the market too.

If you purchase a Cricket device and then decide to leave the network you’ll have to wait six months unless you’re heading to AT&T. The most important factor in changing carriers is band support as always. If your device doesn’t support the right bands then you’re all out of luck. Check the table below for the list of Cricket Wireless bands:

Will they hurt your trees?,"The tree in my yard has webbing in some of the branches and I think I see caterpillars. What should I do? — K.W.

The webs you are describing are probably the webs of tent caterpillars. Tent caterpillars are kind of the spring variation of fall webworms. It is easy to tell them apart by their webs.

The tent caterpillars build their webs in the v’s between branches while fall webworms construct their webs out toward the end of the branch. That and tent caterpillars are active in the spring while fall webworms are active in the fall.

There are two varieties of tent caterpillars in our area: the eastern tent caterpillar and the forest tent caterpillar. Despite the name of the eastern tent caterpillar it can be found as far west as the Rocky Mountains. They prefer to feed on the leaves of cherry plum and crabapple trees. If these trees are in short supply they will feed on the leaves of poplar willow and birch trees. Forest tent caterpillars can be found throughout the United States and prefer hardwood trees.

The eastern tent caterpillar is predominantly black with a white strip visible down the middle of the back. They also have several blue spots on their sides. Forest tent capillaries are blue with keyhole-shaped markings down their backs.

These caterpillars grow to be about 1 to 1.5 inches long and have overwintered in protective egg masses. The egg masses are dark in color and hard encircling smaller twigs on the tree. They almost appear shiny. Each of the egg masses can hold between 150 to 300 eggs that hatch in mid-February to mid-March.

Feeding lasts about six to eight weeks. After feeding they migrate to a protected spot spin cocoons and begin their pupal stage which lasts about three weeks. When the moths emerge in late June and July the females deposit their eggs on branches. Tent caterpillar moths only live a few days.

During the day the caterpillars emerge from the webs to eat but return to the webs at night. With sufficient numbers tent caterpillars can defoliate a tree but this defoliation rarely kills the tree. These caterpillars also serve as a food source for other insects birds and toads.

Since they rarely kill a tree you really don’t need to do anything to reduce their population. However there are several strategies if you just can’t stand it.

First of all you can just cut and remove a branch that contains their webbing during the early stages of their life cycle or break apart the webbing to enable birds to have access to a meal or two. The webs make it hard for the birds to reach them.

If you want to make further efforts to eliminate these caterpillars you can spray the leaves surrounding the webbing with an organic pesticide called bacillus thuringiensis. They will eat the leaves you have sprayed and die. Unfortunately this strategy is difficult for homeowners if a large tree is playing host to tent caterpillars. In this case a professional would need to be brought in. Our advice is to just live and let live. Good luck!

Former Golden State Warriors head coach Mark Jackson will interview for the Sacramento Kings head coach opening next week league sources tell @YahooSports. — Chris Haynes (@ChrisBHaynes) April 23 2022

Jackson coached the Warriors from 2011-2014 going 121-109 in his three seasons at the helm making the playoffs twice and winning a playoff series in 2013. He installed a culture of defense that hadn’t been there for the Warriors before while preserving their culture of weird coaching behavior and paranoid suspicion that had existed back in the Chris Cohan era. From feuds over pre-game chapel services to assistants secretly recording conversations to a blackmail case with a stripper that led to the immortal headline “Mark Jackson assists the FBI in foiling an extortion plot centered around nude photos of himself” he certainly was not a dull coach. Of course the Warriors immediately became one of the greatest teams in NBA history once Jackson was dismissed so he also may not have been a good coach.

But that’s not the important part! There’s intrigue with a potential Jackson hire - whether it’s in Sacramento or in Los Angeles where LeBron James has expressed interest in Klutch Sports client Jackson taking over the Lakers. The King clearly likes his style even if Jackson did openly drool over James’ wife Savannah during a broadcast saying “I’d hit it out of the park. All due respect.”

Clearly the funniest possible landing spot for Jackson is leading the Lake Show where he’d feud with Magic Johnson and people would paint sarcastic murals of him all over the city. He’d also make Anthony Davis cry while he was rehabbing an injury force the Lakers to sign Jermaine O’Neal and call Austin Reaves and Talen Horton-Tucker the “second-greatest shooting backcourt of all time.” Look LeBron’s not going to start missing fewer games at age 38 there’s virtually no young talent on the roster and half of AD’s ligaments are sewn together with extra eyebrow hair. At least Jackson will make things more interesting.

For the Kings it’s still a funny landing spot though we wish they could have employed Jackson and Vlade Divac simultaneously. Jackson would fit the Kings’ No. 1 priority when it comes to a head coach: hiring someone who used to work for the Warriors. That’s why Warriors’ assistant Mike Brown also made the cut.

Can confirm that Mike Brown is interviewing with Sacramento. Brown is eager to become a head coach again but he'd have to feel the Kings are the right fit for him to leave Golden State. https://t.co/cz5kniC28B — Connor Letourneau (@Con_Chron) April 22 2022

Coach Brown it’s not the right fit. With all due respect.

If you squint you can see some similarities between this Kings team and what the Warriors were like when Jackson took over in 2011. Both had oft-injured point guards with potential in Steph Curry and De’Aaron Fox who both love cryptocurrency. Domantas Sabonis is like a slightly taller Lithuanian David Lee. Davion Mitchell is like Monta Ellis - an energetic perfectly-fine player who’s too small to play with their existing point guard and can’t shoot threes and is about to get traded in nine months. One of these teams had Harrison Barnes and the other has...Harrison Barnes.

Kings owner Vivek Ranadive has always wanted to try playing a 4-on-5 defense with one player hanging back to cherry-pick. If any coach is willing to try this it could be Mark Jackson. It could be a new slogan for him: “Hand down man down at the other end of the court.”

As entertaining as it might be to have Jackson on the sidelines the real benefit comes from getting him off the NBA Finals telecast where the talented Mike Breen is often relegated to refereeing bizarre extended arguments between Jackson and Jeff Van Gundy. The curmudgeonly JVG loves to rant about the games the rules or his groceries but when it’s just him and Breen it’s manageable. Breen can ignore it or quickly defuse it but once Jackson steps in it becomes an interminable debate. You might as well say “Mama there goes that tangent” and give up on them discussing what’s happening in the game for the next eight possessions.

The Kings are also considering Mike D’Antoni who would become the second-oldest coach in NBA history if he were hired as he’s the same age as a Captain Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger who retired from flying 12 years ago. Honestly the Kings might want to look at Sully who might conclude that landing a plane in the Hudson River is easier than landing the Kings back in the playoffs.

There’s still a lot of interviews and vetting to be done in Sacramento but we do know one thing about the Kings’ new coach already: He’ll be fired by 2025.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGlnaHNjaG9vbC5zaS5jb20vb2hpby8yMDIyLzA0LzI0L2Zvcm1lci1neW1uYXN0LWRldmVsb3BzLWludG8tYW4tb2hpby10cmFjay1zdGFyLXdpdGgtb2x5bXBpYy1hc3BpcmF0aW9ucy1hcy1hLWh1cmRsZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former gymnast develops into an Ohio track star with Olympic aspirations as a hurdler,"By Aaron Blankenship | Photos courtesy of the Bentley family

Camden Bentley was a far cry from a track and field phenom when she started competing in the sport four years ago.

The Gahanna Lincoln junior was a much better gymnast than hurdler during her solid but unremarkable middle school track career.

And after Bentley failed to secure a spot as one of the Lions’ top two hurdlers during her freshman indoor track season her coaches urged her to switch to pole vault as her freshman outdoor season approached.

Few could have imagined that Bentley would develop into the 2021 state champion in the 300-meter hurdles and one of the top high school hurdlers in the country.

“I was stunned as I watched a caterpillar turn into a butterfly right before my eyes” said 33rd-year Gahanna girls track and field coach Roger Whittaker who led the Lions to Division I state titles in 2015 and 2018. “Camden’s always been a good athlete but she was just a so-so hurdler in middle school and she was still an average hurdler her freshman year. Watching her rise from mediocrity to become a state champion as a sophomore was incredible and now she’s vying to become the best hurdler in the nation.”

Jordan Rispress who trains Bentley and many other top hurdlers at Ohio Speed Academy echoed Whittaker’s sentiments about Bentley’s rapid ascent in the sport.

When Bentley began working with Rispress as a freshman she often struggled to maintain her confidence and would sometimes shed tears of frustration at practice.

Rispress won a state title in the 300 hurdles and placed third in the 110 hurdles as a senior at Hilliard Darby in 2009 before competing at Clemson (2009-11) and Ohio State (2012-14).

He was a member of two ACC champion 1600 relay teams in 2011 (indoor and outdoor) and was a member of a Big Ten champion 1600 team and was second-team All-American in the 400 hurdles and 1600 relay in 2014.

“There were days where she ran around the hurdles instead of going over them because she didn’t feel confident"" Rispress said. ""I remember one day she didn’t go over a single hurdle during an hour and a half of training and I had to talk her off the cliff because she was crying feeling like she was wasting her parents’ time.

“I always knew she had the potential to get better because she’s such a hard worker and she has a lot of talent. But Camden’s definitely a rare breed in that you don’t see many people who grow this quickly from being not being in the top three of their high school team to being a state champion a year later.”

Turning a negative into a positive

No one has been more surprised by Bentley’s rocket-ship-speed journey to the top of the state podium than the 17-year-old herself.

Bentley didn’t start running track until seventh grade and she only gave the sport a try because she fractured her left wrist while playing volleyball and couldn’t compete in gymnastics the previous summer.

“I started doing gymnastics when I was 2 or 3 and I got up to Level 9 but I got burnt out and quit doing gymnastics after eighth grade” Bentley said. “When I broke my wrist I couldn’t tumble in gymnastics so I decided to follow in my older brother Ty’s footsteps by running track.

“I really liked track but I didn’t take it that seriously until COVID hit.”

Bentley began training with Rispress in preparation for her freshman track season but she struggled to adapt to the tougher workouts and made slow progress over the first six months.

“I would get so frustrated and cry to my coaches because I didn’t know how I could finish my workouts at times” Bentley said. “But I just put my head down and ran and I slowly gained more confidence and got better.”

Even though the COVID-19 pandemic wiped out her freshman track season Bentley elevated her training that spring.

Bentley improved her strength endurance and speed by doing CrossFit training with Ty and her father Kyle Bentley at CrossFit Future in Blacklick.

Kyle Bentley — who wrestled at Kent State and served as Gahanna’s wrestling coach from 2007-16 — made four hurdles out of PVC pipes which Camden used in the street in front of her home for an extra hour of training each day.

As Camden continued to get stronger and faster Rispress gradually taught her to launch at hurdles from 6 1/2 feet away instead of waiting until she was closer.

“Camden was taking off from 5 feet and jumping really high over the hurdles” Rispress said. “Taking off from 6 1/2 is scary at first but as a hurdler you have to be a little crazy. I always told her ‘Don’t think just run’ and when she got to that point her confidence rose and her times started dropping really quickly.”

Bentley exploded upon the high school scene as a sophomore winning the 60 hurdles at the indoor state finale in 8.54 seconds before going undefeated in the 100 and 300 hurdles all the way through the regional meet of the outdoor season.

In last year’s Division I regional meet Bentley stunned spectators by winning the 100 hurdles with a personal-record time of 13.66 which ranks second all-time in the state behind Shaker Heights’ Delanda Jackson (13.64 in 2000).

“It’s still hard to believe that Camden improved so much from her freshman to sophomore year” Rispress said. “Camden’s work ethic is tremendous and last season was a perfect storm of specific workouts that taught her high-level skills and made her a lot stronger and faster.”

Bentley lost in the 100 hurdles for the first time at the state meet last season after she clipped her foot on the final hurdle en route to finishing second (14.15) behind Westerville South’s Marissa Saunders (14.05).

Bentley bounced back by finishing first in the first leg of the 800 relay to help the Lions place third (1:40.51) at state.

“I was a little angry when I ran the relay because I wanted the title (in the 100 hurdles)” Bentley said. “But my good friend Marissa won so I was happy for her.”

Bentley then won the 300 hurdles in a personal-record time of 43.18 to finish undefeated in the event.

“That was a surreal experience standing on the top of the podium looking at everyone in the stands screaming” Bentley said. “I felt relieved that I made it to that point because I thought back to losing my freshman season to COVID and I never thought something like this would happen for me.”

Instead of resting on her laurels Bentley worked even harder during the offseason and set an indoor state record in the 60 hurdles (8.49) in January.

She also placed sixth (13.7) in the 100 hurdles against elite competition from across the country in the Beach Run Invitational held April 1 and 2 in Myrtle Beach South Carolina.

'Best athlete I've ever coached'

“Camden’s the best athlete I’ve ever coached” said Whittaker who was named the national Coach of the Year in 2018 by the National Federation of State High School Associations Coaches Association. “She’s also a versatile athlete who can do any event like a heptathlete and could possibly be a state champion in any of them. She decided she wanted to be a hurdler and now she’s already become the No. 7 hurdler in the nation as a junior.”

Bentley is focused on trying to set new personal records in each of her events and is hoping to defend her state title in the 300 hurdles while also capturing her first 100 hurdles state championship.

Before she graduates Bentley also is aiming to lead the Lions to a team state title after Gahanna finished as state runner-up (36 points) behind Mentor (70) at last year’s state meet.

“Camden should easily break the state record this season and the scary part is she’s still improving at a super-fast rate and hasn’t reached her limit” Rispress said.

Bentley has drawn extra motivation to do her best from her entire family including her grandfather Richard Herbst who passed away last year just months after watching Camden compete in the state meet.

“Losing my grandfather was really difficult to deal with because he’s always been so supportive of me and my track career” Bentley said. “My whole family has been really supportive of me and I want to do my best for them.

“My goal is to keep chasing my best times to try to lower my PR in each event. The better I’ve done I’ve gotten more attention from college coaches and higher expectations from people in general. I used to joke about wanting to go to the Olympics but that’s turned into a real goal for me.”

Bentley who has a 3.9 cumulative grade-point average sings and dances for Gahanna’s Show Choir in her spare time and can also speak Chinese.

The talented junior is getting recruited by several Division I coaches across the nation as the prospects for her future in the sport get brighter with each passing season.

“It feels like we’ve had a world champion drop right out of the sky into our program” Whittaker said. “Camden’s progressing to the point where her dream of competing in the Olympics is not out of the question. After how far she’s come in such a short amount of time I certainly wouldn’t bet against her.”"

Three in four plan to increase their volume of activity this year and one in four expect to boost it significantly. Looking beyond 2022 eight in 10 investors expect to increase their U.S. exposure over the next three to five years.

Those are topline results of the annual investor survey conducted by the Association for Foreign Investment in Real Estate. AFIRE drew on input from its broad-based membership of some 175 organizations in 23 countries representing $3 trillion in assets under management. CBRE and Holland Partner Group served as underwriters of the survey conducted in February by AFIRE along with the PwC LLP research team.

“I’ve noticed that the most successful among us—both within and beyond the global real estate investment community—can acknowledge uncertainty and still feel out the way ahead” Gunnar Branson CEO of AFIRE wrote in a letter prefacing the report. “They listen to others to find out what they’ve seen and through this they avoid the pitfalls of assuming that something will work simply because that’s how things worked in the past.”

New Favorites

In a sign of changing strategies the survey shows that tier-one markets like New York City and Los Angeles no longer consistently top institutional investors’ lists. Secondary and tertiary cities have risen to the highest point on investors’ radar. Atlanta a secondary city was the top U.S. choice among respondents with 37 percent selecting the city; the tertiary market of Austin was selected by 32 percent tying primary market Boston for the number-two spot.

In a telling result U.S. markets also took eight of the top 10 spots among global markets. Austin took first place among investors named by 28 percent followed by Atlanta with 26 percent. Close behind in third and fourth place were Boston and Dallas which each received 23 percent of the vote. Other U.S. markets in the top 10 were New York City Dallas Los Angeles and Denver. London and Berlin were the only non-U.S. markets to make the top 10.

Regarding asset categories over the next three to five years investors in U.S. real estate will continue to focus on first on multifamily cited by 90 percent. However the life science sector is high on the list as well with 77 percent planning to increase their exposure. Almost as many respondents 75 percent intend to expand their exposure in the industrial sector. Not all sectors are in good favor with the investment community. Twenty-five percent of survey participants indicated that they plan to reduce their participation in the office sector over the next three to five years.

Lingering Effects

While investors’ outlook for the U.S. market remains on its years-long optimistic track it is different from past forecasts due to the long arm of the pandemic.

“Eighty-one percent of the respondents believe that the pandemic has permanently altered culture and live-work preferences” Branson told Commercial Property Executive. “There has been a lot of discussion over the last two years about the potential impact of changes in how and where we work thanks to the pandemic.

“Some are predicting a return to normal others the complete transformation of the CBD. There’s no way to know at this point if either extreme will be true; however with a clear majority accepting ‘permanent’ change it is clear that investors aren’t expecting a ‘return to normal.’ Their investment focus on secondary markets on alternative asset classes and on waiting to see what happens in office is a change from years past.”

The global survey saw a sizeable year-over-year jump in investors’ sentiment toward ESG criteria with 81 percent of respondents indicating that the standards would be very important over the next five years compared to 69 percent in the 2021 survey. Of the ESG priorities 90 percent of participants placed the highest value on carbon footprint reduction measures with 89 percent citing actionable climate change strategies as a top priority.

“A new question this year was whether they would be willing to accept a lower rate return if the investment had a beneficial impact on the society or environment. Fifty-five percent said yes” Branson told CPE. “The global institutional investor community is very serious about ESG especially Europe.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbmdrb2twb3N0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9nZW5lcmFsLzIyOTkxMzgvY2JyZXMtYWR2aWNlLWZvci1uYXZpZ2F0aW5nLXRoZS1wcm9wZXJ0eS1tYXJrZXRzLXVwcy1hbmQtZG93bnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"CBRE""s advice for navigating the property market""s ups and downs","The consultancy relies on professionalism and reliability to weather the storm

Professionalism reliability and agility have been key to helping property consultancy CBRE Thailand ride the cycle of ups and downs in the Thai property sector over the past 34 years.

""Although sincerity may mean we don't add a client we still have to carry on. This has been one of our principles since we started in Thaialnd."" -- Aliwassa Pathnadabutr Chairwoman CBRE Thailand

Aliwassa Pathnadabutr the company's chairwoman said professionalism and reliability are required qualities for a property consultancy to sustain business over the long run retain clients and ensure they keep returning.

""As a consultant we have to give straightforward advice that should be supported by data"" she said. ""Although sincerity may mean we don't add a client we still have to carry on. This has been one of our principles since we started in Thailand.""

FIRST CONSULTANT

The US-based company set up a Thai office in 1988 under Richard Ellis Co as it saw signs of an economic recovery in Thailand said Ms Aliwassa one of the founding staff.

""As the first international property consultant in Thailand we had to start from zero"" she said. ""Most property brokers were focused on land sales. We had to set up a database on our own walking to survey each office tower because no office market data was available.""

Its research covers offices residential investment land retail hotels and industrial and logistics sectors giving CBRE the oldest property market database.

Ms Roongrat (above) and Ms Aliwassa (below) have seen CBRE adapt to the market.

For offices Bangkok's total supply since 1988 has risen from 1 million square metres with an average rent of 200 baht per sq m per month to 9.5 million sq m priced at 988 baht for grade A and 740 baht for grade B as of the end of 2021.

Overall office space is projected to increase to 10 million sq m in 2022 according to CBRE's research.

The company reported the land price per sq wah in Bangkok soared from 250000 baht in 1988 to 3.9 million baht in 2020.

BRACING FOR A SLIDE

From 20 staff in 1988 to 400 in 1996 CBRE grew in line with the property market boom until 1997 said Ms Aliwassa.

With up-to-date market data the company identified a property bubble and signs of a crash starting in 1995.

At the time massive speculation on condos and land led to an eventual crash because there was minimal regulation she said.

""Property consultancy is a diversified business by nature"" Ms Aliwassa said. ""When leasing and sales are down property management valuation and research remain active. This makes us profitable even as revenue decreases.""

As the residential market in 1997-98 was sluggish the company shifted the residential sales team to the investment unit because there were a lot of foreign investors scooping up Thai properties and loans after the country's financial crisis in 1997.

Another busy segment during the financial crisis was property valuation as foreign investors wanted this service when deciding to buy Thai properties.

As the only international consultancy doing real estate market research with its own data CBRE was also appointed by the World Bank to do property market surveys.

This was the origin of the company's quarterly report for each property sector.

""We had very minimal downsizing in 1997 which helped us come back very quickly"" Ms Aliwassa said.

""Few people had property knowledge and expertise at the time. If we laid them off we might not be able to get them back.""

AN UPSURGE

The market boomed again in 2001 driven by the residential sector especially the condo segment as the skytrain served a vast mass transit demand.

CBRE's residential sales team served both local developers that could not recruit new sales teams in time for a market recovery as well as a large number of overseas property companies that expanded into Bangkok.

""Foreign investors looking for a joint venture with local firms required an international consultancy to do marketing"" she said. ""We have many local and foreign clients which helped our residential sales business to become more robust.""

Proceeds from the residential sales department which includes new projects resale units and Phuket resort homes was the company's largest contributor accounting for 40% of total sales said Ms Aliwassa formerly managing director from 2004-21.

According to the Department of Business Development CBRE's revenue has increased almost every year since 1998.

The biggest growth was recorded in 2015 when it expanded by 105% to 1.47 billion baht its first time breaching 1 billion baht.

Revenue kept rising with growth of 53% to 2.25 billion baht in 2016.

The revenue peak was in 2018 when the company secured 2.55 billion baht after being the sole agent for a British Embassy plot on Ploenchit Road priced at 19 billion baht she said.

NEW BUSINESS

CBRE was affected by the pandemic in 2020 as were most businesses. That year its revenue declined by 11% to 2.26 billion baht the second significant drop since its establishment in Thailand.

However it recovered in 2021 boosted by residential sales after it diversified to the low-rise housing market in 2019 after sensing that condos were performing sluggishly based on a glut and high prices.

Now with 1300 staff CBRE plans to be more aggressive in its new businesses said Roongrat Veeraparkkaroon formerly head of commercial transaction services who was promoted to managing director on Jan 1 2022.

""We will capitalise on the post-pandemic trends in property that include ESG [environmental social and governance] and hybrid work as we aim to grow by 15% back to pre-pandemic levels"" she said.

One new business is energy and sustainability services providing advice to landlords who want to upgrade their properties to get LEED green building certification or the WELL building standard which focuses on people's health and wellness.

Other new businesses include project facilities hotel asset and transaction management workplace strategy and tenant experience mobile application.

""As a professional consultant it is our duty to be a trendsetter giving clients reliable advice and helping them adjust to upcoming changes and challenges"" said Ms Roongrat.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyL2Fwci8yNC9kcml2ZS1mb3ItbmV0LXplcm8tZnVlbHMtdWstYm9vbS1pbi1yZXRyb2ZpdHRpbmctYnVpbGRpbmdzLWZvci1uZXctdXNl0gF3aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIvYXByLzI0L2RyaXZlLWZvci1uZXQtemVyby1mdWVscy11ay1ib29tLWluLXJldHJvZml0dGluZy1idWlsZGluZ3MtZm9yLW5ldy11c2U?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Drive for net zero fuels UK boom in retrofitting buildings for new use,"From a former ice factory becoming a shiny home for offices and shops to a Victorian bus works getting a new lease of life as a flexible workspace across the country buildings are being retrofitted and repurposed for the future.

It stands in stark contrast to what seemed like the commercial property industry’s motto in recent years: knock it all down and start again.

For several decades buildings such as office blocks weren’t designed or built with longevity in mind. When parts and equipment such as lifts and windows wore out landlords often opted for demolition over refurbishment.

But against the backdrop of the UK’s race to reach net zero by 2050 the climate crisis has forced all sectors of the economy to consider their emissions prompting property owners and developers to look again at the impact of construction.

While buildings have become much more energy-efficient to run huge amounts of energy are required – and therefore large amounts of carbon - emitted during the manufacture of components as well as in the construction. These emissions occurring before a building is even in use create what is known as “embodied carbon”.

“Twenty years ago if you looked at the overall carbon impact of a building then 80% of it might have come from how you use it” said Chris Cummings director at Savills Earth the estate agent’s sustainability team.

“With a brand new glass and steel building in London now 95% to 98% of the building’s impact will be in the materials because it’s going to be lean and be using green energy and the grid is decarbonising.”

The prize on offer for decarbonising the entire life cycle of a building is significant. The World Green Building Council calculates that construction together with the energy required to heat cool and power buildings accounts for almost 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

Tenants are increasingly demanding more efficient buildings too and their landlords are trying to deliver this by giving old structures a new lease of life.

Comprising two Victorian warehouses a former bus factory in Islington north London known as the Busworks was bought for £45m last year by the flexible office provider Workspace which is turning the history-rich building into modern offices.

“Going back 30 years you built a HQ building with the view that someone would probably knock it down and build it again in 25-30 years” said Cummings.

He believes developers are once again planning on buildings with a long life or even several lives: “Going back further it was: ‘we need something which lasts 100 years’ and I think it’s coming back to that now.”

In central Birmingham close to the canal and some of the city’s buzzing bars and restaurants one of these major refits is taking place. 10 Brindleyplace formerly offices of NatWest (previously the Royal Bank of Scotland) and apartments has been stripped back and is covered by scaffolding and plastic sheeting.

Two buildings are becoming one and only the frame foundations and basement have been retained which will save some embodied carbon.

“The life expectancy for plant [equipment and fittings] is 20 years” said Nick White asset manager at CBRE Investment Management which is behind the £40m transformation. “The lifts air con mechanical and electrical systems were at the end of life and were breaking down.”

Rather than just replacing worn-out equipment the building is being completely reconfigured inside and out transformed into a modern workspace. About 212000 sq ft (19695 square metres) of open office space is being created larger windows installed and six roof terraces built for outdoor working and meetings.

The works were planned and under way before Covid hit but the developers believe the building is primed for the post-pandemic world of work equipped with a gym bike racks and showers.

“Offices have got to fundamentally work harder” said Theo Holmes director in CBRE’s office agency team. “There is a flight to quality and creating an environment for getting more out of staff. The building has to operate to meet changing needs.”

Due to be ready by the time Birmingham hosts the Commonwealth Games in July the retrofitted building will be more efficient than before powered by green energy including 840 sq ft of solar panels.Such energy transformations aren’t limited to the newer buildings. Historic sites and even those with protected status are also getting in on the act.

Grosvenor the Duke of Westminster’s property company which can trace its links with London property back to 1677 is retrofitting its London portfolio including 500 Grade I- and II-listed buildings.

In an attempt to cut its carbon emissions the company’s UK property arm has pledged to invest £90m by 2030 in retrofitting and reducing the operational emissions of its buildings.

A former ice factory near Victoria station in central London is one of these projects. Built in 1830 it was most recently a car garage but is being turned into a five-storey building for offices shops and a rooftop restaurant.

Grosvenor Property UK’s chief executive James Raynor brought forward the company’s target date for reaching carbon neutrality by five years to 2030 last October. Along with retrofitting this will be achieved by carbon offsetting and increasing the company’s use of renewable energy.

“Why wait until 2030 to offset?” said Raynor. “We know the challenges that we face and the climate crisis is there flashing big warning lights.”

Grosvenor’s first net zero carbon office development is also under way: a 1980s office block at Holbein Gardens close to Sloane Square is being turned into a modern workspace.

Raynor says tenants are demanding more efficient buildings and understand that these won’t necessarily be the newest structures.

“At the top end of the office market we are starting to see that people will walk away from buildings that don’t offer great environmental credentials” he said.

“It’s in the interest of developers ourselves and others to make sure that everything has the best credentials possible otherwise they will stay empty which isn’t really the point.”

Alongside property companies local authorities are increasingly looking to retrofitting to help them meet their emissions targets.

Not all are following this path. Marks & Spencer has recently faced criticism over its plans to demolish its 90-year old flagship store close to Marble Arch in London.

Following environmental concerns the London mayor Sadiq Khan reviewed the plans but gave Westminster council the green light to approve the scheme allowing the retailer to knock down the art deco building.

Marks & Spencer said the site could not be developed further. It will be replaced with a 10-storey structure containing a smaller store as well as offices and a gym. It has been estimated that the construction will create so much carbon dioxide that 2.4m trees would need to be planted to offset it.",,,

Is the price going up down or sideways? Simple enough. But looking at something in isolation only reveals part of the story. If a bank is down 20% from its highs but the rest of the bank sector is down 40% you would call this a relative winner.

Look at a chart of the FANMAG stocks and you’ll see that they peaked in November 2021 and have given up all of their gains back to September 2020. But once you compare the tech giants to the S&P 500 an entirely new image emerges. You can see that their relative performance peaked in July 2020 and all of their outperformance since the summer of 2018 has vanished.

There are two different markets right now; Companies that got the benefit of low rates versus companies that can handle rising rates. It’s all one trade and the simplest visual to express this trade is short duration bonds versus long ones.

Short-term rates have risen more and faster than long ones but the latter is more sensitive to them. This is why long-term bonds can see a fraction of the rate increase and four times the destruction as shorter-term ones. 3-7 year bonds are in a 10% drawdown while zero-coupon bonds are down 36% from their highs.

And this is what’s driving the market. When rates rise and inflation is high investors are more sensitive to earnings today versus the potential of great earnings in the future. That’s why long-duration stocks are getting killed while cash-flow rich companies are holding up okay.

Nobody has time for disruptive technology during uncertain times when the incumbents are tried and true. We roughly know what JPMorgan is going to do and look like in the next couple of years whether or not a recession comes. Buy now pay later is cool and all but the business model is unproven and investors aren’t willing to subsidize losses when money actually costs something.

Here’s more of the same.

IBM might not be growing like it used to but it still generated >$8 billion in free cash flow last quarter with $700 million hitting the bottom line. Robinhood burned through $400 million in cash and lost nearly $1 billion. Investors are like “Umm yeah we’re not doing that anymore.”

In an inflationary environment consumers and investors value physical items. CF Industries one of the largest producers of fertilizers is up 36% on the year. Facebook I mean Meta is down 45%.

One of the areas of the market that’s most sensitive to rising rates is homebuilder stocks. While they’re down 20 and 30% build-to-rent names like Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent are basically flat on the year. Absolute duds but relative home runs.

On the podcast this week I spoke about how Disney was flat since 2015. I know the challenges that Disney has gone through and continues to struggle with but seven years of no returns really blew my mind. And then I saw Jim Bianco tweet this and my head almost exploded. Disney has underperformed the S&P 500 since the inception of SPY (1993) and basically on every other time frame as well.

Some people might see this and say “This is why you shouldn’t pick individual stocks.” I get that and I mostly agree. Disney is one of the most iconic companies in the world and even that wasn’t good enough to beat the index. But for me the more salient point is to diversify. Don’t put all of your eggs in one basket. It’s okay to buy actively managed mutual funds but I wouldn’t recommend putting your entire net worth in three or four stocks.

The market isn’t fun right now and it’s all being driven by interest rates inflation and the fear of a slowing economy. That’s the bad news. The good news and I’m admittedly reaching here is that a lot of stocks already got pancaked. Meanwhile nobody is bullish and good things tend to happen when most investors think they can’t.

Next week is a huge one for earnings which certainly feels like a make-or-break moment for the markets. We’ll hear from Google Facebook Microsoft Apple and Amazon as well as D.R. Horton and Chipotle and Caterpillar. If you want to listen to earnings calls like a podcast check out the Quartr App it’s terrific. Slides embedded in the app 1.5x speed skip to Q&A fuhgeddaboutit.

The Sandusky County Economic Development Corporation announced Thursday MasTec are the new occupants of a previously vacant Fremont industrial building located at 800 Hagerty Dr.

Bob Gross Fremont's economic development director told the News-Messenger last week MasTec wants to move in equipment and start hiring within the next couple of weeks with a goal of being up and running by June 1.

The company plans to create 40 new jobs with aerial and underground labor positions starting at $20 an hour and experienced linemen making up to $35-40 hour according to the SCEDC.

Proximity to Toledo was a plus

Beth Hannam Sandusky County's economic development director said James Fillar MasTec's operations manager really liked the Hagerty Drive building and Fremont's close proximity to Toledo.

""He had looked at locations in Toledo. The cost and conditions of some of those locations were not up to par"" Hannam said Thursday.

MasTec is a Coral Gables Fla.-based company with offices across North America.

The company serves the telecommunications industry including Verizon AT&T Frontier and Charter Communications.

Hannam said MasTec didn't look for economic incentives to open a location in Fremont and conducted its own public search which resulted in them looking through the SCEDC website and ultimately choosing the Hagerty Drive site.

She said that showed the importance of SCEDC having updated information on its website

In a release Fillar said the company's Fremont location will generally serve the Toledo market.

He said the company has built a reliable distribution network that can reach majority of its potential market and it has devoted a lot of resources to training and employee development.

Impact of Fiber optic service

The company's fiber optic construction is a complex and lengthy process and can take three to 12 months to complete depending on the length of the circuit terrain and soils weather and other external factors.

“Our company has provided reliable fiber internet to local governments businesses schools and residencies. By connecting rural communities we have opened the door for the use of precision agriculture provided more work-from-home opportunities and encouraged urban-to-rural migration by offering access to services entertainment and education that rural residents might have traditionally looked to urban areas to provide” Fillar said. “Our fiber internet service has directly impacted sustained infrastructure for future technologies.”

Hannam said MasTec's entrance into Sandusky County would provide potential connections between the company Terra State Community College's construction technology program and the new telecommunications technician program at Vanguard-Sentinel Career and Technology Centers.

Meanwhile Sarawut said the Mineral Fuels Department had set up a war room to manage the smooth transition and coordinate between the new and old concessionaires as well as buyers of natural gas.

He said initially Chevron would not allow the new concessionaire to enter the G1/61 field during the transition period but the department stepped in and negotiated an agreement on December 20. The new concessionaire was then allowed to enter the field to prepare for gas production.

During the transition period the department set up eight teams to monitor the situation at the gas rigs closely.

A team was stationed at each of the five gas rigs and three others at the petroleum tankers. The team measured the volume of the last round of production and the amount of petroleum stored in the tankers before operations were officially handed over to the new contractor.

He said the department also checked the structure and safety of facilities for production at both fields before the handover.

He also applauded department officials for the handover going ahead without a glitch.

The Erawan field produced 399 million cubic feet of gas and Bongkot’s G2/61 938 million cubic on the day of the handover.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Just hours before he was arrested for allegedly knifing a Queens mom more than 60 times and shoving her body into a duffel bag accused killer David Bonola was at one of his usual Forest Hills haunts a worker told The Post.

Bonola 44 casually visited the Chipotle on Austin Street on April 20 where an employee said he was as “friendly” as ever.

“He was right here” the worker said of Bonola gesturing towards the register. “I think he wanted the bathroom code and a water cup.”

“I was like ‘Hey where have you been? I haven’t seen you in a while.’ He was like I’ve been here and there and whatever. He wanted the bathroom code and a water cup and he left. He was no different than when I saw him [the last time].”

The worker said Bonola had been a regular for the past three years. Bonola usually orders tacos he added.

The employee who did not give his name said Bonola dropped by Chipotle around 1:30 pm Wednesday.

That night the NYPD arrested the Mexico City native on murder charges for the April 16 killing of his alleged on again off again lover Orsolya Gaal 51 a married mother of two.

Unlike a barista at a nearby Starbucks who told The Post a few days ago that Bonola came in often and flirted inappropriately with them the Chipotle manager said Bonola was well-liked at the establishment.

“He was extremely friendly” the worker said. “He was a superstar to all of us.”

“He would talk about his personal life like his mom” the employee added. “He gave my friend his personal guitar pick. He would write his music. He was a regular. It’s pretty unexpected that it would happen.”

Bonola — who allegedly dragged the duffel bag with Gaal’s remains down the street and dumped it near Forest Park leaving a blood trail — is also charged with criminal tampering and criminal possession of a weapon.

Bonola has apparently been in the country illegally for about 20 years sources said.

Jimmy Han 37 a worker at food truck Jubao Express said he saw Bonola all the time before the killing at Paris Baguette on 71st Ave which is about 30 feet from the food truck.

“Oh f–k! I see him here in the window eating a sandwich and a salad and breakfast. I see him every time.”

“I just see him eating eating eating. I see him in [the] window eating all the time.”

Bonola who cops said has no prior arrests was “a handyman who was employed by Mrs. Gaal” for about two years — and during that time they had ‘an intimate affair’” police said last week.

They had re-sparked their on-off affair earlier this month just to break up again — and Bonola “came back … to speak about the relationship again” added Chief Julie Morrill who led the investigation.

Police sources said the former lovers did not have plans that evening but Bonola showed up to Gaal’s home at around 12:30 a.m. Saturday — not long after the mom of two had returned from an evening out with friends to see a show at Lincoln Center and then a drink alone at a local bar cops said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vc291dGgtcGFyay1wcmVkaWN0ZWQtZnV0dXJlLWV2ZXJ5LXRpbWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Every Time South Park Predicted The Future,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vc291dGgtcGFyay1wcmVkaWN0ZWQtZnV0dXJlLWV2ZXJ5LXRpbWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,,,,

“He used to sell his candles at the end of the beach and I loved looking at them and smelling them. He said I should make them too. I used to burn candles all the time but I never ever thought about how they were made. It planted a seed” explained Pauline.

After she moved back to the UK and settled in Wolverhampton the opportunity to act on her friend’s advice arose.

“My sister started up a business selling vintage crockery and she wanted me to make candles to go inside tea cups. I went to Hobbycraft and bought a single kit.”

Those first candles were to spark the beginning of a new venture for Pauline.

“I became absolutely obsessed with candle-making. I used to wake up in the middle of the night with an idea go down to the kitchen get everything out and create something. I quickly became a candle designer” she tells Weekend.

One of her first designs was a stiletto shoe shaped out of wax. “I had only been candle-making six weeks. I enjoy experimenting and being creative.”

Pauline. who is self-taught set up Bonita Candles in 2011 designing making and selling candles from home.

It wasn’t long before her candle enterprise had outgrown her kitchen and she moved the business to dedicated premises.

Since then it has grown from strength to strength and in January Pauline and her team moved into a new studio at The Chubb Buildings.

Pauline uses three different types of wax for her candles – paraffin which is wax most commonly used in the industry soya made from soybean oil and gel which has a jelly-like consistency.

The basic process for candle-making starts with measuring out the wax needed for the mould or container being used. The next step is to melt the wax before adding a splash of colour using candle dyes and fragrance oils.

Once it’s been thoroughly mixed the melted wax is poured by hand into the mould or container which contains the wick. It is then left to cool and set which is known as curing and helps to disperse the fragrance oils evenly throughout the wax.

The company also makes scented wax melts which release aromas when they are heated with a tea light.

There are over 100 fragrances to choose from including Apple Fizz Calming Camomile Honeysuckle & Jasmine Jamaican Jinger Mango Mayhem Mint Macaroon Mojito Twist Oriental Cherry Blossom Pumpkin Soufflé Purely Popcorn and Summer Rose.

There is also a range of Just Like perfume fragrances such as Just Like Chanel Allure and Just Like Dior Poision and Just Like Calvin Klein Eternity.

“They are immensely popular. Wax melts are a quick burst of fragrance in the home. People like them because they aren’t stuck with the same fragrance for 50 to 60 hours. They can enjoy one fragrance today and a completely different fragrance tomorrow” explains Pauline.

All of Bonita Candles’ products which include cocktail glass candles are sold online and at events and shows up and down the country.

Alongside producing candles and wax melts Pauline also runs candle-making workshops and also parties catering for the likes of children’s birthdays hen dos and team-building.

“We teach classes most Tuesdays and Saturdays. We teach all over the country and also here in Wolverhampton. I love Wolverhampton and I love the Chubb Buildings – it’s such an iconic and beautiful site. It’s lovely to have a studio here and to be able to offer these workshops in Wolverhampton” says Pauline.

Her introduction to candle making classes are aimed at beginners who want to learn a new hobby or have a fun day out with friends.

“The classes are always fun. We have had some fabulous feedback. They love what they make and take home – they don’t expect to take home as much as they do.

“We teach lots of tricks and twists so people can make something they are really proud of.

“People can have a go at playing with a variety of different waxes and find out about their different uses how they melt and how they burn.

“I wanted to teach people some really fun skills and give them something meaty to make – they aren’t going to be just pouring a tealight. We’re going to do something more fun and meaty than that” Pauline explains.

Once a participant has mastered the basic skills they can choose to book a place on more advanced classes as well as seasonal workshops taking place during the year.

Pauline says sharing her passion for candle-making and inspiring others to take up the craft is always very rewarding.

“I love candle-making and I love teaching. I love meeting new people at events and in the classes. I also have a lovely team working with me” Pauline tells Weekend.

For the second time in less than two months Latter-day Saint women have taken to social media to push back against an address delivered by a top female church leader.

Speaking on Friday at Brigham Young University’s Women’s Conference President Camille Johnson leader of the global Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encouraged women to rely on the words of President Russell M. Nelson and emphasized the need for women to prioritize motherhood.

“My primary orientation — that is my focus passion and calling as a woman — is toward motherhood” Johnson a former corporate lawyer said. “That is our primary orientation our sacred calling as daughters of Heavenly Parents.”

The Salt Lake Tribune submitted questions to a church spokesperson for the 60-year-old Johnson including how she and her husband managed child care while they both worked and her advice for Latter-day Saint women interested in pursuing a career but who feel guilty for doing so. No responses were provided.

“I had babies and my husband and I loved and nurtured them while we were both working” Johnson told her worldwide audience Friday. “It was busy sometimes hectic. We were stretched and sometimes tired. I supported him and he supported me. Family was and still is our top priority.”

Senior apostle Dallin Oaks Nelson’s top counselor in the governing First Presidency and next in line to lead the 17.2 million-member faith spoke on similar themes in a 2023 devotional. The 91-year-old father of six warned young single adults against delaying marriage and childbearing even for financial reasons.

He was among the first to comment on the church’s Instagram post quoting Johnson’s talk calling the Relief Society president a “wonderful role model.”

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and wife Kristen speak to young adults at a worldwide devotional broadcast in May 2023. The couple urged young adults to stop delaying marriage and parenthood.

Some commenters however worried the call to prioritize motherhood could leave women particularly vulnerable to financial insecurity.

“Approaching 40 I have seen enough faithful LDS women abandoned by their husbands and left to care for their children — all with weak educational degrees starting from scratch and barely scraping by” wrote @anniemangelson. “Too many women and children end up in absolute crisis having simply ‘followed the prophet.’ We have to quit teaching like this and setting some women up for failure.”

And as many commenters pointed out Johnson’s own decision to pursue a career conflicted with previous prophetic counsel discouraging women from work that took them away from their husbands and children.

“I’m grateful for this message and example” said user @jsmileybug. “However I’m 25 and this is the very first time I’ve EVER heard a church leader suggest it’s acceptable for [mothers] to work outside the home.”

What Kimball and Benson said

(The Salt Lake Tribune_ President Spencer W Kimball of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sits with apostle Ezra Taft Benson. Both leaders urged women to put motherhood ahead of careers.

Some of the more than 2000 comments pointed to the words of former President Spencer W. Kimball spoken in 1977 and shared a decade later during a Brigham Young University fireside by then-President Ezra Taft Benson as the kind of clear direction Johnson would have heard — and not heeded.

“No career approaches in importance that of wife homemaker mother — cooking meals washing dishes making beds for one’s precious husband and children” Benson quoted Kimball as saying. “Come home wives to your husbands. Make home a heaven for them. Come home wives to your children born and unborn.

Several Instagram commenters cited rhetoric like this as their own reason for forfeiting careers and instead having children sooner than they otherwise would have — decisions some said they now regretted. To have Johnson who chose otherwise now lauded as a role model they said was painful to watch.

One user @oils4us wrote that she was in the audience when Benson delivered his dramatic address. Taking the message to heart she said she proceeded to give birth to three children in three years.

“I used to get the BYU alumni magazine and every time I’d cry and feel sad because where was my paragraph?” she wrote. “Where were my accolades for having done what” Benson instructed?

Seeing Johnson praised now she said brought back that same ache.

“The women” she said “who went against the prophet’s very direct counsel get their paragraphs and fulfillment of becoming something else and a mom.”

Neither was the impact of such rhetoric constrained to a single generation.

“I’m sobbing reading this” commented the 35-year-old Linda Hamilton who in an interview with The Tribune said she gave up her dream of becoming a writer to devote herself to her family.

These days she mourns “for younger me. She gave up all her dreams and ambitions because she truly thought God would only accept her if she obeyed the prophets exactly.”

It’s not that Hamilton who lives in Southern California doesn’t want the church to celebrate working women. Rather she wishes Johnson and other church leaders would acknowledge that doing so represents a major break from the past.

Hamilton is hardly alone.

The ‘right thing to do’

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Relief Society General President Camille Johnson speaks at the European Union Parliament in Brussels in March 2024 on religious liberty for women.

“This would have been an even more beautiful message if it was coupled with an apology” wrote @ariabethards “to all the women who listened to President Benson and other prophets who pressured women into letting go of education and career dreams to stay home as housewives.”

Others meanwhile didn’t seem to know what to think in response to the talk.

“I’m starting to feel so confused” wrote @jameeandelin. “On the one hand I’m so happy that Camille Johnson listened to her own intuition and authority to make decisions for her life. …But I know someone who was not given a temple recommend because they chose to work instead of stay at home at the time. It’s so unfair. I don’t get it.”

Still others saw in the sermon an opportunity to emphasize the importance of following Johnson’s example and carving one’s own path.

“Let this celebratory post of a woman in the church choosing to go against the brethren” @edge_of_inside wrote “stand as a shining example to the rest of us that following our own personal revelation and authority will always be the right thing to do.”

The comments are reminiscent of the more than 13000 responses engendered by a church Instagram post from late March quoting a sermon by Johnson’s first counselor J. Anette Dennis.

In her speech and the associated post Dennis stated “There is no other religious organization in the world that I know of that has so broadly given power and authority to women.”

The women represented in the comments were less convinced arguing that their experience in the patriarchal faith did not align with Dennis’ description.

(KSLA) - Daniel Wimberly said he’s glad he took a chance after noticing social media posts that rapper Torence “Boosie” Hatch had been seen in Shreveport.

Wimberly and his wife Shantina were at a concert in Frisco Texas when they heard that the Louisiana rapper had been spotted. Not knowing whether he would respond Daniel sent Boosie a message inviting him to attend service at Greater Pleasant Grove Baptist Church.

“Daniel my husband always invites everyone to attend church with us. To us it was all about the ministry” Shantina said.

That Sunday Daniel was setting up when he spotted Boosie and his fiancée entering the church.

“While I was playing drums I was shocked because we are a small neighborhood church and here is this national recording artist who doesn’t even know me walking in to visit.”

Wimberly said he revealed at the end of the sermon that he was the one who invited Boosie. Wimberly thanked Boosie for coming and invited him to prayer.

“I told him ‘God bless him.’ Boosie smiled and you can see he was overjoyed. Then our pastor called him up to the front and asked him if he would like to say anything and Mr. Hatch asked for prayer” Wimberly recalled.

He said will never forget the conversation he had with Boosie after church.

“This means a lot to me he is one of my favorite artists and I grew up on his music. You never know what a person is going through so that’s why it’s good to reach out and invite someone to God’s house.”

It was the music that changed first. Or maybe that's just when many people at the pale brick Catholic church in the quiet Wisconsin neighborhood finally began to realize what was happening. The choir director a fixture at St. Maria Goretti for nearly 40 years was suddenly gone. Contemporary hymns were replaced by music rooted in medieval Europe. So much was changing. Sermons were focusing more on sin and confession. Priests were rarely seen without cassocks. Altar girls for a time were banned. At the parish elementary school students began hearing about abortion and hell. ""It was like a step back in time"" said one former parishioner still so dazed by the tumultuous changes that began in 2021 with a new pastor that he only spoke on condition of anonymity. It's not just St. Maria Goretti. Across the U.S. the Catholic Church is undergoing an immense shift. Generations of Catholics who embraced the modernizing tide sparked in the 1960s by Vatican II are increasingly giving way to religious conservatives who believe the church has been twisted by change with the promise of eternal salvation replaced by guitar Masses parish food pantries and casual indifference to church doctrine. The shift molded by plummeting church attendance increasingly traditional priests and growing numbers of young Catholics searching for more orthodoxy has reshaped parishes across the country leaving them sometimes at odds with Pope Francis and much of the Catholic world. The changes are not happening everywhere. There are still plenty of liberal parishes plenty that see themselves as middle-of-the-road. Despite their growing influence conservative Catholics remain a minority. Yet the changes they have brought are impossible to miss.

The progressive priests who dominated the U.S. church in the years after Vatican II are now in their 70s and 80s. Many are retired. Some are dead. Younger priests surveys show are far more conservative. ""They say they're trying to restore what us old guys ruined"" said the Rev. John Forliti 87 a retired Twin Cities priest who fought for civil rights and reforms in Catholic school sex education. Doug Koesel an outspoken 72-year-old priest at Blessed Trinity Parish in Cleveland was blunter: ""They're just waiting for us to die."" At St. Maria Goretti once steeped in the ethos of Vatican II many parishioners saw the changes as a requiem. ""I don't want my daughter to be Catholic"" said Christine Hammond whose family left the parish when the new outlook spilled into the church's school and her daughter's classroom. ""Not if this is the Roman Catholic Church that is coming."" But this is not a simple story. Because there are many who welcome this new old church. They often stand out in the pews with the men in ties and the women sometimes with the lace head coverings that all but disappeared from American churches more than 50 years ago. Often at least a couple families will arrive with four five or even more children signaling their adherence to the church's ban on contraception which most American Catholics have long casually ignored. They attend confession regularly and adhere strictly to church teachings. Many yearn for Masses that echo with medieval traditions — more Latin more incense more Gregorian chants. ""We want this ethereal experience that is different from everything else in our lives"" said Ben Rouleau who until recently led St. Maria Goretti's young adult group which saw membership skyrocket even as the parish shrank amid the turmoil. They are Rouleau said happily out of touch with a liberal city like Madison. ""It's radical in some ways"" Rouleau said. ""We're returning to the roots of the church.""

Three decades of progressive change If this movement emerged from anywhere it might be a now-demolished Denver football stadium and a borrowed military helicopter carrying in Pope John Paul II. Some 500000 people descended on Denver in 1993 for the Catholic festival World Youth Day. When the pope's helicopter landed just outside Mile High Stadium the ground shook from the stomping. The pope whose grandfatherly appearance belied an electric charisma and who was beloved both for his kindness and his sternness confronted an American church shaped by three decades of progressive change. If the church is often best known to non-Catholics for its opposition to abortion it had grown increasingly liberal since Vatican II. Birth control was quietly accepted in many parishes and confession barely mentioned. Catholic social teaching on poverty suffused churches. Most priests traded in their cassocks for plain black shirts with Roman collars. Incense and Latin became increasingly rare. On some issues John Paul II agreed with these liberal-minded Catholics. He spoke against capital punishment and pushed for workers' rights. He preached relentlessly about forgiveness — ""the oxygen that purifies the air of hatred."" He forgave his own would-be assassin. But he was also uncompromising on dogma warning about change and cracking down on liberal theologians. He urged a return to forgotten rituals. Catholics ""are in danger of losing their faith"" he told crowds at the final Denver Mass decrying abortion drug abuse and what he called ""sexual disorders"" a barely veiled reference to growing acceptance of gay rights. Across the nation fervent young Catholics listened. Newman Centers which serve Catholic university students became increasingly popular. So did FOCUS a traditionalist organization working on American college campuses. Conservative Catholic media grew particularly the cable TV network EWTN a prominent voice for increased orthodoxy.

Today conservative Catholic America has its own constellation of online celebrities aimed at young people. There's Sister Miriam James an ever-smiling nun in full habit who talks openly about her hard-partying college days. There's Jackie Francois Angel who speaks in shockingly frank detail about sex marriage and Catholicism. There's Mike Schmitz a movie-star handsome Minnesota priest who exudes kindness while insisting on doctrine. Even today surveys show most American Catholics are far from orthodox. Most support abortion rights. The vast majority use birth control. But increasingly those Catholics are not in church. In 1970 more than half of America's Catholics said they went to Mass at least once a week. By 2022 that had fallen to 17% according to CARA a research center affiliated with Georgetown University. Among millennials the number is just 9%. Even as the U.S. Catholic population has jumped to more than 70 million driven in part by immigration from Latin America ever-fewer Catholics are involved in the church's most important rites. Infant baptisms have fallen from 1.2 million in 1965 to 440000 in 2021 CARA says. Catholic marriages have dropped by well over two-thirds. The shrinking numbers mean that those who remain in the church have outsized influence compared with the overall Catholic population. On the national level conservatives increasingly dominate the U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference and the Catholic intellectual world. They include everyone from the philanthropist founder of Domino's Pizza to six of the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices. Then there's the priesthood. Young priests driven by liberal politics and progressive theology so common in the 1960s and 70s have ""all but vanished"" said a 2023 report from The Catholic Project at Catholic University based on a survey of more than 3500 priests. Today's young priests are far more likely to believe that the church changed too much after Vatican II tangling itself up in America's rapidly shifting views on everything from women's roles to LGBTQ people. ""There really aren't very many liberals in the seminaries anymore"" said a young recently ordained Midwestern priest. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the turmoil that engulfed his parish after he began pressing for more orthodox services. ""They wouldn't feel comfortable.""

Slow shift toward orthodoxy Sometimes the shift toward orthodoxy happens slowly. Maybe there's a little more Latin sprinkled into Mass or an occasional reminder to go to confession. Maybe guitars are relegated to Saturday evening services or dropped completely. And sometimes the changes come like a whirlwind dividing parishes between those thirsting for a more reverent Catholicism and those who feel their spiritual home has been taken from them. ""You'd leave Mass thinking 'Holy cow! What just happened?'"" said another ex-parishioner at St. Maria Goretti whose family eventually left the church describing the 2021 promotion of a new pastor and a sudden focus on sin and confession. Like many former parishioners he spoke only on condition of anonymity worried about upsetting friends still at the church. Diocesan clergy did not respond to requests for interviews. ""I'm a lifelong Catholic. I grew up going to church every Sunday"" he said. ""But I'd never seen anything like this."" The new outlook has spilled across America. In churches from Minnesota to California parishioners have protested changes introduced by new conservative priests. In Cincinnati it came when the new priest abandoned gospel music and African drumming. In small-town North Carolina it was an intense focus on Latin. In east Texas it was a right-wing bishop forced out by the Vatican after accusing Pope Francis of undermining church teachings. Each can seem like one more skirmish in the cultural and political battles tearing at America. But the movement whether called conservative or orthodox or traditionalist or authentic can be hard to define. It ranges from Catholics who want more incense to Latin Mass adherents who have brought back ancient prayers that mention ""the perfidious Jew."" There are right-wing survivalists celebrity exorcists environmentalists and a handful of quasi-socialists. There's the Catholic news outlet railing against the Vatican's ""wicked entourage"" and the small-town Wisconsin priest who traces COVID-19 to a century-old prophecy and warns of looming dictatorship. There's the recent ""Catholic Prayer for Trump"" a $1000-a-plate dinner at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort featuring a string of conspiracy theorists.

Yet the orthodox movement can also seem like a tangle of forgiveness and rigidity where insistence on mercy and kindness mingle with warnings of eternity in hell. Looming over the American divide is Pope Francis who has pushed the global church to be more inclusive even as he toes the line on most dogma. The orthodox movement has watched him nervously from the first days of his papacy angered by his more liberal views on issues like gay relationships and divorce. Some reject him entirely. And the pope clearly worries about America. The U.S. church has ""a very strong reactionary attitude"" he told a group of Jesuits last year. ""Being backward-looking is useless."" A new vision of Catholic America You can find this new vision of Catholic America at Latin Masses in Milwaukee the pews crowded with worshippers even at noon on a weekday. It's in conferences held in California wine country at reinvigorated parishes in Tennessee and prayer groups in Washington D.C. And it's at a little Kansas college built high on a bluff above the Missouri River. At first glance nothing seems unusual about Benedictine College. Students worry about unfinished essays and the complexities of dating. They wear cutoff shorts on warm autumn afternoons. Football is huge. The cafeteria food is mediocre. But look deeper. Because at Benedictine Catholic teaching on contraception can slip into lessons on Plato and no one is surprised if you volunteer for 3 a.m. prayers. Pornography premarital sex and sunbathing in swimsuits are forbidden. If these rules seem like precepts of a bygone age that hasn't stopped students from flocking to Benedictine and other conservative Catholic colleges. At a time when U.S. college enrollment is shrinking Benedictine's expansion over the last 15 years has included four new residence halls a new dining hall and an academic center. An immense new library is being built. The roar of construction equipment never seems to stop. Enrollment now about 2200 has doubled in 20 years. Students many of whom grew up in conservative Catholic families jokingly call it ""the Benedictine bubble."" And it might be a window into the future of the Catholic Church in America.

In a deeply secular America where an ever-churning culture provides few absolute answers Benedictine offers the reassurance of clarity. ""We don't all agree on everything obviously"" said John Welte a senior majoring in economics and philosophy. ""But I would say everyone has an understanding of like truth."" ""There are certain things you can just know in your mind: This is right and this is wrong."" Sometimes people here quietly admit it goes too far. Like the students who loudly proclaim how often they go to Mass or the young man who quit his classics course because he refused to read the works of ancient Greek pagans. Very often talk here echoes the 13th-century writings of St. Thomas Aquinas who believed God could be found in truth goodness and beauty. Sometimes they say that means finding God in strict tenets about sexuality. Sometimes in the haunting beauty of Gregorian chants. ""It's a renewal of like some really really good things that we might have lost"" said Madeline Hays a pensive 22-year-old senior biology major. She takes the church's rules seriously from pre-marital sex to confession. She can't stand modern church architecture. She's seriously considering becoming a nun. But she also worries about poverty and America's wastefulness and the way Americans — including herself — can find themselves slotted into the political divide without even knowing it. She wrestles with her belief in an unerring Catholic doctrine that can see good people including some of her own friends as sinners. Yet she doesn't want change. ""The church wouldn't be the church if it changed things it had set down as 'This is infallible doctrine and this will not change through the ages' "" she said. They understand that in Benedictine's small mostly closeted gay community. Like the young man once deeply religious who suffers in silence as people on campus casually throw around anti-gay slurs. He's thought many times of leaving but generous financial aid keeps him here. And after many years he's accepted his sexuality. He's seen the joy that people can get from Benedictine how some will move back to Atchison after graduation just to stay close. But not him. ""I don't think I'll come back to Atchison — not ever.""

Remodeling a spiritual home For decades the pews at St. Maria Goretti were filled with the families of plumbers engineers and professors from the University of Wisconsin just a couple miles up the road. The church is a well-kept island of Catholicism tucked into the leafy residential streets of one of America's most liberal cities. Like so many other parishes it had been shaped by the ideals of the 1960s and 1970s. Poverty and social justice became tightly interwoven with sermons and parish life. Gay people felt welcome. Some of the church's moral absolutes like the contraception ban became forgotten dogma. Change arrived in 2003 with a new bishop Robert C. Morlino an outspoken conservative. Many liberals remember him as the man who lambasted the message of acceptance in the modern hymn ""All Are Welcome."" His successor Bishop Donald J. Hying steers clear of public battles. But in many ways he quietly carries on Morlino's legacy warning about ""the tangled thinking of Modernism."" In 2021 Hying named the Rev. Scott Emerson a one time top Morlino aide as pastor of the Madison church. Parishioners watched — some pleased some uneasily — as their spiritual home was remodeled. There was more incense more Latin more talk of sin and confession. Emerson's sermons are not all fire-and-brimstone. He speaks often about forgiveness and compassion. But his tone shocked many longtime parishioners. Protection is needed he said in a 2023 service from ""the spiritual corruption of worldly vices."" He has warned against critics — ""the atheists journalists politicians the fallen-away Catholics"" — he said were undermining the church. For some Emerson's changes were welcome. ""A lot of us were like 'Hey more confession! Sweet!"" said Rouleau who ran the parish young adult group. ""Better music!""

“We love having our space open almost recklessly open for the neighborhood” the Rev. Kevin Deal St. John’s vicar told Episcopal News Service. Serving its community “has been part of the DNA of St. John’s almost since its inception 164 years ago.”

St. John’s provides space for more than just sleeping through its partnership with the Gubbio Project a nonprofit organization that serves unhoused people with “safe compassionate respite during the day” according to its website.

The project takes its name from an Italian town where according to legend St. Francis of Assisi brokered a truce between a hungry wolf and frightened townspeople. The nonprofit was founded in 2004 and moved into space at St. John’s in 2017.

Lydia Bransten Gubbio’s executive director since 2021 told ENS that the legend embodies what her organization is about. “When people come together with mutual need we find commonality and can work together” she said.

Their response shines a light not only on homelessness in general but on how communities across the country seek to address it. Homelessness has been on the rise across the United States since 2017 and cities have grappled with how where and even if to provide shelters or housing. A lawsuit against Grants Pass Oregon for its decision to fine homeless people for sleeping outside on public property made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court for oral arguments on April 22.

According to the Associated Press one-third of the country’s unhoused population live in western states like Oregon and California. The San Francisco Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing’s 2022 Point-in-Time count found more than 7700 unhoused people in the city with more than 4000 of them unsheltered. The 2024 count is due out this summer.

While unhoused people have existed in America since the 17th century their needs have grown more acute than ever since the COVID-19 pandemic Bransten said. Homeless people in San Francisco who weren’t gravely disabled or seniors “were basically left out on the street” and with shelters closed encampments sprang up so people could find some safety in being together. There were few services available and many people watched others die of an overdose. “There was a lot of trauma in those years” she said.

“The result is a community of people who are distrusting who are more ill and fentanyl addiction collided with COVID in a way that has been debilitating for that community” she said.

A recent assessment of homeless people living in the Mission District found that before COVID 68% of them were employed and had housing she said. Immigrants make up a large portion of the area’s population and many lost their jobs as office building cleaners or restaurant workers during the pandemic. Loss of a job often meant loss of housing.

Now when St. John’s opens its doors each weekday about 35 people come to sleep and over 100 more arrive for the supportive services Gubbio offers. With no pews in the nave it’s easy to set up cots with blankets and people are welcome to bring their belongings and their dogs inside with them. Couples can arrange their cots to be near each other which usually isn’t permitted in shelters Bransten said. “The only rule is to just stay peaceful” she said.

In other parts of the building people can get a cup of coffee or see one of the nurses who provide foot and wound care. The city’s Department of Public Health’s street medicine team provides health screenings and follow-up appointments. Gubbio’s harm reduction specialist who also is a treatment counselor provides clean needles and other paraphernalia so those using drugs can do so safely.

“That provides an entrée to a conversation with a person who is struggling with drug use” Bransten said. Recovery from addiction always is the end goal but “we need to keep them alive long enough and love them enough until they are ready to love themselves into recovery.”

Bransten said that St. John’s offers a space for Gubbio’s clients that is both sacred and safe. “Not all sacred spaces feel safe” she added. “A lot of people have experienced a level of spiritual violence and St. John’s is an incredibly healing community.”

Deal and some of his parishioners provide pastoral care to those who come to the church for Gubbio’s services and many of them now attend worship services at St. John’s something Deal says he loves. “We don’t think of them as people from Gubbio” he said “they are just folks in the St. John’s community.” He said that because people are familiar with the church and think of it as their space they feel comfortable coming back on Sunday.

Bransten said St. John’s building itself helps the people Gubbio serves. “The beauty of the space is key to the way we’re able to create an environment where people feel welcomed where they feel like it’s peaceful it’s beautiful and it’s for them.”

“This is exactly who the beauty of God’s house is intended” Deal said. “It’s not for the people who have everything. The beauty of God’s house is for the people who are down and out.”

PITTSBURGH (KDKA) -- From Irwin to North Braddock to Ross Township multiple types of disruptions impacting church services have taken place throughout the Pittsburgh area within the last several weeks.

One of the incidents involved a gun pulled on a pastor during a sermon while another consisted of vandalism impacting an organ and sound equipment.

New federal funding has been approved to help increase security for places of worship and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says that all types of churches are welcome to apply.

Places of worship can apply for funding through the Nonprofit Security Grant Program and can use the funds for whatever they would like as long as it helps add security. The deadline to apply for funding is May 21.

""I thank God because only God stopped and jammed this gun.""

A man was arrested in North Braddock on Sunday after pulling a gun on a pastor during his sermon at the Jesus' Dwelling Place Church -- and it was all caught on camera.

Bernard Polite is facing attempted homicide and aggravated assault charges and is accused of trying to shoot and kill the pastor.

As the pastor ducked out of the way Polite was tackled by a deacon and held down on the ground until police arrived.

Police are also investigating after a man was found shot to death in Polite's home near the church. It's unclear if he is responsible for that shooting.

""All churches are sacred places which should be treated with respect.""

A church in Westmoreland County fell victim to vandalism late last week and is looking for help identifying the teenagers responsible for the damage.

As a result of the vandalism the church was unable to use the organ for the first two Holy Communion masses the following morning.

""It was an important sacramental day for our parish and the children and their families were affected by the two teenager's actions"" Father John Moineau. ""All churches are sacred places which should be treated with respect.""

The church is now asking for help identifying the two teenagers and say that information will be turned over to Irwin Police.

""It would be nice if people could just practice their religions in peace.""

Last month a man was reported to be walking into nearly a dozen area churches includes St. Sebastian Church in Ross Township and yelling at a priest that he was the devil.

Parishioners said that these type of incidents are especially disturbing because the man's intentions weren't clear.

The Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh is working with multiple law enforcement agencies to track down the man."

Menurutnya BRI mampu mendorong inklusi dan literasi keuangan hingga pelosok negeri. Perempuan-perempuan di daerah kata dia melalui layanan perbankan BRI diajarkan bagaimana cara menabung hingga mempersiapkan keuangan mereka dengan cara yang lebih aman.

Hal itu menjadi penting bagi pelaku ekonomi menengah ke bawah khususnya kaum hawa karena dapat membangun kepercayaan antara masyarakat yang masih belum paham fasilitas perbankan.

Dengan demikian masyarakat yang masih minim literasi dapat teredukasi. Sehingga perlahan tapi pasti semakin paham layanan jasa keuangan formal demi terciptanya masyarakat yang berdaya dan mampu berkontribusi terhadap pertumbuhan ekonomi Indonesia.

""Essentially what I wanna say is sangat bangga dan bahagia bisa jadi Brand Ambassador BRI karena aku harap dengan adanya kehadiran aku kita bisa terus menyebarkan awareness soal hal ini"" kata Cinta.

Karena itu dia dan BRI berharap dapat bekerja sama memberdayakan kaum perempuan di tataran grassroots economy. Dengan memberikan fasilitas dan edukasi yang cukup agar bisa mulai mengeksekusi bisnis-bisnis yang mereka inginkan dan akhirnya lebih berdaya.

Adapun di ajang WOMAN BRI 2022 dihadapan sekitar 7.000 perempuan-perempuan tangguh dari BRI PT Pegadaian dan PT Permodalan Nasional Madani (PNM) Cinta memberikan pendapatnya tentang perjuangan Raden Ajeng Kartini dalam membuat fondasi emansipasi perempuan di Indonesia.

Menurutnya Kartini adalah sosok yang mampu berjuang sehingga kaum perempuan bisa mengakses pendidikan yang lebih layak.

Oleh karena itu perjuangan Kartini menurutnya perlu terus digulirkan dan ditularkan kepada seluruh perempuan Indonesia. Agar bangsa ini maju berdasarkan inklusivitas dan jauh dari ketimpangan gender.

When Cisco and NetApp’s converged infrastructure storage platform FlexPod launched in 2010 commercial cloud computing was still in its infancy. Now over a decade has passed and the enterprise storage paradigm has shifted dramatically as companies embrace the hybrid cloud. In face of this new reality the developers of FlexPod have announced an upcoming refresh of the platform one that better postures the solution for hybrid cloud environments with a new suite of tools.

Dubbed XCS the updated product ties together Cisco’s Intersight Platform with NetApp’s ONTAP software granting users full-stack visibility end-to-end automation and native integration with three major cloud service providers.

See below to learn all about what does FlexPod XCS offer in relation to its prior version and the converged infrastructure storage market:

FlexPod and the converged infrastructure market

Data centers built under the traditional three-tier model consist of servers storage devices and networking switches. Often this group of hardware is built by different manufacturers and many resources have been expended to ensure compatibility and functionality between the layers. Converged infrastructure such as FlexPod was developed in response to this by establishing best practices and pre-validating all the hardware to be used in a data center.

Platforms like FlexPod also often deliver their converged solutions with a converged system adviser giving administrators the ability to monitor and control the broader system quickly and efficiently. FlexPod also ships with UCS-Director which can pre-provision applications automate services and allocate CPUs and memory as needed.

In the case of FlexPod the hardware is made by Cisco and it’s bundled with NetApp software. The integrated hardware and software coupled with the streamlined support channels from limited vendors has made converged infrastructure a more modern solution to the challenges that arose within the traditional model. Other converged infrastructure solutions include Dell PowerEdge VRTX HPE Converged and Oracle Supercluster.

By contrast hyperconverged infrastructures unify all elements of a data center into a single appliance. While this carries furter benefits toward simplifying network and storage management with potential reductions in cost hyperconverged infrastructures often pose challenges to scalability.

FlexPod XCS features

Some of the new tools that help FlexPod XCS span on-premises workloads into the cloud include:

Cisco Intersight Platform: A cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform that monitors and controls the underlying FlexPod components whether they be on the edge the cloud or in-house managed through a single pane. The software unites Cisco and NetApp storage as well as Kubernetes containerization management through a single dashboard.

Cloud integrations: The converged infrastructure platform features native integration with the three preeminent cloud service providers: AWS Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. This integration extends the single-dashboard visibility of the broader storage environment bridging on-premises servers and the cloud. FlexPod XCS includes health status alarms monitoring of storage capacity and network usage and compliance checking and enforcement.

As-a-service model: FlexPod XCS introduces the service model lowering startup costs to use the platform. Pricing is scalable with customer usage and needs.

Automation: Cisco’s Cloud Orchestrator optimizes workloads automates tasks enforces policies and enables users to self-serve. It is designed to be low/no code. Automation services are configured out of the box servicing day zero configuration workflows and beyond.

Hybrid cloud readiness: Designed to manage cloud backups disaster recovery and fulfill burst needs for processing and capacity.

Containerization: Using NetApp’s CSI Trident FlexPod XCS manages Kubernetes containers with community-developed standardized APIs. Kubernetes deployment is further managed with Cisco’s Intersight Kubernetes Service (IKS). Cloud-native applications can be deployed either locally or in the cloud.

NetApp ONTAP: FlexPod XCS comes with NetApp’s ONTAP data management software designed for file and block workloads.

Existing FlexPod features: While XCS branches FlexPod into the hybrid cloud it still retains the core converged infrastructure features of its previous iteration uniting the three tiers of server components under one management tool with pre-validated hardware.

Case study

Mantra Group

Although FlexPod XCS is in limited debut with full availability expected later this year the FlexPod platform has enjoyed widespread market adoption. One such client is the Australia- and New Zealand-based high-profile hotel chain Mantra Group. With over 11000 rooms for rent across 117 properties Mantra is one of Australia’s largest hotel operators. The company experienced rapid growth and expected more on the horizon as it targeted Asia-Pacific developments. Back ending its operations is a central reservation system one that is accessed by nearly all its employees and many of its customers. While the previous system was performing well Mantra knew it required future proofing to avoid performance loss as the chain grew.

The company adopted several components in securing a more responsive broader IT infrastructure including all-flash storage units from NetApp Cisco unified computing system servers and network switches and NetApp’s Data ONTAP OS much of which was deployed in a FlexPod environment. The resulting solution “could double the number of properties [Mantra] manages over the next three years” while maintaining a high level of performance according to Manta’s IT general manager.

Use case

Data center for AI

Cisco and NetApp offer configurations of FlexPod for different use cases including a setup optimized for the high computing and storage demands of artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML). These high-performance computations require complex integrations of hardware and software components that can make deployment scaling and maintenance operations burdensome under traditional data center models. FlexPod’s Data center for AI solution is optimized for these types of workloads with high-performance Cisco servers NVIDIA GPUs 3 TB of memory and support for up to 24 hard disk drives (HDDs) or solid-state drives (SSDs). FlexPod has deployed these solutions in the financial industry to thwart fraud in the health care industry to process medical image screening and in media and entertainment to produce virtual reality (VR) environments. The data center also stands ready to collaborate across cloud platforms.

Differentiator

FlexPid XCS is a converged infrastructure platform integrated with AWS Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. As most enterprises are already hosting their hybrid cloud platforms with these providers the integrations could stand to simplify deployment and management of hybrid cloud platforms and give FlexPod users better service and support.

User reviews

The presently-available version of FlexPod is PeerSpot’s No. 2 converged infrastructure tool with a customer rating of 4.2 out of 5 stars. Users praise the unified full-stack solution its scalability and its high availability.

Pricing

Pricing for XCS is yet to be determined but XCS will be available for purchase later this summer and available with a pay-as-you-go model.

Conclusions

FlexPod already enjoys adoption from thousands of enterprise clients across the world. We’ll be following how its next iteration empowers IT with more intelligent insights serves data storage and supports web application deployment in multicloud environments later this year when the updated converged infrastructure solution hits the market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlcG9ydGVybmV3cy5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzLzIwMjIvMDQvMjMvbWVya2VsLWFsYmFueS13aW4tYmlnLWlyYXMtcGVuYS10aHJvd3Mtbm8taGl0dGVyLzc0MjMzODUwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merkel Albany win big; Ira's Peña throws no-hitter,"MERKEL — Clyde earned a much-needed win Friday routing the Merkel15-1 in five innings.

The one parcel to be offered at the BLM’s Utah auction June 28 is located on the right edge of this photograph on the far side of the river. It features an abandoned 55-year-old well that will have to be plugged by whoever buys this lease. Overflight provided by LightHawk.

Editor’s note • This story is available to Salt Lake Tribune subscribers only. Thank you for supporting local journalism.

Back in the 1960s a Texas company called Shamrock Oil and Gas Corp. drilled several wells on public land in a new oil and gas field called Horseshoe Bend named for a prominent feature on the Green River in Utah’s Uinta Basin.

One well called McLish #3 produced for two decades yielding nearly 700 million cubic feet of gas before it was idled in 1987 when a new owner concluded it was no longer economical to operate according to records on file with the Utah Division of Oil Gas and Mining (DOGM). For the next 35 years the well changed operators several times; each new owner tried unsuccessfully to eke a profit from it.

McLish #3 finally landed into the hands of Vernal oilman Mark Peterson doing business as Hot Rod Oil who was acquiring many marginal wells in the basin in the mid-1990s. Over the ensuing years Hot Rod essentially walked away from the unproductive McLish wells without plugging them or remediating the sites leaving the mess for federal land managers to clean up according to DOGM records.

The federal leases expired and the wells joined a list of “orphaned” and “idled” wells proliferating across public lands in the West a problem the Biden administration is now seeking to reverse.

“Portions of our federal lands have been neglected after years of prioritizing fossil fuel development above all other uses — ignoring the potential impacts to people water wildlife climate and the potential economic benefits of remediation” Nada Culver Bureau of Land Management’s deputy director for policy and programs testified last year before Congress. “The cleanup of this past development has now been left to the taxpayer to remediate instead of the liable party responsible.”

Now the BLM has decided to reissue the lease on which McLish #3 has long sat idle — but with a big catch. Whoever acquires the lease on this 159-acre parcel would be required to plug the well if they don’t put it back into production. They must put up a surety bond for the site’s reclamation before the lease would be issued under a decision the BLM released April 18 officially marking an end to the White House’s 15-month moratorium on oil and gas leasing.

“The well is in need of immediate attention and the successful bidder should plan to perform work on the well soon after lease issuance” states the decision.

Actually that’s not the case. In the months since the lease sale’s environmental review the Interior Department’s well-plugging program caught up with the McLish wells.

How a Utah well became an “orphan” June 1967: Shamrock Oil and Gas Corp. based in Amarillo Texas drills the McLish #2 and #3 well near Horseshoe Bend in Uintah County. 1984: Alta Energy acquires the McLish wells in 1984 and soon idles Mclish #3 when it is no longer economical to produce natural gas from it. March 1987: Columbia Gas Development Corp. of Houston buys the well in March 1987 and was able to produce 611000 cubic feet before again idling it the next month. 1989: Columbia brings in a drill rig to “work over” the well in an unsuccessful bid to bring it back into production. February 1992: Ross Exploration Inc of Roosevelt acquires the wells. October 1992: The city of Nephi acquires the wells. October 1994: Hot Rod Oil of Vernal acquires and brings them back into marginal intermittent production. August 2003: McLish #3 produces its last reported cubic foot of gas Dec. 3 2021: BLM plugs the well. March 2022: State designates McLish # as “Orphaned-No Responsible Operator” Source: Utah Division of Oil Gas and Mining

A BLM-hired contractor plugged McLish #2 on Dec. 1 and McLish #3 on Dec. 3 according to the wells’ permit files maintained by state regulators. But well sites may still need surface reclamation

Regardless the McLish site will be the one and only parcel offered at BLM’s next quarterly auction for Utah to be held online June 28 the first since December 2020. Under a court order the Interior Department is offering leases for the first time since Joe Biden was sworn in succeeding a president who declared climate change a hoax and offered far more Western public lands for oil and gas development than the industry could even bid on.

Interior Secretary Deb Haaland has ordered a resumption of leasing but under a more deliberative program in accordance with reforms recommended in a report released in November. In an effort to discourage speculation and ensure a better return for the American public offerings will be far smaller than what the industry asked for operators will pay a higher royalty and minimum bids and annual rents will be increased from the current $2 an acre.

The BLM has hiked the royalty rate on new leases by half to 18.75%. The rent and minimum bids will not be increased for the leases sold in the June sale.

The BLM’s new rules and slim offerings for the June auctions upset the oil and gas industry whose representatives complained Interior’s policy shift would “further” depress domestic energy production and exacerbate the global surge in fuel costs.

“The only thing that will materially bring down the cost of gasoline over the long term is a sincere effort to increase domestic production which would be a very different set of policies than we see from the administration currently” said Rikki Hrenko-Browning president of the Utah Petroleum Association. “Here in Utah we along with our members look forward to working with the administration on policies that can actually help increase production and provide relief to consumers and strengthen our energy security.”

(Trent Nelson | The Salt Lake Tribune) The Three Rivers field west of the Ouray National Wildlife Refuge pictured on Nov. 17 2001 is among Utah’s most productive oil and gas fields. This photograph was taken on a flight chartered by LightHawk.

For the Utah sale the BLM considered just six parcels on 6645 acres from the nearly 100000 acres “nominated” for leasing since the beginning of 2021. Four were on the Green River near Horseshoe Bend 10 miles south of Vernal. The area has a long history of drilling. Within a mile of these parcels are two producing six idled and 28 “abandoned” wells industry parlance for plugged wells. Also on the list were single parcels each in Grand and Emery counties.

Ultimately the BLM decided to offer just the 159-acre quarter-section with the McLish well in a plan dubbed the Recreational Resources Preservation Alternative. The public or industry may file a protest against the decision before May 18.

That parcel is one of 173 totaling 144000 acres the BLM is auctioning in June in several states. It will be the first round of auctions since December 2020 when energy prices were badly depressed under the weight of the pandemic. Now two months into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine oil prices have skyrocketed and the industry’s interest in public lands is picking up.

“We knew lifting the leasing ban wouldn’t jump-start production but it would send a message to the market that help is on the way” said Thom Carter director of the Utah Office of Energy Development. “What we see in Utah which is so minimal won’t send the kind of message we need to send to the market.”

Interestingly the Trump administration flooded the market with federal lease offerings at a time of historically low oil and gas prices. The situation is now completely reversed with sparse offerings coming forward at a time of astronomic prices.

Even with today’s thirst for oil and gas however it seems unlikely anyone would risk bidding on the Utah parcel which has already been tapped and abandoned.

According to the BLM Hot Rod will remain obligated to reclaim the site if the parcel fails to be leased and the agency holds a bond from the company although it is unclear whether it would be sufficient to cover the well’s reclamation costs.

At the last auction in 2020 the BLM tried and failed to lease another Utah parcel encumbered with an unplugged well according to leasing records.

This 40-acre tract in Grand County was once part of a much larger lease issued decades ago to Ambra Oil and Gas in the Cisco Springs oil and gas field north of Interstate 70. Ambra drilled the TXO Springs 9-1 well in 1981 and produced nearly 300 million cubic feet of gas from it according to the well’s DOGM file. But by the early 1990s the well stop producing and the BLM instructed Ambra to plug it and other “temporarily abandoned” wells in the Cisco field.

Instead of plugging the wells Ambra sold them and they wound up in the hands of a Colorado company called Falcon Energy LLC whose principal Wayne Stout died in 2015 without ever resuming production from TXO Springs 9-1 or plugging it.

The site remains unreclaimed awaiting a plug job courtesy of U.S. taxpayers unless the BLM can find a new lessee.",,,

Here is Dana Milbank:

Mickey Mouse needs a sanctuary city.

Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-Hades) got his state legislature this week to abolish the favorable tax arrangement that brought Disney World to Orlando and kept it there for 55 years. It’s the latest salvo against corporate America from the Trump right which has already threatened Twitter Facebook Citigroup and Delta Air Lines. But now they’re canceling Mickey and Minnie? That’s just Goofy.

Taking aim at Ariel Belle Jasmine Pocahontas and Moana? It’s not only cruel — it’s Cruella.

Suddenly sad times are upon the Happiest Place on Earth. Jared Polis the Democratic governor of Colorado has promised to “grant Mickey and Minnie full asylum in Colorado” and offered Disney a “Mountain Disneyland” retreat from “Florida’s authoritarian socialist attacks on the private sector.” Many Disney fans online are urging Disney World to leave Florida.

Of course you can’t just put a resort with six theme parks and two dozen or so hotels on a magic carpet ride to say New Jersey. (As it is central Floridians could be stuck with more than $1 billion in debt and a massive property-tax increase because of DeSantis’s anti-Disney vendetta.) But Disney is the place where dreams come true and mine is that the whole of Disney World which employs roughly 80000 Floridians and attracts tens of millions of tourists every year will take the second star to the right and straight on till morning — and abandon Florida entirely.

DeSantis would be left with a 25000-acre house of horrors in Orlando: an abandoned resort in a state nobody wants to visit thanks to Ron’s Runaway Railway.

His “don’t say gay” legislation makes Florida unwelcoming to LGBTQ people. His voter-suppression laws and race-baiting attacks on teaching history and race make Florida hostile to Black Latino and Asian Americans. Rising antisemitism (Florida’s most famous resident just had a film screening at Mar-a-Lago characterized by antisemitic swipes at Mark Zuckerberg) gives Jews pause about the state. DeSantis’s MAGA-signaling anti-immigrant and antiabortion laws repel more large swaths of the population. His banning of math textbooks should send educated Floridians packing. His opposition to Medicaid expansion and Florida’s excessive covid-19 death rate over the past year have sent many Floridians to the morgue.

So far Caratini has done that and then some.

Entering Saturday’s game with the Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park Caratini led the team in OPS (.909) batting 5-for-18 with four walks and a home run.

For a player who was expected to learn an entirely new pitching staff on the fly the offense from Caratini has been a bonus for Milwaukee.

“He’s swung the bat really well” Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. “This is kind of what we had hoped. We hoped to acquire a guy that one we could hit the ground running with which I think we did.”

Among all players with at least 20 plate appearances this season the 28-year-old has the lowest chase rate swinging at just 10.9% of pitches outside the strike zone. That is a far improvement from Caratini’s career mark of 27.8% and career-worst 29.7% chase rate in 2021.

“It’s definitely something I worked on in the off-season and it’s started coming” Caratini said through interpreter Carlos Brizuela. “Last year I was swinging at a lot of pitches out of the zone so I tried to focus on that and the hard work is paying off.”

Behind the plate Caratini says he has finally settled in with the whole pitching staff now that he has had two-plus weeks to work with the group.

“For sure I definitely feel a lot more comfortable” he said. “I’ve been able to spend a lot of time with every pitcher and catch them all a few times so I definitely feel a lot better.”

Luis Urias begins his rehab assignment with Biloxi

An extended spring training game Thursday went well for Brewers infielder Luis Urias and he started playing in rehab games with Class AA Biloxi on Saturday as he recovers from a strained left quad.

The Brewers do not have a set timeline for how long Urias will play in the minors but he will need to acclimate himself at the plate after playing in only one game this spring. He will likely see time at third base shortstop and designated hitter.

“He’ll start there (Saturday) and be there for a while” Counsell said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNyaW1zb24uY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjAyMi80LzIzL2Jvc3Rvbi1iYWxsZXQtZHJlYW1zdGF0ZS1yZXZpZXctbWFyY2gtMjAyMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘DREAMstate’ Review: Boston Ballet Explores the Liminal | Arts,"What does it mean to dream? What kinds of spaces can open up when we allow ourselves to travel deep within our psyche? These were the questions that came to mind when watching a performance of Boston Ballet’s latest oeuvre “DREAMstate.” The show which ran at the Citizens Bank Opera House from March 17 through the 27 featured a triple bill of three stunning contemporary ballets: George Balanchine’s 1976 ballet “Chaconne” Stephen Galloway’s world premiere DEVIL’S/eye and Jiří Kylián’s 1996 “Bella Figura.” Each of the ballets were innovative in their own way powerfully setting and subverting expectations while exploring themes of personhood liminality and the boundaries of consciousness.

Utilizing the more conventional stylings of “Chaconne” as the starting point for the night’s exploration of the self and its limits “DREAMstate” establishes the genre of ballet as both something to lean into and something that can be expanded and reworked. Told through the unbelievable artistry and athleticism of its dancers resplendent in their white costumes against a simple background “Chaconne” is beautiful — that much cannot be disputed. But despite the innovative movement inherent to “The Father of American Ballet”’s choreography the ballet can still be read as falling within the modern-day confines of the genre. That’s not to say the ballet isn’t compelling — it is and the Boston Ballet company was stellar in its translation of the piece to the Citizen’s Opera House stage — but the night’s performances only became more interesting from there.

While “Chaconne” forged a new understanding of classical ballet “DEVIL’s/eye” and “Bella Figura” both lean into something altogether different. Each pushes the relationship between dance music and aesthetics in the search for new limits.

With “DEVIL’s/eye” choreographer dancer and costume designer Stephen Galloway creates an unforgettable ode to love youth and joyful exuberance. Set to a selection of music by The Rolling Stones — for whom Galloway worked as a choreographer and creative consultant — the world premiere ballet is superpowered from start to finish. It is as remarkable for its show-stopping aesthetics (the dancers clad in sparkly and skin-baring ‘80s gym-inspired getups danced in front of massive amp-like light fixtures) as it is for Galloway’s commitment to breaking the mold of classical ballet. Galloway’s dancers — led in part by Boston Ballet principal dancer and Harvard Dance Center’s own John Lam — embodied young lovers and freedom-seeking renegades alike their movements unconstrained as they brought the timeless rock songs to life. It was pure and unbridled rock and roll. An achingly haunting pas de deux to “Wild Horses” with Lam and soloist Chisako Oga was a standout amid a universally strong ballet.

In closing out the show Kylián’s “Bella Figura” took “DREAMstate”’s ruminations on consciousness and the human experience to its natural conclusion. With its exploration of the body as a site of beauty pain and genesis “Bella Figura” managed to escape from the physical and audiospacial limits of the opera house: A fire burned on either side of the stage curtains became usable props and semi-naked dancers floated in mid air while others continued dancing through periods of extended silence so that one could hear the dancers’ own footsteps on the marley floor. Each carefully calibrated movement fell heavy on an already rapt audience as dancers navigated the various scenes of rebirth that drive the ballet their costumes red like blood and designed with the physical contours of the body in mind. The result was a captivating and moving exploration of what it means to be alive and in constant conversation with the self and other people. The choreography was most effective when in true Kylián fashion dancers were interacting with one another compelled into movement by the touch of their partner at a given moment.

Critically the exploration of human consciousness and the body (and its capacity for movement) in the three ballets is only strengthened in their juxtaposition to each other. Each seeks out to explore a different facet of human identity and “DREAMstate” capitalizes on the resulting contrast. In forcing audiences to contend with the liminal spaces those between the embodied joy of “DEVIL’S/eye” and the sober hauntings of “Bella Figura” “DREAMstate” makes a strong case for the ambiguity of human consciousness and the capacity for such a consciousness to be captured through art.

The Philadelphia Phillies drop game two of their series against the Brewers 5-3 as Zack Wheeler takes his third consecutive loss of the season.

A disastrous fifth inning by Wheeler and the Phillies defense pushed the Brewers ahead to a 4-3 lead. Wheeler gave up four runs on five hits in the inning and spoiled his otherwise great outing.

The final run of that inning came on an under throw by JT Realmuto to catch Christian Yelich stealing second base. The ball rolled into center field and granted Willy Adames an easy opportunity to score from third.

Wheeler gave up just two base runners in the first four innings of the game while showcasing an average 4-seam fastball velocity of 95.9 mph almost a full 1.5 mph faster than his previous start.

Regardless of the end result Wheeler did look much sharper compared to his first two starts. It appears as though he just ran out of gas in that fifth inning something that will be fixed when he gets more usage this season.

Despite their early surge picking up three runs in the first three innings the Phillies offense was dormant for the final six innings of the game picking up just three hits in that span.

Bryce Harper and Nick Castellanos gave the Phillies a 1-0 lead with back-to-back doubles in the first.

The team would then add to that lead in the third thanks to an Odubel Herrera lead-off triple that resulted in a score on a misplayed pop fly into shallow right field off the bat of Jean Segura. Segura would later score courtesy of a Castellanos sac-fly.

That would be the last time the Phillies offense contributed to a scoreboard change and it was all Brewers from there on.

The Phillies fall to a 6-9 record and are desperate to find their groove on both sides of the ball. They will have another opportunity on Sunday in their final game of the series against Milwaukee.

Aaron Nola is set to take the mound for the Phillies while the Brewers are sending out Eric Lauer for the start. First pitch is scheduled for 7:08 pm at Citizens Bank Park.

He wanted to hear from the people whose lives were at stake: those living in communities most impacted by violent crime police misconduct growing poverty and persistent disinvestment — communities like Sandtown-Winchester the West Baltimore neighborhood where Freddie Gray died from injuries suffered in police custody five years before the wave of protests that gripped the nation in summer 2020.

“There were thousands of people protesting but most weren’t from these impacted communities” Kelly said. “As we saw ‘defund’ and ‘refund’ and all these taglines coming into play we wanted to focus on listening and elevating their voices.”

His relatively new West Baltimore-based organization the Citizens Policing Project designed a study that involved interviewing community members about public safety asking open-ended questions about their personal experiences attitudes toward the police and proposed solutions. Kelly established the organization in 2018 to advocate for increased civilian oversight of the police department.

When asked whether they supported calls to defund police only about 30% of more than 1000 people the group interviewed said yes according to a recent report that Kelly authored based on findings from the study.

“The immediate reaction … usually was to emphasize how violent and dangerous our streets are” the report says.

Supporters of the defund movement in Baltimore want to transfer money directly from the police budget to schools affordable housing drug treatment and mental health programs — services meant to address the root causes of violence. Their voices likely will enter upcoming discussions about the city’s proposed 2023 budget which was released Monday and calls for increasing police spending by $5 million.

“The money has to come from somewhere and the biggest budget hog in Baltimore City is the police department” said Jessi Ahart digital organizer at Communities United a Baltimore-based advocacy group. “We need to stop spending money on things that don’t work.”

She noted that Baltimore already spends more on policing per capita than other large American cities according to data compiled by the nonprofit Vera Institute of Justice. But its murder rate remains among the highest.

Funding schools a top priority

Interviews for the Citizens Policing Project study were conducted over several months in 2021 by a group of young people working for the organization.

One point the participants largely agreed on according to the report was that Baltimore should better fund public schools in its poorest neighborhoods. That would allow schools to become places where students could imagine a brighter future for themselves Kelly said.

Instead of upgrading outdated buildings increasing technology and maintaining much-needed extracurricular programs Baltimore education officials have been closing schools due to decreased enrollment in some struggling communities.

In Sandtown-Winchester the closure of William Pinderhughes Elementary left “an unattended vacant lot attracting all sorts of nefarious behavior” since the building “already bordered a flourishing open air drug market” the report says.

Aside from boosting education funding residents also want their elected officials to prioritize spending on programs and services that help people lift themselves out of poverty including addiction and mental health treatment affordable housing and job creation according to the report.

In response to those findings Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott highlighted a $65 million increase in school funding included in the 2023 budget.

“I will continue to make targeted investments in our communities while also ensuring that BPD is appropriately funded to fulfill its obligations per the Consent Decree” Scott said in a statement referring to the court-ordered decree the city agreed to in 2017 after a federal investigation found a pattern of unconstitutional policing — particularly in poor predominantly Black neighborhoods. “We have to fund both the implementation of the Consent Decree and areas that will pave a new way forward for our city.”

In the report Kelly argued that investments in schools and social programs if done properly could decrease violent crime and reduce the need for policing eventually allowing Baltimore to safely shrink its police budget. He proposes first investing in services that address the root causes of violence then decreasing police spending.

But he acknowledged that getting officials on board with the front-end investment could prove difficult.

Bracing for change that takes time

The report is titled “The Long Game” because there is no quick fix for the entrenched social problems in Baltimore that so often garner negative headlines Kelly said.

“The ever-changing dynamic of police reform in Baltimore City has made it extremely difficult to emphasize the ongoing need for community investment as the media continues to paint a picture of war zones and anarchy when crime is high” the report says.

Although the study arose largely from the 2020 racial justice protests Kelly said its themes remain relevant especially following Gov. Larry Hogan’s recent announcement committing $45 million to fund police and prosecutors to better combat surging violent crime in Baltimore.

Meanwhile Baltimore officials will start discussing the city’s proposed 2023 budget. In the wake of the 2020 protests City Council voted to eliminate roughly $22 million in police spending only to pass a $28 million increase last year which officials said was needed to cover rising health insurance and pension costs. The proposed $5 million increase in 2023 would fund additional positions for the new Gun Violence Reduction Strategy create more civilian jobs cover rising health care and inflation costs and help raise starting salaries for rookie officers.

Some of those efforts are aimed at addressing a deepening worker shortage. The department is required to adequately staff patrol investigations and internal affairs positions under the consent decree.

In his report Kelly recommends a more inclusive process for developing the city’s annual budget proposal; he called for giving council members more say instead of relying almost solely on the mayor’s office.

Meanwhile residents interviewed for the study reported little to no change in their dealings with police since the consent decree mandated significant reforms.

Among other things the settlement limited how police can engage with people suspected of criminal activity and required more supervision of officers and training in de-escalation. It also called for enhanced civilian oversight and transparency.

Kelly who previously served as the lead community liaison for the monitoring team overseeing the consent decree said many people in those neighborhoods are losing hope that police interactions will ever improve.

However the study also found that younger people were more supportive of sharing their stories and experiences with both police and community members especially negative interactions with law enforcement.

“We have this blueprint for equitable policing but we can’t seem to get it implemented at the street level” Kelly said. “Where is the urgency?”

That’s part of the reason more people are moving out of neighborhoods like Sandtown-Winchester when they can afford to the report says: “Seeing the ever-growing violence fueled by an unchecked fentanyl epidemic minimal effective police presence and the continued blind eye shown by their elected representatives who could blame them?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vY3ViYmllc2NyaWIuY29tLzIwMjIvMDQvMjMvY3Vicy1hbGZvbnNvLXJpdmFzLW11c3QtcGxheS1hcy1tdWNoLWFzLXBvc3NpYmxlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cubs: Alfonso Rivas needs to play as much as possible,Next.

Ethereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain and the first network to launch smart contract functionality. Ethereum was launched in July 2015 and in the span of a few years it increased considerably in value due to its wide range of decentralized application (DApp) offerings. The explosive rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) have sealed its success as the most actively used blockchain network. Furthermore its native currency Ether (ETH) has solidly maintained its second position by market capitalization and daily volume in the cryptocurrency space.

What is Ethereum’s intrinsic value? Before identifying what is unique about Ethereum let us first explore the definition of intrinsic value and how it applies to digital currencies like Ethereum. In finance the intrinsic value represents the perceived or actual value of an asset or a currency. It should not be confused with the market price because assets can be over or undervalued. Fiat currencies like the United States dollar or the euro have intrinsic value because they are issued by monetary authorities like central banks and are primarily used in their economy. What is the intrinsic value of digital currencies? Governments’ central banks do not back cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or ETH but their intrinsic value could be defined by their scarcity use cases and technological application. Over the years cryptocurrencies have gained a reputation as a store of value and promise they can also become units of exchange in the future.

What is the true value of Ethereum? Given that intrinsic value is an investor’s perceived or actual value of an asset utility is crucial to why Ethereum has attracted interest and capital across the crypto community. In contrast with Bitcoin which was created as a money alternative to national currencies Ethereum was built as a platform that could facilitate programmatic smart contracts and applications using Ether. Smart contracts Ethereum’s smart contracts have emerged as the platform’s primary utility considering that they power valuable real-world use cases like DApps DeFi and NFTs applications. They allow the automatic execution of agreements without the intervention of intermediaries like banks for financial transactions or lawful entities for legal arrangements. Billions of dollars worth of assets are already locked up in payments loans insurance and any DeFi application shaping the future of finance. Ethereum smart contracts will likely change the way financial and public services are managed including categories like governance supply chains markets and digital identification. Despite fierce competition from other blockchain networks Ethereum remains the most popular platform for DApps hosting the highest number of DeFi projects NFTs and ERC-20 tokens.

What is Ethereum 2.0 all about? Ethereum is shifting from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) governance mechanism in the foreseeable future resulting in a faster and more efficient blockchain. The Ethereum Network has experienced a considerable spike in transactions volume and size since DeFi and NFTs have captured the finance and art worlds. Such traffic has often caused systemic bottlenecks with a significant rise in fees that have made the blockchain unsustainable. To bring Ethereum into the mainstream and support an increasing number of transactions the need for a substantial transformation emerged. The upgrade from PoW to PoS will make Ethereum more scalable efficient and sustainable while securing its fundamental decentralization. The upgrade will occur only at the backend within a technical framework without affecting how users transact and hold assets across the network. Ethereum’s roadmap envisions the following three phases for the upgrade to complete: Phase 0 also known as the Beacon Chain This update is already live and it brings staking to Ethereum. It lays the groundwork for future upgrades and will coordinate the new system. The Merge Mainnet Ethereum which is the current network will have to merge with the Beacon Chain at some point and this is expected to happen in 2022. The merge will enable staking for the entire network and indicate the end of energy-intensive mining. Shard Chains Shard chains are expected to be initiated in 2023. However sharding is a multi-phase upgrade to improve Ethereum’s scalability and capacity. Shard chains enable layer-2 solutions to offer low transaction fees while improving the network’s performance. Sharding is the process that allows smaller sets of nodes to process transactions in parallel without needing to achieve a consensus across the entire network. Ethereum 2.0 promises to bring transaction speed to as many as 100000 transactions per second (TPS) through the deployment of shard chains in contrast with the 30 TPS currently in place. Ethereum’s transition to PoS has generated a heated debate within the crypto community. While some of the resulting benefits are clear including scalability and sustainability due to a more energy-efficient system many fear decentralization could be at risk due to its implementation. The PoS validation process may trip over large holding validators who can have excessive influence on transaction verification thereby impacting the true nature of decentralization. Detractors of the transition also see sharding as a threat to the network’s security. Because fewer validators will be needed to secure the multiple and small shard chains there is a higher risk that they could be more exposed to malicious actors. How will Ethereum 2.0 impact Ether’s intrinsic value? Many crypto experts believe 2022 will be a make-or-break year for the price of Ether. The digital currency experienced an extraordinary rise since its launch in 2015 going from a mere $0.30 to a high of $4800 in 2021 including highly volatile motions along the way. Will Ether keep up with its massive growth through the shift to ETH 2.0? While it’s impossible to predict the price of any asset based on technical or fundamental analysis crypto investors unanimously believe that ETH 2.0 will impact the intrinsic value of Ether and a lot will depend on the smooth implementation of the upgrade. As with any significant transformation the initial deployment of ETH 2.0 might be a direct cause of volatility. Until the upgrade is thoroughly tested approved and effective across the network experts predict months of uncertainty which will inevitably affect the price of ETH. In the long term the transition to a more sustainable and efficient PoS will benefit Ethereum’s adoption for users and companies building on the platform. However the way and timing this will all pan out is a cause of hesitancy among investors showing signs of caution with their allocation until there’s a more accurate outlook. A lot will depend on the resulting upgrade success in demand and functionality and if the renewed platform will be able to keep its leading position among all other innovative network competitors.",,,,,,,,,,,,

India's crude oil import bill nearly doubled to USD 119 billion in the fiscal year that ended on March 31 as energy prices soared globally following the return of demand and war in Ukraine India the world's third biggest oil consuming and importing nation spent USD 119.2 billion in 2021-22 (April 2021 to March 2022) up from USD 62.2 billion in the previous fiscal year according to data from the oil ministry's Petroleum Planning & Analysis Cell ( PPAC ).It spent USD 13.7 billion in March alone when oil prices surged to 14-year high. This compared with USD 8.4 billion spending in the same month last year.Oil prices started to surge from January and rates crossed USD 100 per barrel in the following month before touching USD 140 per barrel in early March. Prices have since receded and are now around USD 106 per barrel.According to PPAC India imported 212.2 million tonnes of crude oil in 2021-22 up from 196.5 million tonnes in the previous year. This was however lower than pre-pandemic imports of 227 million tonnes in 2019-20. The spending on oil imports in 2019-20 was USD 101.4 billion.The imported crude oil is turned into value-added products like petrol and diesel at oil refineries before being sold to automobiles and other users.India which is 85.5 per cent dependent on imports to meet crude oil needs has a surplus refining capacity and it exports some petroleum products but is short on production of cooking gas LPG which is imported from nations like Saudi Arabia.The nation consumed 202.7 million tonnes of petroleum products in 2021-22 up from 194.3 million tonnes in the previous fiscal but lower than pre-pandemic 214.1 million tonnes demand in 2019-20.Import of petroleum products in 2021-22 fiscal was 40.2 million tonnes worth USD 24.2 billion. On the other hand 61.8 million tonnes of petroleum products were also exported for USD 42.3 billion.Besides India also spent USD 11.9 billion on import of 32 billion cubic meters of LNG in 2021-22. This compared to USD 7.9 billion spent on import of 33 bcm of gas in the previous fiscal and USD 9.5 billion on import of 33.9 bcm in 2019-20.Net oil and gas import bill after adjusting for exports came to USD 113 billion up from USD 63.5 billion in 2020-21 and USD 92.7 billion in 2019-20.India had spent USD 62.2 billion on the import of 196.5 million tonnes of crude oil in the previous 2020-21 fiscal when global oil prices remained subdued in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic Higher crude oil import bill is expected to dent the macroeconomic parameters.The country's import dependence has increased owing to a steady decline in domestic output. The nation produced 32.2 million tonnes of crude oil in 2019-20 which fell to 30.5 million tonnes in the following year and to 29.7 million tonnes in FY22 the PPAC data showed.According to PPAC India's oil import dependence was 85 per cent in 2019-20 which declined marginally to 84.4 per cent in the following year before climbing to 85.5 per cent in 2021-22.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvZW5lcmd5L3Bvd2VyL2dvdnQtYXBwcm92ZXMtcnMtMS02Mi1sYWtoLWNyLXByb3Bvc2Fscy1mcm9tLTEzLXN0YXRlcy9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85MTA1NDk3OC5jbXPSAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL2luZHVzdHJ5L2VuZXJneS9wb3dlci9nb3Z0LWFwcHJvdmVzLXJzLTEtNjItbGFraC1jci1wcm9wb3NhbHMtZnJvbS0xMy1zdGF0ZXMvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkxMDU0OTc4LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Govt approves Rs 1.62 lakh cr proposals from 13 states,"ET Bureau

By creating 11 new full-time instructor roles and two part-time instructor roles Coca-Cola says the investment “supports TCSG’s greatest need recruiting and retaining talented trainers” according to a news release. “Businesses and consumers rely on Georgia’s trucking industry which is facing a driver shortage that has been particularly heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic.”

Alfredo Rivera president of The Coca-Cola Company’s North America operating unit which is headquartered in Atlanta said the company believes in staying true to its Georgia roots.

“As residents and businesses across the state work to recover from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic it is more important than ever to invest in our communities and provide opportunities that will improve the lives of our fellow Georgians” he said.

“We are proud of our Georgia roots and will continue to do our part to keep Georgia strong.”

The donation will supplement the $8.32 million of support from the Governor’s Emergency Education Relief Fund (GEER II) that will provide facility upgrades with the goal of doubling enrollment of commercial drivers across Georgia from 1705 to 3410 in 2023.

The news release stated that the goal is to “ensure more drivers are in the pipeline to help fill trucking industry jobs with local Coca-Cola bottler Coca-Cola UNITED and other businesses across the state. The Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola UNITED have generated a positive economic impact in Georgia for more than 135 years. Currently there are over 80 open commercial driving positions at Coca-Cola UNITED offering an opportunity to deliver refreshment and happiness across Georgia.”

Mark Rahiya chief supply chain technical and innovation officer for Coca-Cola called the trucking industry “a foundational driver of the nation’s economy delivering essential goods to help businesses stay open and to reopen.”

He continued: “By supporting TCSG’s Commercial Truck Driving Program trainers and faculty we’re making sure the next generation of drivers gets a world-class education while simultaneously working to address the driver shortage and provide opportunity for Georgians.”

To raise awareness of TCSG’s Commercial Truck Driving Program and related career opportunities The Coca-Cola Company is rolling out the “Delivering the Future: The Coca-Cola System & Technical College System of Georgia Truck Tour.”

In May 2022 the Coca-Cola truck will make stops in five communities across the state including Vidalia Macon Savannah Athens and Tifton. The free tour will offer entertainment refreshments and activities along with the opportunity to learn about Coca-Cola UNITED job opportunities and TCSG’s Commercial Truck Driving Program enrollment process.

Experts at GardeningExpress.co.uk have shared their top tips on how to control and kill weeds this summer. Drinks normally found in any household’s fridge can be used to do this as well as to fertilise healthy plants.

Orange juice milk and even vodka can be used on plants according to GardeninExpress.co.uk. If used in moderation some of these drinks can help plants grow while others can help to control weeds. Chris Bonnett founder of GardeningExpress.co.uk said: “People might be surprised to hear that a lot of household drinks can actually be used in their gardens and on their plants. “If you have some spare or flat Coca Cola this is a great alternative to weed killers and some drinks like milk and tea actually work as fertilisers.

The household drinks to kill weeds and grow plants - from cola to milk

“Of course they’re not as strong as store-bought ones but they’re definitely better for the environment and are a more eco-friendly option” the gardening expert added. “A lot of these techniques are best off being used in moderation for example adding too much orange juice and milk could potentially do more harm to your plants than good and could result in killing them if overused.” Chris went on to list the cheap drinks gardeners can use to make the most of their garden. The expert mentioned vodka saying it is “one of the most unlikely drinks you would think to add to your garden”.

However vodka can be used as a pesticide or a week killer. It can also be used for indoor plants – gardeners are advised to add a dash of the drink into the water of cut flowers to kill bacteria and promote growth. Coca Cola can be used not only as a weed killer but as compost too. All gardeners need to do is add any leftover Coke they might have to their compost pile. The drink’s sweetness and sugars mean that it’s a brilliant natural booster.

The tea’s leaves enrich garden plants because they are high in nitrogen and they are also good for keeping pests at bay. Normal tea leaves can be used on plants such as daffodils and roses as a fertiliser. Although not as strong as store-bought fertiliser this is a good environmentally friendly option. Orange juice can also be used as a fertiliser – but in moderation. Too much juice could kill plants because of its acidity.

The campaign portrays light-hearted banter to reiterate the brand’s core message of being the go-to refresher drink when the summer heat takes over.

Airing from April 20 nationally ‘Thand Rakh’ is designed to appeal to teens and young adults who tend to give in to irking situations as they go about encountering challenges and exploring the world. This campaign urges them to maintain calm during heated moments while encouraging them to take time to reset and stay cool with a chilled bottle of Sprite.

Known for the immediate refreshment it provides to consumers the unique and dynamic lemon-flavored Sprite is the #1 brand within the flavored carbonated drinks category in India. The brand will continue to play a critical role for the Company in times to come providing a great-tasting beverage for both at-home occasions and on-the-go refreshment.

Commenting on the new campaign Tish Condeno Senior Director Sparkling Flavors Category Coca-Cola INSWA said “Sprite has always been known for refreshing consumer’s mind and body. Now that summer is here we want to offer a cold Sprite to chill everyone down from the intense summer heat and the everyday heated moments of stress and pressure. ‘Thand Rakh’ urges our audience to grab India’s ultimate refreshing beverage ‘Sprite’ and stay calm as they battle the summer heat and the numerous challenges of the ‘new normal’. Our brands have always sought to add value across various consumption occasions and this summer Sprite is ready to keep India chill and cool!”

Sukesh Nayak Chief Creative Officer Ogilvy India says “Sprite has always been the refreshment of choice for the smart ones. And the smart ones definitely know that when stuck in a heated situation it’s best to just ‘Thand Rakh’ and get things done your way without losing your cool. The new positioning inspired by our lingo will truly connect and help keep things cool in an overheated world.”

“As the heat rises and tempers soar you know there will be one person who’ll keep their cool. Simply because they are smart enough to count on Sprite. For years now the Sprite person has been the smart one. This year we take the summer challenge a notch up with the voice of heat making you want to do crazy things. And as always the smart Sprite people know just what to do. In the coolest smartest ‘Thand Rakh’ way.” said Ritu Sharda Chief Creative Officer Ogilvy India (North).

The humorous campaign takes a light-hearted approach to showcase how teens and young adults in today’s day and age lose their temper in the blink of an eye. It then depicts how just a sip of Sprite can beat the ‘heat’ and reinstate calmness to the drinker within seconds. The out-of-the-box campaign which perfectly aligns with the Coca-Cola Company’s purpose of ‘Refreshing the World Making a Difference’ will go live on television channels across the country complemented with digital as well as OOH marketing efforts.

Over the years Sprite has not only established itself as the undisputed youth brand but has also been leading authentic edgy and urban conversations via its marketing efforts. Through the new campaign Sprite once again aims to establish itself as the preferred choice of drink for consumers who would like to take difficult situations in their stride or for those who are simply looking to beat the heat stay cool and ‘chill’ during the scorching summer months ahead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDQvMjMvbGVzc29ucy1idWZmZXR0LWFuZC16dWNrZXJiZXJnLWxlYXJuZWQtZnJvbS10aGVzZS1ib29rcy1vbi1idXNpbmVzcy5odG1s0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjIvMDQvMjMvbGVzc29ucy1idWZmZXR0LWFuZC16dWNrZXJiZXJnLWxlYXJuZWQtZnJvbS10aGVzZS1ib29rcy1vbi1idXNpbmVzcy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These are the books that Warren Buffett Mark Zuckerberg and Daymond John turned to for crucial business lessons,"There's no shame in finding business tips and tricks on TikTok. But if you want to follow in the footsteps of your favorite entrepreneur or tech titan – think Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett or Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg for instance – you might want to crack open one of the books where they picked up some of their most valuable lessons. Zuckerberg for instance wrote in a 2015 Facebook post that he liked to read ""first-hand accounts about how people build great companies."" The 37-year-old billionaire turns to those books he said in another post for insight into ""what causes innovation — what kinds of people questions and environments"" He's far from alone especially among his fellow successful business leaders. Below four entrepreneurs share the books that shaped their careers business strategies and — in a few cases — the way they think:

1. Mark Zuckerberg

In 2015 Zuckerberg read ""Creativity Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration"" by Alice Wallace and Edwin Catmull co-founder of Pixar. It tells the story of how the animation studio became a titan of entertainment innovation. It appears Zuckerberg took at least one lesson from the book: ""Don't wait for things to be before you share them with others"" Catmull wrote in the book. ""Show early and show often. It'll be pretty when we get there but it won't be pretty along the way."" ""Done is better than perfect"" was painted on Meta headquarters in Menlo Park California. Zuckerberg wrote he was also struck by Jon Gertner's ""The Idea Factory: Bell Labs and the Great Age of American Innovation"" which tells the history of Bell Labs – which was founded by Alexander Graham Bell and is now owned by Nokia.

2. Daymond John (and fellow Sharks Barbara Corcoran and Robert Herjavec)

""Shark Tank"" investor Daymond John told CNBC Make It in 2018 that a handful of books changed his life. Some of those titles include ""Seven Habits of Highly Effective People"" by Stephen Covey and ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. But John – and fellow Sharks Barbara Corcoran and Robert Herjavec – have also recommended Napoleon Hill's ""Think and Grow Rich."" The 1937 business book contains interviews with Andrew Carnegie Henry Ford and Charles M. Schwab and it dissects the psychology behind why people earn fortunes – or why not. ""The book teaches you: If you can imagine it you can accomplish it"" Corcoran said in a 2017 documentary based on the book called ""Think and Grow Rich: The Legacy."" She also said the book taught her she could ""always hire the attributes in the next guy that you don't have yourself.""

3. Warren Buffett

Buffett also learned the best business advice comes from people who know the industry. In the documentary ""Becoming Warren Buffet"" the billionaire investor said as a 7-year-old he'd already ""virtually memorized"" F. C. Minaker's ""One Thousand Ways to Make $1000."" The book – now out of print – contains anecdotes about retailer James Cash Penney of J.C. Penney fame and other successful entrepreneurs. In 1988 Buffett told Fortune magazine that the book – which discloses practical business lessons about compound interest sales and investing – inspired him to start selling Coca-Cola newspapers and gum door-to-door. To develop business acumen prominent businessmen Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have also recommended ""Business Adventures"" journalist John Brooks' breakdown of notable moments in the histories of iconic American companies like Ford and General Electric. Buffett loaned Gates the book in 1991 and Gates noted he still had it in a 2014 blog post.

Tech companies are revising the salaries of freshers as part of their new hiring strategies to retain talent and stem attrition which has been at record levels for the past two quarters.

Part Time Employees No Longer Needed? IT Companies Now Focusing on Retaining Permanent Staff

New Delhi: With companies focusing more on hiring fresh graduates salaries of entry-level employees in India’s IT companies continue to rise faster than of mid-level executives. According to reports the sector may see salaries rise by at least 15% and in some cases by as much as 60% for fresh hires. It is to be noted that tech companies are revising the salaries of freshers as part of their new hiring strategies to retain talent and stem attrition which has been at record levels for the past two quarters.

“The salaries for entry-level engineers has been revised to Rs 4.25 lakh this year from Rs 3.65 lakh. We are also tying up with engineering colleges for courses in analytics and digital content and students who take the courses and clear them will join HCL at ₹6 lakh salary” HCL Technologies chief human resources officer Apparao V.V. was quoted as saying by livemint.com.

HCL’s strategy to raise salaries may prompt rival IT firms such as Infosys Cognizant Wipro and TCS to follow suit. According to the report in the publication TCS is working on raising salary packages for graduates of the 2022 batch. TCS and Infosys did not immediately respond to queries. Wipro is maintaining a silent period and will not entertain media queries while and Cognizant did not respond till press time.

Noida-based HCL plans to hire 45000 freshers in FY23 almost doubling from last year’s 23000. In FY22 Infosys recruited 85000 freshers and plans to hire 50000 college graduates this year. TCS onboarded close to 78000 freshers in FY22 and aims to hire about 40000 graduates from across campuses this year.

As India Inc. tries to keep pace with rising digital adoption and surging demand for cloud-based services there is growing requirement for experts in programming languages such as Java Javascript Python and SQL. Industry body Nasscom said the sector roped in a record 450000 employees in FY22.

Executives at top IT companies said hiring and training freshers is the only sustainable way to fill demand as the battle for candidates at senior levels has led to poaching despite non-compete clauses between the companies to stop candidates from joining a rival firm for roles wherein the project and client details are similar. According to industry estimates 1.5 million-1.8 million IT engineers graduate every year.

On a trailing-12-month (TTM) basis Infosys’ attrition rate jumped to 27.7% in the fiscal fourth quarter from 15.2% a year ago and 25.5% in the December quarter. TCS had the lowest attrition rate in the industry which rose to 17.4% in the March quarter from 7.2% a year ago and 15.3% in the December quarter.

HCL’s attrition rate was 21.9% at the end of March against 9.9% a year ago.

The uncertainty around Bolt’s operation in Tanzania is with respect to the recent 15% service fee order. The two major ride companies in the country are Bolt and Uber and this fee affects them. According to Bold it is already making contact with relevant stakeholders. Bolt East Africa regional manager Kenneth Micah said

“Bolt has requested a meeting with the relevant stakeholders to further discuss this particular matter with the hope of reaching favourable tariff and commission regulations even as we continue to seek and explore alternative lobbying options provided within the legal framework including Latra regulatory framework”

Latra is the Land Transport Regulatory Authority which regulates taxi services in Tanzania. The authority is in charge of setting fares and reviews of pre-existing fares. According to Bolt it will have to discontinue its car business if the situation remains the same. If Bolts switches of its car category then the market will have small companies like Little and Ping. Presently Little charges 15% while Bolt and Uber charge 20% and 25% respectively.

Micah continues

“While we acknowledge and appreciate Latra’s mandate we strongly believe that the introduction of control tariffs in a well-functioning and competitive ride-hailing sector is detrimental to a free market economy. Nevertheless Bolt will implement the directive under duress and for an interim period” said Micah.

“We are complying temporarily to demonstrate goodwill and our commitment to engage with Latra for more favorable regulations that enable further investment. We are cognizant of the fact that should Latra maintain the status quo. The market will eventually cease to be viable for Bolt and this will necessitate turning off our car category.”

Uber temporaily suspends its operations in Tanzania

Although Bolt is still trying to make a decision Uber already suspended its operation in the country last week. However the company claims that it will resume operation if there are favourable changes.

According to Bolt over 10000 drivers will have to look for new jobs if it switches off its service. Bolt operates in seven markets in African including Nigeria Kenya South Africa Uganda and Ghana.

Just last month Latra had a review of the rates for ride companies. The againcy also did some adjustments to the maximum distance (per kilometer) rate and commission. Latra wants all car ride companies to reduce their “dead kilometers”. This means reducing the distance that the driver will cover before picking up a passenger. The agency also wants a platform where drivers can be “heard” when a passenger has a complaint. Due to increasing fuel costs the agency doubles the per-kilometer rate for ride-hailing companies.

Vettel is no stranger to delivering stand-out performances in the wet and did so again at Imola going from P13 to P9 on the opening lap and retaining his place comfortably in the top 10 after being one of the earlier drivers to switch from intermediates to slick tyres on the drying track.

From there it was a case of holding on and that is exactly what Vettel did finishing P8 to score his first points of the season.

“I think it was an unbelievable race for us” he told reporters.

“We capitalised on the conditions but after that we were just trying to hang on as much as we could and we did well keeping faster cars behind us.

“I think it was a very strong race.”

This is what it means. 💚 Points on the board is strong progress but we know there's still work to do.#WeClimbTogether pic.twitter.com/LE53rJWwRc — Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team (@AstonMartinF1) April 24 2022

Vettel was able to keep Haas’ Kevin Magnussen at bay behind explaining that although the Danish racer was in a “much faster package” his tyres seemed to fall away which allowed Vettel to keep P8.

And with Vettel’s team-mate Lance Stroll crossing the line P10 it meant Aston Martin’s first points of 2022 came in a double points finish.

Aston Martin have improved to P9 in the Constructors’ Championship with every team now off the mark after four races of the season.

“I wasn’t sure if we could really go [to the end] on the same set of tyres but I guess we had to so I had to manage it and at the same time push” Vettel explained.

“Kevin had a much faster package but we were able to fend him off then he was running into trouble with his tyres so I think we managed well and it’s good also to have both cars in the points so that’s really a good day for us.”

Stroll noted the damp conditions and colder temperatures seemed to suit Aston Martin on a weekend when they took advantage of every opportunity.

He now urges the team to push for further gains in the coming races.

“It’s been a positive weekend for the team and it’s great to see both cars in the points” he told the Aston Martin website.

“It was a well-earned point for us because there was intense pressure throughout the race not to mention the changeable weather conditions.

“At the beginning of the race we performed strongly. Everyone was battling overheating tyres and a drying track but we kept [Lewis] Hamilton behind and pressured [Yuki] Tsunoda ahead.

“Once we switched to the medium tyres we continued to show good pace and pulled away from the train of cars behind us. I’m happy we performed better this weekend and made the most of the opportunities that came our way.

“Qualifying and the race were in cooler and wet conditions which may have suited us. We will enjoy today but will continue to keep pushing for more in the coming races.”"

Part of their belief is Boston and other densely populated areas have better service.

Courtney Bird president and founder of FalmouthNet a nonprofit organization which wants to create a municipally operated fiber optic network says the reason Boston and has better internet than the Cape is a simple matter of economics.

Denser areas mean higher profitability he said which is why private companies like Comcast are more likely to invest in upgraded infrastructure in those areas rather than rural areas like the Cape. Areas in and around Boston carry more fiber in their networks than the Cape he said. Bird and others believe that creates higher quality internet.

“You don’t fault Comcast they need to return a profit” he said.

The lack of incentive to upgrade infrastructure leads to the Cape being underserved he said. One of the biggest problems is that telecom companies have been able to narrow the minimum definition of high-speed internet he said. The FCC minimum requirement for broadband internet is 25 megabits per second download and 3 megabits per second upload speeds according to Verizon.com.

In fact Verizon FiOS won’t serve the Cape because of a lack of economic incentive said Bird.

FalmouthNet board member David Isenberg however says the lack of incentive to invest in the Cape’s internet infrastructure has less to do with density and more to do with return on investment.

New York City he said sued Verizon FiOS because of Verizon’s decision to not wire some households in low-income neighborhoods.

The lack of competition on the Cape also leads to a less than robust internet service said Steven Johnston CEO of OpenCape a nonprofit seeking to spread fiber optic networks throughout the Cape and Islands and southeastern Massachusetts.

More:Joe Biden wants to provide millions of Americans with high-speed internet. It won’t be easy.

Cities have multiple internet providers competing which leads to better pricing for customers and a higher incentive to upgrade infrastructure he said. Isenberg echoed that sentiment saying because Comcast has a de facto monopoly on the Cape it isn't motivated to improve the network.

Through a spokesman Comcast said there's no difference between the infrastructure on the Cape and in Boston.

Much of the evidence that the fiber advocates lean on is a feasibility study for Falmouth conducted by CCG Consulting in 2020 which found that broadband customers in Falmouth experience outages and inconsistent speeds.

According to the study Comcast advertises basic download speeds in Falmouth as “up to 150 megabits per second” however 43% of Comcast customers had download speeds under 100 megabits per second and 23% had download speeds under 50 megabits per second. The study states that finding was surprising since most Comcast customers studied in other markets have speeds equal to or greater than the speeds they are subscribing to.

More:Study says fiber optic network feasible for Falmouth

The study also said 78% of Comcast customers in Falmouth had upload speeds under 15 megabits per second though Comcast reported to the FCC that it could achieve upload speeds of 25 megabits per second in Falmouth.

“The broadband in Falmouth is not nearly as good as the broadband in nearby urban centers and the surrounding suburbs” reads the study.

The study was done specifically for Falmouth but contends the broadband system in Falmouth is like the rest of the Cape.

“One thing we learned is the entire Cape has nearly the identical broadband situation. Verizon has not built any FiOS on the Cape and all of the communities are served by a combination of Comcast along with Verizon DSL” reads the study.

Should internet providers be treated like a public utility?

Truro a significantly rural community with a year-round population of around 2000 has had its struggles with internet connectivity. Select Board chair Robert Weinstein said up until two years ago many residents depended on satellite service which he said was horrible. After nearly a decade of battling with Comcast Truro was able to get adequate wiring he said.

Weinstein doesn’t blame Comcast but the federal government.

The federal government he said allows internet companies to be treated like entertainment companies rather than a public utility which means they aren’t obligated to wire every town.

“In terms of internet we’re a Third World nation” he said.

Truro resident Curtis Hartman said at his old home on Long Nook Road he couldn’t get wired internet service. He has moved to a different part of town served by Comcast where he said service is ""adequate.""

Hartman said there have always been parts of the town that Comcast has refused to wire. However because internet is mandatory today he believes that internet companies should operate like a regulated utility rather than merely a business.

Comcast perspective

Marc Goodman a director of public relations for Comcast said there’s no difference between the broadband systems for Comcast customers on the Cape and those in Boston. He said Comcast has invested billions in its network and that the network design in Falmouth and in Boston is identical.

Comcast also has invested thousands of miles of fiber in its network including on Cape Cod he said and is working to offer customers multi-gigabit speeds on its existing infrastructure.

“Across Massachusetts and Cape Cod Comcast has invested billions in our smart fast and reliable fiber-rich network to deliver residential broadband speeds up to 1.2 gigabits per second and business speeds up to 100 gigabits per second for our customers. We will continue to invest in our network our technology and our local workforce to offer residents and businesses throughout the Cape unbeatable internet with the best connection advanced cybersecurity faster speeds and the best technology available” said Goodman.

Additionally Goodman hopes that Xfinity customers on the Cape who have issues deal directly with Xfinity employees such as by going to their stores in Falmouth or Hyannis or talking to customer service by phone or online.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvc2NvdHRtZW5kZWxzb24vMjAyMi8wNC8yMy9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLWZyaWRheS1tb3ZpZXMtYmFkLWd1eXMtbm9ydGhtYW4tbmljb2xhcy1jYWdlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Box Office: 'Bad Guys' Tops 'Northman' And Nic Cage With $8 Millon Friday,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2022/04/23/box-office-friday-movies-bad-guys-northman-nicolas-cage/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvc2NvdHRtZW5kZWxzb24vMjAyMi8wNC8yMy9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLWZyaWRheS1tb3ZpZXMtYmFkLWd1eXMtbm9ydGhtYW4tbmljb2xhcy1jYWdlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9kYy1tZC12YS8yMDIyLzA0LzI0L3BlcGNvLXV0aWxpdHktcG9sZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Who do you call when there's a problem with a utility pole or wire?,Ads for utility companies always feature photos of smiling customers basking in lives improved by the wondrous services these corporations offer.

One of those people former Detroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford was on hand at Comerica Park when another one of those people Detroit Tigers star Miguel Cabrera recorded the 3000th hit of his major league career.

""It was amazing it was so cool to watch his career"" Stafford told the Free Press during during the Tigers' 13-0 win Saturday in Game 1 of a doubleheader. ""He got here in 2008 I got here in 2009 and being able to watch him do his thing from a far for so many years was special.

""To be able to luck out and be in the house when he gets it done and gets 3000 is something I'll always remember.""

Cabrera achieved the feat in the first inning when he ripped a single to right field against the Colorado Rockies.

NIGHTMARE TO FACE:What makes Miguel Cabrera one of the greatest hitters ever? Just ask the pitchers he faced

Cabrera wasn't done on the afternoon hitting a single up the middle with the bases loaded in the sixth inning scoring two runs to pad the Tigers lead before Eric Haase came in to pinch run and the Venezuelan slugger left the field to a standing ovation.

Stafford was in town for the groundbreaking of the SAY Detroit Play Center — an after school program for kids in the city.

But when Cabrera was sitting on 2999 hits entering play Stafford made his way to the ballpark to watch the feat along side 37566 fans — the most at Comerica Park in a non-Opening Day game since July 15 2017.

A number of those same Detroit fans continued to pull for Stafford this year in the NFL playoffs as he led the Los Angeles Rams to a Super Bowl victory.

Stafford's presence was announced to the fans in the bottom of the eighth inning who gave him a standing ovation many taking off their caps to salute as he waved and pointed to his shirt that said ""Cabrera"" on it.

""It's a credit to the people of this city pulling for people they care about people they've cheered for for a long time and people who do it the right way"" Stafford said. ""He's the No. 1 example of that just an unbelievable talent a guy who sacrifices everything he's got brings it every week every season.

""It's just been really cool to watch him do his thing for such a long time.""

FROM 1-3000:Inside Miguel Cabrera's milestone-filled climb to 3000 hits

Former Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander also shared a message from Houston shared on social media by Bally Sports Detroit.

""Miggy what's up man congratulations on 3000 that is just so incredible I'm so happy for you and your family"" Verlander said. ""I'm so proud to be able to be your teammate for so long and see so many of those hits in so many clutch situations.

""What you've been able to accomplish is nothing short of amazing congratulations my friend.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL3VjZi91Y2YtYmFzZWJhbGwvbWlndWVsLWNhYnJlcmEtMzAwMC1oaXRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Future Hall of Famer Miguel Cabrera Reaches 3000 Hit Milestone,"On a hot summer night in Miami Gardens almost twenty years ago Miguel Cabrera wrote the storybook opening to his major league career that most ball players can only dream of.

In his MLB debut the Florida Marlins rookie stepped into the batter’s box in the bottom of the eleventh inning trailing by a run with the home crowd roaring in support. Tampa Bay Rays’ Al Levine tossed a pitch right down the center of the plate and the 20-year-old Cabrera absolutely tore the stitching out of it launching it over the centerfield wall for the walk-off home run a Marlins victory and his first big league hit. The Venezuelan hard hitter had put the world on notice and everyone could tell right away how special he was going to be.

That was June 20 2003. Fast forward to this Saturday and we were able to witness just how extraordinary his 19-year journey has been as he was able to notch his 3000th career hit. The elusive career milestone comes less than a year after the slugger cranked out his 500th home run last August. He is just the 33rd player in baseball history to reach the 3000-hit mark and only the seventh to do it while also smashing 500 home runs. Among his career accolades are two AL MVP awards four AL batting titles one triple crown (led AL in batting avg/home runs/rbi) and a 2003 World Series championship with the Florida Marlins.

He burst onto the major league scene as a Marlin winning the World Series title in his rookie year. He would spend five memorable years in Miami before a blockbuster trade at the end of 2007 sent him to the Detroit Tigers where he spent the last 14 years of his illustrious career and became a local hero.

Through it all Cabrera has managed to maintain an unreal .310 batting average the highest of any active player with over 3000 plate appearances. Not to mention a better average than Yankee great Derek Jeter. What makes his average even more incredible is that he owns more than 11000 plate appearances (PA) one of the highest PA counts on the list of history’s most efficient hitters. This means that Cabrera has been able to maintain his stellar output for as much as twice the time as some of baseballs’ legends who might have a higher career average. The man they call “Miggy” has been giving pitchers nightmares for two decades. Saturday in front of his home crowd once again his efforts culminated in this historic hit milestone.

In Saturday’s game against the Colorado Rockies Cabrera took pitcher Antonio Senzatela’s 1-1 fastball and sent it the opposite way to right field a strategy that has defined his career. His 3000th hit was a ground ball with a meager 86 mph exit velocity but because of Cabrera’s pinpoint precision there were no fielders in the vicinity to put a glove on it.

Cabrera’s ability to put the ball where the defense isn’t is a result of tireless dedication to his craft and a fierce plate discipline. The 6’4” righty towers over many of his MLB counterparts but attributes his success to hitting like a small guy. “I don't care how tall or how big you are” preaches Cabrera “if you're going to hit for average and power you have to be short to the ball. That's it. Short to the ball simple as that.”

There aren’t many better to get slugging advice from than Cabrera something that Tigers manager AJ Hinch believes has been invaluable for his young Detroit team. “There [are] so many lessons to take away from it but just soaking it up and enjoying every minute of it. These players Miggy might be the first Hall of Famer they've ever played with” said Hinch “You can put it in that perspective. It's pretty amazing that we get to be a part of it.”

Although the past few years have been a bit rocky for the Tigers Detroit fans will remember fondly the 2012 season that saw Cabrera win his first career MVP and carry the Tigers to the World Series before ultimately falling to the San Francisco Giants. The first baseman and designated hitter is a beloved figure in Detroit sports culture and Tigers general manager Al Avila believes it stems from Cabrera’s authentic character. “His humility passion for having fun and genuine love of the city of Detroit are completely unmatched” said Avila who was the Marlins scouting director that signed the Venezuelan slugger to his rookie contract as a teenager.

Miggy is one of the few players in the league that is universally loved. No matter what stadium he walks into he’s greeted with cheers and showered with adulation. His former team now named the Miami Marlins still holds deep ties to the eleven-time All-Star. Current Marlins captain and shortstop Miguel Rojas a friend of Cabrera and fellow Venezuelan native put his pal’s chase for 3000 into perspective.

“All of us Venezuelans feel so proud of the way that Miguel Cabrera is reaching more and more goals…It’s becoming the whole Venezuelan country represented by him. We all get excited. When he started reaching those goals and getting closer to that [milestone] every at-bat paralyzed the whole country. Everybody’s watching. He’s a big figure not just in baseball but outside the game as well because of all the things that he’s done in Venezuela.”

Cabrera has another year remaining on his contract with the Tigers and has expressed his intention to play out the remainder of his deal before hanging up the cleats. ""I would say thank God for the opportunity and I say two more years and I'm done” said the seasoned veteran last year after hitting his 500th deep ball. If he retires in 2023 we’ll undoubtedly be watching his Hall of Fame acceptance speech in Cooperstown some time in 2029 when he’ll become eligible for the honor.

With next year likely to be his last professional season Miguel Cabrera is taking a moment to stop and smell the roses but still has one item on his career wish list. A World Series trophy for Detroit. ""But I'm going to feel more proud if in my last two years here in Detroit we can win a championship. Because the city of Detroit the Tigers' organization they deserve this. They deserve a championship” asserts Cabrera.

The game was briefly halted for an on-field celebration that included members of Cabrera's family. Cabrera later returned to the field at the end of the inning for a curtain call from the announced crowd of 37566 at Comerica Park.

Nearby at Little Caesars Arena Cabrera's milestone at-bat was shown live to the crowd watching the Penguins-Red Wings game.

Cabrera becomes the seventh player in major league history with at least 3000 career hits and 500 career home runs. He joins Ty Cobb and Al Kaline as the third player to get his 3000th hit while with Detroit.

""It's a special moment for me my family and the whole country of Venezuela"" Cabrera said in a postgame television interview on the field.

Following Cabrera's 3000th hit the Tigers played a video with messages from other players including Albert Pujols the only other active major league player to reach the milestone.

Cabrera who tied Baseball Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente on the list of career hits leaders with 3000 later passed Clemente with a two-run single in the sixth inning for hit number 3001.

“He’s going to go down as one of the best hitters of all time"" Hall of Famer Alan Trammell said Friday. “He realizes that it’s getting toward the end but he still has something left in the tank. When it’s all said and done this year I think he’s going to have a heck of a year.”

The Tigers announced plans to honor Cabrera's milestone with a pregame ceremony at Comerica Park on June 12.

Cabrera became the 33rd player in major league history and first Venezuelan-born player to achieve the feat when he grounded a first-inning single into right field. The hit came against fellow Venezuelan Antonio Senzatela and set off rousing cheers and chants at Comerica Park.

Cabrera added a bases-loaded two-run single in the sixth then was pulled for a pinch-runner and drew another huge ovation as he trotted off with 3001 hits.

The 39-year-old Cabrera became just the seventh player with 500 home runs and 3000 hits. He joined an exclusive club with Hank Aaron Willie Mays Eddie Murray Rafael Palmeiro Albert Pujols and Alex Rodriguez.

He’s the seventh Latino player reach the 3000 mark. Pujols was the previous player to reach the mark doing it in 2018.

Cabrera is the third player to get his 3000th hit in a Tigers uniform joining Ty Cobb and Al Kaline.

After getting his 2999th career hit on Wednesday he went 0 for 3 on Thursday. The Rockies-Tigers game scheduled for Friday night was rained out putting history on hold for another day.

Cabrera fouled off the first pitch he saw and took a ball from Antonio Senzatela before his milestone swing.

He raised his right arm while heading to first base as right fielder Randal Grichuk retrieved the ball. The Comerica Park crowd of 37566 roared and Rockies shortstop José Iglesias who played with Cabrera on the Tigers raced over to give his former teammate a big hug.

His current teammates then came streaming from the dugout to congratulate him before he went behind home plate to embrace his mother wife son and daughter on the field.

Cabrera scored three batters later on rookie Spencer Torkelson’s three-run homer as Detroit jumped to a 4-0 lead. Pinch-runner Eric Haase replaced Cabrera after his two-run single in the sixth.

Tigers starter Tarik Skubal (1-1) allowed five hits and struck out six in six innings. The two players who batted in front of Cabrera Robbie Grossman and Austin Meadows combined for five hits five runs scored and three RBIs. Harold Castro added four hits and scored two runs.

Senzatela (1-1) gave up five runs on 10 hits in five innings.

TRAINER’S ROOM

Detroit SS Javier Báez (right thumb soreness) took batting practice Saturday and could be activated from the 10-day injured list on Sunday. “We’re kind of aiming for tomorrow if today goes well” manager A.J. Hinch said.

ROSTER MOVES

The Tigers placed OF Victor Reyes (left quad strain) on the 10-day IL and recalled OF Derek Hill from Triple-A Toledo. … Tigers OF Daz Cameron will be recalled from Toledo and serve as the 29th man in the doubleheader prior to the second game. He’ll start in right field. RHP Julian Fernandez will be the Rockies’ 29th man in Game 2 after a recall from the Albuquerque Isotopes.

UP NEXT

Rockies: LHP Austin Gomber (0-1 7.00 ERA) will start Game 2 of the doubleheader. Gomber gave up five runs (four earned) in 4 1/3 innings against the Chicago Cubs in his last outing on Sunday.

Tigers: RHP Beau Brieske (0-0 0.00 ERA) will make his major-league debut in the nightcap. The 24-year-old right-hander has pitched two games for Triple-A Toledo this season allowing five runs over 10 innings.

Last week: A look back at last week's performers of the week

Kelly Coppola Harrison

It was a busy week for Coppola and the Huskies who went 4-1 this past week with wins over Mamaroneck Ardsley Sleepy Hollow and Rye. They did take a close loss to Pelham but all throughout this stretch the senior shortstop was consistent defensively and at the plate. Coppola went 8-for-13 (.533) with a double two walks 11 RBI and four runs.

Kami DeGaetani Nanuet

Nanuet only had two games this week but the Golden Knights senior made the most of her time in the circle and at the plate. She posted 10 strikeouts in the win over Lakeland then followed up with a big one-hit shutout against a Clarkstown North team that had been off to a solid start. She also went 4-for-6 at the plate with two doubles a triple two runs and six RBI across the two victories.

Mandy Fernandez Carmel

The junior shortstop was an offensive machine batting a combined .714 (15-for-21) with eight doubles 11 RBI and nine runs. Fernandez's contributions helped Carmel continue its unbeaten start as the Rams picked up wins over Fox Lane Arlington B and Scarsdale this past week.

Arianna Garcia Yonkers

Garcia helped the Bulldogs climb back to the top dethroning defending city champion Yonkers Montessori in a lopsided final to top off their 3-0 week that included earlier wins over Roosevelt and Saunders. She homered at least once in all three tournament games including twice against Yonkers Montessori in the finals. Garcia was named Yonkers City Tournament MVP after an impressive week where she went a combined 5-for-7 with four home runs a double nine RBI a walk and seven runs scored.

Serena Gillen White Plains

﻿After providing the heroics in a 10-inning win over Ursuline the freshman pitcher followed up with a big 3-0 week against marquee opponents. She went the distance and helped White Plains to a 6-2 win over Arlington allowing seven hits and avenging last season's playoff loss to the Admirals. Gillen followed up with another complete game giving up just five hits in a 6-1 win over last season's Section 1 Class AA runner-up North Rockland. She also had two hits and a RBI. Then against New Rochelle she pitched a three-hit shutout and stuck out 10 batters to get her 20th career win. She also had a two RBI single.

Kayleigh Heckel Port Chester

She might be better known for her basketball prowess but the Port Chester sophomore is also an impact player on the field. Heckel started her week off with a multi-home run game but was a consistent bright spot through victory or defeat. Heckel batted a combined 6-for-9 with a double triple three home runs eight RBI and scored five runs across games against Scarsdale John Jay-East Fishkill and Tuckahoe.

Maysin Kannapin Dobbs Ferry

The freshman catcher had a big week at the plate and came through in the clutch for Dobbs Ferry hitting a walk-off home run in the Eagles' 9-8 win over Irvington. That was just one highlight in a strong three-game stretch where she finished a combined 9-for-12 (.750) with a double home run and seven RBI across games against Palisade Prep Irvington and Ardsley. She was also given the 'Heart and Hustle' award at the Ardsley Breast Cancer Tournament.

Kiera Luckie Pearl River

The sophomore pitcher went 3-0 in the circle tossing a shutout against Sacred Heart-Buffalo and holding Tappan Zee and Clarkstown North to one run apiece in both league wins. All in all she pitched 21 innings giving up two earned runs and 22 strikeouts in three games. She also went a combined 4-for-9 with a double triple grand slam and six RBI against the Rams and Dutchmen. Luckie didn't pitch against Section 2 Class AA Shaker but she did go 1-for-1 with a sac fly RBI and a walk.

Mackenzie Moccia Yonkers Montessori

﻿The junior workhorse has been a strong hitter-pitcher combination for the Eagles and despite Yonkers Montessori falling short in the city tournament finals Moccia was a bright spot all throughout. She tallied 23 strikeouts over the 2-1 week which included lopsided wins over Putnam Valley/Haldane and Riverside as well as her first loss of the season to Yonkers. However Moccia was a machine at the plate batting a combined 9-for-11 (.818) with four triples a home run and 12 RBI.

Melanie Panico Suffern

A strong defensive presence in the outfield for the Mounties that made several diving catches this week the senior center fielder also came through at the plate for her team. Panico went a combined 7-for-11 (.636) in a three-game slate that included wins over Arlington B and Scarsdale and a loss to Ketcham. She also tallied two doubles nine RBI and six runs throughout this stretch.

Carissa Pecchia Rye Neck

It was a big milestone week for Pecchia who recorded her 100th hit as Rye Neck continued its unbeaten streak. The Panthers went 4-0 with wins over Hastings Valhalla and Westlake plus a victory by forfeit over Pawling. A savvy catcher behind the plate that calls a good game Pecchia also stepped up when it was her turn in the batters' box. Pecchia went a combined 5-for-11 with two triples a double six runs scored and eight RBI. She's also set up to possibly achieve her 100th RBI this week.

Danielle Pisacreta Eastchester

She's a defensive anchor and a lifeline at shortstop for the Eagles but she also packed a punch at the plate. Aside from going errorless in the field she batted .500 (4-for-8) through Eastchester's 3-0 week that included a forfeit win against Byram Hills but also victories over Pelham and Sleepy Hollow. Pisacreta also had a double triple and her first varsity home run as well as six RBI and three runs.

Maya Servedio Yorktown

She notched a shutout over John Jay-Cross River and then a nine-inning no-hitter against John Jay-East Fishkill in a marquee matchup to top off her pitching duties for the week. She didn't give up a single run and only allowed one hit over 18 innings of work tallying 36 strikeouts along the way limiting opponents to a combined .019 batting average against. Servedio hit well across all four Yorktown wins over both John Jays Brewster and Somers going a combined 8-for-14 (.571) with six RBI and four runs and posted a .625 on-base percentage.

Tanner Smith Valhalla

The sophomore pitcher's week was highlighted by a shutout win over defending Section 1 Class B champion Albertus Magnus where she also got her 300th career strikeout. Smith followed up with her first perfect game and added a double and triple with five RBI en route to being named lohud's Friday Softball Player of the Day. The Vikings might've gone 2-2 in the week behind Smith — wins over Albertus Magnus and Blind Brook plus losses to Rye Neck and New Rochelle — but she was solid throughout posting a 1.40 ERA with 38 strikeouts and only five walks.

Ja'Nae Walker Hen Hud

The freshman third baseman didn't take long to heat up after the rain washed away the Sailors' first game of the week. Walker went a combined 9-for-13 with three doubles two triples eight RBI and scored seven runs throughout a big 4-0 week for Hen Hud that included wins over Horace Greeley Lourdes Panas and Fox Lane. She served her best for last when she was named to the Hen Hud Blue-White Tournament all-tournament team and helped her team capture the title for the second straight year.

Then the next day it fell 11%.

This shouldn’t come as much of a surprise as global markets — and energy prices including for gasoline — have been seesawing and on the rise in recent months. But it is enough reason to give readers an update on where things stand and what you may want to do for your heating bills.

More:February's natural gas prices shot back up; here's some advice| Betty Lin-Fisher

Last fall with forecasts that natural gas prices were soaring for the winter and probably about a year I suggested to readers that it was time to come off the Standard Choice Offer or SCO which is based on a state-approved formula. For many years we have enjoyed close to wholesale rates at historic lows.

More:Betty Lin-Fisher: Let's put the recent increase in natural gas prices into perspective

So in many ways we got spoiled and comfortable with prices. In 2021 for instance the SCO had a low of $2.62 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) in January and was in the $3 range through July when it started to creep up into the $4 range in September.

Experts were putting into perspective that while prices were “soaring” into the $5 and $6 range there were some years in the last two decades when we were paying as much as $10 to $16/mcf.

The price of natural gas on the New York Mercantile Exchange is finicky. It also often relies on the level of gas storage and the weather — and global events like the war in Ukraine.

The SCO had a high of $6.35 in November but then there was “blip” in January when the price went down to $4.17/mcf partially because we had a mild winter. Then we got walloped with a lot of snow and prices continued their earlier predicted upward march.

More:Betty Lin-Fisher: Do a price checkup with the January slump in natural gas price

The SCO for bills from April 12 through May 11 is $5.52/mcf when rounded up to the nearest cent. That’s up from $4.72/mcf in March and down from $6.42/mcf in February.

Except for the blip in January and the historic high this week the markets and natural gas prices have been following forecasts and trends that they would be rising said Dave Jankowski NOPEC chief marketing and communications officer. NOPEC is a large aggregator or bulk buyer with more than 430000 gas customers in Summit County (including Cuyahoga Falls and many northern communities) as well as some communities in Medina and Portage counties. It also aggregates electricity.

We went into the winter with a five-year low in natural gas supply in the ground he said. But weather always plays a key role in pricing and we’ve had lots of ups and downs in our weather this year Jankowski said.

When you put all that together with gas producers trying to figure out if they should drill more it causes uncertainty in the market he said.

“Production has not caught up with demand” he said. “I don’t think we’re going to have a clear picture (on pricing) until we have some forecasts about how hot it is going to be this summer” since more electric plants rely on natural gas for air conditioning supply he said.

While there is the perception that the war in Ukraine is also causing havoc in the markets — and any global issues do impact the global markets and prices — Jankowski said that is more perception than reality.

Contracts for liquefied natural gas to go overseas are set long in advance so there is not an immediate impact on supply now because of the war he said. “But it’s adding to the volatility globally.""

The U.S Energy Information Administration in its April 12 short-term outlook remained on track with earlier forecasts that prices should stabilize by later this year or next year.

So what should I do?

Last fall I suggested people get off the SCO and find a good fixed rate and evaluate any aggregation groups. There were many different choices.

So there isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer to what you should do now. But here’s some guidance:

If you locked into a good fixed rate in the fall and are still on that rate for a while you are in good shape. I was able to get a very good $2.49/mcf rate for 11 months in October with a $50 cancellation fee. I know that was a short-lived offer — some readers got it and others at the time got some other contracts in the $3 range. As the months passed the cheapest fixed rates for those who wanted to lock in were starting to creep up to the mid-$4 range.

Fixed rates on the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio’s Apples to Apples chart — www.energychoice.ohio.gov — are mostly high which is not a surprise. The cheapest is a $4.99 fixed rate for 24 months but it has a $200 cancellation fee. That's too hefty in my opinion. The cheapest fixed rate without a cancellation fee is Direct Energy at $5.59/mcf for 32 months. The phone number if you want this rate is 877-698-7551 or you can find it on the Apples to Apples chart. I am reluctant to have people lock into a rate that is higher than the SCO of $5.52/mcf. But it is also possible that next month’s SCO and future SCOs continue to rise based on forecasts. If you do take this rate there is no cancellation fee so you can keep an eye on other rates if you want to switch. It takes up to two months for any switch.

If you live or have a small business in the city of Akron the aggregation with Constellation Energy is about to move into its $4.06 fixed rate starting with May billing through November 2024. That is a very good price given where we are now. In the fall I was not in favor of the Akron rate since it was going to mirror the higher SCO rates through the winter months when people use the most gas though I said the fixed rate was decent. Akron residents and small business owners are allowed to opt-in now or anytime. Call Constellation at 833-500-2738. It will take one to two billing cycles to switch over.

Akron residents and small business owners are allowed to opt-in now or anytime. Call Constellation at 833-500-2738. It will take one to two billing cycles to switch over. If you are still on the SCO or a price that is based on the SCO see if your community has an aggregation rate that's better and see if you can get in. If not you might need to lock into a fixed rate so see the first bullet point above.

or a price that is based on the SCO see if your community has an aggregation rate that's better and see if you can get in. If not you might need to lock into a fixed rate so see the first bullet point above. If you live in a NOPEC community which is a large portion of the Akron region NOPEC's default is called its program rate. Jankowski said the goal is to try to even out that price over a few months to keep prices competitive for customers. It is not always the cheapest rate but the aggregation tries to even out the risk for people. However with the volatility of prices lately the program price which is currently at $5.23/mcf has had to increase three months in a row. Jankowski said the program price would be increasing again in the next week or so due to the volatile market but he could not give the actual price.

NOPEC customers can switch among the group’s various plans without penalty. NOPEC has a variable plan which is always 2 cents below the SCO. NOPEC also has a 12-month and 24-month rate but those just last week had to be repriced and are in the $6 range so I don’t think they are an option.

If you are not currently a NOPEC customer or live in a NOPEC community and you want to join it takes some extra steps. You must first cancel any separate contract you have and return to Dominion’s SCO (once you cancel you’ll go back to Dominion automatically) and then NOPEC will send you an opt-out notice in its next mailing which is usually every other month. (You can check www.nopec.org for a full list of gas and electric communities or call 855-667-3201.)

The good news for us all is that — fingers crossed — consistent spring and summer weather is around the corner and our high heating costs are behind us. So that may help us weather these higher natural gas costs better.

As always I will keep an eye on prices and I often update my online Utility Guide which includes a lot of information about natural gas and electricity pricing monthly. That can be found at www.tinyurl.com/UtilityGuide.

Change in April bills

I go into much more nitty-gritty detail in the Utility Guide about the various parts of Dominion charges on your bill but there is one change in your April bill I want to point out.

All customers have a ""Tax Savings Credit Rider"" which began in April 2020. The credit was the result of a 2017 federal law that changed tax rates for utilities which needed to return those savings to customers. Dominion was allowed to spread those returns over a 38-year period. It started as a $5.41 per month credit which then went down to $2.61 per month with last April's bills. It is recalculated each year and this month the credit will change to $2.47 per month.

For reference if you like knowing all the details of each month's Dominion bills and watching the SCO price watch for monthly updates at this website generally early each month: www.dominionenergy.com/ohio/rates-and-tariffs/rate-schedules and choose ""Residential GSS-R"" on the first box under ""General Sales Service.""

The nova system called RS Ophiuchi produced the extremely high-energy gamma-rays during its latest thermonuclear explosion observed by astronomers at the Max Planck Institute for Physics in Munich in August 2021.

Located 5000 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Ophiuchus  RS Ophiuchi comprises one red giant star and one white dwarf that exist in a parasitic relationship called a recurrent nova system. The dense white dwarf absorbs hydrogen gas shed from the red giant's outer later eventually acquiring so much material that the white dwarf overheats and erupts in a massive thermonuclear explosion called a nova. This occurs cyclically in recurrent nova systems and for RS Ophiuchi a cycle lasts approximately 15 years.

Supernova photos: Great images of star explosions

The team of astronomers observed RS Ophiuchi's most recent nova using the dual Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescopes in Spain's Canary Islands which revealed the presence of highly energetic gamma-rays with a value of 250 gigaelectronvolts (GeV) — among the highest energies ever recorded for a nova.

The explosion created shock waves that accelerated particles to nearly the speed of light. Based on these observations scientists now theorize that ""gamma-rays emanate from energetic protons nuclei of hydrogen atoms"" the researchers said in a statement .

""This also makes nova outbursts a source of cosmic rays "" which are highly energetic particles that travel through space at nearly the speed of light David Green a scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Physics who co-authored a paper on the observations said in the statement. ""However they tend to play the role of local heroes — meaning to only contribute to the cosmic rays in the close neighborhood. The big players for cosmic rays are supernova remnants. The shock fronts created from stellar explosions are far more violent compared to novas.""

Rita was born on May 7 1925 and was raised in Pawtucket Rhode Island the daughter of Joseph and Bridget Healey. Despite losing her father at a very young age Rita her sisters Pinky and Toni and her brother Joe had wonderful childhoods under the watchful eye of Bridget. The Healey sisters were inseparable beauties and the belles of Pawtucket. The Healeys all grew up well were happily married and raised wonderful families of their own. The Healey clan remained a tightknit family spending many vacations holidays and special occasions together throughout their lives.

In her youth Rita was a lover of sports and an outstanding athlete winning Pawtucket Female Athlete of the year in 1939 as well as other youth prizes for roller skating ping pong tap dancing and baseball. She was always proud to have won a childhood award from the Pawtucket Boys Club for the most freckles in Pawtucket. As a young adult she was graceful on the ice and an avid skier until breaking bones three years in row.

Rita graduated from Pawtucket East High School in 1942 and after a year at Brown University went to support the war effort by working at Owens Corning Fiberglass in Cumberland Rhode Island where she met the love of her life Caesar “Chuck” Spero. Chuck a new employee was lost and asked Rita for help. She ended up helping him for over 70 years until his passing in February 2020.

Rita was a loving wife and mother who put her career and education aside to raise three children Colin Brian and Denice. After all of the children were sent off to college Rita resumed her education and graduated with High Distinction and Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Rhode Island in 1977 majoring in English and Communications. Rita went on to obtain a Masters of Science from Salve Regina University in 1987. Rita worked for many happy years as the Director of Conferences at Roger Williams College where she founded and directed the Rhode Island Creative Arts Center.

Rita like her husband Chuck was very active in the community. Rita was a founding member of the Newport Ski Club and a member of the Portsmouth Garden Club the Glen Manor House Authority the Ida Lewis Yacht Club the Wanumetonomy Golf & Country Club and then later in life the Montaup Country Club where she had two holes in one the American Association of University Women the Friends of Ballroom Dancing the Aquidneck Island Land Trust and several book clubs. She was also a member and President of the Saint Barnabas Women’s Guild member of the Saint Vincent DePaul Society and a Grand Regent of the Catholic Daughters of America.

Most of all Rita was a loving mother and a lover of life. All who knew Rita knew her passion for her children fashion travel sailing music and dancing. Rita was well-known for the beautiful hats she wore each Sunday at Saint Barnabas most of which were handmade. She was always impeccably dressed regardless of the occasion. She and Chuck were lucky enough to spend over 30 years after Chuck’s retirement sailing traveling the world dancing and enjoying life with their children and grandchildren frequently attending many a youth sporting event.

Rita will be best remembered for her warmth generosity kindness sense of humor and the love that she bestowed on those around her. It was not unusual for her to purchase a suit for a young college woman going on her first interview or to buy a class ring for a new graduate. No one left her house without hearing the words “is there anything you need or that I can give to you.” During difficult times she reminded us “this too shall pass” and during family gatherings “my cup runneth over.” Even during her last year residing at John Clarke she daily visited the rooms of the other residents and had a greeting and warm smile for each. As family members we often hear how her love supported many. The Spero family can say with certainty that she enhanced the lives of all about her immeasurably.

“We cannot all do great things. But we can do small things with great love.” ~ Mother Teresa

Rita was predeceased by her brother Joseph Healey and his wife Georgie her sisters Agnes (Pinky) Healey and her husband Calvin her sister Antoinette (Toni) Healey and her husband Jim her son Colin G. Spero and her loving husband Chuck. She is survived by her son Brian J. Spero (Mikki) of Portsmouth; her daughter Denice M. Spero (Christopher Pargellis) of Newport; her grandchildren Dylan (Kerri) Ryan (Kendra Johnson) Brian Jr. Andrew Sydney and Patrick Spero (Risa); and her great-granddaughter Fayth.

She will be greatly missed by her family and friends.

Funeral services will be held on Friday April 29 2022 with a Mass of Christian Burial at 11:00 a.m. at Saint Barnabas Church 1697 East Main Road Portsmouth Rhode Island 02871. In lieu of flowers the family would request that memorial donations be made to the Aquidneck Island Land Trust 790 Aquidneck Avenue Middletown Rhode Island 02842.

Store Roofs Could Be Key to Reaching Environmental Goals.,"U.S. big-box retailers are projected to have enough rooftop real estate to support the installation of solar panels that could meet the nation’s estimated renewable energy needs and realize the long-term potential for increased solar use.

The United States has the solar capacity to serve 23 million homes but that output appears to be barely scratching the surface of its potential. The country could generate 78 times as much electricity as it consumed in 2020 if it utilized the solar potential of its biggest retail buildings according to reports from the Solar Energy Industries Association and the Environment Texas research and advocacy group.

There are more than 100000 big-box retailers across the nation including stores malls supercenters and grocers representing 7.2 billion square feet of rooftop space most of which is unused according to Environment Texas.

With a little more than 1% of commercial electricity demand served by on-site solar there remains significant opportunity for potential growth in solar capacity and clean energy goals from large Fortune 500 companies such as Walmart Apple Target and Amazon are expected to help push the sector to near-record levels this year according to SEIA.

“We certainly see big-box retailers being open"" to solar panels since they have a lot of space and flat roofs said Ian Pierce senior vice president for communications at Weitzman Group a Dallas-based retail real estate brokerage. ""As a landlord you’re always looking for any type of reasonable savings.”

But installing solar panels can be expensive and those costs have been compounded by recent supply chain constraints. Commercial solar projects cost 14.3% more in the fourth quarter than for the same time in 2020 according to Wood Mackenzie an energy research and consulting firm. Other barriers to solar usage include variable weather such as winter months and cloudy days potential zoning issues and an inability to relocate solar panels to a new location when a business or individual moves.

Even so the large upfront costs can be offset by long-term savings said Pierce. Solar panels can reduce electricity bills and require minimal maintenance over their lifetime which could be at least 20 years.

Wood Mackenzie decreased its near-term forecast of solar installations by 19% in large part because of continued supply chain constraints price increases and interconnection challenges but still has a positive long-term outlook of U.S. solar installations.

Installing solar on the rooftops of major shopping centers and stores could go a long way in reducing or offsetting the carbon footprint of big-box retailers analysts say especially considering the greenhouse gas emissions and pollution that could be traced back to the energy the companies use to power their offices stores warehouses and supply chain operations.

Mall Roof Potential

Potential annual solar usage at big-box stores were highest in states like California Florida Georgia Illinois New York North Carolina Ohio Pennsylvania Texas and Virginia according to the Environment Texas report.

“The flat open sunny roofs of giant grocery stores retail stores and shopping malls are perfect locations for solar panels"" the report stated. “Big box stores and shopping centers could replace half of their annual electricity use by fully building out their rooftop solar potential.”

Texas is one of five states listed in the report as having the greatest potential for emissions reduction especially if big-box stores realize their full capacity for solar use. A full build-out of solar capacity at big-box stores could reduce 52 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually — the equivalent of taking 11.3 million passenger vehicles off the road according to the report.

But for some smaller retailers solar panels don't make financial sense.

""For small tenants most don't have the type of roof coverage that make solar cost effective"" Pierce said. ""We've seen big-box retailers concentrate on solar with Target reaching more than 500 locations with rooftop solar. And it's not just stores; for their huge warehouses a major retailer's million-square-foot warehouse roof can create a lot of power with solar.""

E-commerce retailers are also jumping in on the action. Amazon notes on the sustainability section of its website that a rooftop solar system can generate as much as 80% of a single fulfillment facility's annual energy needs ""so that's at a point where it becomes cost-effective"" Pierce said.

Ikea the Sweden-based furniture retailer with several big-box locations across Texas has committed to become “climate positive” by 2030. Part of Ikea’s business model includes use of solar panels. A company spokesperson stated 90% of Ikea’s U.S. stores have rooftop solar panels.

Walmart meanwhile committed to solar panels and eco-roofs as early as 2007. The big-box retailer based in Bentonville Arkansas completed 380 solar installations as of 2020 with contracts for another 98 solar energy projects in place.

Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino California has been powered by 100% renewable energy since 2017. The campus relies on on-site generation from 14 megawatts of rooftop solar panels. Additional power for the campus is provided by the California Flats solar farm in nearby Monterey County.

What Cities Can Do

Cities also have the potential to develop utility-scale solar installations on open land or above parking lots adding significantly to the clean energy they can provide to the grid that is also more reliable.

“Increasing solar energy capacity will be critical to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create a more resilient and reliable energy system” according to a separate report from Environment Texas called ""Shining Cities 2022: The Top U.S. Cities for Solar Energy.""

Many cities are already installing solar panels on public buildings and “working with utilities to upgrade the electric grid and offer their customers incentives to invest in solar energy systems.”

The city of Houston mandated a new policy this month requiring all Houston-area homebuilders to either install solar on new construction or build houses that could incorporate panels later. Similar policies are in place in Austin Texas and Lewisville Texas a Dallas-Fort Worth suburb. Beyond Texas California updated its building code in 2020 to require all new construction in the state to have solar as an electricity source.

“By setting big goals to grow solar here at home and helping more Texans see the benefits of solar for themselves we are both setting an example for our peers to follow and ensuring a better future for our community” said Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner in a statement.

Real Property & Energy Solutions which provides renewable energy alternatives for property owners recently installed one of the largest rooftop solar projects in Washington D.C. The installation at a 54000-square-foot industrial property in D.C.’s Brookland neighborhood features 2100 solar panels generating enough energy to power 150 homes annually. The panels also offset 1.8 million pounds of carbon dioxide emissions per year.

Gaining Permission

This is Real Property & Energy Solutions’ first rooftop solar project. The challenge is trying to adapt its rooftop solar program to other neighborhoods or commercial and retail properties.

“The first thing you have to do is find a roof” said Ryan Fauquier director of building automation services at Real Property & Energy Solutions.

Once a location is identified the building’s owner has to agree to go forward with solar panels. The real work starts once permission is secured. All parties involved must secure proper permitting work with the utilities and work with city officials.

A building’s age and design could be a stumbling block for solar panels. The rooftops of some buildings might not have the capacity to support the weight though installation practices such as anchoring could be a workaround.

Another issue is future tenant use. A retailer for example might commit to a 10-year lease at a specific property and commit to rooftop solar panels there. When that tenant's lease is up and a new tenant occupies the space the solar panels might not be part of the new company's business plan.

It could take a few years to see the net benefits of rooftop solar panels Fauquier added. The size of the solar project where it's located — Southwest versus Pacific Northwest for example — and incentives also factor in to how long it takes to see tangible benefits but retailers and commercial property landlords would eventually see a return on their investments.

""Generally it's a year one cash flow positive for the owner of the system"" with incentives Fauquier said. He added that if you don't have those incentives oftentimes it'll take a few more years — 5 to 10 years — to get your"" return on investment back with these systems which generally last 20 to 25 years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmVkZXRyb2l0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8zMDM4Mi9pY29uaWNfZGV0cm9pdF9za3lzY3JhcGVyX2hhbGYtZW1wdHlfYXNfYW5vdGhlcl9jb21wYW55X2RlcGFydHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Iconic Detroit skyscraper half-empty as another company departs,"Detroit's tallest building is eerily empty two years into the pandemic.

Brittany 30 revealed that an accident happened in the living room.

An MTV cameraman appeared to have knocked over a plant.

The crew member - who had a black mask covering his face - was pilling up the black dirt with his hands.

Brittany's voice can be heard off-screen as she screamed: ""Ma!""

Roxanne appeared to be busy while she was unpacking the groceries.

She seemed to be having a conversation with Luis Hernandez.

Luis is the father of Briana's four-year-old daughter Stella.

Brittany captioned her post: ""My mom freaks out over any little mess. So this was funny to me.""

'STELLA'S HEART'

During a recent installment from the reality show Briana tried to get through to Luis after he failed to show up to one of Stella’s hospital appointments.

She said: ""I’m not gonna hate him and we can take the necessary steps to remove him off the birth certificate… so that he’s not in my way of taking care of Stella.

“Right now the first person that's breaking Stella's heart is her own dad.""

The TV star previously spoke about Luis' absence as he has popped in and out of his daughter's life since 2017.

THE STRANGER

Back in July 2021 Luis came over to Briana’s house to spend quality time with their daughter.

Before her father arrived Stella started sobbing and ran away from her mother.

She then buried herself in their sofa in an attempt to hide.

Briana said in a confessional: “Luis is pretty much a stranger to Stella...""

She continued: “Stella would not be acting like this if Luis came around more. I can't force her to do anything.

“But I thought it was a good idea that they could spend time with each other.”

Briana concluded: ”I struggle with this daily...whether or not Luis should continue coming in and out or just stay away forever.""

In addition to Stella Briana and her ex Devoin Austin share their 10-year-old daughter Nova.

HER LEGAL VICTORY

Meanwhile the MTV mom scored a major win during costar Kailyn Lowry’s defamation lawsuit against her.

The Teen Mom stars faced off in court after Kailyn accused Briana of making ""false"" comments about her physically abusing her ex Chris Lopez.

According to documents obtained by The Sun the case was dismissed in favor of the Florida native.

In the end the judge found Kailyn's claims to be unfounded.

The judge also agreed with Briana that the TV personality was required to give her notice that she was about to file the lawsuit but she did not comply.

Briana has vowed to sue Kailyn for her legal bills which have racked up to $120k.

""I had the same reaction when I saw them a few days ago"" one commenter said before recommending people to put them in the refrigerator. They didn't elaborate on why besides declaring it would make them ""especially"" good. The pent desire for lemon bites is evidenced by another commenter's testimony that ""I've been looking for two weeks (east coast) and no luck!

Although you need to pay for a membership to enter those gilded industrial doors if you know what to buy you can find some serious savings — yes on cash but also time and energy from repeatedly heading to the store.

If you're not sure what the best no-brainer buys are we've compiled a list of what folks on Reddit suggest to newbies. We've also compared prices to Target and have aimed most of these suggestions towards people with pantry storage and multiple mouths to feed under one roof. Though the savings apply to anyone it might take a single person a while to finish these quantities.

Paper towels and toilet paper

Since the early fear-filled days of the pandemic it feels nowadays that you can never have too much toilet paper. If you have the space for it Costco can offer you pretty significant savings on paper goods like a 24-count of Viva Cloth Paper Towels. At $46.99 for the pack you're coming out to about $1.95 a roll. A smaller pack available at Target runs at about $2.05 a roll which will add up if you have lots of messes to address. Similarly a 30-pack of Charmin bath tissue comes out to $1.05 a roll while an 18-pack from Target is about $1.14.

Bacon

Kirkland Signature will be the unsung hero of this list providing high-quality goods at a pretty competitive price point when compared to the name brands. Take their signature thick-sliced bacon. Redditors have raved about the quality and flavor and for $17.99 you get two packs at 1.5 lbs each. That's around $6 a pound and will last a considerable amount of time in the freezer. Target's offering of Oscar Mayer Hardwood smoked thick cut bacon is $7.29 for a 16-ounce pack which means you'd be paying $7.29 a pound.

Rotisserie chicken

The Kirkland brand rotisserie chicken is another one of those heroic Costco items that has inspired its own lore. At around $4.99 and roughly 3 pounds it's a well-seasoned and very well-priced add-on that can give you a hand with dinners for a few days. Target's offering of the Archer Farms rotisserie chicken is around 29oz (a little under 2 pounds) and costs $6.79. That means at Costco you're getting more for less.

Gasoline

I will spare you a quip about how high gas prices are and cut straight to the point: gas is expensive but at Costco it can be significantly less expensive. The Costco closest to me currently has a gallon of gas listed at $3.99 for regular. Compare that to the Shell down the street that is currently pricing a gallon of regular at $4.40 (and lament the fact that Brooklyn costs this much to exist in).

Cheese

Despite the fact the U.S. government has stockpiled mass amounts of cheese for who-knows-what buying cheese isn't always the cheapest. If you're the type who can consume a good amount you're in luck because various users cited good prices and quality for the cheeses offered at Costco. For example if you're into sharp cheddar they have a 5-pound block of Cheswick Sharp Cheddar Cheese for $17.79. An 8-ounce container of sharp cheddar cheese from one of Target's store brands is $2.49 which means a similarly sized offering would come out to about $25. Shred to your heart's delight.

OTC medicine

Over-the-counter medicines like Ibuprofen or allergy relievers are usually stupidly expensive for small quantities and buying in bulk is one of the few solutions. A 2-pack of Kirkland signature Ibuprofen with 500 tablets in each bottle comes out to $9.99. The Target store brand offering is a similar price at $9.79 but is only half the amount of pills.

Even when imparting information we already know The Palace Papers is a compulsive read. Picking up where her 2007 bestseller The Diana Chronicles left off she covers some of the same ground on the late Princess of Wales before turning to more recent events. Beginning and ending with the Duchess of Sussex’s doe-eyed appearance during her Oprah Winfrey interview – wearing Diana’s Cartier tennis bracelet as well as equal lashings of black eyeliner – this is the well-connected Brown’s attempt to put “Megxit” in context.

In order to understand the “truth and the turmoil” inside the House of Windsor you need to understand the Windsors themselves. The first part of the book is a whistle-stop tour through the first 50 years of the Queen’s reign from her earliest interactions with Sir Winston Churchill to her sometimes testy relationship with her sister Princess Margaret and the back story of Charles and Camilla’s romance.

Some anecdotes inevitably have the ring of familiarity but Brown gives credit where it is due stitching together the best observations by the likes of Lady Glenconner and the Right Honourable Margaret Rhodes – two of the Queen’s besties. And there are still some surprises.

Who knew for example that Marion “Crawfie” Crawford Elizabeth and Margaret’s former nanny was hoodwinked into writing the 1950 book The Little Princesses that saw her banished from the royal household? And while we know that the Queen and the Queen Mother refused to be in the same room as Camilla practically until the day of her wedding to Charles in 2005 were we aware that his three siblings were minded to write him a joint letter condemning his adulterous behaviour after the birth of Prince Harry? Or that the heir to the throne described his youngest brother Prince Edward as a “f---ing idiot” after his production company was caught filming at St Andrew’s University in 2001 despite a media blackout while Prince William was studying there?

Brown also serves up some classic one-liners. When Diana’s ­former butler Paul Burrell was found with more than £4 million of her pos­sessions including negatives of Charles William and Harry in the bath her mother Frances Shand Kydd apparently announced: “I hope his balls burn.” When Diana learnt James Hewitt had collaborated with Anna Pasternak’s Princess in Love exposé of their affair she apparently told her friend Simone Simmons the psychic: “I hope his cock shrivels up.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3MuY28udWsvbGlmZS1zdHlsZS9wcm9wZXJ0eS8xNjAwMjIwL3F1ZWVuLW1vdGhlci1jYXN0bGUtb2YtbWV5LWluc2lkZS1ob21lLXNjb3RsYW5kLXJveWFsLWZhbWlseS1waWN0dXJlc9IBf2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3MuY28udWsvbGlmZS1zdHlsZS9wcm9wZXJ0eS8xNjAwMjIwL3F1ZWVuLW1vdGhlci1jYXN0bGUtb2YtbWV5LWluc2lkZS1ob21lLXNjb3RsYW5kLXJveWFsLWZhbWlseS1waWN0dXJlcy9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inside the Queen Mother's Scottish Castle she reportedly paid £100 for - The Castle of Mey,"Queen Mother 'clashed with Margaret over royalty' says expert

The Castle of Mey was the property of the Queen Mother from 1952 until 1996 when she generously gifted it with an endowment to the Trust. It was reportedly bought for less than £100 at the time and was a firm favourite home of the Queen Mother. Something that defines the Royal Family is the number of castles palaces and stately homes that are associated with it.

Whether it's Buckingham Palace the Tower of London Windsor Castle or Kensington Palace the Royal Family has an impressive portfolio of homes around the country. The Castle of Mey is one stunning Scottish home that was bought for a shockingly low price. The castle has never been lived in full-time by the Queen and is today used as a summer home for Prince Charles and Camilla. The story of its purchase is even featured in Netflix’s The Crown.

The Castle of Mey is situated in Caithness on the northern coast of Scotland. It is a four-and-a-half-hour journey from another of the Royal Family’s Scottish residences Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire. The Castle of Mey was built between 1566 and 1572 on the lands of Mey which belonged to the Bishops of Caithness. The castle was purchased by the recently widowed Queen Mother in 1952 following the death of her husband King George VI on February 6 of the same year.

The Queen Mother used her own funds to bring the castle up to date by adding electricity and freshwater supplies. Even still Princess Margaret called it ""Mummy’s drafty castle"".

And the firm's CEO Queen Elizabeth II has been in the corner office for seven decades now. With cannon-fire and the release of a recent photo with two of her horses the Queen celebrated her 96th birthday three days ago a year after the death of her husband.

""She's a working great-grandmother and she loves her job is the truth"" said Tina Brown a prominent editor on both sides of the Atlantic who has long trained her gimlet eye on the royals. ""And she'll keep going 'til the last breath I really believe it.""

For the queen it is Brown said ""a higher calling yes. I mean she made it to Prince Philip's memorial even though she's really finding herself frail. She simply has this extraordinary ability to make herself do things.""

And as she writes in her new book ""The Palace Papers: Inside the House of Windsor – The Truth and the Turmoil"" (Crown) ""Smiling through maximum discomfort is their most priceless skill.""

Crown

Brown's latest book chronicles the last quarter-century one of the most difficult and at times scandalous in the history of the monarchy now set for more upheaval.

Correspondent Mo Rocca asked ""The transition from Queen Elizabeth to King Charles – how is that gonna go?""

""Well I think there's a lot of anxiety obviously"" Brown replied.

The queen is a monarch but she's not immortal. One day before too long her son Charles will ascend to the throne. ""We're going from a 96-year-old CEO to a 72-year-old successor who everybody knows a great deal about probably too much about. I mean there's no mystique to Charles that's for sure.""

The world has endlessly dissected Charles' unhappy marriage to Princess Diana (killed in a Paris car crash in 1997) and his eventual wedding eight years later to the woman he'd been closest to most of his life Camilla Parker-Bowles.

Rocca said ""I was at lunch a few years ago and I just casually mentioned that I kind of like Camilla. And my friend's mother she like shot darts at me and said 'How dare you say that about that woman!'""

""Yeah no I'm sure"" said Brown. ""There are people who still feel strongly about that. But the irony is really I mean this was the great love of Charles' life always has been. And she's gone from being this hated figure to being actually quite beloved. And the queen very recently declared that she wanted to see Camilla become queen which had always been somewhat in the balance: Was Camilla going to get the title of queen?""

""Will she be known as Queen Camilla?""

""She will be known now as Queen Camilla which was in a way a brilliant piece of estate planning of the queen.""

WEB EXCLUSIVE: Tina Brown on when Charles becomes King

And after King Charles and Queen Camilla? Charles' son William … then William's kids … then his brother Harry. Although Harry basically took himself out of the picture after broadcasting his unhappiness with the family and decamping to California with his wife Meghan Markle. The Queen left no doubt about their status after what's been dubbed ""Megxit.""

""The terms of the exit were harsh"" said Brown. ""They didn't get anything they wanted actually. They didn't even get to keep the 'Royal' [title]. Harry was not allowed to keep any of his military honors. I mean it was frankly lethal what happened.""

""Because there's no halfway?""

""There's no halfway. And in fact there was one phrase which really stuck out to me when it said that they would continue to quote 'Collaborate with the queen on projects.' And the queen doesn't collaborate. She's not a co-executive producer of a TV show okay? She commands right? And you better remember it. And she did! She said 'Unh-uh. No.' She doesn't do partnerships!""

Harry's estrangement also means there's no partnership between the two princes who have gone through so much together.

""Harry for William was the person who kept him grounded who could have fun with him who could make fun of him you know?"" Brown said. ""Because when you are the future king no matter how normal you try to make your life everybody's talking to you as the future king. Only your younger brother can really tease you. Only your younger brother can take you down when you're pompous you know? I'm told that William is very grievously sad to have lost that.""

""Of all the multiple estrangements this seems like the saddest one"" said Rocca.

""It's a very sad thing.""

The British monarchy has endured since the ninth century. The latest crowd might sometimes be a royal pain but maybe that helps explain why the British just can't quit them.

Said Brown ""It's a great family saga because you know the monarchy's an institution built on human beings who are members of a family. And they will always be you know the prodigal sons and the miscreants and the sort of lovelorn ones. They are fallible. Some are better at it than others. And they come up against the hard realities of the crown.""

You may drive between their quaint picturesque buildings without really batting an eyelash as you cruise on through or stop at a wholesome corner shop to pick up some home-baked goods. You might not even realise that the quiet out-of-the-way little spot might be harbouring an international megastar who lurks somewhere within the cute winding streets of independent shops and parochial cottages.

Framlingham in Suffolk is a small town with a big personality in its midst. Ed Sheeran grew up in Suffolk and despite receiving international acclaim and an estimated £160 million from his time at the top of music he has never forgotten his roots. Rather than choosing a mansion in Malibu to be his base of operations the popstar chose to invest it in the area he was from.

Since his rise to fame Ed has added a growing number of properties to his ‘estate’ over the years leading to locals nicknaming the large clustered of houses ‘Sheeranville’. His area of Framlingham now consists of three 4-bedroom houses one 6-bedroom house a treehouse a bungalow a football pitch and a 4-car garage.

Considering all that the multimillionaire only paid a reported £3.7 million for the lot. The megastar has been spotted around town at various points most famously back in 2013 when he and fellow international superstar Taylor Swift popped in for a pint at the local pub The Station.

Spotting Ed may be less hard than people think with the town’s population only 3000 or roughly half the capacity of the Royal Albert Hall. There are plenty of other reasons to visit Framlingham if you aren’t into the idea of Ed Sheeran spotting.

The town is the perfect place for a shop and stroll with the ancient market town having plenty of streets of historical interest. As Suffolkcoast.co.uk describes: “Market Hill is the Town’s centre and still hosts markets on Saturday and Tuesday offering great local produce together with trinkets and collectibles. There are excellent shops too for gifts food fashions and antiques and mouth-watering selection of cafés tea shops pubs and restaurants.”

Framlingham has a walking guide for those who are interested in local history or just want to stretch their legs while getting to see the best sights the town has to offer. A highlight is Framlingham Castle. The imposing structure is a great example of a 12th-century fort. In 1553 Mary Tudor stayed here with an enormous retinue when she learned that she had been proclaimed Queen.

You can enter the castle by walking across a bridge over the moat and through the outer wall’s gate all of which is now preserved by English Heritage. If all the walking exploring and chasing down cars that look like Ed Sheeran might be in they have got your appetite up there are a few places you can go to get refreshment and a bite to eat.

(Image: Getty Images)

First of all there are several pubs to try out. These include Ed Sheeran’s celebrity watering hole The Station which is said to have great seafood while The Railways Inn’s roasts have been described as “Sunday roast at its best”. The Crown is a great place to grab soup and a sandwich by an open fire and The Old Mill House is perfect if traditional pub fare is your thing.

However the jewel in the crown of Framlingham’s Michelin Guide standard Italian restaurant. Watson and Walpole have received overwhelmingly positive reviews on TripAdvisor from people praising everything from its garlic bread to its tiramisu.

“The pre-starter garlic bread meanwhile was arguably the best we’ve had anywhere” said one diner. Another reviewer wrote: “We were pretty full but shared a tiramisu which we all thought was the best we’d ever had.”

A third review simply read: “One of the very best restaurants I’ve been to for a long while. The food is delicious and refreshingly different. The service is top-notch. Cannot recommend it enough.”

How to get there

Depending on where you set off the drive will take between 2 and 3 hours with North Londoners having a much easier time. The train journey is around 2 and a half hours and involves catching a train from Liverpool Street to Ipswich before changing for a ride to Wickham Market. From there you need to catch a bus to Framlingham.

The advance payments would address impacts that rail employees have encountered from the COVID-19 pandemic. They are being offered because the contract negotiations which started in January 2020 have taken a long time and there is no immediate end in sight according to NCCC.

The NANO-F was designed for use with ATOMOS 5-inch or 7-inch devices including the NINJA V NINJA V+ and SHINOBI. The 45wh L-series battery is capable of handling up to a 7A load. It features a 4-cell design which Core SWX states make it slimmer and more powerful than most comparable 45wh L-series packs. The battery is equipped with a 4-stage LED gauge.

NPF-ATOM50









The NPF-ATOM50 is a dual NPF battery pack for the 7-inch Dual NPF sled ATOMOS devices such as the SHINOBI 7 Shogun and the legacy 7-inch Flame and Inferno series. It offers a capacity of 49wh and a P-tap which allows users to power other devices. The battery is equipped with a 4-stage LED gauge.

AtomX NEON battery system by Core SWX





The AtomX NEON battery system by Core SWX is a battery module that accepts two V-mount or 3-Stud AB Gold Mount batteries. This allows it to supply proper voltage and current delivery to power the NEON monitors without the need for AC mains.

The module has NATO rails on top and side so it can be clamped to a C-stand or connected to a NATO handle for easy transport.

These new products will mark their first debut at Core SWX’s booth (C5623) and the ATOMOS booth (C9526) during the 2022 NAB Show."

With this knock Cummins equalled the record of KL Rahul for registering the fastest fifty in the history of the cash-rich league. Cummins' KKR and Australia teammate Aaron Finch has taken a cheeky dig at the pacer revealing why he calls him as ""IPL Pat"".

Finch also said that he was taken aback after seeing Cummins' 56-run knock against Mumbai Indians.

""Absolutely I was taken aback by it! We call him IPL Pat because he bats a lot better in IPL than he does for Australia. He's played some great innings for KKR and he works hard on his batting so it was great to see him continue that aggressive mindset batting at number seven to come out and keep swinging hard from ball one and change the momentum of the game it was brilliant"" the official website of KKR quoted Finch as saying.

Finch was roped in by KKR as a replacement for Alex Hales as the England opening batter had opted out of the tournament citing bubble fatigue. Finch went unsold in the mega auction but eventually he came in as a replacement for Hales. The Australia white-ball skipper admitted that he was disappointed on going unsold in the auction.

Talking about being picked by KKR Finch said: ""Yeah of course. Yeah. But then to get the call from Baz [Head coach Brendon McCullum] to come and join KKR I was very excited and jumped at the opportunity.""

KKR are currently at the seventh spot in the IPL standings with just 6 points. The side will next square off against Gujarat Titans on Saturday.

Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) find themselves in a tricky situation heading into their next fixture in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) after suffering three defeats in a row; slipping to the seventh spot in the points table.

The downfall after the journey under new leader Shreyas Iyer got off to a promising start with three wins in their first four games including a six-wicket win over Chennai Super Kings (CSK) who had outplayed them in last year’s final.

And with the league phase having reached the halfway stage the time is now for the Knight Riders to get their act together if they are to keep their hopes of reaching the playoffs alive for a second consecutive season.

As far as their recent performances go it is the bowling department that comes under scrutiny with special emphasis on Pat Cummins. As brilliant as he was with the bat against Mumbai Indians (MI) forcing the world to sit up and take notice of his T20 finishing skills with a 15-ball 56 not out  Cummins has proven far too expensive with the ball in the recent games.

He ended up leaking 50-plus runs in two of the last three games with Delhi Capitals (DC) and Rajasthan Royals (RR) posting totals of 215 and 217 in those two games.

While he got off to a promising start against the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) with the dismissal of opener Abhishek Sharma in his first over of the evening he ended up getting smashed to all parts of the Brabourne Stadium as he conceded 40 in 3.5 overs at a rate of more than 10-per-over.

It’s not as if Cummins among the leading bowlers of the current generation especially in the Test format hasn’t tasted success in the IPL in the past. While he didn’t make much of an impact in his initial run with KKR in 2014 and 2015 he was Delhi Capitals’ leading wicket-taker (15; average: 24.86; economy: 8.07) in 2017 his only season with the franchise.

Advertisement

He was fairly decent in the 2020 season (12 wickets; average: 34.08; economy: 7.86) after re-signing with KKR for a whopping Rs 15.5 crore finishing as their second-highest wicket-taker that season with nine wickets at an average of 26.33 in the first half of the 2021 edition before opting to skip the UAE leg.

Cummins however has been far too wayward this season. Even in the Mumbai Indians game he conceded 49 runs in his four overs while accounting for the dismissals of Ishan Kishan and Suryakumar Yadav though he would more than make up for the expensive bowling display with the freak match-winning knock.

Advertisement

The Australian though has followed that unbeaten 56 up with scores of 43 and 0 since then and thus has made it very difficult for the team management to retain him in the XI going forward regardless of his status as a superstar of the modern-day game.

It would therefore hardly come as a surprise if captain Iyer and coach Brendon McCullum opt to bring the tried-and-tested Tim Southee back into the line-up for the crucial game against the new franchise Gujarat Titans who are currently at the top of the points table with five wins in six outings so far. KKR cannot afford any weak links against a side that has been the most clinical unit of the 10 teams in action so far and will have to make a tough call or two in the process.

Southee after all has looked far more threatening of an option. Both in the powerplay as well as in the slog overs Southee has made a telling contribution in the two games that he has played so far this season. His 3/20 against the Royal Challengers Bangalore was among the reasons the Knight Riders were able to take the game into the final over in their defence of a modest score of 128.

Advertisement

He was a tad expensive against the Punjab Kings (PBKS) leaking 36 runs for his dismissals of Shikhar Dhawan and M Shahrukh Khan but surely deserves a shot at redemption in their upcoming fixture on Saturday.

Especially since none of the bowlers barring veteran West Indian spinner Sunil Narine has looked convincing in the last three games. After early success Umesh Yadav’s effectiveness appears to have gradually tapered off since his match-winning haul of 4/23 against Punjab.

Though Southee who was recently awarded the Sir Richard Hadlee Medal for the New Zealand Player of the Year in 2021 remains an integral part of the Black Caps Test attack his performances in the T20 World Cup last year showed that he could be a reliable option in the shortest format too.

Southee collected eight wickets in seven outings but more importantly was economical throughout the tournament barring the final against Australia — the only time his economy shot past seven — and had bowled the most dot balls among the New Zealand bowlers in five of their seven outings in the event.

Advertisement

The holding role that might bring to the game should he get picked could allow the Yadavs and Narines to attack from the other end and could then get the breakthroughs and restrict the opposition. If things go right it could revive KKR’s bowling performance which would essentially be their first step towards reviving their fortunes this season.

The data is broken down by how many times the MP has voted how many debates the MP has taken part in and how many parliamentary questions the MP has asked since the last general election.

In the final part of this series we will take a look at the contributions of Judith Cummins the Labour MP for Bradford South.

Votes by Judith Cummins MP

The figures from the House of Commons Library (HoC) show the activities of MPs between the state opening of Parliament on December 16 2019 and March 7 2022.

Of the 491 votes over this time Judith Cummins recorded 362 ayes or noes.

The backbench MP recorded no vote or abstained on 129 occasions – giving the representative a participation rate of 74 per cent.

This is below the 81 per cent average for all UK politicians who have sat in the House of Commons since the election (excluding the Speakers).

Ms Cummins stood in as a temporary Deputy Speaker for one week during this time period.

The HoC Library said MPs may not vote because they are carrying out other work related to their parliamentary government or opposition roles.

Participation rates may be affected by ‘pairing arrangements’ whereby MPs from different parties who cannot attend a division agree to cancel out one another’s vote.

Before divisions debates are held for Members to discuss government policy new laws and topical issues of the day to help the House reach an informed decision.

The Conservatives had the highest average participation rate of 86 per cent while Labour had an overall rate of 77 per cent.

Debates

Since the last election Ms Cummins has taken part in 87 debates speaking a total of 24301 words.

By comparison the average MP has spoken 44530 words over the same period.

These include spoken contributions and oral questions in the House of Commons chamber and in Westminster Hall but not those shorter than four words.

Parliamentary Questions

The figures show Judith Cummins has asked 174 Parliamentary Questions since the last election.

These are put formally to a government minister about a matter they are responsible for to seek information or to press for action from the Government.

This included 22 put to a government minister in person 143 in writing and seven topical questions – those asked during the last 15 minutes of most ministerial question sessions.

The backbencher asked two during Prime Minister's Questions – the weekly session when the PM faces scrutiny in the House.

Life as an MP

Responding to the figures Ms Cummins said: ""Being an MP means balancing my duties in Parliament with the work to support my constituents in Bradford South. MPs effectively work in two places.

""Like Philip Davies I am appointed by the Speaker of the House to the Panel of Chairs. This is an important role in parliamentary democracy. However it does mean that I am unable to take part in debates or vote on those public bill committees and delegated legislation committees which I am chairing.

""I have also served as Deputy Speaker which similarly means that I could not take part on certain votes in the chamber.

""It is typical that MPs of the governing party would generally have higher vote participation than opposition MPs. They would usually be supporting their own governments legislation on topics that opposition MPs may not vote on.

""I am Chair and Vice Chair of a number of All Party Parliamentary Groups. Commonly referred to as ‘APPGs’ these are groups of MPs from all parties who come together to work on specific issues.

""I chair the APPG on Osteoporosis and Bone Health which has recently produced a report on improving vital access on Fracture Liaison Services.

""I also Chair the Rugby League APPG which is promoting the positive social and economic impact of the sport in cities like Bradford.

""Additionally I am vice-chair of several other APPGs such as dentistry working on improving access to NHS dentists and dementia that works on issues that are important to me and my constituents.""

The MP added: ""Whilst we may not always agree with each other I do acknowledge that all my Bradford district colleagues work hard for the district and take seriously the importance of keeping constituents up to date on what we are doing. As part of this each of us takes a turn to write a weekly column in the Telegraph & Argus to report back on our recent work and to share our views on topical issues."""

The CHOICE study which was published in The Journal of Rheumatology also found improvements in patients who received secukinumab 150 mg but the response was generally higher for the 300 mg dose.

The randomized double-blind controlled trial included a total of 258 patients with PsA who had not previously used biologics. Patient age ranged between 19 and 82 years and the mean time since PsA diagnosis ranged between 3 and 3.9 years. The mean body mass index at baseline was greater than 30 kg/m2 indicating the sample population was generally obese. Additionally at baseline 73.3% of patients had enthesitis and 48.1% had dactylitis.

In a 2:2:1 ratio 103 patients received secukinumab 300 mg 103 received secukinumab 150 mg and 52 received placebo. All groups received their treatment every 4 weeks for 16 weeks in treatment period 1.

At week 16 patients who were receiving secukinumab 300 mg continued receiving the same dose during treatment period 2 up to week 52 and patients receiving placebo began receiving secukinumab 300 mg every 4 weeks up to week 52.

Patients in the secukinumab 150 mg group who reached less than 20% improvement in tender and swollen joint counts at weeks 16 28 or 40 compared with baseline were considered nonresponders and received the 300 mg dose every 4 weeks. Meanwhile patients who did respond by achieving at least 20% improvement continued with the 150 mg dosage every 4 weeks.

The authors noted that if the dose was stable patients were allowed to receive concomitant treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids up to week 16 or with methotrexate up to week 52. About a third of patients were receiving methotrexate at baseline.

Proportionally more patients in the 300 mg group completed treatment up to week 52 (80.6%) compared with the 150 mg group (74.8%) or originally placebo group (76.9%).

According to the authors the main reasons for discontinuation in treatment period 1 were withdrawal of informed consent and loss to follow-up while the main reasons for discontinuation in treatment period 2 were withdrawal of informed consent and experience of adverse events (AEs).

At week 16 higher proportion of patients who received secukinumab 300 mg (51.5%) achieved a 20% improvement in American College of Rheumatology score (ACR20) compared with patients who received placebo (23.1%) which the authors deemed statistically significant (OR 3.51; 95% CI 1.65-7.45; P =.0011).

While patients who received secukinumab 150 mg (36.9%) also achieved a higher ACR20 response rate compared with the placebo group OR was not considered statistically significant (OR 1.92; 95% CI 0.89-4.15; P = .0961).

Both secukinumab 300 mg (28.2%) and 150 mg (24.3%) also led to higher ACR50 response rates at week 16 compared with placebo (5.8%) both with significant ORs. They also both led to higher ACR70 response rates compared with placebo but only the 300 mg dose resulted in a significant OR.

Regarding Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores patients receiving either dose of secukinumab also had substantial improvements in psoriasis and achieved higher PASI75 PASI90 and PASI100 response rates compared with patients receiving placebo with significant ORs.

In terms of safety the authors noted that the most common AEs among patients in either secukinumab group were upper respiratory tract infection and. At week 52 serious AEs were reported in 9.6% of patients receiving secukinumab 300 mg and in 7.8% of patients receiving secukinumab 150 mg. However AEs were generally mild or moderate and were not found to be related to secukinumab dosage.

According to the authors these findings were consistent with those of prior research and suggest the 300 mg dosage of secukinumab is safe and efficacious as afirst-line biologic treatment for patients with PsA.

“Further studies will also help determine the optimal dose of secukinumab for treating overweight patients or those with high disease activity at treatment initiation” they wrote.

Throughout her nearly decadelong career Hadid has modeled campaigns and walked the runways for the likes of Chanel Versace Moschino Balmain Jacquemus Off-White Tommy Hilfiger Max Mara and Marc Jacobs among many others.

More from WWD

Some of her more memorable red carpet looks include a matching moment with her younger sister Bella Hadid at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2019 where they wore skin-tight neutral looks. Gigi Hadid wore an outfit by Tom Ford while Bella Hadid opted for one by Charlotte Knowles.

Some of Hadid’s other notable ensembles over the years include her outfits at the Met Gala wearing the likes of Tommy Hilfiger Versace Michael Kors Prada and Diane von Furstenberg.

Earlier in her career Hadid gained more prominence from her appearances in “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” as the eldest of Yolanda Hadid’s three children.

However Hadid initially started her modeling career as a toddler posing for Baby Guess when she was two years old after being discovered by Paul Marciano of Guess. She stopped shortly after that to concentrate on school before resuming her modeling career in 2011.

During her cameos on the Bravo reality series with her mother alongside her siblings Bella Hadid and Anwar Hadid with occasional appearances from her then-stepfather David Foster and biological father Mohamed Hadid viewers caught glimpses of her return to modeling.

In 2013 Gigi Hadid signed with IMG Models and made her New York Fashion Week debut with Desigual in February 2014. That same month she made her big break in high fashion when she was on the cover of Carine Roitfeld’s CR Fashion Book.

From there she was named Daily Front Row’s Model of the Year and scored an ambassadorship with Maybelline in 2015. That year she also appeared in multiple music videos including Taylor Swift’s “Bad Blood” and Calvin Harris’ song with the Disciples “How Deep Is Your Love.”

The years 2015 to 2016 marked major milestones for Hadid as she also walked the then-coveted Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show along with her sister Bella. Both continued to walk for the show until it was canceled in 2019.

In 2016 Hadid went on to host the iHeartRadio Much Music Video Awards and the American Music Awards. That year she walked for Anna Sui Miu Miu Balmain Isabel Marant Elie Saab Giambattista Valli Chanel and Versace among others. She also appeared on the magazine covers for 11 different Vogue issues including U.S. Paris and Italy Elle Harper’s Bazaar Allure and The Wall Street Journal.

That fall Hadid also codesigned a successful capsule collection with Tommy Hilfiger called Tommy x Gigi.

From then until the present day Hadid has continued to score some of the biggest high fashion campaigns and walk the runways for leading designer brands such as Versace Max Mara Valentino and Fendi.

The model is considered one of the highest paid models in the world with Forbes ranking her in the top 10 list for 2018 earning an estimated $9.5 million that year. Hadid also has a large social media following with more than 73 million followers on Instagram and counting.

Hadid has one daughter named Khai whom she shares with her now ex-boyfriend Zayn Malik. The two have had an on-again off-again relationship since 2015 before splitting again last fall.

A Florida teen was charged this week in a January crash that left six dead after the teen lost control while driving 151 miles per hour authorities said.

Noah Galle 18 was charged Monday with six counts of vehicular homicide for the fatal Jan. 27 crash that left six people dead Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg said in a statement.

Galle who was 17 at the time of the fatal crash had previously done racing stunts for social media attention according to a criminal affidavit obtained by The Washington Post. The teen displayed his Instagram handle on his car windows and in a video offered $25 to anyone who could correctly guess how fast he was driving.

Galle was driving a 2019 BMW at 151 mph down a Delray Beach highway when he crashed into the back of an SUV carrying the six passengers and caused the vehicle to flip multiple times police said. The victims were Filaine Dieu 46; Vanice Percina 29; Mirlaine Innocent Julceus 45; Remize Michel 53; Marriel Michelle Louis 60; and Michel Louis Saint 77 NBC News reported.

All six victims worked at Pero Family Farms which has set up a GoFundMe for the families of the victims.

Galle has entered a plea of not guilty. Each count he faces is a second-degree felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison.

While arriving to a polling station on Sunday morning in Le Touquet with Emmanuel Macron Brigitte cast her ballot for France’s presidential election in a beige suit. The set featured slim-fitting trousers and a structured blazer complete with pointed lapels. Macron’s ensemble was finished with a white blouse and a beige Louis Vuitton top-handle handbag with gold hardware.

Grounding her look was a set of coordinating suede pumps. The beige set featured pointed toes as well as stiletto heels totaling 3-4 inches in height.

Later that evening Macron switched into a second outfit to celebrate President Macron’s re-election with supporters in Paris. For the occasion she wore a second suit with a sharp jacket and pants — this one in a deep blue hue. Completing this look was a military-style blazer with pointed eyelets and a tall silver collar. Macron finished this look with delicate earrings while President Macron coordinated in a blue suit with a white shirt.

Though her footwear wasn’t visible it’s likely Macron finished her ensemble with a similar pair of pointed-toe pumps or — if the weather was colder — a pair of ankle boots in a coordinating dark tone.

Pointed-toe pumps are revered for their ability to streamline and sharpen any outfit. Pairs in neutral or tonal leathers or suedes with soaring stiletto heels are the most popular and have emerged in new styles by Sam Edelman M.Gemi and Sarah Flint in recent weeks. Aside from Macron stars like Sofia Richie Nina Dobrev and Lily James have also slipped on sharp Manolo Blahnik Saint Laurent and Versace pumps for high-profile appearances.

Macron’s minimalist wardrobe is regarded as a standard for the French-chic aesthetic. Most of the French first lady’s shoes are by Louis Vuitton which is one of her go-to brands — she also counts Vuitton designer Nicolas Ghesquière as a close friend. Aside from ankle boots she can also be seen in pointed-toe pumps and sporty sneakers in similarly chic colors. Macron often wears blazers dresses and pantsuits as well as skinny jeans and trousers in sharp neutral tones. For formal occasions she dons elegant dresses and gowns with minimal embellishments with most ailing from French labels like Alaïa Alexandre Vauthier and Dior.

Where is Julius Erving Now?,"‘Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty‘ chronicles the journey of the LA Lakers basketball team as they rise to the pinnacle of the sport. The series dives deep into the making of Earvin “Magic” Johnson by focusing on his personal and professional life. In the show’s first season Magic is a rookie signed by the LA Lakers who quickly becomes an important player for the team.

The show’s eighth episode brings Magic face-to-face with one of his idols Julius “Dr. J” Erving both on and off the court. Given the duo’s interactions in the show viewers must be surprised by their complex interpersonal dynamic. Naturally if you watched the show you must be curious to learn more about the real-life relationship between Dr. J and Magic Johnson and Dr. J’s current whereabouts. In that case here is everything we have gathered on the matter!

Are Julius Erving and Magic Johnson Friends?

In ‘Winning TIme’ Julius “Dr. J” Erving is a childhood idol of Earvin “Magic” Johnson. Dr. J’s influence on Magic is also one of the prime reasons behind his deal with Converse. In the series the two meet during the NBA All-Star game in 1980 followed by meet-ups between their respective teams in the NBA. In reality when Magic Johnson was in his rookie season Dr. J was playing for the Philadelphia 76ers and was considered one of the best players in the league.

Most of Magic and Dr. J’s well-known interactions during the 80s took place on the basketball court. Most notable among these was their involvement in the 1979-80 NBA Finals in which the LA Lakers faced off against the Philadelphia 76ers. Magic and Dr. J were rivals on the pitch for most of their careers but seem to have developed a cordial relationship outside the game. The two have made several public appearances together and also featured in Converse ad campaigns during the 80s. In an Instagram post from 2018 Dr. J referred to Magic Johnson as one of his friends. Therefore it is safe to say that the basketball icons are friends in real life.

Where is Julius Erving Now?

Julius Erving aka Dr. J was named the NBA MVP for the 1981 season and won the NBA Championship in 1983. After playing for the Philadelphia 76ers for eleven seasons Erving decided to hang up his boots and retired at the age of 37. Since his retirement from playing professional basketball Dr. J has dabbled in various ventures. He became a television analyst while taking up other business interests. He owned a Coca-Cola bottling plant in Philadelphia and co-owned a NASCAR Busch Series team. He worked as the Vice President of RDV Sports and Executive Vice President for Orlando Magic.

Dr. J also served on the boards of several businesses such as Converse Darden Restaurants The Sports Authority and Saks Incorporated. Outside sports and business Erving is also known for making cameos in the 1993 movie ‘Philadelphia’ and sitcoms such as ‘Hangin’ with Mr. Cooper’ and ‘The Office.’ He was married to Turquoise Erving from 1972 until 2003. After his separation from his first wife he married Dorýs Madden in 2008.

Shown here is the larger Orchard GUSS. A Mini GUSS is available for applications in higher-density plantings. (Photo courtesy of GUSS)

Deere & Company has made a new move into the world of unmanned technologies forming a joint venture with GUSS Automation LLC based in Kingsburg California in the San Joaquin Valley.

GUSS an acronym for Global Unmanned Spray System currently sells a pair of unmanned machines to treat high-value crops such as vineyards and orchards.

GUSS Automation traces its roots trace back to 1982 and an agriculture spray business called Crinklaw Farm Services (CFS). Along the way CFS developed multi-row vineyard sprayers mechanical vineyard pruners and the Tree-See orchard sprayer designed for young orchards. CFS now sprays 5000 acres a day during peak season in California.

GUSS Automation functions today as an individual business entity separate from CFS. It builds two machines Orchard GUSS and Mini GUSS. Orchard GUSS is 24 feet long and 6 feet 4 inches tall and come in two widths: 8-foot 3-inches and 7-foot 6-inches. Mini GUSS is 25% smaller enabling it to move through high-density plantings of orchards vineyards and berries. Its first units were delivered in 2019.

The Deere-GUSS joint venture focuses on specific California high-value crop systems. The joint venture will retain all GUSS technology while Deere is gaining insight into GUSS technology. By that measure this is an interesting tech move for Deere which is currently rolling out commercial technologies for its row-crop customers. Deere will not be building the GUSS units nor will GUSS technology be applied to Deere products. But access to the technology fits well with Deere's ""technology-enabled"" product development work.

This year for example Deere has introduced its Autonomous 8R tractor and the See & Spray camera visualization system designed to control weeds and manage resistance. Deere's $250 million purchase of Silicon Valley's Bear Flag Robotics last fall brings into Deere a second technology approach to autonomy.

Deere's autonomous 8R moves by way of stereo cameras. Bear Flag tractors are equipped with LiDAR and cameras plus the computing power to manage the sensors and actuators that bring situational awareness to the tractors. LiDAR stands for light detection and ranging. It is a remote sensing method using light to measure distance and generate three-dimensional information. Bear Flag has deployed its autonomous solution onto U.S. farms.

GUSS Automation also uses LiDAR in combination with GPS in its vehicles. Vehicle sensors and software give GUSS vehicles continued ability to control speed and applications under orchard and vineyard canopies.

The Deere-GUSS joint venture will be collaborative.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15am91cm5hbGNvdXJpZXIuY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9YLTE2OTc5NjUzLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tired of waiting for driverless vehicles?

Paul Riggs

Ankeny - Paul Thomas Riggs 82 of Ankeny Iowa and formerly of Waterloo Iowa died Wednesday April 13 2022 at MercyOne in Des Moines of natural causes.

Paul was born August 1 1939 at St. Francis Hospital in Waterloo Iowa to Philip and Viola Riggs. He attended St. John's grade school and then East High School. Following high school he was employed at Waterloo John Deere Tractor Works retiring after 30 years. While employed at John Deere he was active in the UAW and employee assistance program. After retirement he worked at The Hilton Garden Inn in Des Moines doing maintenance and airport shuttle transportation.

Paul married Michalle Sulentic in 1962. They later divorced. Four children were born out of that marriage. He later married Laurie Math. They later divorced. Two children were born out of that marriage.

While living in Waterloo he was a member of The Knights of Columbus and was active in the local Boy Scouts of America. He attended St. Edward's Catholic Church in Waterloo and went on several mission trips to their sister parish in Mississippi.

Paul is survived by his children: Scott (Dr. Sheila) Riggs of Eagan Minnesota Daniel (Rebekah) Riggs of Newport Beach California Robert (Sandy) Riggs of McKinney Texas Nicole (Dr. Charles) Pruchno of Robins Iowa Colin and Carson Riggs of Ankeny Iowa; six grandchildren Georgia Riggs Tess Riggs Micah Riggs Brayden Kelly Jordan Count and Kaci Miller; one great-granddaughter Lillian.

Paul was preceded in death by his father and mother; two brothers Jack and Phil and one sister Mary Ann.

Per his wishes Paul was cremated. There will be a private celebration of life later this summer.

Memorials in his name may be directed to The AA West Side Club; 613 W. 5th St. Waterloo IA 50701 or The Iowa Chapter of the American Red Cross.

You can choose between several levels of accuracy depending on what your needs are.

Morgen Dietrich is the market manager for embedded technology at John Deere. He says the type of GPS receiver needed for your operation depends on the intended use because it determines repeatability and pass-to-pass accuracy.

""SF1 is our base signal and that is pass-to-pass accuracy in 15 minutes within 6"". So if you would come back to that same place within 15 minutes you should still be within the 6"". Once you're past that time frame you could be further away"" says Dietrich. ""Then when we step that up to SF3 that would be 1.2"" in 15 minutes but it actually allows repeatability of that 1.2"" for a full nine months.""

Another option is called RTK – Real Time Kinematic.

""And that essentially allows you to come back to the same point year after year with 1"" accuracy"" he says. ""That's the beauty of RTK and it allows customers to do things more repeatable than would an SF1 or SF3. There are additional costs for RTK. You need to have a radio that essentially helps you triangulate where your signal is coming from.""

You also need a display and the software that enables the system. How easy it is to use is another important factor. Consider how intuitive the menus buttons and touch interfaces are and how easy it is to train other operators.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9xY29ubGluZS9uYW1lL2hlbnJ5LWhhbnNvbi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNDQyMjc4N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Henry Hanson Obituary (1945 - 2022) - Viola IL - The Rock Island Dispatch Argus,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/qconline/name/henry-hanson-obituary?id=34422787 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9xY29ubGluZS9uYW1lL2hlbnJ5LWhhbnNvbi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNDQyMjc4N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Finance website WalletHub revealed the best and worst US airlines based on data from the Department of Transportation.

Delta Air Lines took the top spot scoring high in terms of reliability comfort and customer satisfaction.

Southwest ranked dead last followed by American Airlines JetBlue Airways and Frontier Airlines.

Personal finance website WalletHub revealed the best airlines in the US based on 2021 flight data collected from the US Department of Transportation.

The company ranked 11 carriers from best to worst including mainline airlines like American and Southwest and low-cost carriers like Spirit and Frontier.

Two regional carriers — SkyWest Airlines and Envoy Air — were included because they make up at least 1% of domestic scheduled service and report data to the DOT according to the company.

WalletHub scored each airline based on 16 metrics across four main categories including baggage departures and complaints animal-related incidents inflight comfort and safety. Subcategories included factors like delays WiFi availability legroom denied boardings and price.

While price is a common dealbreaker for many consumers WalletHub noted that its report examines ""overlooked aspects of air travel"" to help travelers ""make more informed decisions."" However the company said ""for the sake of fairness"" it considered costs ""in relation to inflight amenities.""

""For example it wouldn't be right to penalize an airline that charges for drinks if its tickets are far cheaper than those from an airline with free in-flight refreshments"" it explained.

WalletHub took each airline's score from the four major categories to determine the overall best and worst carriers in the US. Scores were based on specific criteria like the rate of delays or the number of customer complaints.

Then the company totaled the points from each category to give an overall performance rank. Delta earned the highest score of 70.48 out of 100 while Southwest came in last with just 30.60 points earned.

WalletHub disclosed that each metric was allowed a maximum number of available points an airline could earn and that the weight of each and its calculation into the overall score was based on the company's subjective view. However it said points were generally allocated ""based on common sense.""

In addition to ranking the best airline the company also gave six other awards including cheapest airline safest airline most reliable airline the best airline for pets least complained-about airline and most comfortable airline.

Delta took home the most medals including being the best overall US airline the most reliable and tied for the safest for animals. Meanwhile JetBlue and Frontier earned top spots for comfort and affordability respectively.

Here's a closer look at WalletHub's best and worst US airlines and the individual awards each received.







11. Southwest Airlines

Ashlee D. Smith/Southwest Airlines

Southwest ranked last on WalletHub's list bringing up the rear in several categories including being the least reliable and the least safe airline. WalletHub gave Southwest a score of 7.84 out of 50 for reliability whereas the top performers including Delta and Hawaiian scored above 30.

The data also showed Southwest's reliability tanked in comparison to the year prior which earned a score of 26.80. This is likely in part due to the airline's multi-day meltdown in October 2021 that left thousands of passengers stranded.

The airline got its low safety rating due to an uncontained engine failure in 2018 that resulted in the death of a passenger which forced WalletHub to deduct points.

10. American Airlines

American aircraft. Airbus

American ranked second-to-last on WalletHub's list earning low scores in reliability price and safety. According to the data the carrier sustained at least 50 passenger or employee injuries that required medical care in 2021 causing its low safety rating.

Meanwhile the carrier earned a reliability score of 14.24 though it did earn a higher comfort score of 4 out of 5.

9. JetBlue Airways

JetBlue A320 aircraft. Marcus Mainka/Shutterstock

JetBlue was named the worst US airline by the Wall Street Journal earlier this year due to poor on-time performance and a high number of passenger complaints.

WalletHub's data reared similar results scoring its reliability at 16.52 out of 50 as well ranking fourth in terms of customer complaints.

However not all is bad for JetBlue. The carrier was ranked the best airline for onboard comfort including offering free amenities like WiFi inflight entertainment snacks and beverages. The carrier also offers the most legroom in economy Conde Nest Traveler reported.

8. Frontier Airlines

Frontier Airlines Carlos Yudica

Frontier ranked low in terms of reliability with a score of 13.18 and came in last for comfort due to a lack of inflight amenities like WiFi or free snacks and drinks.

The carrier also configures its planes with 28 inches of legroom which is the lowest offered in the US according to travel magazine AFAR.

However Frontier did earn the top ranking for affordability offering consumers the cheapest plane tickets of any other carrier. The data showed Frontier's airfare averaged 3.53 cents per mile.

7. United Airlines

While United ranked low compared to other carriers it received the third-best reliability score of 26.67 out of 50 and a high comfort score of 4.5 out of 5.

However its low overall ranking can be contributed to its high number of passenger complaints. According to DOT data United had 3581 complaints in 2021 which came out to 29.73 complaints per 100000 passengers WalletHub revealed.

6. SkyWest Airlines

Regional carrier SkyWest which flies on behalf of United Delta American and Alaska earned high rankings for pet-friendliness and customer satisfaction. Specifically the carrier received 328 complaints in total according to DOT data giving it a rate of 0.92 complaints per 100000 passengers.

Because Skywest flies for four carriers WalletHub used the average maximum and minimum scores for each situation to determine the regional carrier's overall comfort score.

5. Spirit Airlines

Rounding out the top five carriers Spirit Airlines performed well in 2021 in terms of affordability and safety.

The carrier is the second-cheapest airline behind Frontier with an average airfare of 3.82 cents per mile. Meanwhile the airline received a score of 19.99 out of 50 for reliability which is average compared to other airlines.

Like Frontier Spirit did rank low in onboard comfort offering no free amenities inflight except for a seat and a personal item.

4. Envoy Air

Envoy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of American and is one of the top-performing operators according to WalletHub. The airline earned an overall score of 60.46 out of 100 which is double Southwest's score of 30.60. It also scored high for pet safety.

However Envoy was the most expensive carrier of 2021 with an average fare of 12.42 cents per mile. This can mostly be attributed to the carrier flying on behalf of American to small markets that have higher operating costs causing airfare to increase.

3. Alaska Airlines

Alaska Airlines. Alaska Airlines

Alaska is the third-best airline in the US according to WalletHub. The airline earned the title of the safest airline and scored high in terms of reliability comfort and price.

The airline scored 4.5 out of 5 for comfort tying with Delta and just losing out to JetBlue.

2. Hawaiian Airlines

Hawaiian is the runner-up this year scoring high in affordability reliability and safety. However the airline only beat out Spirit and Frontier in terms of comfort scoring 2 out of 5.

Meanwhile the airline had the second-highest number of passenger complaints with 37.63 per 100000 passengers according to WalletHub data. The airline received an overall high score due to its strong on-time performance and safety.

1. Delta Air Lines

Just like the Wall Street Journal WalletHub named Delta the best airline in the US. The Atlanta-based carrier is the most reliable airline and came in second for comfort tieing with Alaska Southwest and United.

The airline has also proved its responsibility with pets reporting no animal-related incidents in 2021. Moreover the airline had one of the lowest rates of consumer complaints receiving 1.92 complaints per 100000 passengers according to WalletHub data.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vYmVhdG9maGF3YWlpLmNvbS9haXJsaW5lLXJhbmtpbmdzLW9uLWZsaWdodHMtdG8taGF3YWlpLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airline Rankings On Flights To Hawaii 2023,Beat of Hawaii's Special Picks for You,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZS5jb20vNjE3MDA5MC9waWxvdC1zaG9ydGFnZXMtcGVyc2lzdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airlines Substitute Buses for Planes Due to Pilot Shortage,"U.S. airlines are facing a pilot shortage that’s complicating efforts to ramp up flights forcing them to step up training programs recruit foreign pilots and even replace planes with buses.

The industry needs to hire an average of 14500 new pilots each year until 2030 according to federal labor statistics. But carriers say there’s no way they can bring on that many due to long lag times for credentialing. Worse experts say the staffing bottleneck is unlikely to end anytime soon.

“The pilot shortage for the industry is real and most airlines are simply not going to be able to realize their capacity plans because there simply aren’t enough pilots at least not for the next five-plus years” Scott Kirby chief executive officer of United Airlines Holdings Inc. said earlier this week on a conference call. That will likely force United to keep 150 regional planes parked despite increased domestic travel demand he said.

Members of the Air Line Pilots Association picket outside Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta Georgia on March 10 2022.

The issue isn’t new — airlines already faced difficulty finding and retaining pilots before the pandemic — but a purging of employees at the start of the downturn in 2020 has left the industry ill-prepared for a rebound. Thousands of pilots accepted buyouts or retired early when federal aid to avoid furloughs failed to cover all the airlines’ labor costs especially for veteran pilots earning six-figure salaries.

Two years on airlines are unable to find enough qualified crews to fully reinstate route maps.

“This is going to be one of the biggest constraints for the industry going forward” Alaska Air Group Inc. Chief Executive Ben Minicucci said on an April 21 call.

Airlines have scaled back plans for a rapid resumption of pre-pandemic flight schedules. United expects flying this quarter to be down 13% from 2019 while Delta Air Lines Inc. projects a 16% decline American Airlines Group Inc. as much as 8% and Alaska Air about 9%. JetBlue Airways Corp. is trimming 10% of its planned summer flights.

Regional Carrier Crunch

The problem is most acute at regional airlines where pilot ranks have been depleted by hiring at larger carriers. A beggar-thy-neighbor strategy has left smaller aircraft idle and cut flights dedicated to shorter routes.

“We don’t have the regional aircraft flying the summer right now [that] we would like” American’s chief executive officer Robert Isom told CNBC Thursday. “This is a fantastic opportunity for people that want to come in and fly planes. They can make a lot of money.”

Regional airlines play a critical role in ferrying passengers from smaller markets to hub airports where they board flights operated by larger partners. These work horses of the industry have capacity purchase agreements binding them to one or more primary airlines such as American or Delta which control scheduling pricing and ticketing.

“This is the pivotal point” Faye Malarkey Black chief executive of the Regional Airline Association said in an interview. “We have not seen this level of service loss since right after 9-11 when that crisis changed the fly-drive equation. I expect this bad situation to get worse before it gets better no matter what we do.”

Flying Bus

In lieu of puddle-jumper flights some airlines are linking up with charter bus services. United and American have contracted with Landline Co. a Fort Collins Colorado-based startup to ferry passengers and their bags by motorcoach on some shorter routes allowing them to sell destinations where they don’t fly.

Others are casting a wide net to find staff. Discount carrier Breeze Airways and SkyWest Inc. are both recruiting foreign pilots from Australia.

The industry is hiking pay to attract and retain pilots. But the rapid escalation in labor costs could undermine the business models of deep-discount airlines by limiting their ability to grow and eroding their core cost advantages.

That’s a risk to Spirit Airlines Inc. and Frontier Group Holdings Inc. Those two carriers “require an abundance of pilots willing to work for less than what large airlines pay” said Jamie Baker a JPMorgan analyst. “The sustainability of that model should logically be questioned in the current environment.”

Within this narrative organizations must amass as much data as possible while bolstering their analytics and AI capabilities to mine them for insights. Unsurprisingly reports show that big data market volume will exceed USD100 billion over the next five years.

So the more data there is the better things will be right?

The case for quality data

It turns out that there are scenarios where too much data might not be a good idea according to Karen Burns cofounder of AI computer vision firm Fyma. In a contributed opinion piece for CPO Magazine she argues that more data only generate value if organizations know how to use it.

“Data for data’s sake is completely pointless and organizations are increasingly jumping the gun when it comes to pursuing ambitious insights strategies without the know-how to make the most of new data” wrote Burns.

In addition there are various disadvantages to juggling a vast amount of data. More data means a larger attack surface whether through data leaks or data breaches. Burns points out that the damage can be significant for at-risk industries such as healthcare FSI and telecommunications sectors.

Having more data also means more data wrangling which can drive the cost up significantly – increasing an initially manageable cost to unsustainable levels. Finally we know that bad data is a serious problem when training AI models so much so that it can result in trained models that are effectively useless.

Start with strategic objectives

To avoid rushing headlong into data initiatives and ending up with a situation where the organization is gathering more data for its own sake Burns suggests that data managers take a step back to review their strategic objectives and the best route to achieve them.

“CTOs need to be taking greater care over their cost-benefit analysis before looking to data analytics to improve their business models. Not all data will be useful and you need a solution that is built from the ground-up to be compliant and secure” she wrote.

Two key areas must be in place: the right data platform and the right talent to bring data projects to fruition. And businesses should probably not jump straight into more challenging areas such as AI before they get the right guidance from experts.

In a nutshell quality data in smaller quantities leveraged to fulfil strategic objectives will impact the bottom line in a bigger way than chaotic and unfocused attempts at using any and every data. Burns noted: “People fall into the trap of thinking more data automatically generates more value and revenue.”

Growing momentum for small data

Fortunately there is a growing awareness that the ability to make data-driven decisions doesn’t necessarily require a huge amount of data. Indeed Gartner in a report last year predicted that 70% of organizations will shift their focus from big to small and wide data by 2025.

Unlike big data small data is an approach that requires less data but still offers useful insights. According to Gartner this approach might include certain time-series analysis techniques few-shot learning synthetic data or self-supervised learning.

It is worth pointing out that Singapore which is working hard to position itself as a leading hub for AI has in recent months shared its intention to focus on data sharing and quality data. Of course the country had previously also acknowledged that its datasets are comparatively smaller given the size of the country.

“Taken together [small data and wide data] are capable of using available data more effectively either by reducing the required volume or by extracting more value from unstructured diverse data sources” explained Jim Hare a distinguished research vice president at Gartner.

“Taken together they are capable of using available data more effectively either by reducing the required volume or by extracting more value from unstructured diverse data sources.”

Nike and Rtfkt’s first digital sneakers are here. On Friday the digital fashion and 3D creation studio which Nike acquired in December revealed a collection of co-branded digital sneakers on Discord and Twitter. The shoes called Nike Cryptokicks are modelled after the Nike Dunk sneaker and mark the brand’s long-awaited entrance into digital clothing.

The sneakers are available to people who own Rtfkt’s Mnlth a mysterious digital box NFT that was airdropped for free to anyone who owned a Clone-X in February. (Clone-X is the PFP project that Rtfkt created with artist Takashi Murakami in November.) People could elect to sell their Mnlth NFTs or keep them. Now those who held onto it have been rewarded: they can burn their current Mnlths in exchange for a Mnlth that holds a Cryptokick.

The company will offer eight Rtfkt-made evolutionary “skins” to start which let people customise the sneakers with various looks and designs similar to a video-game skill tree although the evolution mode isn't yet activated says co-founder Benoit Pagotto who worked in luxury fashion before founding Rtfkt. Rtfkt plans to open the ability for creators and partners to create skins. At launch one of the skins was created by Murakami.

Read More With Rtfkt acquisition Nike invests in the metaverse Nike has bought the two-year-old “Supreme of digital fashion” for an undisclosed sum. The move brings the brand further into the metaverse.

The sneaker community has enthusiastically embraced digital fashion and become a leader in trends including PFPs Discord communities and digital collectibles. Fittingly Adidas and Nike have been in competition to keep communities curious and intrigued about the metaverse. The same week that Nike acquired Rtfkt Adidas unveiled its hotly anticipated “Into the Metaverse” NFTs in collaboration with Web3 influencers Gmoney and the Bored Ape Yacht Club. Similar to Rtfkt Adidas’s strategy hinges on the promise of ongoing future perks including access to both digital and physical products and events. To that end Adidas has begun developing digital real estate on The Sandbox and Nike has an ongoing world on Roblox where people can play to earn digital goods.

Nike acquired two-year-old Rtfkt for an undisclosed sum in December bringing on a small team and large NFT fan-group. Nike called out the platform’s “next-generation collectibles that merge culture and gaming” and Nike Inc. president and CEO John Donahoe said it allows the company to serve creators at the “intersection of sport creativity gaming and culture”.

Trademarks filed by Nike for Cryptokicks earlier this week offered clues about its future roadmap: it filed for downloadable computer software for use as a cryptocurrency wallet; services for a marketplace for digital currency assets; services that provide a digital currency or token for an online community; electronic bulletin board services; blogs in crypto-collectibles; online scavenger hunts; and technology that enables members to receive crypto assets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pYW1paGVyYWxkLmNvbS9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlLW5ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZTI2MDM5NDI1Ny5odG1s0gFQaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAubWlhbWloZXJhbGQuY29tL25ld3MvYnVzaW5lc3MvcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUtbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlMjYwMzk0MjU3Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cryptocurrency creeps into real estate: Miami mansion to be sold as an NFT,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.miamiherald.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Raine were commissioned to lead the sale process by Roman Abramovich before the Russian was hit by UK government sanctions last month over his connections to Vladimir Putin.

The European champions have since been operating under a special licence that limits their ability to sell tickets merchandise and operate in the transfer market.

Chelsea won 19 major trophies during Abramovich’s 19-year reign and could add another when they face Liverpool in next month’s FA Cup final.

However the impact of the sanctions is beginning to show with rows of empty seats in the home end for Arsenal’s 4-2 win at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.

The club also cannot offer new contracts — defenders Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen are likely to leave at the end of the season on free transfers.

The hope is that new owners will be in place by the end of the campaign.

None of the three bids is expected to run into trouble passing the Premier League’s owners’ and directors’ test or seeking UK government approval.

Soft loans totalling £1.5 billion ($1.9 billion) from Abramovich have fuelled Chelsea’s success over the past two decades but he will not claim that money back and will not receive funds from the sale while sanctioned.

Despite those losses and the need for an expensive stadium upgrade to match their status as one of Europe’s top clubs the sale is set to attract a world-record fee for a sports club of an estimated £2.5 billion.

AFP Sport looks at the three bids on the table.

Boehly Wyss and Goldstein

Swiss billionaire Hansjoerg Wyss first broke the news of Abramovich’s desire to sell in an interview with newspaper Blick in his homeland.

However it is American Todd Boehly co-owner of Major League Baseball franchise the Los Angeles Dodgers who is leading their bid along with British lawyer Jonathan Goldstein.

Goldstein’s loyalties as a Tottenham fan have presented a red flag for some Chelsea fans.

But Boehly has credibility with his ownership of the Dodgers who won a first World Series for 32 years in 2020.

He has also overseen a significant stadium redevelopment at Dodger Stadium and modernisation will be needed at Stamford Bridge.

Broughton’s star power

Martin Broughton brings formidable football and business experience to the table as a former chairman of Liverpool and British Airways.

However it is a collection of sporting stars he has assembled that has caught the eye in his bid.

Seven-time Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton and tennis great Serena Williams have reportedly pledged to invest millions into Broughton’s consortium.

“When I heard about the opportunity I was like wow” said Hamilton. “This is a great opportunity to be part of something so great.”

World Athletics president Sebastian Coe a Chelsea fan would also take a seat on the board if the bid were successful.

The major financial investment for the bid does cause a headache for the Premier League as it comes from Josh Harris and David Blitzer who own a stake in Crystal Palace.

Harris and Blitzer would have to sell their shares in Palace before being cleared to be part-owners of Chelsea.

Stephen Pagliuca

Co-owner of National Basketball Association side Boston Celtics and Serie A club Atalanta and co-chairman of Bain Capital which has $160 billion in assets Stephen Pagliuca was the last of the bidders to go public with his interest.

He has secured the support of the True Blues Consortium a Chelsea supporters group that includes former captain John Terry.

There is even more sports business experience among his consortium.

Larry Tanenbaum owns stakes in Toronto’s ice hockey basketball and football teams as well as being chairman of the NBA.

Pagliuca only bought into Atalanta in February paying a reported $450 million for a 47 percent stake.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL2VuLndvcmxkdGVtcHVzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2luZHVzdHJ5LW5ld3MvYnVzaW5lc3MvaG9yb2xvZ2ljYWwtc29jaWV0eS1vZi1uZXcteW9yay1oc255LWhzbnktYXdhcmRzLTEwMDAwMC1pbi1maW5hbmNpYWwtYWlkLWF0LWl0cy1hbm51YWwtZ2FsYS0zMTMxNi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HSNY Awards $100000 In Financial Aid at Its Annual Gala,"After a two-year pause in its 156-year tradition the Horological Society of New York (HSNY) held its annual Gala on Saturday April 9 2022 where it awarded $100000 to watchmaking students and schools and raised an additional $18000 toward its mission of advancing the art and science of horology

HSNY celebrated the 2022 Gala & Awards Ceremony in style at the landmark Harvard Club of New York City where 200 members and friends reunited to toast to one of the world’s oldest continuously operating horological associations.

Highlights from the evening included a presentation by HSNY President John Teifert of the Howard Fass Award given this year to longtime HSNY member and horological bibliophile Fortunat Mueller-Maerki. Bestowed for the third time since its creation in 2016 the Howard Fass award is HSNY’s highest honor given to individuals judged to have shown extraordinary dedication to the ideals which the Society pursues.

The lavish evening continued with the announcement of HSNY’s largest financial aid awarded to date — a sum of $100000 to 15 watchmaking students and three watchmaking institutions across the country. Steve Eagle HSNY’s Director of Education presented a check to Robert Younger a student of the Patek Philippe Institute in New York who accepted the award on behalf of all recipients. (Please see below a full list of financial aid recipients.)

In between dinner courses and mingling a lively bidding war took place for HSNY’s first-ever Lifetime Membership Card. Hosted by Isabella Proia of Phillips in Association with Bacs & Russo the starting bid of $500 quickly escalated as attendees bid for the evening’s coveted auction item among them Kevin O'Leary the entrepreneur and businessman fondly known as Mr. Wonderful on the television show Shark Tank. A hammer price of $18000 ended the evening’s auction with Jared Tramontano taking home bragging rights as HSNY’s first Lifetime Membership cardholder. Proceeds from the sale will benefit HSNY’s ongoing financial aid initiatives. The card grants the owner lifetime membership privileges at HSNY including all aspects of all current and future membership levels. It was engine turned by Joshua Shapiro and hand-engraved by Artur Akmaev and made from a 92.5% sterling silver alloy with tarnish-resistant properties 4-5 times that of traditional sterling silver. HSNY’s full Charity Auction will be held online in June 2022 and will be hosted by Phillips in Association with Bacs & Russo.

A last-minute change of plan to board an overnight train from Vienna with our children offered an unforgettable sunrise. From the sleeper window we watched Venice's skyline etched onto an orange crimson and pale blue sky as the train glided across the lagoon. Another time years earlier I woke up in a tightly packed carriage to the offer of food and conversation from labourers on their way back home to Thessaloniki because I had slept through a connection in Belgrade Central Station.

After two years of uncertainty around air travel and growing awareness of its impact on the climate there's no better time to rediscover the joy of travelling by train. Our own rail network in Ireland is limited however so the simplest way to try out a multi-destination rail holiday is take the ferry across the Irish Sea to England to discover beautiful landscapes and picturesque towns and villages beyond the bright lights of London Manchester or Liverpool.

Liam (played by Johnny McPherson) breathed a sigh of relief earlier this week on Emmerdale when he finally received justice for Leanna's (Mimi Slinger) death as villain Meena Jutla (Paige Sandhu) was sentenced to life in prison. Although this grief will never leave him he has taken a new approach to life an in upcoming scenes on the ITV soap he will put more effort into his wife Leyla Harding (Roxy Shahidi). However as he does some digging and wants to do something grand to mark their first anniversary he could discover their marriage was completely invalid.

Ahead of the pair getting married last summer Liam and Leyla were shocked to see Bernice Blackstock (Samantha Giles) back in the village. Bernice had previously tried to marry the doctor but she jilted him on their wedding day when she told him she was going to live in Australia. When she made her dramatic comeback she was eager to right the wrongs of her past which included not tying the knot with the handsome villager. Chaos ensued as she donned a wedding dress and horrified Leyla when she claimed she was going to be the one who was going to marry Liam. Eventually she saw what she was doing was wrong and stood to the side as her former lover and his new wife exchanged their vows.

However going back to Liam and Leyla's wedding day Bernice could have cooked up a dastardly plan to ensure legally they never actually married. When the wedding officials were not looking she could have swapped out the documentation and replaced it with fake replicas. Of course with so much having happened since they tied the knot the couple would have had little time to look at their marriage certificate.

Could she try and convince the grief-stricken father it could have been villain Meena who swapped out the real documentation for the fake replicas? With Meena having taken such a fascination with the Cavanaghs during her reign of terror she could have wanted to destroy Liam and Leyla before going on to kill Leanna. But will she do a good enough job to throw her former lover off the scent it was actually her who has caused this fresh tragedy?

Speaking with Express.co.uk and other media earlier this year producer for the show Kate Brooks hinted a twist like this was on the horizon for Liam and Leyla. Discussing the aftermath of Meena's exit from the show the soap boss explained: ""I think we were very conscious not to just tie it up in a very neat bow and say okay now Meena has left and gone from the village let’s just move on. ""That is not what would happen or how we have made it. ""There's a massive story on the table for Liam and Leyla which is the result of what has gone down with Leanna and everything."" Not officially confirming what the storyline twist was could Kate have been hinting at how Liam and Leyla will discover their bad luck started even before Leanna died?

We don’t see the evidence of the grape harvest until much later in the year when the season’s vintage is released but with hops “harvest” beers are hitting the shelves now.

These beers are much different from the year-round offerings because they are made with unprocessed newly picked “fresh” hops.

To make sure hops are available year-round for brewing the bulk of them are dried processed into pellets and sealed into vacuum packs to stay in good condition. Part of this processing removes a lot of the green leafy material.

Increasingly in New Zealand however a fraction of the harvest remains unprocessed and is used in a growing number of “fresh hop” beers.

The idea of celebrating the hop harvest in New Zealand is relatively new. Tracy Banner – now owner and master brewer of Sprig + Fern Brewery in Richmond –was one of the early adopters when she created Brewjolais for Mac’s in nearby Nelson in the 1990s.

For a long time fresh hop beers were the preserve of brewers close to Nelson because newly picked hops can start to turn brown within 24 hours. It wasn’t so long ago that brewers in Wellington started chartering planes to get to Nelson load up on freshly picked hops and head back to their bases to start making beer the same day.

Transport issues and logistics used to be barriers for brewers further afield but the past two years has seen a rapid change in both technology and logistics. It’s been discovered that the hops last longer when chilled straight off the bine (yes the bine – the climbing or twining stem of the hop plant – not vine). The pre-chilled hops can be at their best for three days if they stay cold. That’s allowed New Zealand’s biggest producer NZ Hops Ltd to send pre-chilled hops to designated pick-up venues in Upper Hutt (Kererū Brewing) and Auckland (Behemoth) so breweries in the North Island can go and get them.

That change in practice has seen the fresh hop phenomenon spread much further afield than in previous years; NZ Hops calculates that a record 35 breweries used its green hops this year.

A good example is Brave Brewing in Hastings where founder-brewer Matt Smith had previously always found it hard to get his hands on fresh hops. This year he flew to Wellington hired a car drove to Kererū picked up his allocation and was back in Hastings that afternoon to start brewing. The hops were around three days old when he used them in his Helping Hands IPA but they were in great condition he said.

“NZ Hops have made a lot of improvements over the years. They pick them and they go straight into coolrooms to pre-cool before they start their journey. They go into the refrigerated truck cold and stay cold.”

Many breweries also deal direct with individual farms for quick pick-up and delivery.

Luke Nicholas of Epic Beer in Onehunga says his Haze Fever IPA featured hops that were on the bine at 5am and in the brew kettle early that afternoon. “Our friend from Eggers Hop Farm in the Moutere Valley was up at 5am picking the hops so we could get them into the brew as fast as possible. The hops were delivered to Nelson Airport by 7am were in Auckland by noon and into the brew by 2pm the same day.”

The growth of fresh hop beers is reflected in New World’s record number of such offerings with 18 on the shelves including 8 Wired Baylands Behemoth Deep Creek Double Vision Eddyline Epic Garage Project Good George Panhead Parrotdog Renaissance Sawmill and Urbanaut.

Urbanaut is one of the most adventurous fresh hop breweries in the country and this year is the second time it’s made a six-pack with six different fresh hop beers. Each showcases a different hop variety and a different beer style — Saison (Pacifica) India Pale Lager (Nelson Sauvin) Brut IPA (Motueka) Hazy Pale Ale (Nectaron) West Coast IPA (Waimea) and Hazy Double IPA (Cascade).

Brewing with fresh hops is notoriously hard and — from a business perspective — inefficient. The pillow-like hops soak up so much beer that yields are lower than on normal brew days and the saturated hops clog up systems and make things difficult to clean. So to brew six different fresh hop beers is a massive undertaking.

But Urbanaut founder Bruce Turner’s view is that this is a special time of the year for beer lovers and it’s worth celebrating.

“The beautiful thing is we’re so lucky because there are not many countries in the world where you can brew fresh hop beers with top-grade commercial hops.

“It’s only New Zealand Australia parts of the US the hop belt in Europe — if you’re not close enough to fresh hops you can’t have the privilege of making these beers.”

So what’s different about a fresh hop beer? There’s often an oily resinous quality to the mouthfeel and the aroma has a sprightly delicate fresh-from-the-garden pungency. It’s not quite as striking as the difference you find between dried and fresh herbs but it’s comparable. Dried herbs have a more concentrated intense flavour than fresh herbs and so it is with hops. Compare a mint tea made with fresh mint from the garden versus dried-mint tea.

But as with anything fresh and one-off you have to be in quick as there’s only a limited volume of these beers and they won’t last long.

""I open the store at 8 a.m. and I basically had to run the entire store. I had to check in and out customers I had to do my paperwork I had to check in vendors I had to check in a mystery truck that just showed up out of nowhere"" Mary Gundel who managed a Dollar General store near Tampa said. ""I had no help I don't have enough hours given to me for me to actually be a manager within the business. And that's a big safety concern within the company.""

SUPPLY CHAIN EXPERT WARNS OF RISING RATES GOING INTO PEAK SEASON: ‘I SEE A LOT OF TROUBLE AHEAD’

Gundel created the hashtag ""Putinaticket"" which is meant to mock how Dollar General handles complaints by employees by telling them to ""put in a ticket.""

As a result of her TikToks other Dollar General employees began posting their work experiences at Dollar General as well.

When she tried to raise concerns about staffing and other issues with people at Dollar General Gundel said that she was met with the same response every time: ""Everybody is dealing with this right now.""

She also alleged that employees are working by themselves in the store for entire shifts.

GEORGIA BUSINESS OWNER DETAILS SUPPLY CHAIN 'NIGHTMARE'

In one video Gundel posted while she was still working at Dollar General she criticized a new company policy that allegedly limited the days in which incoming truck containers can be unloaded.

In response to the allegations Dollar General provided FOX Business with the following statement:

""At Dollar General we are committed to providing an environment where employees can grow their careers and where they feel valued and heard. We are proud that approximately 75% of our Store Managers along with many other leaders were promoted from within. Maintaining two-way open lines of communication with our employees is a priority. We provide many avenues for our teams to make their voices heard including our open-door policy and routine engagement surveys. We use this feedback to help us identify and address concerns improve our workplace and better serve our employees customers and communities"" the statement said.

""We are disappointed any time an employee feels that we have not lived up to these goals and we use those situations as additional opportunities to listen and learn. Although we do not agree with all the statements currently being made by Ms. Gundel we are doing that here"" the discount store chain added.

A Dollar General spokesperson said the company had spoken with Gundel about the violations of company policy it says she committed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbnZlcnBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjIvMDQvMjMvaG93LWEtZG9sbGFyLWdlbmVyYWwtZW1wbG95ZWUtd2VudC12aXJhbC1vbi10aWt0b2sv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVudmVycG9zdC5jb20vMjAyMi8wNC8yMy9ob3ctYS1kb2xsYXItZ2VuZXJhbC1lbXBsb3llZS13ZW50LXZpcmFsLW9uLXRpa3Rvay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How a Dollar General employee went viral on TikTok,"By Michael Corkery The New York Times Company

In January 2021 Mary Gundel received a letter from Dollar General’s corporate office congratulating her for being one of the company’s top-performing employees. In honor of her hard work and dedication the company gave Gundel a lapel pin that read “DG: Top 5%.”

“Wear it proudly” the letter said.

Gundel did just that affixing the pin to her black-and-yellow Dollar General uniform next to her name badge. “I wanted the world to see it” she said.

Gundel loved her job managing the Dollar General store in Tampa Florida. It was fast-paced unpredictable and even exciting. She especially liked the challenge of calming down belligerent customers and pursuing shoplifters. She earned about $51000 a year far more than the median income in Tampa.

But the job had its challenges too: Delivery trucks that would show up unannounced leaving boxes piled up in the aisles because there were not enough workers to unpack them. Days spent running the store for long stretches by herself because the company allotted only so many hours for other employees to work. Cranky customers complaining about out of stock items.

So on the morning of March 28 in between running the register and putting tags on clothing Gundel 33 propped up her iPhone and hit record.

The result was a six-part critique “Retail Store Manager Life” in which Gundel laid bare the working conditions inside the fast-growing retail chain with stores that are a common sight in rural areas.

“Me talking out about this is actually kind of bad” Gundel said as she looked into her camera. “Technically I could get into a lot of trouble.”

But she added: “Whatever happens happens. Something needs to be said and there needs to be some changes or they are probably going to end up losing a lot of people.”

Her videos which she posted on TikTok went viral including one that has been viewed 1.8 million times.

And with that Gundel was instantly transformed from a loyal lieutenant in Dollar General management into an outspoken dissident who risked her career to describe working conditions familiar to retail employees across the United States.

As Gundel had predicted Dollar General soon fired her. She was let go less than a week after posting her first critical video but not before she inspired other Dollar General store managers many of them women working in stores in poor areas to speak out on TikTok.

“I am so tired I can’t even talk” said one woman who described herself as a 24-year-old store manager but did not give her name. “Give me my life back.”

“I’ve been so afraid to post this until now” another unidentified woman said as she walked viewers through a Dollar General store while discussing how she was forced to work alone because of labor cuts.

“This will be my last day” she said citing Gundel’s videos. “I am not doing this anymore.”

In a statement Dollar General said: “We provide many avenues for our teams to make their voices heard including our open-door policy and routine engagement surveys. We use this feedback to help us identify and address concerns improve our workplace and better serve our employees customers and communities. We are disappointed any time an employee feels that we have not lived up to these goals and we use those situations as additional opportunities to listen and learn.

“Although we do not agree with all the statements currently being made by Ms. Gundel we are doing that here.”

Before March 28 Gundel’s TikTok page was a mix of posts about hair extensions and her recent dental surgery. Now it is a daily digest dedicated to fomenting revolt at a major American company. She is trying to build what she calls a “movement” of workers who feel overworked and disrespected and is encouraging Dollar General employees to form a union.

Just about every day Gundel announces on TikTok a newly “elected spokesperson” — each one a woman who works for Dollar General or worked there recently — from Arkansas Ohio Tennessee West Virginia and other places. These women have been assigned to answer questions and concerns from fellow employees in those states and most are keeping their identities hidden because they worry about losing their jobs.

Social media not only gives workers a platform to vent and connect with one another it empowers rank-and-file workers like Gundel to become labor leaders. Gundel’s viral videos appeared as Christian Smalls an Amazon warehouse employee in New York City who was derided by the company as “not smart or articulate” organized the first major union in Amazon history last month.

Gundel — who often dyes her hair pink and purple and has long painted nails that she uses to slice open packaging at work — has been able to break through it seems because other workers see themselves in her.

“Everyone has their breaking point” she said in a telephone interview. “You can only feel unappreciated for so long.”

Gundel planned on a long career at Dollar General when she started working in her first store in Georgia three years ago. She has three children including one who is autistic and her husband works at a defense contractor. She grew up in Titusville Florida near Cape Canaveral. Her mother was a district manager at the Waffle House restaurants. Her grandmother worked in the gift store at the Kennedy Space Center. Gundel moved to Tampa as a Dollar General store manager in February 2020 just before the pandemic.

The store used to have about 198 hours a week to allocate to a staff of about seven people she said. But by the end of last month she had only about 130 hours to allocate which equated to one full-time employee and one part-time employee fewer than when she started.

With not as many hours to give to her staff Gundel often had to operate the store on her own for long stretches typically working six days and up to 60 hours a week with no overtime pay.

Gundel’s protest was prompted by a TikTok video posted by a customer complaining about the disheveled state of a Dollar General store. Gundel had heard these complaints from her own customers. Why are boxes blocking the aisles? Why aren’t the shelves fully stocked?

She understood their frustration. But the blame on employees is misplaced she said.

“Instead of getting mad at the people working there trying to handle all of their workload why don’t you say something to the actual big people in the company?” Gundel said on TikTok. “Why don’t you demand more from the company so they actually start funding the stores to be able to get all this stuff done?”

Gundel soon tapped into a network of fellow employees some of whom had already gone public about challenges at work. They included Crystal McBride who worked at a Dollar General in Utah and had made a video that showed her store’s dumpster overflowing with trash that people had deposited there.

“Thanks guys for adding some more dirty work for me” McBride 37 said in her post.

She said in an interview that Dollar General had fired her earlier this month and that her manager had warned her about some of her videos. As someone who had walked out of an abusive relationship with “just the clothes on my back” and lost her 11 year-old daughter to cancer in 2018 “I wasn’t afraid of losing my job” she said. “I was not going to be silenced.”

Neither was Gundel. As her online following grew she kept posting more videos many of them increasingly angry.

She talked about a customer who had pulled a knife on her and a man who had reached into her car in the store parking lot and tried yanking her through the window.

She said the company’s way of avoiding serious issues was to bury them in bureaucracy. “You know what they tell you? ‘Put in a ticket’” she said.

Gundel started using the hashtag #PutInATicket which other TikTok users tagged in their own videos.

On the night of March 29 Gundel posted a video saying her boss had called her that day to discuss her videos. He told her to review the company’s social media policy she said. She told him that she was well aware of the policy.

“I was not specifically told to take my videos down but it was recommended” she said in the video. “To save my job and future career and where I want to go.”

She closed her eyes for a moment.

“I had to respectfully decline” to remove the videos she said. “I feel like it would be against my morals and integrity to do so.”

Gundel also got a call from one of the senior executives who had sent her the “DG: 5%” pin she had been so proud of. Gundel insisted on recording the call to protect herself. The executive said she just wanted to talk through Gundel’s concerns but did not want to be recorded. The call ended politely but quickly.

On April 1 Gundel reported to work at 6 a.m. “Guess what” she said in a post from outside the store. “I just got fired.”

She added “It’s pretty sad that a store manager or anybody has to go viral on a social media site in order to be listened to in order to get some help in their store.”

Gundel continues to post videos regularly and recently started driving for Uber and Lyft.

While Gundel’s unionizing effort may be an uphill effort some people say she has already had an impact. In one recent TikTok video a woman shopping at a Dollar General in Florida credited Gundel with forcing the company to spruce up the store she shops in.

“Look at the refrigerators — everything’s stacked in there” the woman said as her camera panned the aisles. “They’ve got toilet paper to the roof y’all.”

“Thank you Mary for going viral and holding your ground and standing up to corporate and losing your job because it wasn’t done in vain” she said. “I’m proud to go into a Dollar General now because look at it. Look at it.”

(WNDU/Gray News) - A Dollar Tree store in Indiana has come under fire after its manager at the time posted a “help wanted” sign that some were calling controversial and discriminatory.

WNDU reports a store manager recently put up a hiring sign after two young employees had quit.

The handwritten sign read:

“I apologize for us closing AGAIN. My 2 new cashiers quit because I said their boyfriends couldn’t stand here for their entire shift. Don’t hire Gen Z’s. They don’t know what work actually means. NOW HIRING! *Baby Boomers ONLY thanks!”

The Pew Research Center defines Generation Z as any person born between 1997 and 2012 and the baby-boomer generation includes any person born between 1946 and 1964.

The sign has since been removed but it was there long enough for potential customers to share photos and gain attention on social media.

“You’re going to get people from every group who are lazy and work hard. I’m sure when baby boomers were young they were probably also called lazy and it just keeps going on from generation to generation” said frequent Dollar Tree customer Lindsay Berger.

Dollar Tree was informed of the manager’s sign and released the following statement:

“We are aware that an unauthorized sign was posted at our store for a brief period of time. The handwritten message was absolutely not approved by or condoned by our company.”

Additionally Dollar Tree representatives said the manager was no longer employed by the company.

BREMEN Ind. — The manager of a northern Indiana store is out of a job after posting a ""help wanted"" sign that some say is discriminatory.

The handwritten sign no longer hangs in the window of the Dollar Tree in Bremen Indiana but it was posted long enough for photos to reach the internet.

The sign reportedly written by a store manager according to WNDU read:

“I apologize for us closing AGAIN. My 2 new cashiers quit because I said their boyfriends couldn’t stand here for their entire shift.”

“Don’t hire Gen Z’s. They don’t know what work actually means. NOW HIRING! *Baby Boomers ONLY thanks!”

Generation Z includes people born between 1997 and 2012 making them 10 to 25 years old this year. So-called ""baby boomers"" were born between 1946 and 1964 in the years following World War II. They are currently between the ages of 58 and 76.

By SEAN SUBLETTE

Richmond Times-Dispatch

Wind turbines are among the technologies driving the development of renewable energy on a large scale with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel power plants and slowing down planetary warming.

Onshore turbines are already common from Texas to Iowa as winds are reliable on the Plains throughout most of the year.

That’s generally not the case in Virginia and the Middle Atlantic states especially during the doldrums of July and August. But several miles offshore it’s a different story which makes wind turbines more practical.

Offshore wind has already scaled up quickly in Western Europe and appears to be on the verge of rapid growth on this side of the Atlantic. But for the moment there’s not much.

A small group of five offshore wind turbines operated by the Danish firm Orsted has been generating power in the state waters off Rhode Island since 2016. Dominion Energy has been operating two wind turbines about 27 miles east of Virginia Beach since 2020.

Dominion appears poised to scale up offshore wind dramatically. The two turbines it currently operates are the pilot structures involved in its Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project and the turbines have performed well so far.

As a result Dominion is continuing its plans to go big with 176 new turbines extending outward an additional 15 miles by the end of 2026. This is roughly one for each square mile in the area it is leasing from the federal government over the next 30 years.

We went to take a look at the pilot turbines as new technologies often come with questions. Some are more basic than others.

How do they make electricity?

Electricity is generated by spinning a metal coil around a magnet. Or vice versa. This process called induction was discovered nearly 200 years ago. In this case wind turns the blades (the turbine) which spins a generator inside of the structure producing electricity.

How big are they?

When a blade is at its highest point the pilot turbines are 620 feet above the water line. For reference the Washington Monument is 555 feet tall and the James Monroe Building in downtown Richmond is 449 feet tall. Each blade is about 250 feet long.

The steel foundation of each turbine extends into the sea floor and the distance between the ocean surface and the blades at their lowest point varies between 85 and 110 feet.

The new series of commercial turbines will be 30% larger measuring 837 feet above the ocean surface with blades of 354 feet — about the length of a football field.

How much electricity will they make?

At peak output one of the new turbines will be able to power 3500 homes with one revolution of the blades generating enough electricity to power one home for one day.

Once complete the full series of turbines would produce enough electricity for 660000 homes at peak or about 25% of the household demand in Dominion’s service area — equivalent to 2.6 gigawatts (2.6 billion watts) of power.

How will the power get onshore?

Power from the turbines is sent downward through the center of each structure and into cables beneath the ocean floor. The cables are connected to each other remaining underground and run toward three offshore substations. From there the substations send the power back to shore via special underground export cables.

Dominion proposes bringing the underwater cables onshore at the State Military Reservation in Virginia Beach between the resort area and Sandbridge. The cables would continue underground until reaching Dominion’s new Harpers switching station on the edge of Oceana Naval Air Station.

From there the power lines would transition to overhead lines and continue to Dominion’s existing Fentress substation near the Great Bridge section of Chesapeake where they would join the rest of the high-voltage grid.

The Virginia State Corporation Commission plans to evaluate Dominion’s proposed onshore routing of the lines with a decision expected later this year.

Has there been any environmental review?

A draft of the environmental impact statement is expected this summer from the lead federal agency the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. After a period of public comments its final decision is expected in June 2023.

If the commercial project moves forward as Dominion plans additional federal agencies — like the Environmental Protection Agency the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Army Corps of Engineers — would issue their corresponding permits within 90 days of the BOEM decision.

What if there’s a hurricane?

In case of very high winds like a hurricane the turbines have been designed to feather meaning they would rotate so that less of the blades’ surface area would be in contact with the wind. The turbine itself would also rotate to minimize force on it.

How fast is this all going to happen?

If the permitting and review is done on time onshore preparations and manufacturing would start in the fall of 2023 with offshore construction beginning the following spring.

The foundations for the turbines will need to be installed between May 1 and Oct. 31 to avoid migration season of the North Atlantic right whale which has been on the endangered species list since 1970. Dominion will likely need two seasons for the installations meaning the foundations will not be ready for the turbines until 2025.

Work above the water can go on year-round. As a result installation of the physical turbines is planned to start in August 2025 with completion by the end of 2026.

Will they be visible from the beach?

Generally not. But under the right conditions some will be visible from the taller properties along the Virginia Beach Oceanfront.

How much will this cost customers?

Dominion is spending $9.8 billion to construct and commission the project. There will be variations but it expects the net cost to be $4 a month to a typical residential customer.

But any direct costs to the customers must be approved by the SCC. With no fuel necessary to power the turbines Dominion expects to save at least $3 billion in the first 10 years.

How long will they last?

Dominion plans for at least 30 years. It will track the performance and specifications of the equipment optimistic it can go beyond the initial 30 years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3JvYW5va2UuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvYXBwYWxhY2hpYW4tcG93ZXItcGxhbnMtZm9yLWl0cy1yZW5ld2FibGUtZW5lcmd5LWZ1dHVyZS9hcnRpY2xlXzYyMjM3MDE2LWMyN2YtMTFlYy04NDBkLTRiODhkODBjNmM1NC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Appalachian Power plans for its renewable energy future,"While capturing more sunlight and wind to produce its electricity Appalachian Power Co. will continue to burn coal in two large power plants in West Virginia until 2040.

That at least is one way that Appalachian says it could meet a state-imposed mandate that requires its Virginia customers to receive all-renewable power by 2050.

During a State Corporation Commission hearing last week the utility presented six different options for complying with a sweeping state law passed in 2020 by the General Assembly. The Virginia Clean Economy Act aims to fight climate change by replacing fossil fuels with green energy in the generation of electricity.

A decision from the SCC on Appalachian’s renewable energy plan which is updated yearly under the law is expected in the coming months.

Of the six plans outlined in voluminous filings with the regulatory agency Appalachian indicated that its preference is to keep the Amos and Mountaineer power plants — which produce nearly two-thirds of the utility’s electricity from their locations north of Charleston West Virginia — operational for the next 18 years.

At the same time the company would further diversify a power portfolio that includes banks of solar panels and rows of wind turbines.

Appalachian is seeking SCC approval to acquire a solar farm in Pittsylvania County and to purchase electricity from three others in Bedford Louisa and Rockingham counties. The plan also calls for the company to own a wind farm in Logan County Illinois and a solar farm in Berkeley County West Virginia among other things.

All that would cost $32 million which would be recovered through a rate increase. The average residential customer would pay an extra $2.37 a month in the upcoming rate year according to SCC documents.

Appalachian warns that abiding by the law will cost its ratepayers much more in the coming years.

The Clean Economy Act requires the investor-owned utility to provide all carbon-free electricity to its approximately 540000 Virginia customers by 2050 five years after the deadline for the state’s other large provider Dominion Energy to meet the same mandate.

Change comes slowly

For as long as Appalachian has served about 1 million customers in Virginia West Virginia and Tennessee the bulk of its electricity has come from burning coal which produces the most greenhouse gas emissions of its sources.

As of Sept. 30 coal accounted for 64.5% of the power generated or purchased by the utility according to Appalachian spokeswoman Teresa Hall. Natural gas the second most polluting fuel represented another 19.1%.

The remaining 16.4% came predominantly from hydroelectric power produced by dams like the one at Smith Mountain Lake and wind farms all of which are located in other states.

Appalachian currently does not use enough industrial-scale solar energy to register in the breakdown. The company’s first venture into the field went online last year when it began to purchase power from the Leatherwood solar farm in Henry County. That facility has a capacity of 20 megawatts or enough to power about 3600 homes.

The utility’s total capacity is about 6000 megawatts; roughly two-thirds of that is generated by the two coal-fired plants in West Virginia.

Change is coming but it won’t happen quickly.

“There are many factors that determine whether it is economical to invest in and continue to operate a generating facility including the cost to operate the units and the costs of replacement capacity and energy” Hall wrote in an email in response to questions from The Roanoke Times about why the coal plants are not being phased out faster.

“While we considered various alternatives those options would be impractical expensive and not in the best interest of customers” the email stated.

Recognizing that utilities can’t turn on a dime when restructuring their operations the Clean Economy Act sets benchmarks for the gradual transformation to all carbon-free electricity by 2050.

Over the next three years Appalachian plans to purchase or acquire 500 megawatts of wind and solar energy. By 2040 the company expects its solar capacity to reach 3300 megawatts combined with nearly that much from wind.

Other steps include developing energy storage and the use of renewable energy certificates which are essentially the currency for the green energy market.

A renewable energy certificate which is a legal entitlement to 1 megawatt hour of electricity from a non-fossil fuel source can come from an Appalachian-owned facility or be purchased from a third-party generator on an open market.

The owner of such a certificate then “retires” it which is how compliance with the Clean Economy Act is measured.

Moving away from coal

In the current global discussion of climate change and how to slow it down coal-fired power plants are from another century. The Amos facility began operating in the early 1970s followed a decade later by Mountaineer.

That was before the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency imposed regulations meant to curb pollution from coal.

Last August the SCC approved a rate increase that Appalachian said was needed upgrade the two plants’ coal ash disposal methods and treatments of flue emissions. Those improvements required by the EPA will allow the facilities to remain in operation until 2028.

The commission balked at a higher rate increase to cover more work which would provide additional surface water protections that is needed to extend the lifespans of Amos and Mountaineer to 2040.

However the SCC gave Appalachian a second shot at its proposal which would require additional study. That process is still in limbo — meaning that the retirement dates of the plants could change which in turn would impact how much renewable power would have to be acquired and how quickly.

For now Appalachian is planning to take the required steps to keep the plants burning coal until 2040 according to William Castle the company’s director of regulatory services.

Company officials point out that the West Virginia Public Service Commission has already allowed both plants to keep running through 2040.

When pressed on cross-examination at last week’s SCC hearing for details on the plants Castle testified that “a lot could happen” that would change plans to keep them in service.

Appalachian does not have any coal plants in Virginia. It closed the Glen Lyn plant in Giles County about 10 years ago and converted the Clinch River plant in Russell County to burn natural gas.

Should the company be moving faster to do the same in West Virginia?

“It would be too simplistic to say we want these two coal-fired power plants to close as soon as possible” said Peter Anderson Virginia policy director of Appalachian Voices one of about a half-dozen organizations and businesses participating in the SCC case.

“The climate science demands that we decarbonize our power sector sooner than mid-century but fairness compels us to ensure that we do it at least cost while keeping the lights on and providing new economic opportunities for the communities that rely on the existing infrastructure” Anderson said in a written statement.

Nationally coal accounted for just 21.8% of the generation by electric utilities in 2021 according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

At 64.5% Appalachian “is far behind many other utilities of comparable size in terms of its transition to clean energy resources” Anderson said. Part of the reason is that about half of the utility’s service area is in West Virginia he said which does not have a mandatory clean energy standard.

With Virginia’s law less than two years old it will take more time to have a substantial effect.

The cost of green power

How Appalachian intends to pay for its renewable energy became a major issue as testimony began Thursday in the SCC hearing.

Rather than determine the actual costs of wind and solar farms as the basis for its proposed rate increases Appalachian is using a new framework that calculates their value based on future demand forecasts.

Such forecasts are “wildly speculative” John Walker an attorney for a steering committee of the Virginia Municipal League and the Virginia Association of Counties said in his opening statements.

“The financial stakes are high for Appalachian ratepayers” said Walker whose clients include 10 cities 30 counties and about 50 towns that are located in the utility’s service territory.

Although the financial impact for the coming rate year does not seem drastic — an extra $2.37 on the bill for an average residential customer who consumes 1000 kilowatt hours per month — critics say Appalachian’s calculations could lock in future rate increases at excessive levels.

“These errors would continue under Apco’s plan year after year after year” Walker said. “This plan simply does not provide transparency and clarity and that is very important to ratepayers.”

Castle acknowledged in his testimony that the utility is not using its traditional cost recovery methods. But with the Clean Economy Act he testified “we’re in a different era now.”

At the beginning of the hearing Appalachian attorney Noelle Coates suggested that the parties involved in the case form a working group to address cost issues that are expected to linger.

Whatever the final price tag is for renewable energy it will be the latest in a series of increases for Appalachian customers.

The SCC approved three major rate increases last year — one to recover transmission costs a second to pay for environmental upgrades to the Amos and Mountaineer plants and the third to cover the higher cost of coal and natural gas — that amount to about $16 a month for the average residential customer.

Those increases followed a denial by the regulatory agency in November 2020 of a base rate hike that would have boosted the monthly bill by another $10. Appalachian has appealed that ruling to the Virginia Supreme Court. The high court heard oral arguments in the case March 1; an opinion is expected in the coming weeks.

In SCC filings the company has said the Clean Economy Act could lead to rate increases as high as 55% by 2035 but added that it’s difficult to make long-term predictions.

Utilities like Appalachian and Dominion are driven by the desire to earn a profit Anderson said so it’s up to the SCC to ensure they do not overbuild or choose more expensive options.

“It’s simply unfair to ask ratepayers to cover more than the minimum costs of the energy transition” he said.

The public’s right to know

The SCC public record contains thousands of pages of pre-filed testimony reports and other documents that delve into the complicated process of complying with the Clean Economy Act.

Out of public view however is some financial information that has been placed under seal at Appalachian’s request.

The projected cost of resources such as solar and wind farms and how much Appalachian has offered to purchase them is “extraordinarily sensitive information” that should be kept confidential the company says.

Release of the information would cause “irreparable harm not only to Appalachian and its customers and to the developers but also to the competitive solicitation process in Virginia as a whole” Appalachian’s attorneys wrote in SCC filings.

The Virginia Attorney General’s Office of Consumer Counsel which is a participant in the case sees it differently.

“Customers and the public have a right to know basic ‘cost information’ related to generation facilities that customers will pay for” Assistant Attorney General Mitch Burton wrote in a motion asking the SCC to lift its protective order.

Burton took issue with Appalachian’s concerns that releasing the information might enable bidders for its projects to raise their asking prices to the detriment of its customers.

“The argument seems to go we need to charge customers higher rates but we must keep the underlying ‘cost information’ for the higher rates secret because if not we will have to charge customers even higher rates” Burton wrote.

Hearing examiner Mary Beth Adams will rule on the Attorney General’s motion later and for now the information remains confidential.

The SCC hearing continued late into Friday afternoon and will resume Monday. In past cases hearing examiners have allowed participants to file written briefs before they issue a final order.

Every year the process will repeat itself as Appalachian state regulators and other groups involved in the proceedings make adjustments to the blueprint to become carbon-free.

Then the next day it fell 11%.

This shouldn’t come as much of a surprise as global markets — and energy prices including for gasoline — have been seesawing and on the rise in recent months. But it is enough reason to give readers an update on where things stand and what you may want to do for your heating bills.

More:February's natural gas prices shot back up; here's some advice| Betty Lin-Fisher

Last fall with forecasts that natural gas prices were soaring for the winter and probably about a year I suggested to readers that it was time to come off the Standard Choice Offer or SCO which is based on a state-approved formula. For many years we have enjoyed close to wholesale rates at historic lows.

More:Betty Lin-Fisher: Let's put the recent increase in natural gas prices into perspective

So in many ways we got spoiled and comfortable with prices. In 2021 for instance the SCO had a low of $2.62 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) in January and was in the $3 range through July when it started to creep up into the $4 range in September.

Experts were putting into perspective that while prices were “soaring” into the $5 and $6 range there were some years in the last two decades when we were paying as much as $10 to $16/mcf.

The price of natural gas on the New York Mercantile Exchange is finicky. It also often relies on the level of gas storage and the weather — and global events like the war in Ukraine.

The SCO had a high of $6.35 in November but then there was “blip” in January when the price went down to $4.17/mcf partially because we had a mild winter. Then we got walloped with a lot of snow and prices continued their earlier predicted upward march.

The SCO for bills from April 12 through May 11 is $5.52/mcf when rounded up to the nearest cent. That’s up from $4.72/mcf in March and down from $6.42/mcf in February.

Except for the blip in January and the historic high this week the markets and natural gas prices have been following forecasts and trends that they would be rising said Dave Jankowski NOPEC chief marketing and communications officer. NOPEC is a large aggregator or bulk buyer with more than 430000 gas customers in Summit County (including Cuyahoga Falls and many northern communities) as well as some communities in Medina and Portage counties. It also aggregates electricity.

We went into the winter with a five-year low in natural gas supply in the ground he said. But weather always plays a key role in pricing and we’ve had lots of ups and downs in our weather this year Jankowski said.

When you put all that together with gas producers trying to figure out if they should drill more it causes uncertainty in the market he said.

“Production has not caught up with demand” he said. “I don’t think we’re going to have a clear picture (on pricing) until we have some forecasts about how hot it is going to be this summer” since more electric plants rely on natural gas for air conditioning supply he said.

While there is the perception that the war in Ukraine is also causing havoc in the markets — and any global issues do impact the global markets and prices — Jankowski said that is more perception than reality.

Contracts for liquefied natural gas to go overseas are set long in advance so there is not an immediate impact on supply now because of the war he said. “But it’s adding to the volatility globally.""

The U.S Energy Information Administration in its April 12 short-term outlook remained on track with earlier forecasts that prices should stabilize by later this year or next year.

So what should I do?

Last fall I suggested people get off the SCO and find a good fixed rate and evaluate any aggregation groups. There were many different choices.

So there isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer to what you should do now. But here’s some guidance:

If you locked into a good fixed rate in the fall and are still on that rate for a while you are in good shape. I was able to get a very good $2.49/mcf rate for 11 months in October with a $50 cancellation fee. I know that was a short-lived offer — some readers got it and others at the time got some other contracts in the $3 range. As the months passed the cheapest fixed rates for those who wanted to lock in were starting to creep up to the mid-$4 range.

Fixed rates on the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio’s Apples to Apples chart — www.energychoice.ohio.gov — are mostly high which is not a surprise. The cheapest is a $4.99 fixed rate for 24 months but it has a $200 cancellation fee. That's too hefty in my opinion. The cheapest fixed rate without a cancellation fee is Direct Energy at $5.59/mcf for 32 months. The phone number if you want this rate is 877-698-7551 or you can find it on the Apples to Apples chart. I am reluctant to have people lock into a rate that is higher than the SCO of $5.52/mcf. But it is also possible that next month’s SCO and future SCOs continue to rise based on forecasts. If you do take this rate there is no cancellation fee so you can keep an eye on other rates if you want to switch. It takes up to two months for any switch.

If you live or have a small business in the city of Akron the aggregation with Constellation Energy is about to move into its $4.06 fixed rate starting with May billing through November 2024. That is a very good price given where we are now. In the fall I was not in favor of the Akron rate since it was going to mirror the higher SCO rates through the winter months when people use the most gas though I said the fixed rate was decent. Akron residents and small business owners are allowed to opt-in now or anytime. Call Constellation at 833-500-2738. It will take one to two billing cycles to switch over.

If you are still on the SCO or a price that is based on the SCO see if your community has an aggregation rate that's better and see if you can get in. If not you might need to lock into a fixed rate so see the first bullet point above.

or a price that is based on the SCO see if your community has an aggregation rate that's better and see if you can get in. If not you might need to lock into a fixed rate so see the first bullet point above. If you live in a NOPEC community which is a large portion of the Akron region NOPEC's default is called its program rate. Jankowski said the goal is to try to even out that price over a few months to keep prices competitive for customers. It is not always the cheapest rate but the aggregation tries to even out the risk for people. However with the volatility of prices lately the program price which is currently at $5.23/mcf has had to increase three months in a row. Jankowski said the program price would be increasing again in the next week or so due to the volatile market but he could not give the actual price.

NOPEC customers can switch among the group’s various plans without penalty. NOPEC has a variable plan which is always 2 cents below the SCO. NOPEC also has a 12-month and 24-month rate but those just last week had to be repriced and are in the $6 range so I don’t think they are an option.

If you are not currently a NOPEC customer or live in a NOPEC community and you want to join it takes some extra steps. You must first cancel any separate contract you have and return to Dominion’s SCO (once you cancel you’ll go back to Dominion automatically) and then NOPEC will send you an opt-out notice in its next mailing which is usually every other month. (You can check www.nopec.org for a full list of gas and electric communities or call 855-667-3201.)

The good news for us all is that — fingers crossed — consistent spring and summer weather is around the corner and our high heating costs are behind us. So that may help us weather these higher natural gas costs better.

As always I will keep an eye on prices and I often update my online Utility Guide which includes a lot of information about natural gas and electricity pricing monthly. That can be found at www.tinyurl.com/UtilityGuide.

Change in April bills

I go into much more nitty-gritty detail in the Utility Guide about the various parts of Dominion charges on your bill but there is one change in your April bill I want to point out.

All customers have a ""Tax Savings Credit Rider"" which began in April 2020. The credit was the result of a 2017 federal law that changed tax rates for utilities which needed to return those savings to customers. Dominion was allowed to spread those returns over a 38-year period. It started as a $5.41 per month credit which then went down to $2.61 per month with last April's bills. It is recalculated each year and this month the credit will change to $2.47 per month.

For reference if you like knowing all the details of each month's Dominion bills and watching the SCO price watch for monthly updates at this website generally early each month: www.dominionenergy.com/ohio/rates-and-tariffs/rate-schedules and choose ""Residential GSS-R"" on the first box under ""General Sales Service.""

Janea Brown

Janea Brown was insistent on downsizing for her move from Brooklyn to Los Angeles. Or at least sticking with the same amount of space as her Bushwick one-bedroom apartment. “I’m one person; I don’t need an entire house” says the creative behind @jnaydaily. But one very early morning—2 a.m. to be exact—her plan went out the window. The content creator had spotted the ideal single-family two-bedroom home in West Hollywood. Marble countertops in the kitchen oak hardwood floors—the property was a far cry from the laminate tile and beige walls most renters are used to inheriting.

The owner Chaele Cooper had gut renovated the circa-1932 Spanish Revival thinking she would be the one to care for it for decades to come. Then the pandemic hit and Cooper and her husband realized that their two-hour work commute to Burbank could be a thing of the past so they decided to list the home as a rental and move to their beach-adjacent digs in Venice (another rental property whose tenants had fled north). “I was more nervous than when I decided to knock out the kitchen wall” Cooper says of the search for the right tenant. Finding someone who would care for her beloved breakfast nook and built-in bookcases as if they were their own took time but the minute Brown applied Cooper knew she’d met the one: “She was someone who would be a custodian of the home.”



For Brown the home’s Mediterranean roots was the catalyst for trying on a more eclectic decor style. As she settled in with her best friend–turned–roommate she found herself choosing vintage rugs and olive branches in favor of her usual trailing pothos vines and quippy-phrase posters. You could say the rental is where Brown’s tastes grew up—in part due to the pandemic but also thanks to the creative freedom. “I’ve had roommates before that were very involved in the design process causing a lot of compromise” she explains. “But this time I have total control.” (Just one perk of sharing your space with a pal who gets you.)

Even as she gets ready to move out this summer Brown is still treating the place as a practice ground. “I was looking to experiment in order to find my forever pieces” she explains by which she means “furniture I won’t want to swap out every six months.” Certain items like her mustard wingback chairs from Maiden Home were instant keepers. But her antique dresser and slipcovered bed a McGee & Co. piece were late-in-the-game purchases. “I feel like I just got my bedroom where I want it and now I have to take it apart again” she says laughing. Swapping things in and out is especially tempting when the backdrop is go-with-anything white walls dressed up with old-world molding.

Across the hall in the living room another blank slate Brown found her groove quickly. “It started with the sofas” she says which took months of searching online to uncover. The cream Lulu and Georgia two-seaters also slipcovered are the dream aesthetic combo of both laid-back but put-together (although Brown doesn’t love how much fluffing they require after a Real Housewives binge). A vintage rug from Etsy protects Cooper’s beloved floors from her frequent rearranging missions while the vintage brass sconces provide the ultimate moody game night lighting.

Despite the kitchen and bathroom already being in pristine condition—Cooper ensured there were plenty of cupboards to hide the ugly stuff (even a dedicated appliance cabinet) and there’s the added luxury of soft-close drawers—Brown brought in a few additions to make the spaces feel like her own albeit temporarily.

A vintage wood stool next to the bathtub makes setting down her latest read simple and the open kitchen shelves got Brown’s signature styling treatment with decanted cooking essentials and rustic serving boards ready for a charcuterie spread.

Brown may be bidding the spot adieu—she really is downsizing this time so she can afford to live on her own—but both she and Cooper had their hesitations. “What other tenant is going to care for the features the way Janea has?” Cooper wonders. Brown will miss the abundance of storage and notched archways. But while those have to stay put Brown’s freshly refined style is carrying over to her next place. And it’s the Spanish Revival where Brown says “I cracked the code on what I love to be surrounded by.”

It was never the plan for Katy Mitchell the owner of a Victorian townhouse in West Sussex England to hire an interior designer once she got the keys last summer. But having moved with her husband Alex and their 9-year-old daughter Chloe from a 500-year-old cottage and selling most of her antiques in the process to its new owners she conceded that she needed a little help in filling their space with stylish new furniture. Not to mention as a busy working mom (she is the managing director of a commercial laundry business) Mitchell admits she just didn’t have the time or imagination to bring their new home to life herself. “Left to our own devices it would have gone in a really ordinary direction” she says.

Luckily the couple’s project manager Will Vaughan who was managing the single-story kitchen extension and renovation of the property is married to Holly Vaughan of Vaughan Design & Development. “In a very cute way the scope turned from me asking Holly ‘Can you help me sort out my furniture?’ to her saying ‘Let me design your house for you!’” says Mitchell laughing.

Right off the bat Holly pushed the envelope with her time-poor but open-minded client with blue geometric floor tiles and clashing yellow tongue-and-groove wall paneling in the foyer. “I just can’t help but smile when I see it; it’s so visually striking” notes Mitchell. They saw the adjacent kitchen-dining room as an opportunity to embrace a more classic feel. “Katy wanted Shaker-style cabinets and I’ve long loved Edward Bulmer’s Azurite Blue” explains Holly of the bold spray-painted finish. To add a touch of texture the designer clad the walls in ribbed tiles and popped out the upper cupboard fronts and replaced them with fluted-glass panels.

Holly reimagined the few pieces of furniture Mitchell and her family had saved from their previous home to chime with the new decor. That included a dated ottoman once swathed in floral Laura Ashley fabric (now it’s covered in a bouclé-like textured finish by Tibor) and a wingback armchair which she made over in a graphic Flora Soames fabric. “The print is so busy that at first I wasn’t sure” says Mitchell. Fortunately she agreed to it on a whim at the end of a very tiring week. “Now it’s one of my favorite pieces” she adds. The tranquil library is also her go-to hangout thanks to the addition of rhubarb-colored shelving: “On the days I work from home I’m in there and it always feels so fresh.”

One of the challenges Mitchell threw at Holly and Will was her need for built-ins throughout. In the entrance that took the form of a neat corner bench with lift-up storage to stash shoes and the dog’s leashes. In the main bedroom Holly embellished the wardrobes with diamond-shaped cane inserts and brass bow-shaped hardware by Beata Heuman. “I use them every day and simple touches like those handles make such a difference” says Mitchell of the elevated detail.

To keep costs down Holly and Will relied on their in-house carpenters for these bespoke projects as often as possible. The designer also embraced affordable work-arounds such as sourcing fabric for blinds from Haines Collection which sells end-of-roll and defective prints from big-name brands and having a stonemason create a charming scallop detail out of marble offcuts for the utility room’s countertop and backsplash. The dining chairs look luxe but are actually from Zara Home while the custom-made headboards are positioned on top of budget-friendly divan bases (you just can’t tell because they are hidden behind coordinating valances).

Although the project was completed more than six months ago there are still plenty of finishing touches to be added a task that Mitchell is relishing now that all the major work is done. “When I’ve got 10 minutes to spare I’ll look online for a beautiful cushion or a new lampshade” she says. And when she’s totally stumped Mitchell knows it’s always okay to ask for help.

But if like me you're a pizza die-hard then Domino's has you covered with a new option which they're pitching as the ultimate alfresco summer taste for vegetable lovers.

The Grilled Vegi Pesto pizza is available for a limited time. Made on Domino's signature base topped with tomato sauce it has a generous topping of chargrilled courgettes red green and yellow peppers tomato and red onions all finished with a pesto drizzle.

All of which sounded lovely in theory when it arrived at my door. Opening the box it looked the closest to healthy a takeaway pizza could get unless you're talking about those pizzas where restaurants cut a hole of the good stuff out and fill it with rocket although really what's the point? Boasting the usual golden base optimum amount of crisp piping hot crust and generous portion of cheese it definitely looked tempting.

The vegetable pieces were cut up into generous chunks and there were actual chargrill marks on the pieces. It looked wonderful practically bursting with vitamins and had a definite herby smell that smelled fresh and enticing. I was genuinely wondering if my usual veggie option of choice would be being kicked to the kerb for the duration of the Grilled Vegi Pesto's stay.

And then my husband and I both took a slice. As a firm devotee of the Mighty Meaty the Vegi Pesto was always going to be pushing at a closed door for him so his grumpy reaction after gingerly taking a bite of grimacing and saying: ""Well that was an affront to nature"" was not a huge surprise.

However as someone who not only views Domino's as her pizza takeaway of choice but will always pick a veggie option as her ideal pizza (Veggie Supreme with additional BBQ sauce on the base don't judge until you've tried it) I was expecting to love the new addition to Domino's menu much more than I did.

I have learned two things from the introduction of the Grilled Vegi Pesto. Firstly courgette does not belong on pizza. I'm not a huge fan at the best of times but I found the slightly slimy consistency of it particularly paired with the pesto drizzle just unappealing.

And that brings us on to the pesto drizzle. I love pesto. I love the smell of it and how fresh it tastes. But this really didn't do it for me. The aroma was great but when you actually tasted it the consistency was actively off-putting. And while you got a bit of a herby flavour from the topping the main taste I was left with was the grilled courgette. It was not a happy taste.

If you love courgette and goodness knows someone has to then you should order the Grilled Vegi Pesto because for lovers of all things squash this is basically your every pizza dream come true.

But while pesto and pizza are both up there as among my favourite foods they aren't a marriage made in heaven. Perhaps it's me. No matter how much I love certain things merging them together often brings me disappointment.

I love chocolate and I love beer but chocolate beer ruined them both. The only exception is Fierce's Maple Pancake Beer which took three things I love - maple syrup pancakes and beer - and made one of the most delicious nectars I've ever had the joy of sampling so maybe they just need a third flavour in the mix. Or in Domino's case to remove some of the courgette.

All was not lost with my takeaway though because Domino's has not just added a new pizza to its menu this week - they've bought back what was basically a Christmas highlight in our house the After Eight Cookies.

We ordered these by accident when they were part of Domino's festive menu and were not convinced by how they looked - let's face it it's very hard to make a cocoa flavoured cookie filled with the After Eight mint fondant look particularly tempting.

But don't judge a book by its cover. Everything you would hope pesto would bring to the table in terms of banging flavour aroma and zing comes in bucketloads with the peppermint essence of After Eight goodness.

Crisp on the outside gooey and warm in the middle and with a peppermint punch this went a long way to redress the balance for non-courgette lovers. And we will be happily adding it to our regular Domino's order for as long as it's available.

Whether you want to brave the courgettes or stick with your favourite Domino's has launched a new Tasty Twosome delivery deal two get two medium pizzas for £19.99. Meanwhile if you collect in person you can get any pizza any size for buy one get one free perfect for a weekend family treat.

'Dominoes' by Station House Opera takes the simplest of ideas as its starting point… a line of dominoes. Thousands of breezeblocks are used to create a moving sculpture which traverses the city unfolding over the course of the day.

On streets through parks buildings and even on water occasionally disappearing and then resurfacing sometimes pausing for sculptural performances the domino line threads its way through historical and everyday parts of the city linking its diverse communities in a symbolic as well as physical chain of cause and effect.

Dominoes is a mass participation event and will need more than 200 volunteers on Friday 13 May to come together to line-up over 7000 aerated breezeblocks through the city. The installation will travel through Norwich City Centre starting at Anglia Square and finishing at The Forum.

The Dominoes volunteers are key to making all of this happen. Each taking ownership of a section of the route and working together to ensure the tumbling dominoes continue on their winding journey. Although the fall starts at 6:00pm the real Dominoes experience begins at 11am as the team comes together to make this extraordinary event happen.

The project will bring the Norwich and Norfolk community together through participation and engagement. Hundreds of volunteers and audience members will gather together to make this exceptional and unique event.

Norfolk & Norwich Festival’s Volunteer Officer Vikki Nelson said: “We really value the time and effort our volunteers give us each year at the Festival. We have volunteers from around Norfolk of different ages and occupations who come together as a team to help us deliver our events and welcome our audiences.

""Dominoes will be a joyful celebration with thousands of people taking to the streets to help open our 250th anniversary festival.”

Dominoes will launch Norfolk & Norwich Festival’s 250th anniversary programme which will see installations exhibitions gigs cabaret and circus presented on beaches in churches at pop-up venues chapels art centres in car parks and through the streets across the county from King’s Lynn Great Yarmouth to Diss and Sheringham and throughout Norwich.

Festival Gardens will be a place to eat drink and gather for the duration with al fresco performances from local artists as well as international performances in the Adnams Spiegeltent. Transforming the city and county each May for 17 days the 2022 edition of the Festival runs 13 - 29 May.

If you would like to join the team and help build the 2 km route made up of over 7000 domino blocks you should be over 18 available on Friday 13 from 11am to 7pm and able to attend a training briefing on Tuesday 10 or Wednesday 11 May 6pm - 8pm.

Now the Wonder Woman star has put an official stamp on the relationship by appearing in the status brand’s latest ad campaign.

And this isn’t just any campaign; it’s the first set of Tiffany & Co. ad images devoted exclusively to its Blue Book collection the house’s designation for its one-of-a-kind high-jewelry designs that represent the pinnacle of handcraft and which are typically purchased by private clients around the globe. Gadot shot the campaign in Los Angeles in October 2021 with photographer Dan Jackson whose other clients include Dior Helmut Lang and Armani Fragrances.

Dubbed Botanica Tiffany & Co.’s 2022 high-jewelry Blue Book collection indeed puts a focus on nature themes. Among the standout pieces from the collection is the “Dandelion” necklace a transformable design that can be worn five different ways starting with a medallion pendant that resembles the flower in its late stages before its feathery white seeds disperse in the wind. Because high jewelry often showcases significant stones the medallion features a round brilliant diamond totaling more than 12 carats at its center. An emerald-cut aquamarine totaling more than 31 carats also is offered in the set and can be worn on either the included baguette-diamond choker or long diamond-accented chain necklace.

“This was one of my favorite campaigns to shoot” Gadot tells The Hollywood Reporter exclusively. “I’ve never seen anything quite as stunning as the Botanica Dandelion necklace we shot. Tiffany’s diamonds and craftsmanship are truly unparalleled.”

Gadot is also seen in the collection’s “Thistle” necklace which contrasts pyramid-cut Australian sapphires set to resemble the spiky texture of the titular flower with the platinum hue of a sizable South Sea pearl all set in platinum. Gadot also wears an orchid-inspired brooch (seen above) that blends petals embellished with rose-cut diamonds set in platinum with a brushstroke detail of 18-karat yellow gold; in the center of the orchid sits a pear-shaped diamond of more than three carats. A diamond-adorned stem meanwhile can be removed so the brooch can be worn as a pendant.

“It’s such an honor to be included in this Tiffany campaign” Gadot adds. “The pieces I am wearing from the 2022 Blue Book collection Botanica are some of my favorites as they are inspired by the most beautiful flowers: the dandelion and orchid.”

Completing the campaign is a selection of images in which Gadot wears pieces by Jean Schlumberger the famed jewelry designer who created some of the house’s most celebrated designs — including the iconic “Bird on a Rock” brooch — between 1956 and his retirement in the late 1970s.

Gal Gadot shoots her new high-jewelry campaign for Tiffany & Co. Tiffany & Co.

This is far from Gadot’s first experience with unique pieces from the Tiffany & Co. collection. As a presenter at the 2021 Golden Globe Awards she wore a Blue Book necklace that featured an emerald-cut bicolor zoisite that totaled more than 48 carats and was set on a lengthy diamond-set chain of 18-karat yellow gold.

But in Gadot’s most recent film the Kenneth Branagh-directed Death on the Nile the actress wore a re-creation of what is indisputably the most famous piece in the house’s archives: the Tiffany Diamond a 128.54-carat cushion-cut yellow diamond featuring 82 facets and set on a diamond-embellished necklace. Lady Gaga wore the genuine article to the 2019 Academy Awards while the famed jewel also has adorned the necks of Audrey Hepburn in a publicity photo for 1961’s Breakfast at Tiffany’s and Beyoncé in a 2021 Tiffany & Co. campaign.

All of which is to say Gadot is in good company. “Gal Gadot is more than a house ambassador. She epitomizes the effortless glamour sheer sophistication and sense of modernity that Blue Book represents” said Alexandre Arnault executive vice president of product and communication for Tiffany & Co. in a statement. “We are thrilled that she is the face of the new Botanica campaign.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Since then our pioneering collaboration has resulted in Dow’s 2025 Valuing Nature Goal and the development of tools and processes that are helping Dow and other organizations systematically factor nature and its value into business decisions.

In 2020 Dow and The Nature Conservancy again came together to ask an important question: What’s next? How do we continue to evolve our work beyond the 2025 nature goal? Together we started to look at biodiversity and how it is a critical part of valuing nature. Now using some of the same proven approaches that advanced our work in valuing nature we are developing scientifically credible tools and strategies for assessing biodiversity and investing in projects that help restore and conserve critical watersheds. Looking at priority areas for Dow such as water carbon and biodiversity we identified the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Mississippi River watershed as critical to our efforts and we are working with The Nature Conservancy on specific projects in this region such as the Loch Leven Restoration Project in Louisiana.

Recently we talked to Jennifer Molnar managing director and lead scientist for The Nature Conservancy’s Center for Sustainability Science for her thoughts on how businesses can better manage and account for biodiversity.

Guest columnist

It’s been 12 years since an explosion on BP’s Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico killed 11 crew members and injured 17. The disaster that began on April 20 lasted for five months. It was the largest marine oil spill in history. Almost five million barrels of oil created a 57000-square-mile oil slick that polluted 1100 miles of shoreline.

Ultimately government scientists found BP responsible for the disaster. More recently University of South Florida scientists found petroleum hydrocarbons in all fish species at levels two to three times higher than elsewhere in the Gulf. It’s projected that it will take 50 to 100 years for the deep ocean ecosystem to recover.

This is the legacy of a polluting energy system. We cannot let this happen again. Florida’s economy is tied to our beautiful beaches so there’s much at stake.

That’s why it’s important that after a two-year hiatus due to the COVID pandemic Hands Across the Sand will take place at several Florida locations on May 21. Please join your neighbors. Find the site closest to you at their website.

The good news is that we don’t have to drill. We have alternatives — electric vehicles — so why would we risk our tourism-based economy?

Anyone who watches Super Bowl ads knows that the major automakers have announced plans to electrify large portions of their fleets most notably the popular F-150 Lightning. In fact two models of the truck sold out before even hitting the dealerships.

It’s expected there will be over 100 models of electric vehicles (EVs) available by the end of 2024. EVs don’t use gas or need oil changes. They’ll likely save you money. Consumer Reports finds that typical ownership savings over the life of most EVs ranges from $6000 to $10000.

Growing Infrastructure:RESTORE grant helps Santa Rosa Gulf Breeze keep pace with growing infrastructure stress

Offshore drilling:Bill to permanently ban offshore oil drilling in Gulf of Mexico reintroduced in U.S. House

Floridians are jumping on board. The sunshine state is the nation’s second largest market for EVs.

While we are making progress it’s of grave concern to see what longtime environmental reporter Bruce Ritchie of Politico wrote about a meeting between Mike Sommers president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute and state leaders in Tallahassee.

Sommers told the Economic Club of Florida that more access to oil on public lands and faster permitting is needed to combat rising gas prices and provide energy security. After the speech he said his group asked Florida officials to undo a state constitutional amendment protecting state waters and revoke a 2020 offshore drilling ban signed by then-President Donald Trump in an executive order.

Have we not learned our lesson? Anyone who cares about this state our beautiful beaches and wildlife should be up in arms.

Let your voice be heard at Hands Across the Sand. It’s an annual event that started after the BP oil spill. It’s where as a community we stand and say NO to offshore oil drilling. We say NO to dirty fuels and YES to clean energy. This isn't about politics it's about protecting our oceans and marine life our coastal environment and our coastal economies. It’s a true grassroots movement.

Historically Florida has stood strong against offshore drilling but we have seen the oil industry’s influence take hold before. In 2009 the Florida House of Representatives — after receiving campaign contributions from oil drillers — voted 70-43 to lift the ban on drilling in state waters nine miles to the shore. That protection had been in place for two decades. As a result Floridians voted to add a state constitutional amendment in 2018 to codify this safeguard.

Worse than thought:'Invisible' and 'toxic' oil made the Deepwater Horizon spill worse than thought study says

Additional settlment:Florida receives additional $73 million from Deepwater Horizon settlement

As to federal waters — 10 miles and beyond — offshore drilling has been banned off Florida since 2006 through a series of time-limited federal moratoriums. The current one expires in June. Just before the 2020 election former President Trump extended the ban by executive order for an additional 10 years until 2032.

But executive orders can be changed. We need a permanent ban on drilling. So let’s stand together on May 21st and tell the American Petroleum Institute that there’s no need to risk our precious beaches with dirty oil drilling. We have cheaper and cleaner options. Drive Electric!

Is the price going up down or sideways? Simple enough. But looking at something in isolation only reveals part of the story. If a bank is down 20% from its highs but the rest of the bank sector is down 40% you would call this a relative winner.

Look at a chart of the FANMAG stocks and you’ll see that they peaked in November 2021 and have given up all of their gains back to September 2020. But once you compare the tech giants to the S&P 500 an entirely new image emerges. You can see that their relative performance peaked in July 2020 and all of their outperformance since the summer of 2018 has vanished.

There are two different markets right now; Companies that got the benefit of low rates versus companies that can handle rising rates. It’s all one trade and the simplest visual to express this trade is short duration bonds versus long ones.

Short-term rates have risen more and faster than long ones but the latter is more sensitive to them. This is why long-term bonds can see a fraction of the rate increase and four times the destruction as shorter-term ones. 3-7 year bonds are in a 10% drawdown while zero-coupon bonds are down 36% from their highs.

And this is what’s driving the market. When rates rise and inflation is high investors are more sensitive to earnings today versus the potential of great earnings in the future. That’s why long-duration stocks are getting killed while cash-flow rich companies are holding up okay.

Nobody has time for disruptive technology during uncertain times when the incumbents are tried and true. We roughly know what JPMorgan is going to do and look like in the next couple of years whether or not a recession comes. Buy now pay later is cool and all but the business model is unproven and investors aren’t willing to subsidize losses when money actually costs something.

Here’s more of the same.

IBM might not be growing like it used to but it still generated >$8 billion in free cash flow last quarter with $700 million hitting the bottom line. Robinhood burned through $400 million in cash and lost nearly $1 billion. Investors are like “Umm yeah we’re not doing that anymore.”

In an inflationary environment consumers and investors value physical items. CF Industries one of the largest producers of fertilizers is up 36% on the year. Facebook I mean Meta is down 45%.

One of the areas of the market that’s most sensitive to rising rates is homebuilder stocks. While they’re down 20 and 30% build-to-rent names like Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent are basically flat on the year. Absolute duds but relative home runs.

On the podcast this week I spoke about how Disney was flat since 2015. I know the challenges that Disney has gone through and continues to struggle with but seven years of no returns really blew my mind. And then I saw Jim Bianco tweet this and my head almost exploded. Disney has underperformed the S&P 500 since the inception of SPY (1993) and basically on every other time frame as well.

Some people might see this and say “This is why you shouldn’t pick individual stocks.” I get that and I mostly agree. Disney is one of the most iconic companies in the world and even that wasn’t good enough to beat the index. But for me the more salient point is to diversify. Don’t put all of your eggs in one basket. It’s okay to buy actively managed mutual funds but I wouldn’t recommend putting your entire net worth in three or four stocks.

The market isn’t fun right now and it’s all being driven by interest rates inflation and the fear of a slowing economy. That’s the bad news. The good news and I’m admittedly reaching here is that a lot of stocks already got pancaked. Meanwhile nobody is bullish and good things tend to happen when most investors think they can’t.

Next week is a huge one for earnings which certainly feels like a make-or-break moment for the markets. We’ll hear from Google Facebook Microsoft Apple and Amazon as well as D.R. Horton and Chipotle and Caterpillar. If you want to listen to earnings calls like a podcast check out the Quartr App it’s terrific. Slides embedded in the app 1.5x speed skip to Q&A fuhgeddaboutit.

But the soaring cost of fossil fuels and unexpected disruptions in energy security are now supercharging what was already a torrid pace of growth in solar wind and battery storage projects.

IEEFA predicted last year that wind solar and hydro’s share of the U.S. electric power market would approach 30 percent by the end of 2026. IEEFA now believes the forecast reflected the low end of possible growth given the significant acceleration in expected solar and wind (particularly offshore) capacity installations through 2026. We now expect that clean energy’s share of the electric generation market could hit 33 percent or more. Together with existing nuclear generation this would push the U.S. share of carbon-free electricity to well over 50 percent—a massive transition from just five years ago.

Some of the most notable recent developments include:

Construction has begun on the first two commercial-scale offshore wind farms in the U.S. which has lagged far behind development efforts in Europe. A recent federal lease auction brought in a record $4.4 billion for development areas off the New Jersey/New York coasts and underscored investor enthusiasm for the resource’s economic potential over the coming decade. Offshore wind will have an increasing impact on power markets up and down the East Coast.

A significant shift among several of the largest traditionally coal-based utilities to completely move away from the fuel. Georgia Power Duke Energy and the Tennessee Valley Authority have all recently embraced plans for a 2035 coal plant phaseout.

An end to the decade-long run of annual increases of gas-fired electric generation. IEEFA projected last year that the increase in gas-fired capacity had plateaued; we now think that total annual gas-fired electricity generation has peaked as well. IEEFA believes that gas-fired generation in the U.S. peaked in 2020 and we expect it to decline this year and into the future as rapid growth in solar and wind output displaces both coal and gas generation. The challenges for gas have been exacerbated by the recent runup in prices and growing concerns about methane emissions from gas production and distribution which significantly reduce the fuel’s supposed environmental benefits.

Corporate renewable energy demand is climbing quickly as American businesses embrace net-zero goals pushed by consumer demand higher electricity prices and the rise in fossil fuel costs. This could drive the construction of as much as 94 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2030.

Real-world experience and research increasingly show that high levels of green energy with battery storage can be integrated into the U.S. power grid while maintaining system reliability. A recent report from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory concluded that with sufficient storage renewable generation (including solar wind hydropower geothermal and biofuel resources) could meet as much as 94% of demand on an annual basis with “no unserved energy and low reserve violations indicating no concerns about hourly load balancing through the end year of 2050.”[1]

The compelling economics and proven reliability of renewable energy and storage have changed perceptions in utility and corporate boardrooms across the U.S. driving a buildout of wind and solar generation portfolios and prompting businesses and consumers to push for greater access to green energy. With fossil fuel price volatility and energy security currently among the top concerns of executives and policymakers IEEFA finds the energy transition is tipping even more strongly toward renewables and battery storage and expects this trend will continue to drive fossil fuels out of the power market.

Sierra Madre’s Earth Day celebrations began with the ribbon cutting for its Photovoltaic Solar Array.

By Kate Bartlett

The overnight rain produced a glistening San Gabriel Mountains backdrop and a shiny two-acre solar array for the ribbon cutting ceremonies on the morning of April 22 2022 the 52nd anniversary of Earth Day. Attending the ceremony were representatives of Sierra Madre: Mayor Gene Goss President Pro Tem Edward Garcia City Manager Jose Reynoso Council Members Rachelle Arizmendi Kelly Kriebs and Robert Parkhurst Management Analyst James Carlson and other representatives of the City. Mayor Goss made the initial comments and introductions and Councilmember Parkhurst described the history of the project.

The City was honored by remarks by U.S. Congresswoman Judy Chu State Senator Anthony Portantino L. A. County Supervisor Kathryn Barger Ann Marie Hickambottom representing Assemblymember Chris Holden and Miles Prince a Director of the San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District. Ted Bardacke Executive Director of the Clean Power Alliance also was present.

Robert Parkhurst became interested in the solar array project before he was on the City Council; the project has since received the support of seven members of the City Council and two mayors. It is now stewarded by Jose Reynoso who was Sierra Madre’s Director of Utilities before being appointed City Manager. The project was contracted in 2019 with Direct Solar/Duke Energy and construction began in January 2022. It is located at 611 East Sierra Madre Boulevard near the groundwater replenishment basins City Yard and water productions facilities.

The fixed-tilt photovoltaic solar array with anti-reflective technology absorbs sunlight and converts it into electricity. It is estimated that the project will offset nearly 555 kWh of energy from the City’s water production facility with a 111 KW battery energy storage system saving 38% of the energy used in the production and distribution of the City’s water supply eliminating 693 tons of carbon emissions and saving 1457 barrels of oil per year.

Each of the speakers applauded Sierra Madre’s role as a leader in addressing climate crisis issues. The City is a founding member of the Clean Power Alliance a Joint Powers Authority of 32 communities across Los Angeles and Ventura counties that are purchasing their own renewable energy. Director Prince noted the willingness of the city to partner with others and explore new and innovative means to offset the pressures on resources. Supervisor Barger described these projects as chipping away at the challenges of the climate crises. Congresswoman Chu congratulated the City on prioritizing a renewable energy project and Senator Portantino described the cumulative effect of projects such as this by quoting Mother Teresa: ‘I alone cannot change the world but I can cast a stone across the waters to create many ripples.’

If the glass breaks it is engineered to not break into dangerous sharp shards. By tuning the composition and structure of automobile glass manufacturers produce a rugged safety material that provides drivers and passengers with a clear view of their surroundings while controlling the cabin temperature and acoustics as well as the vehicle’s weight and energy efficiency. But this complex engineering makes the material challenging to recycle compared with other types of glass. Companies are finding ways to overcome these challenges and reduce the environmental impact of this multibillion-dollar industry.

Earlier this year Riley Leon made headlines when he survived a tornado that flung his pickup truck across a highway. His story highlights the safety engineering that goes into automotive glass.

On March 21 Leon was driving along US Route 290 in Elgin Texas when tornado winds topping 210 km/h knocked over his pickup truck spun it round and round and eventually uprighted it. Despite the violent thrashing that heavily damaged the truck and blew out some windows Leon received little more than minor scratches. That was in part because the windshield and rear window remained intact preventing him from being ejected from the vehicle or injured by a collapsing cabin frame. Those protective features are engineered into the truck’s safety glass.

Safety is one of several design needs of glass for automobiles. The glass has to be optically clear to provide drivers and passengers with an undistorted view of their surroundings but it also needs to selectively transmit light to help drivers see clearly without squinting and to keep the interior cool on hot sunny days. It needs to be strong to resist high-speed winds and impacts from small stones during highway driving. Windshields and sunroofs in particular must be structurally rugged to support the cabin frame and prevent the roof from buckling and harming passengers during rollovers. And if the glass does break the pieces should remain in the window frame or break into small rounded chunks not large jagged shards that can cut maim or kill the occupants. The glass also must be as light as possible to maximize fuel efficiency must control the acoustics for cabin comfort and should provide various tints and colors for aesthetics and privacy.

Tailoring glass to affordably provide all these functionalities requires striking the right balance among glass properties says Thibaut Heitz director of R&D at Paris-based Saint-Gobain Sekurit a multinational glass company. To achieve this custom combination of properties glass scientists and engineers fine-tune the material’s composition and further tailor its properties through tempering chemical strengthening laminating coating and other procedures.

As a result automotive glass manufacturing is complicated. It’s also growing. Worldwide manufacturers produced an average of roughly 90 million passenger cars and commercial vehicles per year in the past 10 years according to the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers. Industry watchers predict that number will grow steadily in the next decade. As it does the global automotive glass market will also grow almost doubling from approximately $15.5 billion in 2021 to $31.1 billion in 2028 according to Fortune Business Insights a market analysis firm. The size of the market is driving recyclers to create innovative ways to reclaim waste auto glass and turn it into valuable products thereby reducing this industry’s environmental footprint. The various manufacturing steps that tailor automotive glass and provide it with a unique combination of properties present special recycling challenges but ones that the industry is working to overcome.

Glass composition

Like glass used for making bottles jars and ordinary building windows the glass found in cars trucks and buses is known as soda-lime glass. It’s the most common type and accounts for roughly 90% of all manufactured glass. The material’s main ingredients include sand as an abundant source of silica sodium carbonate (soda ash) and calcium carbonate (limestone). To form glass manufacturers blend the raw ingredients and feed them to a furnace that heats the mixture above 1500 °C forming a molten material that is shaped into bottles or other products as it cools.

Not all soda-lime glass looks alike. Glassmakers generally customize the formulation to control the color which varies by application. Beer for example often comes in brown bottles to prevent unwanted photooxidation. For some homes and art displays designers may choose brilliant colorless glass made from highly purified starting materials.

For automotive applications the soda-lime glass ingredients may also include iron oxide a tinting agent that imparts a greenish color to the glass. The tint reduces light transmission into the cabin Heitz explains. This reduction makes it easier for the driver to see the road clearly in strong sunlight. The tint also helps keep the interior cool by blocking infrared (IR) wavelengths he says. A cooler cabin leads to less demand for air conditioning which reduces fuel consumption and lowers emissions of carbon dioxide in gas- and diesel-powered cars and extends driving range in electric vehicles.

Other inorganic compounds play a similar role in controlling light transmission but they impart other tint colors. Cobalt for example provides a neutral blue-gray tint. And glassmakers often use a combination of compounds containing iron manganese and selenium to produce what the industry calls privacy glass. In addition to cutting light and heat penetration and looking elegant this dark glass which is commonly found in rear windows of sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and many luxury cars offers back-seat occupants some privacy and deters theft by keeping the car’s contents out of sight.

Coating windshields and sunroofs with metal films is a highly effective but more complex way to control light and heat in the cabin says Eric Rogers of AGC (formerly Asahi Glass) a technical expert on the company’s intellectual property. In this procedure glassmakers often sputter deposit one or more nanometer-thin layers of silver separated by layers of metal oxides such as tin oxide or titanium dioxide. The thinness of the stacks allows this optically engineered structure to strongly reflect IR wavelengths thereby minimizing cabin heating without coloring the glass silver which would sacrifice visibility Rogers says.

Tempered glass for safety

Broken glass can be fatal especially during high-speed collisions when the glass can fly into the cabin or people can be thrown against a broken window. For that reason carmakers build automobiles with two types of safety glass. Side and rear windows are generally made from specially heat-treated or tempered glass. Windshields are universally made from laminated glass which has a glass-polymer sandwich structure.

Manufacturers prepare tempered glass which has been widely used in automobiles since the 1950s by heating the glass to more than 600 °C then quenching it quickly by blasting it for just a few seconds with high-pressure cold air says Michael Richardson a technical specialist in automotive glass at General Motors. The treatment makes the glass about four times as strong as ordinary annealed (slow-cooled) window glass. If it does break tempering leaves the glass prone to shattering into many small rounded pieces with relatively few sharp edges. These fragments are less likely to cut occupants than the large jagged shards that typically form when common window glass breaks.

The cold air rapidly cools molecules at the surface locking them in place in a state of high compression which strengthens the surface says Thomas Cleary an automobile glass expert at Corning. At the same time the molecules in the hot core are slower to cool and continue to vibrate freely until they do. “That leads to a density difference that sets up a tug-of-war between molecules in the core and at the surface” Cleary says. As a result of that internal tension when tempered glass breaks it rapidly explodes into tiny pieces releasing that pent-up energy.

Laminated windshields

Car safety has evolved a lot over the years. The earliest cars didn’t have windshields. Those began appearing around 1904 but they didn’t become standard equipment until more than a decade later.

The story of laminated glass for windshields dates back to 1903 when Edouard Benedictus a French artist and chemist made an unexpected observation while working in his lab. When Benedictus accidentally knocked a glass beaker to the floor he was surprised to see that the beaker broke but the pieces of glass remained together retaining the shape of the glassware. Benedictus had been working with a solution of nitrocellulose and the solution evaporated coating the glassware with a tough film that held the glass fragments in place.

At that time automobiles were growing in popularity and injuries caused by broken glass during car collisions were on the rise. Benedictus saw a way to protect motorists by making windshields from toughened polymer-coated glass that resisted shattering and stayed in the windshield frame if it did break. After a few years of development he patented a safety-glass laminate composed of two layers of plate glass that sandwiched a film of cellulose.

By 1920 a number of companies made laminated glass for windshields and other applications but early versions of this safety glass often discolored as the plastic interlayer film aged. Glass companies and carmakers found that polyvinyl butyral (PVB) resisted discoloring and within a decade several companies began using this material to laminate windshields. As a result of worldwide safety regulations implemented since the 1960s laminated windshields are now standard everywhere and although various materials have been used as interlayers PVB remains the most common one.

The basics of PVB chemistry were identified 100 years ago according to Travis Smith president of Eastman Chemical’s films division a major supplier of PVB for laminated glass. PVB remains the top choice for windshield interlayers because of its safety characteristics and optical clarity Smith says. In addition PVB can be tailored to control acoustics block solar heating and integrate displays and other electronic devices. And importantly it can be produced economically at an industrial scale he says.

To make laminated windshields manufacturers cut sheets of soda-lime glass roughly 2.5 mm thick and shape them in a furnace to fit a car’s curved windshield frame. Then they bond the glass and PVB film in a hot pressurized vessel known as an autoclave. The procedure causes the PVB to thoroughly wet the glass surface which leads to intimate mechanical contact between the layers says Alan K. Phillips Eastman’s R&D director for films. It also drives hydrogen bonding between the layers further strengthening the laminate he says. The result is a tightly bonded tough transparent material that resists shattering by flexing on impact.

Chemical strengthening also plays a role in making windshields tough. In 2017 Ford debuted a windshield made from a laminated hybrid of ordinary soda-lime glass on the car’s exterior and a thin piece of Corning’s Gorilla Glass a chemically strengthened aluminosilicate material on the interior. Corning’s Cleary explains that the strengthening in Gorilla Glass comes from ion-exchange chemistry that causes potassium ions to replace some of the sodium ions in a thin surface layer. Potassium’s large size relative to sodium leads to compressive forces that toughen the glass surface by raising roadblocks that prevent cracks from propagating.

Before introducing the hybrid windshields Ford and Corning ran various tests simulating impact with blunt and sharp stones on the glass. It took more than twice as much impact energy to form star cracks in the hybrids as it did in conventional windshields. And because the Gorilla Glass ply in 2017 was much thinner and lighter than other types of glass the windshield’s weight was cut by about 30% nearly 7 kg for some SUVs Cleary says. Since then the glass has become even thinner and lighter which reduces fuel consumption and emissions of greenhouse gases and extends driving range in electric vehicles.

Recycling challenges

Glass can be recycled repeatedly with no loss in the quality of containers windows and other products made from it. Most glass is recycled by crushing it to form cullet removing impurities and sorting by color and then blending the cullet with sand and other raw ingredients which are melted in the furnace to make new glass. Using cullet in this way reduces glass manufacturers’ need for raw materials. It also reduces the energy required to keep the furnace at temperatures high enough to generate molten glass which lowers greenhouse gas emissions and operating costs and keeps glass prices in check. Glass recyclers process tempered window glass in much the same way as container glass—crush clean sort and ship the furnace-ready cullet to manufacturers says Mark Nelson a vice president at Strategic Materials the largest cullet supplier in the US.

But the same features that make windshields tough and safe also make them difficult to recycle. By design the glass is tightly bonded to the rubbery sheet of PVB and adheres strongly even after the glass breaks Nelson says. So even though glass recyclers process many millions of metric tons of container glass annually they have traditionally recycled very few windshields. This is especially true in the US which lags far behind many countries when it comes to recycling container glass. Broken windshields often ended up in landfills.

Andela Products is a company that has developed one way to pry the materials apart. Cynthia Andela president and CEO of the company describes the method as based on a hammer-and-chisel-like approach. Equipment beats the windshield from both sides simultaneously—repeatedly and at high speed fracturing the glass and mechanically peeling it from the PVB. The stripping process yields millimeter-sized cullet and larger pieces of PVB.

Nearly all glassmakers use cullet to manufacture new products so the reclaimed windshield glass is readily recycled. What about the PVB? Shark Solutions based in Denmark is one of a handful of companies that processes broken windshields and recycles the film. The company which also operates in the US and Belgium purifies the PVB and converts it to pellets and water-based dispersions. Manufacturers use those materials to make carpet backing binders for paints adhesives fabric coatings and other industrial products.

“Interest in recycling windshields has really grown in the past few years” Andela says. People are focused on sustainability and reducing the volume of material sent to landfills. They see opportunities to recycle windshields into useful materials she says.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Eight months after winning an Olympic bronze medal on the west side of Tokyo Bay skateboarder Jagger Eaton won his first X Games gold on the east side.

The 21-year-old from Mesa Arizona won the men’s park event Sunday in Chiba Japan. The competition marked the first X Games to be held in Japan which followed the Olympic debut of skateboarding last year in Tokyo.

A BMX freestyle park event was also included in the Olympics for the first time in Tokyo. American Justin Dowell who took part in that Olympic contest finished in second in the men’s BMX park event in Chiba.

For Eaton the win was his first in a decade of appearing at the X Games having previously won three silvers since his 2012 debut.

“Really I’m just getting comfortable in this environment” he said on the broadcast. “You know this is kind of where I live. I get my mail sent to these competitions. This is where I live. I live with the pressure. I live in that bowl. I live in the street. And that’s just kind of the way I train the way I prepare.”

Just hours after winning the park event Eaton closed out the competition by finishing fifth in men’s street. That’s the event in which he claimed the bronze medal in at last year’s Olympics.

“Oh man it’s so special” Eaton said of his park win. “I mean dude these guys that you’re going against it’s no joke. You can never underestimate them.”

Dowell 22 of Virginia Beach Virginia took second in BMX park behind Australia’s Logan Martin who also won gold at the Olympics.

In the Olympics men and women compete in park and street events for skateboarding and park for BMX freestyle. Those disciplines were also included in this weekend’s X Games program. Five U.S. men and three women reached the park finals in skateboarding park while three American men did so in BMX. Park athletes perform in a hollowed-out course similar to an empty swimming pool. Three U.S. men and one woman qualified for the final in skateboarding street where the course resembles a city street with handrails walls ramps and other features.

Eaton was one of two American skaters on the podium in men’s park with Australia’s Kieran Woolley taking second and Liam Pace of the U.S. in third. Three other U.S. skaters reached the final. Tristan Rennie was fifth Gavin Bottger sixth and Olympian Zion Wright eighth.

Eaton led three U.S. skaters in the men’s street final with Dashawn Jordan taking sixth and Olympian Jake Ilardi eighth. Yuto Horigome the defending Olympic champion led a podium sweep for Japan.

Olympian Bryce Wettstein was the top U.S. woman in park taking fourth with Minna Stess in sixth and Ruby Lilley in seventh. Defending Olympic gold medalist Sakura Yosozumi led another Japanese sweep of the podium spots.

It’s what the money says.,"My favorite scene in the movie adaptation of Michael Lewis’ “Moneyball” occurred during 2003 in the darkened Oakland A’s locker room where Billy Beane the team’s general manager reluctantly slid a folded piece of paper across a table to his math genius assistant Peter Brand.

Unfolding the paper Brand stared at the number written telling Beane after a pause the offer from the Boston Red Sox would make Beane the highest-paid general manager in sports.

“So?” So what? Beane replies somewhat annoyed.

“You’re not doing it for the money” Brand says. “You’re doing it for what the money says.”

Before the credits roll we learn that Beane turned down an offer of $12.5 million a year to run a Red Sox team that would win a World Series a year later in 2004.

What you may be rightfully wondering does that have to do with electric infrastructure and the future of supply chains?

Maybe nothing. But stay with me here.

DOE doles out infrastructure dough

The Michael Lewis bestseller Moneyball was made into a 2011 movie starring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill. It is a true story of Oakland A’s general manager and current executive vice president Billy Beane a speaker at the FreightWaves Future of Supply Chain event May 9-10 in Northwest Arkansas.

For just a couple hundred thousand dollars more than Red Sox owner John Henry offered Beane the Department of Energy is granting two major auto suppliers and one university a total of $12.7 million to develop fast-charging infrastructure for electric vehicles.





If commercial electric vehicles — especially heavy-duty trucks — are going to be viable they need to be able to charge quickly. Otherwise they could become a future supply chain obstacle. Ready access to low-cost fast-charging infrastructure is essential for fleet electrification and broader EV adoption. Scaling current charging technology is pricey.

I missed the specifics of these grants late last year. And I wondered why BorgWarner Inc. just got around to announcing its $4.09 million award on April 14. Eaton Corp which picked up $4.9 million in the “Fiscal Year 2021 Low Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Vehicle Technologies Research Development Demonstration and Deployment” program issued its release four months ago.

North Carolina State University received $3.9 million. In total the DOE gave out more than $68 million across eight infrastructure-related areas including $5 million to Achates Power whose opposed-piston 2-stroke hybrid commercial vehicle system was featured in Truck Tech on Friday.

What the money says (and buys)

BorgWarner (NYSE: BWA) is leading a team on a36-month project to design and develop a cost-effective advanced direct current fast charger (DCFC).

It is coordinating with U.S.-based suppliers and research partners including Michigan State University eTransEnergy Cityfi the State of Michigan and the construction firm Barton Malow. Component supplier support is coming from Wolfspeed Inc.

The goal is to develop the next-generation DCFC system for 20-30% lower cost than current systems. BorgWarner’s flexible and adaptable single-stage power conversion and power module architecture will allow up to five vehicles to share 150 to 350 kilowatts of juice in 25kW modules. Five other EVs can be plugged in and ready to be charged.

Initially the charger won’t help trucks much since they need more power because of the size of their battery packs. But BorgWarner is confident it can get there.

Solid state transformer

Eaton (NYSE: ETN) is developing a compact and turnkey solution for DC fast-charging infrastructure. It is expected to reduce costs by 65% through improvements in power conversion grid interconnection technology charger integration and modularity and installation time.





A solid-state Eaton transformer design and modular chargers packaged on a compact skid will speed installation and reduce the amount of equipment and space needed both of which should reduce cost. It will connect directly to a utility’s medium-voltage distribution system eliminating the need for additional power conversion devices.

Eaton is leading the project. Partners include the National Renewable Energy Lab N.C. State the University of Pittsburgh ITC Holdings and Calstart the national nonprofit focus on clean transportation.

Eaton NCSU and Pitt are collaborating on the technical development of the solid-state transformer. NREL will validate the technology. ITC Holdings will provide a demonstration site for fleet charging and CALSTART will independently validate costs and performance.

One more coincidence

Oh and one more coincidence. Beane who remains with the A’s as executive vice president nearly two decades after the Moneyball story was told in Lewis’ 2003 bestseller will speak at the FreightWaves Future of Supply Chain event in Northwest Arkansas on May 9-10.

This is a 1U PDU with Isobar surge protection. As the name suggests it has a total of twelve outlets. These devices rarely get featured so we figured this would be worth a quick look since Patrick and I both have them now.

Tripp-Lite ISOBAR12ULTRA Hardware Overview

The unit itself is only 1U in height and is very short in-depth as one can see. One small but very nice feature is that both of the units we have came with pre-installed rackmount ears. That just saves a few minutes finding a screwdriver and screwing in rack ears so it is a nice touch. For those that do not want a rackmount unit TrippLite has other options.

On the left side we have the nameplate and in the center two outlets. The Isobar line means that we have $25000 in equipment protection. That warranty is part of the reason this unit costs significantly more than some of the company’s other options. We have not had something attached fail so we did not get to try the warranty process.

This is a 15A 120V surge protector. Something that we do not have is features like power metering with a LCD display and remote monitoring.

There are a few status LEDs along with a fuse and a little box. That little box holds the power switch for the entire PDU. It is a small feature but a nice one to ensure that the switch is not accidentally toggled.

The back of the unit has ten more outlets. Six of these are black outlets like the front. Four are a beige color.

The label on the top of the unit tells us about the difference. The black outlets have “basic” noise suppression on the line. The beige outlets have “enhanced noise suppression”. These also have a UL sticker which is important for many installations.

The cord attached has a standard NEMA 5-15P plug and it is a 15-foot cable giving the unit quite a bit of length.

There is also a grounding point above the cord.

For those that want to see inside the unit that is next."

Recently we reported about the over 100 C8 Corvettes that had been lined up outside Chevrolet’s Bowling Green Kentucky plant. According to The Corvette Blogger Sticker Auto Parts in Batavia Ohio seems to have received at least a few of those tornado-damaged C8 Corvettes.

The tornado ravaged nearby homes and businesses and caused a fire on the roof of the assembly plant which allowed water to damage Corvettes that were still being assembled. Since the vehicles can’t be sold to the public they’re only good for parts before being sent to the crusher.

The eBay listings for the parts also have pictures of the vehicle that they came off of with a large X clearly visible on the windshield matching those that were sitting in the yard. A photo from one of the listings for a steering wheel shows the dashboard of the vehicle showing 0 miles on the odometer confirming that it never left the factory under its own power.

People are crashing these things all over the place and repair shops are having a hard time getting replacement parts due to ongoing supply shortages. While buying from eBay is probably not the preferred way for shops to get their parts it could be the only way to get customers’ vehicles back on the road after waiting for months.

According to The Insurer a global risk industry website the estimated total damage caused to the plant is over $225 million with $175 million of that accounting for the physical damage and the other $50 million for the losses incurred from service interruptions.

No question but that eBay is a pioneer in the history of web commerce that forever changed the ways in which people use the internet. Just one year after Jeff Bezos started Amazon in his garage (per Britannica) and a year before Larry Page and Sergey Brin launched Google on the Stanford University computer network (as reported by The Verge) Pierre Omidyar took bids for and sold a broken laser pointer online using what would go on to be the multi-billion-dollar corporation known as eBay.

According to The Street Omidyar originally called his platform AuctionWeb and founded it in his San Jose California home on September 3 1995. Legend has it that Omidyar's initial plan was to sell off his wife's enormous collection of Pez dispensers but in reality he was merely interested in exploring buying and selling products via the newly mainstream worldwide web. Per the official eBay website AuctionWeb started out as a hobby for Omidyar ""dedicated to bringing together buyers and sellers in an honest and open marketplace."" The site brought in so much traffic that his web provider insisted he switch to a business account. The rise in his monthly bill led to Omidyar charging people to list items on the site and hire his first employee Chris Agarpao. Per his LinkedIn profile Agarpao is still employed by eBay where he's been the Quality Assurance Inspector Workplace Resources since 2005.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3VwLWZvci1zYWxlLXRoZS1sYW1ib3JnaGluaS1kaWFibG8td2l0aC10aGUtcmVsaWFiaWxpdHktb2YtYW4tYWN1cmEtbnN4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Up For Sale: The Lamborghini Diablo With The Reliability Of An Acura NSX,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3VwLWZvci1zYWxlLXRoZS1sYW1ib3JnaGluaS1kaWFibG8td2l0aC10aGUtcmVsaWFiaWxpdHktb2YtYW4tYWN1cmEtbnN4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL21vbmV5LzUxNzEyNTgvbW9zdC12YWx1YWJsZS05MHMtdG95cy1yZXZlYWxlZC_SAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGUtc3VuLmNvbS9tb25leS81MTcxMjU4L21vc3QtdmFsdWFibGUtOTBzLXRveXMtcmV2ZWFsZWQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Most valuable ’90s toys worth up to $14700 revealed – from Star Wars to Beanie Babies...,"hidden treasure Most valuable ’90s toys worth up to $14700 revealed – from Star Wars to Beanie Babies

Rare or unopened items are going for thousands - like one Princess Diana Beanie Baby which sold for more than $14000.

8 Collectibles from the 90's are drawing high sales on eBay in 2022

When it comes to collectibles you may think of rare coins or baseball cards.

This is not a bad price considering more than 32million dolls are said to have been sold since 1986.

That's why these sales are so interesting.

Each item was fairly common and sold in the millions.

Yet finding one in unopened condition can transform its value.

It may be worth checking your storage.

Thousands could be hiding out of sight.

There are at least eight major Star Wars games in the works likely with more to be announced in the coming months and years.

Those video game projects join a long list of new movies TV shows books and comics set in George Lucas’ galaxy far far away as Lucasfilm Games works to rebuild Star Wars’ presence in games. Many of those games are years away as evidenced by the number of Star Wars logos and untitled projects you’ll see below.

Beyond recent releases like Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga and Star Wars: The Force Unleashed for Nintendo Switch and continued development of games like the MMO Star Wars: The Old Republic here are all the Star Wars games in development (that we know about).

Star Wars: Hunters

Developed by Zynga and NaturalMotion the studio known for its CSR Racing games Star Wars: Hunters is a free-to-play multiplayer arena combat game coming to Android iOS and Nintendo Switch sometime in 2022. Star Wars: Hunters is set after the fall of the Galactic Empire and features a colorful cast of original characters. Standouts include Slingshot an Ugnaught who rides a Droideka into battle; Utooni a pair of Jawas doing the two-kids-in-a-trench-coat thing; Grozz a Wookiee who fights using a pair of torn-off KX droid arms as melee weapons; and J-3D1 a droid programmed to think it can use the Force.

Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake

BioWare and LucasArts’ seminal Star Wars role-playing game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is being “completely rebuilt from the ground up” by developer Aspyr with some help from Sony Interactive Entertainment. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic - Remake promises to “[honor] what fans love about the original while bringing new fans on this incredible journey.” The remake of the 2003 original will be released for PlayStation 5 as a console exclusive at launch and it will also come to PC.

Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic - Remake does not have a release date.

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order 2

Titanfall and Apex Legends developer Respawn Entertainment is making a sequel to 2019’s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order the game that sent Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis on a galaxy-spanning chase set after the events of Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith. Game director Stig Asmussen (God of War 3) is returning the lead the sequel which does not have a release date or an official title.

Untitled Star Wars FPS

Respawn Entertainment also has an untitled all-new Star Wars first-person shooter in the works. Game director Peter Hirschmann is leading development on the shooter which is good news for fans of the early Medal of Honor games and the original Star Wars: Battlefront games where he was a producer. Respawn’s Star Wars shooter does not have a release date or announced platforms but it appears to be publisher Electronic Arts’ replacement for the modern Battlefront franchise which was developed by DICE.

Untitled Star Wars strategy game

Respawn also has its fingers in a new Star Wars strategy game. The studio is producing the untitled game but development is led by Bit Reactor a new studio formed by developers of the XCOM and Civilization franchises. Bit Reactor is helmed by Greg Foertsch the art director of XCOM and XCOM 2. There’s no release date for this one either.

Untitled Star Wars game from Ubisoft Massive Entertainment

Massive Entertainment known for its work on the Tom Clancy’s The Division games is making a “new story-driven open-world video game set in the Star Wars galaxy.” Little else is known about what Massive calls “The Star Wars Project” other than that it will use the studio’s in-house Snowdrop engine and that Tom Clancy series veteran Julian Gerighty will serve as the game’s creative director.

Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot called Massive’s Star Wars game “the beginning of a long-term collaboration with Disney and Lucasfilm Games” so expect more from the Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry publisher.

Star Wars Eclipse

Unveiled with a dramatic trailer at The Game Awards 2021 Star Wars Eclipse is the first announced video game set during the franchise’s relatively new High Republic era the “golden age of the Jedi.” Eclipse is being developed by Quantic Dream (Detroit: Become Human Heavy Rain) and will give players a diverse cast of characters as they explore the uncharted region of the Outer Rim and encounter never-before-seen species and planets. Quantic Dream promises a deep branching narrative: “Player’s choices will be at the heart of the experience as every decision can have a dramatic impact on the course of the story.”

Star Wars Eclipse does not have a release date or platforms but early reports on its development indicate this trip through the Star Wars galaxy is far far away.

HDR issue I have a brand new top spec 4k tv with HDR capability my PS4 has HDR enabled and it works with other games. When i go to the BF2042 settings the HDR options are greyed out and i can’t select anything HDR related. Any ideas?

Electronic Arts already investigating potential workaround

An Electronic Arts Community Manager confirmed that the glitch in question has already been escalated to the development team for investigation. But there are no details on an ETA for a fix yet.

Also a member of the EA Dice team shed more light on the matter and further confirmed that a fix will come in a future update:

I checked up on this for you. The HDR options actually shouldn’t be visible in-game on console. It’s enabled automatically if supported so we have a fix incoming in a future update that removes this option from the menu. What we’ll add in stead is a calibration screen for HDR.

Meanwhile there is a potential workaround that reportedly allows you to enable the HDR option in auto-mode:

If a pediatric patient presents with a rash on the back of the legs and buttock in the shape of a toilet seat most likely they are having a reaction to either a component of the seat or a cleaner being used on it. A way to avoid this issue in the future is to add a soft toilet seat cover for at-home use and using paper covers while in public. The rash itself can be treated with a topical steroid.

For dermatitis caused by shin guards the culprit has been found according to Swanson. Acetophenone azine a contact allergen and by-product of a foam material used in shin guards causes this reaction. To treat fluocinonide or clobetasol can be prescribed.

There has been an increase of pediatric psoriasis according to Swanson explaining that the number of patients she sees with the condition has increased from once a month to once a day. Psoriasis is an inflammatory disease with the greatest association being obesity in children. According to the screening guidelines the following should be screened in pediatric patients with the disease2:

Check for diabetes every 3 years at age 10

Nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) test every 3 years at age 10

HTN test annually starting at age 3

Screen lipids at age 10 and again at age 18

Also be sure to ask the patient for history of arthritis depression anxiety and in older patients smoking stress and substance abuse Swanson advised.

“I think we've all thought that if we're treating psoriasis systemically and reducing that inflammation that we could have an impact on preventing the Psoriatic March of inflammation. We're starting to see data that suggests that” she said. Currently there are 2 interleukin (IL)-17 inhibitors approved for treatment in pediatric patients secukinumab (Cosentyx; Novartis) and ixekizumab (Taltz Eli Lilly and Company).

When screening pediatric patients for IL-17 inhibitors for psoriasis treatments ask questions about family history of Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) growth issues nocturnal diarrhea or bowel movements and perianal issues. Swanson also suggests that a complete blood count (CBC) is taken to determine if the patient is anemic along with a C-reactive protein (CRP) test and fecal calprotectin.

Another skin condition that pediatric patients often come into the practice with is acne she said. One type in infantile (toddler) acne which starts at 6 and 18 months and often appears on the checks. These usually present as inflammatory papules and pustules and she said is very important to treat. If treatment is delayed it can lead to scarring due to post-inflammatory erythema.

As for mid childhood acne it can start between the ages of 3 and 7 and it is abnormal. Swanson suggests asking the patient or patient’s parents about any inhaled steroid use as it can cause this reaction. Other labs to check include total/free testosterone dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) luteinizing hormone/follicle stimulating hormone (LH/FSH) ratio and bone age.

“Acne used to be abnormal before the age of nine. Now it's only abnormal before the age of 7” said Swanson.

To avoid overusing antibiotics birth control or oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) can be an option to treat acne but the patient has to be asked about smoking history migraines with focal neurologic deficit and if there are any family issues of blood clots before starting treatment. OCPs that are non-estrogen have greater efficacy with drospirenone having the greatest efficacy.3 Another common treatment is spironolactone especially in adolescence patients that may have polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and tests are not needed unless the treatment is greater than 200 mg a day.

As for isotretinoin the association with IBD has been disproven according to Swanson and its connection with depression has varied by patient. “Most studies… show no association between depression and [isotretinoin]” Swanson said. “In fact most of them show that [isotretinoin] improves the patient's mood by treating their acne [which improves] their self-esteem and their confidence.”

She did mention that 6 of her patients over the last 11 years did struggle with mental health during treatment. While depression may occur Swanson said it is quite rare in her experience however it is important to acknowledge the risk.

Disclosures:

Swanson is a speaker for Valeant and Bayer and on the advisory board for Allergan.

David L. “Dave” Osterkamp of Prior Lake MN died Saturday April 16 2022 in Northfield MN after a brave battle with cancer. Dave was born November 13 1967 to Lawrence and Constance (Thatcher) Osterkamp in St. Paul MN. He graduated from Harding High School in 1986. He went on to graduate from St. Paul Technical College with an Associate’s Degree in Electronics. He has worked for Emerson Process Management as a Senior Electronics Technician.

While camping at Jay Cooke State Park in Minnesota Dave met his wife Helen M. Hufnagle and they married January 17 2004 in at St. James Lutheran Church in Burnsville MN making their home in Shakopee MN and later moving to Prior Lake MN. They have one son Cole who is the love of their life. Cole earned his Boy Scout Eagle rank in January 2022. A private Court of Honor was held so Dave could attend and be honored.

Dave was hard-wired for electronics and computers. He was also passionate for camping hiking traveling photography metal-detecting weather-spotting and playing games…especially Crap on Your Neighbor Yahtzee and Farkle. As a family they put on many miles and took many amazing pictures in Minnesota’s State Parks and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area. Dave has been a musician all his life but he excelled at drums and percussion. He humbly served as the drummer for the Praise III choir co-lead the Handy Men’s group and participated in several bible studies at St. James Lutheran Church.

Dave had a quick wit and could always make people laugh. He loved spending time with his family and friends. He would always be the first to volunteer lend a hand or take pictures. He will be sadly missed by all those who were fortunate to have known this incredible son husband father brother uncle and friend. He is survived by his wife Helen; son Cole; parents Larry and Connie Osterkamp; parents-in-law Don and Ruthann Hufnagle; sister Sue (John) Bahrke and children Amanda Tony and Michael; sisters-in-law Ruth (Brian) Backlund and daughter Kari Hufnagle; Sheryl (Scott) Haugen and son Michael; DeAnn (Mark) Genung and children Jakob Hufnagle-Puffer Jessica Megan Worley and Samuel; and brothers-in-law Don (Kristin) Hufnagle and children Ben and Holly; Paul Hufnagle and children Amanda Ally and Missy and several grandnieces and nephews.

""It's nice to come up and see what they actually look like"" said Mike Cucciare of Little Rock who was visiting the zoo with his wife and children. ""You see Teslas all over the road but you don't get to see [other brands] too often.""

The city and Audubon Delta held the ""Drive Electric for Earth Day"" event in which about 20 electric cars were available for observation and some for test driving. Entergy Arkansas Adopt A Charger Evolve Auto the Little Rock Zoo and the Arkansas Energy Office also sponsored the event.

Mayor Frank Scott Jr. dedicated four new 240-volt electric vehicle chargers at the front of the zoo's parking lot by plugging one into an electric car owned by Little Rock resident Ann Owen.

""We're excited about this opportunity to be clean green [and] a more sustainable city"" Scott said during a news conference.

He recently announced a goal for city operations to run entirely on renewable resources by 2030 and he said Saturday that adding electric cars to the police and fire departments will help achieve this goal as well as installing more electric vehicle chargers throughout the city.

Firefighter Dan Oberste has owned a Tesla Model 3 for three years and demonstrated its self-driving ability to several curious onlookers in the zoo parking lot. He told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that the Fire Department's battalion chiefs and arson investigators could use electric vehicles.

""Right now we're responding in [Chevrolet] Silverado pickup trucks so something like the [Tesla] Model Y would be good for a battalion chief"" Oberste said.

He said electric cars' high price tags can be off-putting but are worth it due to long-term savings on fuel and maintenance.

""The cost of ownership over a five-year period is equal to or even less than what a new gas-powered vehicle might cost"" Oberste said.

Climate change caused largely by fuel emissions is a primary cause of death among North American birds which gives Audubon an interest in promoting electric car use and infrastructure Audubon Delta policy manager Glen Hooks said during the news conference.

""The science says we absolutely have to lessen the amount of greenhouse gases that we put into the atmosphere"" Hooks said. ""Electric vehicles are a big part of how we're going to solve the climate crisis because they don't pollute.""

Nick Creed of Sherwood told the Democrat-Gazette that his occasional commutes into Little Rock for work frustrate him because of unnecessary fuel emissions.

""I'm sitting there in traffic stop and go and the thought that all this pollution all this gas is getting burned up for no reason"" is aggravating Creed said. ""I think I would feel calmer and better about the commute if I wasn't burning up all this gas.""

He and his wife Roz said they were happy to see so many people stopping to look at and ask questions about the electric cars on display. They also said they appreciated that electric cars can reduce noise pollution.

Entergy Arkansas has subsidized 20 charging stations throughout Arkansas in the past two years company communications specialist Brandi Hinkle said. The stations are strategically placed along heavily traveled highways and Entergy pays for the installment of the chargers while private companies pay the electric bills and drivers can charge their cars for free she said.

The Little Rock Technology Park has one of the 20 charging stations.

The state's only electric car dealership Evolve Auto is on West Broadway in North Little Rock. Collin Riggin a partner with the dealership said several people at Saturday's event had questions for him about electric cars.

Interest in electric cars has risen a great deal within Arkansas over the past several months Riggin said.

""We went from selling most of these [cars] out of state to selling them locally"" he said. ""Our sales and phone calls have probably gone up 200% apiece within just the last six weeks due to fuel prices.""

Richard Malott of Little Rock said he is on a waiting list for a Model Y so he can stop driving his gas-powered cruiser.

""I think it's not wise to buy a gas-powered vehicle now"" he said. ""They are going away in my opinion.""

Kwami Abdul-Bey test-drove a Tesla around the zoo parking lot with his 6-year-old son who asked him when they can get one of their own.

Abdul-Bey has driven hybrid cars before but the Tesla ""is a fully different creature and I'm loving it"" he said.

He home-schools his son and brought him to the event as an Earth Day field trip to learn more about how electric vehicles can help the environment he said.

Abdul-Bey wants an electric vehicle for several reasons including the fact that electric car batteries can be refurbished while gas-powered car batteries are unsalvageable when they break down he said. He also appreciates that the cars can brake by themselves and have cameras on the outside in order to show their surroundings on a screen on the dashboard.

Additionally reducing fuel emissions will help achieve environmental justice for Black Americans said Abdul-Bey who is the legislative and political action committee chair for the Jacksonville chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.

""You look at the things that are going on in cities across Louisiana Texas and Alabama where these Black communities are being heavily negatively impacted by these oil companies"" Abdul-Bey said. ""We need to stop giving them license to exist and we can do that by converting our transportation to all electric vehicles.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

In its annual Summer Gas Outlook published on 14 April the UK’s National Grid plc a British multinational electricity and gas utility company noted that the UK will increase its gas exports over the next 6 months to help Europe fill its gas storage sites ahead of next winter.

European gas storage was at 27% at the end of this winter as compared to 30% the same time a year ago.

The UK has been a net importer of gas since 2005 covering 50% of demand with its own production from the North and Irish Seas plus associated petroleum gas from oil fields.

Norway supplies about 30% of UK imports via pipeline with LNG from Qatar the US and Russia accounting for a bit more than 15% according to the Outlook.

Any surplus gas in the system can then be exported to Europe via the BBL pipeline to the Netherlands (Bacton to Balgzand) or through the Interconnector pipeline to Belgium (Bacton to Zeebrugge.) The ability to regasify LNG from anywhere in the world and then deliver it to Europe by pipeline makes Britain an “energy bridge” that can wean Europe off Russian energy while longer-term solutions are put into place.

This summer UK gas exports to the EU could reach 5.1 Bcm far beyond the volumes of 2021 when exports totaled only 0.7 Bcm because cold summers had drawn down the UK’s gas reserves according to National Grid which noted that the increased exports are to be based on “commercial agreements” as opposed to intergovernmental agreements.

LNG is expected to play a major role in boosting EU gas supplies from new sources globally with more cargos directed in the near term to the UK’s three regasification terminals—Grain LNG (the UK’s largest) on the Thames Estuary Kent; and the South Hook and Dragon regasification terminals in Wales.

The UK is Europe’s second-largest LNG importer after Spain and given its subsea pipeline connections to the continent it is also a gas transit state to the EU.

So far the US has agreed to increase LNG exports to Europe by 15 Bcm and Qatar has promised not to redirect Europe-bound cargoes to Asia as is the practice when buyers in Asia offer higher premiums to sellers.

LNG cargoes delivered to UK by source 2021–2022 to date. Source: National Grid Summer Gas Outlook

Fred Hutchison chief executive of the US trade group LNG Allies confirmed to Reuters that delegations from Latvia and Estonia as well as diplomats from Bulgaria Estonia France Germany Hungary Latvia and the UK toured the Golden Pass LNG export project in Sabine Pass Texas in early April and met in Houston with US shale gas producers.

Top executives from Chesapeake Energy Coterra Energy EOG Resources and EQT Corp. participated in the event which was intended to foster discussion of how US energy producers could assist Europe in replacing Russian imports of oil coal and LNG.

The meeting co-organized with the American Exploration and Production Council touched also on the topic of building new infrastructure in both Europe and in the US echoing testimony that Pioneer Natural Resources Chief Executive Scott Sheffield gave the same day when he told a congressional hearing that new LNG facilities are needed in the northeast according to Reuters and C-SPAN.

As for Europe Germany—which had staked its energy security largely on Russian pipeline gas—now expects to commission its first LNG regasification plant in 2026.In March Germany’s Economic Minister Robert Habeck was in Doha lining up a long-term supply contract with Qatar.

Meanwhile Algeria has agreed to increase gas exports to Italy through the Trans-Mediterranean Pipeline to Sicily via Tunisiaunder an agreement announced during Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi’s visit to Algiers for talks with Algerian president Abdelmadjid Tebboune.

Italy like the rest of the EU relies on Russia for about 40% of its energy imports. In 2021 the EU imported 155 Bcm of Russian gas which represented about 45% of EU gas imports nearly 40% of total gas consumption according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency.",,,,,,,,,

We’d like to thank our Arlington neighbors and the County Board for their partnership and feedback through the years-long process of designing PenPlace a project we believe will benefit the entire region. With the County Board’s approval we look forward to continuing our work with the community as we take the next steps on this journey to build an integrated innovative and sustainable second headquarters in Arlington Virginia.

We announced in late 2018 that Arlington Virginia would be home to Amazon’s second headquarters (HQ2) and that we would bring more than 25000 jobs to the region. Since then we’ve made some significant progress in our commitment to be a trusted business and community partner. We’ve continued to engage with local organizations and now work with over 100 nonprofits civic groups and small businesses providing in-kind support and charitable donations.

Our hard-working recruiting teams have crossed an important hiring milestone with more than 5000 employees now assigned to our second headquarters. Our construction partners have put in more than 2 million hours of work and recently celebrated finishing the top floor—the “topping out”—of Met Park the first phase of HQ2. And finally our architecture design sustainability and transportation teams have engaged with the local community and partnered with Arlington County to continue improving the design of PenPlace the next phase of our development.

As we prepare to take the next step in our more than $2.5 billion HQ2 investment we want to provide a snapshot of what the project will bring to the Arlington community and the wider region. Here are some highlights:

More sustainable by design

When we announced the development of HQ2 we challenged ourselves to think big and design Amazon’s buildings in a way that helps lead the industry toward net-zero carbon. In pursuit of this goal we have electrified the operations of HQ2 eliminating the use of fossil fuels for buildings systems and our food service. We’ve committed to powering 100% of HQ2’s operations with renewable energy through a combination of off-site and on-site solar projects aligning with The Climate Pledge Amazon’s commitment to be net-zero carbon across its operations by 2040.

PenPlace will provide more than 100000 square feet of retail space for dining shopping and a childcare facility. Multimodal pathways will connect throughout the site to prioritize access by foot and bike.

To do this we’ve contracted 82 megawatts (MW) of energy from a new 120 MW solar farm in Pittsylvania County Virginia which is expected to generate 172500 megawatt hours (MWh) of renewable energy annually once operational later this year. The renewable energy generated at this site will be used in part for the operation of HQ2 and other Amazon-owned buildings across Virginia including Whole Foods Market stores and Amazon fulfillment centers. The remaining portion of energy generated by the solar farm has been contracted by Arlington County and will provide clean energy for use in the region. At PenPlace we will also have rooftop solar panels installed totaling 1 MW of clean energy capacity to further support our sustainability efforts.

Our plans to focus on sustainability at PenPlace include:



Committing to achieve LEED Platinum certification the highest sustainability certification for a development issued by the U.S. Green Building Council.

Integrating strategic climate-responsive design for our office buildings including high-performance glazing and built-in solar shading that will reduce the need for building heating and cooling targeting a savings of 30% over the American Society of Heating Refrigerating Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) baseline.

Providing more than 125 electric vehicle charging stations with the ability to double capacity as needed.

Leveraging low-flow fixtures and reclaimed water usage to reduce water consumption by 50% beyond national standards.

Reducing the amount of embodied carbon in the concrete structure compared to typical construction practices by at least 10% along with a commitment to offset 100% of the remaining embodied carbon from building materials.

Using bird-safe glass where appropriate on all seven buildings at PenPlace to ensure that the development is safer for the region’s bird population.

Connecting the neighborhood

We’ve designed PenPlace to be part of the local neighborhood because we want both employees and local residents to enjoy the space equally. This means considering how people will travel to get to PenPlace and how they will utilize the space each day. Our plans prioritize access by foot bike and public transportation with a 15-foot-wide multimodal path that will be part of the Green Ribbon a network of pedestrian and shared-use pathways throughout the neighborhood. When complete PenPlace will provide more than 900 interior and exterior bike storage stalls to encourage bike commuting over the use of single-occupancy vehicles. All vehicle movements on-site will occur underground including loading docks which allows for contiguous outdoor public space with gathering areas public plazas and ample green space for the community to enjoy.

An open-air amphitheater will provide space for programming and events including concerts farmers markets and evening movie screenings.

Providing parks and public space

After engaging with the local community we heard feedback from our neighbors and shifted our designs to integrate more planting areas and maximize publicly accessible green space at PenPlace. The project will create 2.75 acres of public park space available for community use including immersive forest rooms shaded seating groves water features and many native and pollinator gardens. We will plant more than 100 native plant species and over 500 new trees throughout the site—all inspired by the natural ecosystems of the surrounding region. An open-air amphitheater will provide space for programming and events including concerts farmers markets and evening movie screenings. We will also build a dog run for Arlington’s four-legged residents.

In addition to the central green PenPlace will include immersive forest rooms shaded seating groves water features a dog run and many native and pollinator gardens all for the community to enjoy.

Adding vibrancy to the neighborhood

One of the main opportunities of designing a welcoming inviting and well-connected development will be the ability to support vibrant local small businesses. PenPlace will provide more than 100000 square feet of space for dining shopping a childcare facility and other opportunities across the main buildings and three retail pavilions. We’re also dedicating over 26500 square feet to establish a new home for Arlington County Community High School. This public school will provide an opportunity for approximately 300 students to pursue their academic goals while preparing for the future.

Building more than office space

The Helix a spiral-shaped building in the northeast corner of PenPlace will become a landmark for Arlington and the National Landing area. This distinctive building will take our biophilic-led design principles to new heights integrating nature and working to inspire innovation and invention. The interior of the Helix will provide formal and casual meeting spaces in an environment filled with more than 25000 square feet of planting areas and living walls. The exterior of the structure will feature two paths for employees to engage with colleagues in meetings or to take in views of Arlington the Potomac River and Washington D.C. The Helix will also be home to an artist-in-residence program and a meeting center and it will be open to the public and community to enjoy two days per month. We can’t wait for everyone to see this unique and thoughtfully designed space come to life.

Engaging with the local community

We know that success and scale bring broad responsibility and we strive to be good neighbors in the communities in which we operate. When we chose National Landing as the site of HQ2 we made a commitment to be a trusted business and community partner in the region and our work to become a part of the fabric of this community reflects that commitment daily.

First local retailer signs on to open shop at Amazon’s HQ2 District Dogs is the first small business to sign a lease at HQ2 as part of Amazon’s pledge to bring local minority- and women-owned retailers to its second headquarters in Arlington Virginia. Watch now

Since we announced Arlington as the site of HQ2 in 2018 we have committed more than $35 million in total investments to local nonprofits community groups public schools and businesses. This includes both monetary and in-kind donations—like school supplies to public schools across Northern Virginia and food donations to local food banks and pantries for families in need. We also know that housing affordability is front of mind for many in the community. Through the Housing Equity Fund we’ve contributed more than $800 million to support affordable housing in the Arlington and metro-Washington D.C. areas with more to come. Since the launch of the Amazon Housing Equity Fund 15 months ago our efforts are helping to create and preserve more than 4400 affordable homes. Based on data provided by Arlington County the Fund has helped to increase the affordable housing stock in Arlington by 22%.

We will continue to engage with the Arlington community to understand how we can best support the issues that matter to local residents. Our goal is to build a second headquarters that integrates into the surrounding neighborhood and benefits the entire region. We appreciate Arlington County and the community’s partnership in this process and we are excited to continue the conversation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiczguY29tL2FydGljbGUvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9wYXJhZGlzZS1hdC1hLXByaWNlL3Nhbi1kaWVnby1hLXNlbGxlcnMtbWFya2V0LzUwOS1mMjJmNDgzZi04NmU1LTRjNmYtOGY0My0yMGJmOTk4NWM1YTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Interest rates rise for buyers home prices steady in San Diego,"Experts say home prices will likely continue to climb especially in San Diego where there’s not enough homes for sale.

SAN DIEGO — It's a seller's market in San Diego and it could be staying that way for a while according to experts. Even with interest rates on the rise home and condo prices are likely not going to go down.

""You have this many buyers and you only have this many houses"" said Tina Balch.

Balch is a realtor with Big Block Realty and says San Diego is a market where people will do whatever it takes to buy a home.

""Right now we’re average 4.25 between 4.75 for a 30 year fix for a single family home if you’re getting a condo there’s a hit for a condo. It’s much more risky for a lender. Condo rates are higher we just locked a rate that’s almost 6%"" said Balch.

Today the cost of a 30 year mortgage on a typical U.S. home is nearly 20 percent higher than it was just three months ago.

Experts say prices will likely continue to climb especially in San Diego where there’s not enough homes for sale.

Economics and finance professor at University of California San Diego Allan Timmerman says shocks to the economy such as the pandemic and war in Ukraine have caused inflation to soar.

""The fed is debating how to get in control with rampant inflation at 8.5%"" said Timmerman. He says the federal reserve is trying to mitigate the high inflation with higher interest rates.

""The fed might need to slam the brakes harder than they would like to because when they do there's always a danger of the economy hitting a recessionary spell"" said Timmerman.

Even with if a recession were to happen Balch says it is unlikely home prices will move.

Price cuts will only happen if a large number of people can no longer afford today’s prices forcing sellers to adjust their expectations.",,,,,,,,,

ETSY,Etsy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3RoZS1ldHN5LXN0cmlrZS1tYXktYmUtb3Zlci1idXQtaXRzLXNlbGxlcnMtdm93LXRvLWtlZXAtZmlnaHRpbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Etsy Strike May Be Over but Its Sellers Vow to Keep Fighting,"Etsy has been home to many independent sellers and small businesses since its launch in 2005. The platform has grown to a billion-dollar enterprise with a focus on handmade and vintage items and craft supplies. In February the company’s CEO Josh Silverman reported that Etsy had seen its most profitable year on record with revenue and shares at an all-time high.

While this was good news for executives and investors in a surprising turn of events there is some less than promising news for sellers: Etsy was raising its transaction fees by 30 percent. Fees increased from 5 percent to 6.5 percent from April 11.

Etsy sellers didn’t take this lying down. Shortly after hearing of the increase in seller fees Kristi Cassidy an active Etsy seller since 2007 known for gothic wedding dresses decided to take a stand. She headed to the Etsy sellers subreddit and wrote “I wonder what would happen if on April 11 so many sellers put their shops on vacation mode that Etsy starts shitting bricks.” Thus the Etsy strike was born.

On April 11 thousands of Etsy shops went into vacation mode suspending sales for a little over a week to protest the changes. They have also asked shoppers to refrain from buying on Etsy and their coworker campaign in support of the strike received over 15000 signatures in a week. Around 5000 sellers have participated in the strike suspending business by however many days they thought appropriate.

When Cassidy learned of the increase in sellers’ fees she went to the Reddit Etsy seller’s forum and said they needed an Etsy sellers’ union. According to MarketWatch Etsy currently has 5.3 million active sellers which means Cassidy had her work cut out with seller outreach. The strike petition went live in the middle of March but quickly garnered attention and numerous sellers put their shoppers on vacation mode or paused sales.

“We’ve gotten a reaction from Etsy” Cassidy said. “Sellers have tried to open a dialogue with Etsy but the most we get back is a generic email saying they care about their sellers and how they are increasing transaction fees to better the platform but we are trying to tell Etsy that’s not how this works.”

While Cassidy has considered looking into alternative platforms to Etsy there is little available with the size of Etsy’s marketplace audience and the only other alternatives would be sellers hosting a store via Shopify. The advantage to Etsy is the built-in search engine and its eight-figure users per year.

“ Etsy is not living up to its promise of what it is claiming to be. ” — Kristi Cassidy

Etsy originally started as a marketplace to help small business owners sell and thrive but Cassidy says the promise of what it would be when she started has been broken. “Etsy is not living up to its promise of what it is claiming to be” Cassidy said. “There’s a major discrepancy between Etsy’s brand and selling on the platform. We were hoping the company would at least open a dialogue with us but it doesn’t look like that’s happening. Sellers are hoping to carry the strike efforts for in a different way but if Etsy doesn’t listen to us we will get to a point where will have to leave the platform.”

Cassidy says that Etsy is trying to turn into an Amazon 2.0 but given that most Etsy sellers are vintage sellers and people doing handmade products it is impractical. “We are sellers who make things quickly handmade or to-order we are not mass-market producers” Cassidy said. “Our products are unique.”

While the transaction fee seems to be the major gripe of sellers it goes beyond that. Etsy can take up to 30 percent from one transaction with additional fees including the listing fee to post products on Etsy a payment processing fee for processing payments and a fee for offsite ads that’s around 12 percent.

“The real reason the transaction fee led to so many Etsy sellers striking is that it was our final straw” Cassidy said. “Etsy is not providing a service worth 5 percent right now and they are raising it to 6.5. This pushed sellers over the edge and we’ve had enough.”

Cassidy is currently looking into forming a union for the Etsy sellers although nothing is set in stone yet. Cassidy’s hopes Etsy will meet sellers’ demands to keep the seller fee at 5 percent allow sellers to opt out of expensive off-site ads and provide better customer service support for shops.

Balmung Furuya an Etsy seller who sells 3-D print Dungeons and Dragons figurines decided to launch on Etsy because the nature of the platform brought in many more customers than when he was trying to run his website via Squarespace. While he said Squarespace was more customizable and he had more control the volume of his Etsy shop is ten times what it was via Squarespace.

“With Squarespace I’ve had a total of 15 sales trying to actively push the site whereas with Etsy I’ve broken 1400 sales” Furuya said.

While he’s fairly new to the platform only having joined in 2020 he says from the time he started with Etsy until now one of the things he’s noticed is the customer service getting worse. When he got started with Etsy during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic he was very forgiving about it because nearly every business faced issues during COVID-19 but it’s gotten progressively worse.

“ I don’t see how that fee increase is related based on how customer service for sellers is going ” — Balmung Furuya

“I needed proper help with a legal issue earlier this year and it took me two months to get a response” Furuya said. “When I heard about the increase in seller fees I didn’t think the price was that much but they are claiming the increase is to help support sellers better but I’ve only seen that get worse. I don’t see how that fee increase is related based on how customer service for sellers is going.”

Furuya ended up putting his shop on vacation mode for five days to protest the fee increase. He had decided to shut down his store for a day to boycott the fee increase before he learned about the protest but once he saw more collective organized efforts he was on board. Furuya says his only real hope for the strike is Etsy taking a more face-value approach to consider the needs of their sellers.

“Etsy seems very against their seller base” Furuya said. “While I don’t know exactly what I want to see I’d like some more genuine support from the customer service team. Some better communication would be better and while I’d prefer a decrease in prices if the services for sellers were there it would be different.”

Although Furuya says if Etsy sellers were to unionize he would give himself several weeks to consider and weigh the pros and cons he also says the rhetoric that unions are bad that’s been driven in America is propaganda. Although he says pausing his store was scary his customers immediately returned once his shop was active again.

Brooklyn-based costume and swimwear designer Courtney Gamble founder of MessQueen New York has been an Etsy seller since 2010. She joined Etsy because she found the platform seamless but over the years she’s found it increasingly frustrating to use.

“Now they demand more keywords for my products to show up in the listings it can be very time consuming” Gamble said. “I’m constantly fixing my shop product titles and tags. I understand they are trying to streamline the search optimization but I wish it was a little bit easier and it’s not realistic for me with 300 plus listings.”

Gamble says that while Etsy says they are trying to do the best for their sellers she no longer believes that because “everything is about their bottom line dollar and shareholders.”

In September 2021 Etsy launched its Star Seller program which was to let shoppers know what sellers offer consistently excellent customer service. While this sounds great in theory it has proven to be a nightmare for sellers like Gamble.

“It is unrealistic for small shops to live up to the standards of the Star Seller program” Gamble said. “Etsy expects us to message people back in 24 hours or it lowers your qualifications and percentage points to be a Star Seller. You need 95 percent to be a Star Seller and it’s very unclear as to what even qualifies you to be a Star Seller. My sales were slow in winter and I still made star seller so who knows?”

“ I’ve had customers tell me: ‘This is too expensive now; I’ll just find something similar on Amazon.’ ” — Courtney Gamble

Gamble unfortunately had to raise her prices to compensate for the increase in transaction fees and she feels guilty passing the cost onto her customers. “Etsy expects us to add onto our costs and have the customers pay for it but that’s not a guarantee” she said. “I’ve had customers tell me: ‘This is too expensive now; I’ll just find something similar on Amazon.’”

Gamble said if Etsy sellers were to form a union she would look into it and she’s hoping there will be some form of protection for sellers soon. “The sellers’ concerns need to be at the forefront of Etsy because without us they don’t have a marketplace” she said.

Rebekah Grippen an Etsy seller focused on vintage fashion and vintage décor started selling on Etsy in 2017. Previously she had been an Etsy shopper since 2006. When Grippen began as an Etsy seller she didn’t notice the extra fees at first because she was just happy to be making sales and income. After she began every four months or so she would begin getting corporate emails about changes they were making to terms and conditions for sellers.

One of the first big changes that got her was Etsy’s free shipping program which prioritized free shipping for U.S.-based customers. Grippen describes it as a “nightmare” for small businesses because the threshold for free shipping is 35 dollars.

“For sellers who opted into the free shipping program anything over 35 dollars was free shipping” Grippen said. “The problem with this is customers could combine items that weren’t individually 35 dollars to get to the amount of 35 dollars and then sellers would make no money because it would all go toward shipping.”

Etsy pushed sellers like Grippen to raise the cost of their products to essentially pass the cost of items onto customers. Grippen says this was unfair to her international customers because “International customers would be buying items and paying for both U.S. shipping on top of international shipping. 1/4 to 2/3 of my customers are international and this would alienate them. I love my international customers because they leave me great reviews and I don’t want to risk losing them.”

Grippen’s other grievances with Etsy are she did not even receive a tax form from them this year which they guarantee to all sellers who do more than $600 in sales. This forced her to manually calculate all her Etsy income making tax season very tedious for her.

She learned about the Etsy strike from her mother who read about it in a Buzzfeed article. Grippen is one of the biggest strike organizers to advocate for sellers to unionize. While she says they haven’t figured out the mechanics of how that would work the idea is still in the works.

She currently describes dealing with Etsy’s corporate structure as “hostile.” She also says that while many news outlets are saying the strike is due to the fee hike the fee was truly the last straw. Between the stress of free shipping and trying to make the Star Seller program sellers have had enough.

Etsy user Kittynaut is known for her anime-inspired accessory pins. She made several semi-viral infographics around the Etsy strike. Kittynaut originally started off doing handmade clay products which she began selling on the platform in 2009 back when she was in college just trying to make some extra money. Now she primarily sells accessory pins and she’s also made tumblers and designed a purse on Kickstarter.

Kittynaut became frustrated with Etsy in 2015 when the platform raised its transaction fees from 3 percent to 5 percent. She says what Etsy does to sellers is “fee them to death.” Her biggest frustration with the platform is how they promised not to have resellers but lately mass-produced injected molded products like things sold on Ali Express have made their way onto the platform.

“Resellers are very detectable because they use the same pictures from Alibaba and other mass-market sites’ Kittynaut said. “Sellers aren’t the only ones mad about it either. Customers are mad as well because they come to Etsy expecting handmade products next thing they know they get a product on their doorstep from a reseller with a Made in China label somewhere on it. Customers feel tricked. Resellers are causing undue trust issues with buyers in some sense.”

“ I think about how unfair that is for younger artists and I want to be able to shield and protect them from those problems. ” — Kittynaut

Kittynaut says nowadays most of her traffic actually comes from using her social media platforms like Instagram to drive traffic to her Etsy shop. She says that since Etsy went public in 2015 she’s seen nothing but raised fees increased costs for sellers on shipping and increased costs for offsite ads. She saw the Etsy strike as something a long time coming.

After years on the platform and now being established Kittynaut says that it would be virtually impossible for her to start from scratch on Etsy now. “When I look back at where I was in 2009 I couldn’t have broken into this space easily with how Etsy is set up now” she said. “I think about how unfair that is for younger artists and I want to be able to shield and protect them from those problems.”

Recently members who participated in the strike appeared to be targeted by union busters. According to Grippen members received a suspicious email from a private research firm starting on April 20 trying to dig up data and info about strike participants. The group doing research was not an academic institution and their clients were all large corporations.

Grippen says that she and fellow strike participants are suspicious it is Etsy or a competitor and the insights could be used to harm their movement. “We’ve seen similar things happen at Amazon” she said.

While the formal Etsy strike is over the sellers’ fight is far from over. One of Kittynaut’s biggest grievances is around how Etsy is run on a corporate level. She recently began reviewing Etsy’s SEC reports and learned high-level executives were taking seven-figure bonuses and offered multi-million dollar severance packages. Her big question is why that money isn’t going toward investing in sellers. She also sees Etsy as trying to become a competitor to Amazon to which she says “Etsy sellers are a bunch of mom and pop craft makers. We can’t compete with overseas manufacturing and a company like Amazon. Does the CEO of Etsy know what Etsy actually is?”

In a statement to The Daily Beast regarding the strike Etsy COO Raina Moskowitz said “Our sellers’ success is a top priority for Etsy. We are always receptive to seller feedback and the new fee structure will enable us to increase our investments in areas outlined in the petition including marketing customer support and removing listings that don't meet our policies. We are committed to providing great value for our 5.3 million sellers so they can grow their businesses while keeping Etsy a beloved trusted and thriving marketplace.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbGVtbmV3cy5uZXQvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDQvY29va2llLXNhbGVzLWFpZC11a3JhaW5pYW4tcmVmdWdlZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cookie sales aid Ukrainian refugees | News Sports Jobs,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.salemnews.net/news/local-news/2022/04/cookie-sales-aid-ukrainian-refugees/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbGVtbmV3cy5uZXQvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDQvY29va2llLXNhbGVzLWFpZC11a3JhaW5pYW4tcmVmdWdlZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDQvMjQvb3Bpbmlvbi9jdWx0dXJlL25vLXJlZ3JldHMtbWFyaWtvLXl1Z2V0YS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion | Mariko Yugeta and the Motivating Power of Regret,"American culture is saturated with advice on managing regret — which generally amounts to pretending we don’t experience it.

The message is clear: Regret is self-defeating backward-looking a negative feeling to avoid at all costs.

""There are great places for the kids to hang out meet

VALENCIA CA April 23 2022 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Jubil and Sini had lived in Santa Clarita for more than 15 years raising two children in a condominium. ""Noel and Ivana are now adolescents and they both wanted their own bedroom and bath and hangout spots away from us—we had clearly outgrown the condo"" said Jubil.



""Sini and I had our wish lists too"" Jubil added. ""We were running out of storage space we wanted more bedrooms and baths and we wanted a back yard large enough to enjoy the outdoors and grow plants and flowers.""



The family found their fit at Wisteria by Lennar purchasing a Plan Four and moving to their new place in December. Sini reports that the decision to buy here was not difficult. ""We had looked at pre-owned homes but crossed them off because they needed work and that equals expense and time and hassles"" she said. ""Our new home was slightly more expensive than the pre-owned we looked at but we got to pick our finishes and we got built-in solar—this home was ready for us.""



Plan Four is a two-story design with approximately 3402 square feet of living space. Its two-bay garage provides a private owner entry while guest arrival is from the hospitable porch which opens to high ceilings and a graceful stair. Beyond the great room features an open kitchen with work island and casual seating dining and family lounge and expansive views to the rear yard. ""Our new home has a good back yard big enough to suit us and yet not overwhelming"" said Jubil.""



Jubil and Sini also picked Plan Four's optional Next Gen suite for this level. It features a bedroom and bath seating area kitchenette stacked washer/dryer and entries from hall and side yard. ""Our parents live in India and this suite will make it easy for them to enjoy extended stays!"" said Sini.



Upstairs Plan Four features an opulent primary suite with compartmented bath walk-in wardrobe and overlook views to the rear yard.

J. Chris Martin a former employee who used to head the resource group said that a different flag featuring the Exxon logo on a rainbow background “was flown at many company locations last year without question” but that he had been told that approval to display that flag had been revoked “without explanation.”

“I’m also told that the employee resource groups were consulted only in a perfunctory way regarding this matter based on momentary discomfort with displaying a symbol of open-mindedness and support for long-suppressed voices” he said.

“While they may say nobody has lost anything the symbolism is unmistakable” he added.

The Human Rights Campaign an organization that works to end discrimination against lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people criticized the company for the policy saying on Twitter: “There’s no such thing as ‘neutrality’ when it comes to our rights. Our flag isn’t just a visual representation of our identities. It is also a staple of allyship.”

The decision first reported by Bloomberg News came as corporations have increasingly been pressed to be more outspoken on cultural and political issues. Disney long quiet on such matters has been in a fight with Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida over a new state law officially known as “Parental Rights in Education” — or to its critics “Don’t Say Gay.” The measure prohibits classroom instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity in some elementary school grades.

Investing for the long haul is a long-proven way to build wealth and patience is well-rewarded for those who pick well and let great companies take care of their businesses and their investors.

Heck if you had put $10000 in the S&P 500 say 20 years ago and let it run that stake would have returned a cool $58940 counting dividends and share price gain through that metric known as total return.

And if you'd rather choose individual equities you don't have to chase growth stocks with all their volatility. You can go slow and steady and just buy stocks in companies that do warehouses office buildings and shopping centers.

Here are three real estate investment trusts (REITs) that do just that and each has soundly beaten the S&P 500 over the past two decades while providing respectable dividend yields along the way.

Prologis the warehouse behemoth

Prologis (PLD 2.95%) is not just the biggest of industrial REITs; by market cap it's the largest of the more than 225 publicly traded REITs. Behind that current valuation of about $128 billion is a portfolio of nearly a billion square feet of critical warehouse and distribution space serving 5500 customers from about 4700 facilities in 19 countries.

While on a particularly hot streak like any other major owner of property in the very hot logistics space San Francisco-based Prologis also has a long record of rewarding shareholders providing a total return over the past 20 years of 1140% more than twice that of the S&P 500. It's raised its dividend for nine straight years too and is currently yielding about 1.83%.

Long-term demand for consumer e-commerce and business-to-business space doesn't appear to be abating and Prologis looks to keep growing its share continuing its internal expansion while reports circulate of possible acquisitions in Europe.

Alexandria Real Estate Equities does offices but not just any offices

Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE -0.13%) provides office and laboratory space to many of the biggest names in the biopharma business including the new Moderna headquarters near Boston.

This office REIT now has a market cap of about $33 billion has been around since the 1990s and concentrates its business in collaborative campus clusters in its hometown of San Diego and in and around San Francisco Seattle New York City North Carolina's Research Triangle and the Washington D.C. area.

Alexandria has been steadily growing for a long time and has seen increased momentum as demand grew for its current space -- and anything more it could develop -- during the pandemic. That can be expected to help the company continue a streak of 12 years of dividend increases that are rewarding shareholders with a current yield of about 2.29%.

Federal Realty Investment Trust is a Dividend King

Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT 0.95%) is a retail REIT a somewhat battered sector in which to find a Dividend King. That means it's one of about 30 members of the S&P 500 that have raised its dividend for 50 straight years.

For Federal Realty make that 54 years giving this Bethesda Maryland-based proprietor of high-quality retail-based properties the longest such record among all REITs.

The company currently has a portfolio of about 104 properties mostly in desirable areas in the Boston San Francisco Los Angeles and Washington D.C. markets. With a market cap of just shy of $10 billion this REIT is the smallest of the three here but its slow and steady performance through good times and bad stands it well for the future and currently pays shareholders a yield of about 3.50%.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3Rvd25iZWUuY29tLzA0MjMyMDIyL2JvYXJkLW9mLXJlYWx0b3JzLWNvbmR1Y3RpbmctYW5pbWFsLXNoZWx0ZXItZG9uYXRpb24tZHJpdmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Board Of Realtors Conducting Animal Shelter Donation Drive,"Newtown Board of Realtors is conducting a Newtown Animal Shelter Donation Drive in conjunction with the upcoming Strutt Your Mutt Dog Walk.

Exclusive PropTrack data shows that the top 10 electorates for rent price growth are all in regional areas with every one safely held by the Liberal National Party (LNP).

And they range from coastal and hinterland locations to mining university and military regions.

Top of the unenviable pack for soaring rental price growth is the Wide Bay electorate which also holds the title as home to Queensland’s tightest rental market.

There the median rent for houses across the electorate has soared from $360 in 2019 to $510 while unit rents have climbed to $550 up from $390 in 2019.

Held by Llew O’Brien (Nationals) with a healthy margin of 13.1 per cent the rental crisis has been most acutely felt in Maryborough where the vacancy rate is 0.1 per cent.

Ray White Maryborough principal Guy Meredith said vacancy rates were still at record lows with tenants taking the “price rises on the chin”.

“It is tough mate but they don’t have a choice” he said.

“We have 30-plus applications per property and the majority are good applicants.

“It is just a lottery and I don’t really know where they go to be honest.”

The Flynn electorate which is held by Ken O’Dowd (Liberals) with a margin of 8.7 per cent has had the second highest increase in rents since 2019 up 31 per cent across houses and units combined.

Home to towns such as Gladstone ($340) Emerald ($390) and Agnes Water ($490) vacancies are tight across the region.

But with O’Dowd retiring the ALP’s Matt Burnett who is the mayor of Gladstone is a strong contender to take the seat albeit he will go up against well-known local MP Colin Boyce for the LNP.

The Capricornia electorate which is held by Michelle Landry (Nationals) with a 12.4 per cent margin has seen rents rise 27 per cent since the last election – the third highest rise in the state.

Of the top 10 electorates with the highest combined rent increases all have very healthy margins in favour of their LNP incumbents – Fairfax (13.4) McPherson (12.2) Fadden (13.4) Fisher (12.7) Hinkler (14.5) Moncrieff (15.4) and Herbert (8.4).

The Herbert electorate which takes in most of Townsville and its surrounds is held by former soldier Phillip Thompson who will go up against firefighter and ex-serviceman John Ring (ALP).

There current available rentals range from $1300 a week for a house on Castle Hill to $150 for a room in a share house with the vacancy rate just 0.7 per cent.

John Gribbin of John Gribbin Realty which has one of the biggest rental rolls in Townsville said vacancy rates were still tight but said investors were only just now starting to see returns similar to the last boom more than a decade ago.

“People forget that” he said. “Rent prices started to improve after the floods (2019) and now Townsville is full of people but that comes after the region saw a drain of people leave after the mining downturn.

“Rents now are not much different to what they were back in 2008/09 so investors really are just getting back to where they should have been.”

As a result Mr Gribbin said the region was again attracting new investors.

“But we still need a few things to happen as we do not have enough properties but hopefully the Reinsurance Pool will encourage the construction of more strata complexes to ease that vacancy pressure.”

Nationally three of the top 10 electorates with the highest rent increases for houses were in Queensland – Wide Bay (42%) Flynn (29%) and Fairfax (27%).

Wide Bay was second only to the vast electorate of Durack in Western Australia where rents there have soared by a staggering 49 per cent since the 2019 election.

On the Gold Coast all three of its electorates – McPherson (23%) Fadden (22%) and Moncrieff (20%) – saw substantial rent increases across both houses and units with the surge on the back of record-high interstate migration.

Vacancy rates fell to 0.6 per cent during the last quarter of 2021 compared to 2 per cent at the last election.

Every Queensland electorate has seen rents go up since 2019 but those with the lowest increases of around 11 per cent for houses can be found in Forde (LNP) Maranoa (LNP) Moreton (ALP) Rankin (ALP) and Blair (ALP).

For units Moreton boasts the lowest rent increase at just 2 per cent followed by Forde (3%) and Oxley (5%).

Real Estate Institute of Queensland CEO Antonia Mercorella said 36 per cent of people living in Queensland were renters.

“It’s no secret that affordability is a hot topic sure to be on voter’s minds as it increasingly becomes a prevalent issue all around Australia” Ms Mercorella said.

“While we acknowledge that we can’t just rely on the Federal Government to tackle housing affordability we would expect that the public would support parties prepared to put politics aside and work together with all levels of government to develop a bipartisan plan to address housing affordability and better planning for our future housing needs.

“As private investors do the heavy lifting when it comes to housing Queenslanders we would like to see government introducing more initiatives that recognise this and encourage investment in our state.”

Tenants Queensland CEO Penny Carr said housing affordability needed to be front of mind.

“We have tenants who are too afraid to ask for repairs to challenge anything” Ms Carr said.

“We have created a system where residential property has become an investment class yet there are people with kids living in cars camping.

“Housing needs to be a right and even if a person can’t buy they should feel secure with a roof over their head.”

PropTrack economist Angus Moore said regional Queensland in particular had seen significant migration from interstate where inner city rents had dropped as a result.

“It is the perfect storm with investors selling up in 2020/21 and a lot of rentals going to owner-occupiers interstate migration natural disasters” he said.

“We have started to see investor credit pick up but the only long term solution is to build more housing.”

Mr Moore said that rents had increased faster than rental assistance adding that was one area within the control of whichever party ends up in power.",,,,,,

(NYSE: FDX) and one of the world’s largest express transportation companies today announced the launch of its first zero-tailpipe emissions electric vehicles for use in Thailand. The first four electric vehicles consisting of a midsize van two full-size vans and a 6-wheeler straight truck began their deployment last month and will initially operate in Bangkok.

This is part of the FedEx Priority Earth initiative with vehicle electrification as one of the key areas in the company’s journey toward reaching its carbon neutral operations goal. The FedEx commitment to gradually reduce environmental impacts includes the goal of operating an all-electric global pickup and delivery (PUD) fleet by 2040. This will be carried out through a phased approach for FedEx Express: 50% of all new vehicle purchases are intended to be electric by 2025 rising to 100% by 2030.

“Our efforts to operate more sustainably apply in all areas throughout our network” said Woon Tien Long Managing Director Operations FedEx Express Thailand. “As we mark 40 years in Thailand this represents another step toward achieving our sustainability goals. At FedEx with thriving e-commerce and our increased focus to support our customers’ growth plans transforming our operations to be more sustainable has become significantly important now more than ever. We are working toward building the network for what’s next and along with it working to reduce our environmental impact and this is clear proof of that.”

Celebrating its 40th anniversary in Thailand this year FedEx is continuing to build on its long-term commitment to the country through job creation infrastructure investments support for communities where team members live and work and fostering initiatives toward a more sustainable future.

Since the launch of local operations in 1983 FedEx has tripled in size and expanded to more than 400 motorized vehicles 16 service centers and 14 stations to date. With a tailored approach to using resources efficiently and responsibly by focusing on reducing replacing and revolutionizing both in the skies and on the ground FedEx continually looks for ways to innovate and optimize its fleet.

The company is also focused on community outreach with initiatives that have included the Adopt-A-School program with AMCHAM FedEx Safe Kids program and the Junior Achievement International Trade Challenge.

The BrightDrop Zevo 600 formerly known as the BrightDrop EV600 completed the nearly 260-mile (418 km) trip from New York City to Washington D.C. driven by Stephen Marlin.

According to the press release as part of the journey the Zevo 600 transported a shipment of Full Circle sustainable cleaning products from its headquarters in New York City to a MOM’s Organic Market location in Washington D.C. a Mid-Atlantic chain of family-owned and operated organic grocery stores.

FedEx is a strategic first customer of BrightDrop EVs which received the first units in December 2021.

The company says that the Zevo 600's driving range is roughly 250 miles (400 km). It indicates that the team exceeded the nominal range during the run.

Travis Katz BrightDrop president and CEO said:

“Since the beginning the Zevo 600 has been a record-setting vehicle. Now we’re seeing firsthand what BrightDrop can do by pairing our zero-operating-emissions technology with FedEx a leader in the transportation and delivery industry. Having a long battery range with reliable power is critical to electrifying delivery fleets everywhere. This special delivery highlights our products’ advanced capabilities and our mission to decarbonize deliveries.”

BrightDrop so far has secured more than 25000 production reservations for Zevo 600 and Zevo 400 models including 2500 from FedEx. Other customers interested in those all-new electric commercial vehicles are Merchants Fleet (up to 18000) and Walmart (up to 5000).

The driver of a white Hyundai involved in a crash with a gray Dodge at the intersection of Highway 95 and Meadows Drive was declared dead on the scene police officials confirmed. Emergency crews from Bullhead City and Fort Mojave Mesa Fire departments responded about 3:20 p.m. to reports of the collision. Police officials at the scene reported witnesses stated the driver of the Dodge was southbound on Highway 95 at a high rate of speed when it collided in the intersection with the northbound Hyundai making a westbound turn onto Meadows Drive. Four adults and one child from the Dodge were transported to Western Arizona Regional Medical Center with unknown injuries fire officials said. One of the occupants of the Dodge had to be extricated from the vehicle by fire department crews. The Dodge came to rest on the grass in front of the Palo Verde Professional Plaza after colliding with a retaining wall and trees after the collision. The Hyundai blocked the inside southbound lane of Highway 95. Northbound traffic was reduced to one lane and southbound lanes of Highway 95 were diverted into Palo Verde Professional Plaza at Meadows Drive for more than an hour as crews worked the scene. The crash is under investigation. The Meadows Drive crash closely followed an emergency response to an injury collision at Highway 95 and Richardo Avenue a little more than half and hour earlier. Two people were taken to Valley View Medical Center in Fort Mohave with non-critical injuries said Bullhead City Fire Department Battalion Chief Marvin McCabe.

Meanwhile this week Atlanta United finally found the clinical finishing touch it's been looking for. After failing to find the back of the net the previous two matches the six-goal performance on Wednesday was a confidence boost for the team heading back into MLS play.

The two clubs meet after both won to advance in Open Cup competition. With a 1-0 win over Miami FC Inter Miami continued the success it’s found as of late. The team has won two straight in MLS and scored three goals against New England Revolution.

The result sent Atlanta United into the Round of 32 . For its next U.S. Open Cup matchup Atlanta will face another MLS club: Nashville SC on May 11. Atlanta United has three more matches in MLS before then. Up first Inter Miami this weekend.

Atlanta United returns to MLS competition with a matchup against Inter Miami CF at DRV PNK Stadium on Sunday April 24. Kickoff is scheduled for 1:00 p.m. ET.

Matchday Conditions

The conditions in Florida are expected to be warm similar to the warm front going through Atlanta at the end of the week. The weather at kickoff on Sunday is forecasted to be around sunny with a high of 81 degrees.

With that in mind Atlanta United’s game plan will be to try and control possession and force Inter Miami to run.

“We’re going to go into the game obviously with a hard mentality” midfielder Amar Sejdić said. “It’s a 1 p.m. game so we’re expecting it’s going to be hot and humid.”

About The Opponent

Inter Miami CF is an Eastern Conference club based in South Florida. The club is one of the newer ones to MLS beginning play in March 2020.

In January 2021 the club announced Phil Neville as head coach. Neville gained most of his coaching experience in England where he’s from. He had coaching stints as an assistant at Valencia CF and Manchester United. Most recently he managed the England women’s national team and led the squad to a SheBelieves Cup title in 2019.

""They are very solid they are very compact” head coach Gonzalo Pineda said. “They try to make it hard to break them down. And then in transition they’re very good.”

Series History

Atlanta United and Inter Miami have played each other remarkably even. The all-time record is split both sides winning twice and playing to a draw three times. All seven meetings have been either draws or decided by one goal. And in those seven meetings both teams have scored and conceded seven times.

This is the first of two meetings in 2022. Last time out on October 27 2021 Inter Miami traveled to Mercedes-Benz Stadium and got on the board first thanks to a forward Gonzalo Higuain’s penalty kick in the 32nd minute. Then Atlanta United climbed back to win 2-1. Araújo scored the equalizer on a direct free kick and Josef Martínez delivered the game-winner in the 73rd minute.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3RoZWN1cC51cy8yMDIyLzA0LzIzLzIwMjItdXMtb3Blbi1jdXAtcm91bmQtMy1hdGxhbnRhLXVuaXRlZC1iZWdpbi1kZWxheWVkLXRpdGxlLWRlZmVuc2Utd2l0aC1ibG93b3V0LW9mLWNoYXR0YW5vb2dhLWZjL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 US Open Cup Round 3: Atlanta United begin delayed title defense with blowout of Chattanooga FC,"Nearly two years and eight months after it hoisted the U.S. Open Cup in front of more than 35700 fans at Mercedes-Benz Stadium Atlanta United opened its long-awaited title defense in convincing fashion.

Behind a trio of first-half goals in the span of a quarter-hour – including a first-half brace from Dom Dwyer – and three more in the second half Atlanta cruised to a comprehensive 6-0 victory over the NISA’s Chattanooga FC at Fifth Third Bank Stadium in Kennesaw Ga.

Marcelino Moreno added a goal from the penalty spot and Luiz Araujo and Brooks Lennon each added second-half tallies of their own as well as Atlanta booked its place in the Open Cup’s Round of 32 966 days after defeating Minnesota United 2-1 in the 2019 US Open Cup Final.

It was the positive start to the competition the Five Stripes needed. Captain and goalkeeper Brad Guzan suffered a ruptured Achilles during a league match against FC Cincinnati on Saturday while the club was already without Josef Martinez following a knee procedure weeks prior.

“I told the team that they (showed) good intensity today” said Atlanta head coach Gonzalo Pineda. “I was very happy with how fast we moved the ball from side to side and especially on the ground and especially through the midfielders. When we did that we were really dangerous.”

Atlanta opened the scoring in the 21st minute through Ronald Hernandez as Andrew Gutman’s cross into the scoring area found the Venezuelan right back. Hernandez snuck it past Chattanooga goalkeeper Kevin Gonzalez for just his second goal for the club to make it a 1-0 lead for the hosts.

The advantage grew to 2-0 just minutes later in the 25th as Dwyer flicked a well-timed header into the net following a perfect ball from Jake Mulraney. Dwyer made it a double for himself in the 35th as he lasered a strike from outside the box to increase Atlanta’s lead to 3-0.

“He’s an experienced No. 9 in this league that we know is able and capable of scoring goals” Pineda said. “It was good to see that performance…I’m very happy for him and his confidence.”

That makes three goals in as many appearances with Atlanta for the former U.S. international once one of MLS’s most lethal strikers but now looking to rediscover his scoring touch after a spell of disappointing form over the past several years.

“Honestly I’m in a good place” Dwyer said of joining the club after two years at Toronto FC and several seasons at Atlanta rival Orlando City SC prior to that. “Atlanta’s believed in me as a club and signed me to a multiple-year contract so for me it’s trying to perform each week whether I’m asked to start or come off the bench or whatever it is”

For Dwyer it was his 10th and 11th career US Open Cup goals which is fourth most in the Modern Era (1995-present). Dwyer scored three for Orlando City in 2013 (as a member of USL Pro) before scoring six between the 2015 and the Open Cup winning 2017 Sporting Kansas City teams.

Atlanta United weren’t done though. Mulraney was taken down in the box near the end line leading referee Matthew Thompson to point to the spot. Moreno stepped up and converted the resulting penalty to make it 4-0 less than 10 minutes into the second half. Araujo added Atlanta’s fifth goal with a nifty finish in the 67th while Brooks Lennon capped the scoring in the 84th minute as Atlanta improved to 5-0-0 all-time in Open Cup play at Fifth Third Bank Stadium.

It was in stark contrast to Saturday’s league match against Cincinnati a 0-0 stalemate that followed a 1-0 loss to expansion side Charlotte FC. With a club Open Cup record six-goal effort against Chattanooga though Pineda expressed hope that the performance would kickstart a flagging attack starting with Sunday afternoon’s league contest at Inter Miami CF.

“ were a bit more composed in the final third even though still there were some chances that we let go because the last touch the last pass wasn’t quite there” Pineda said. “I felt that today they gained confidence…Hopefully is that night that will help us in the future to score more goals.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9jb21pbmctZG96ZW5zLWtyb2dlci1zdG9yZXMtbmVhci0wMjAwMDUzMzIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coming to (dozens of) Kroger stores near you: bigger belted self-checkout lanes,"Attention Kroger shoppers: Are you that customer who heads into the store for a couple of items and ends up getting well 15 or 20 things?

You really want to zip out so you head to the self-checkout and it's a little awkward with all your items. Oops. It's not just you – in fact a lot of people do that.

In the coming weeks dozens of local Kroger stores in greater Cincinnati Northern Kentucky and the Dayton area will get a couple of new larger self-checkout lanes that the supermarket giant has been testing in Columbus.

At the new stations shoppers will still scan their own purchases but once an item is swiped a belt moves it to a bagging station. There's no cashier but a courtesy clerk will bag your groceries.

Olivia Shrewsbery left of Hilliard uses the new conveyer belt self check out at the Kroger store in Dublin Ohio. Kroger is experimenting with a self-checkout technology where shoppers use a conveyor checkout.

As Kroger and many retailers continue to grapple with a nationwide labor shortage the new checkout system might be just the thing to speed the checkout process.

""We are excited to roll out this new enhancement to the customer shopping experience"" said Kroger spokeswoman Jenifer Moore

Kroger is testing out a new self-checkout machine that uses a conveyor belt for shoppers with larger purchases at the Oakley Kroger.

Until this month only two stores in the nation – both in the Columbus area – were testing the lanes. This spring 42 stores or roughly a third of local Cincinnati region stores will get two lanes apiece. The first ones were installed last week.

On Thursday Libby Bien a 21-year-old Xavier University nursing student from Norwood tried it out at the Kroger Marketplace on Marburg Avenue in Oakley – and gave it high marks.

""I like it I like self-checkout – I can't remember the last time I used a lane with a live checker"" Bien said.

Bien said it was an improvement because she also prefers to stock up when she shops and visit the store less. That's a problem in the self-checkout because the unit typically pauses around 20 items and has to be restarted by a nearby attendant.

""It always beeps out at you"" Bien said.

Noah Derese a 25-year-old Clifton resident and student at the University of Cincinnati said he has the same problem: he prefers self-checkout but wants to scan more items per visit.

""I try to keep it just under the limit but it still goes off"" Derese said. ""This is some concept!""

In addition to Kroger stores the Cincinnati-based grocer operates several regional supermarket chains in 35 states including Fred Meyer Harris Teeter Ralphs Mariano's Fry's Smith's King Soopers QFC and others. The company has nearly 2800 stores and employs 465000 workers.

West Michigan's music scene

The busiest — and priciest — concert season in Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park history sparked a robust response from ticket buyers on the first day of sales to Meijer Gardens members.

Today’s opening salvo of online ticket sales produced 11 sellouts of summer 2022 shows within two hours with tickets for Norah Jones’ July 17 appearance gone shortly after 9 a.m. followed by the Goo Goo Dolls (Sept. 15) and Foreigner (Sept. 18).

Also selling out this morning: Fitz & The Tantrums/St. Paul & The Broken Bones Sheryl Crow/Allison Russell O.A.R./Chris Trapper Michael Franti & Spearhead/Tropidelic America Lake Street Dive/Madison Cunningham The Beach Boys and Boz Scaggs/Robert Cray Band.

Indeed Meijer Gardens sold more than 44000 tickets — or 70 percent of those available for the series — in the first hour alone signaling pent-up demand for the outdoor shows.

“We’re once again overwhelmed at the support of members of Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park and very happy with how sales went this morning” said communications director John VanderHaagen.

“We understand that some people are disappointed that they weren’t able to purchase tickets to all of the shows that they might have wanted to attend but that is one of the drawbacks of having such an intimate venue. Supply is low while demand is high.”

The 2022 series features a record 33 concerts kicking off June 12 with Marc Cohn and Blind Boys of Alabama and wrapping up with Foreigner on Sept. 18. Tickets are sold online via Etix.com or by calling 1-800-514-3849.

Today’s sellouts came in spite of higher price tags for 2022 tickets. Eight concerts are priced at $90 or more and the average public ticket price for 2022 is $73.91 a 22 percent increase from 2021. As with many venues post-COVID cost increases have pushed prices higher withVanderHaagen noting that the prices “are a direct reflection of our costs associated with bringing these high-quality acts to Grand Rapids; artist fees are on the rise.”

The amphitheater will also host an expanded edition of the Tuesday Evening Music Club series featuring local and regional acts adding June shows to the usual July-August schedule with that lineup announced in the near future.

Here’s the 2022 schedule with sellouts as of noon Saturday (April 23).

So it’s fitting that on Earth Day the organization announced its on track to become the first zoo to achieve net zero energy waste and water status.

What You Need To Know The Cincinnati Zoo believes it will soon achieve net zero energy waste and water statue



The original goal was 2025 but they now think they'll surpass it



The zoo installed its first solar panels in 2011



Keeping trash out of the landfill has been the most troublesome part so far but the Zoo has a plan in place

Achieving that status means the facility will consume only as much energy as it produces use only as much water as it collects and not send anything to the landfill.

The Cincinnati Zoo set the net zero goal back in 2018 as part of its More Home to Roam capital campaign. Back then they viewed it as attainable by 2025. But as of Friday they believe they can accomplish the feat sooner.

Though he didn’t provide an expected completion date Mark Fisher the zoo’s vice president of facilities and sustainability said the zoo is already so far along with its progress that getting to net zero status before 2025 is well within reach.

“For a long time we assured people that 100% sustainable is attainable” Fisher said. “It is but why stop there if we know we can do better? We can produce more than 100% of the energy that we need and share the additional power with our neighbors.”

The process really got started back in 2011 when the zoo installed a 1.56-megawatt solar array over its main parking lot. It plans to build another solar array over a new surface lot this summer and then install a battery storage system. Doing so will enable the zoo to create its own energy microgrid.

A 25-megawatt array that’s 16 times the size of the Zoo’s parking lot structure is being erected at the Zoo’s Bowyer Farm and will move the site from net zero to net positive meaning they’re producing more energy than they’re using.

“These long-term investments end up paying for themselves and ultimately save us money” Fisher said. “They also reduce our environmental impact and help us model sustainable practices. When our neighbors and peers see the benefits of what we’re doing they are likely to do it too and that is what has to happen in order to move the needle.”

Water conservation has been taking place at the zoo for years. They catch and store rainwater which has saved 2 billion gallons of water. Doing so also “kept water and sewer overflow out of neighbors’ basements” in Avondale the Cincinnati Zoo said in a statement.

The stormwater retention tanks buried under Africa and Roo Valley can hold up to 500000 gallons of water enough to provide most of the water used in habitats and pools around the zoo. They’ll eclipse that need after they complete their new Elephant Trek habitat. That will increase their capacity by 1 million gallons enough to satisfy all the Zoo’s water needs.

Fisher said the zoo has cut its water costs by 80% in the last 10 years. That zoo estimates that figure to be about $10 million.

The Cincinnati Zoo has been trialing an aerobic bio-digester to turn organic waste into a soil amending product it can use in its gardens. The plan is to get the internal logistics figured out before installing a much larger unit in 2023 as part of the Elephant Trek habitat.

It will handle most of the zoo’s organic waste including food waste and animal waste as well.

The zoo plans to “spread the love” by selling the soil enhancer produced by the biodigester Fisher said. Once the organic waste processing and reuse system is working the zoo will be 90% of the way to net zero waste. The other 10 percent will come from a robust recycling program.

The zoo performed a waste audit earlier this to collect data that will help enhance its mainstream specialty and organic waste recycling efforts.

Information gathered will go toward the creation of a list of hard to recycle items and items that can’t go into mainstream recycling. Plans call for the development of a specialty recycling program.

The zoo discovered that paper waste eligible for recycling was being thrown away by mistake. The zoo plans an awareness campaign to educate guests and visitors about where to put certain kinds of trash.

“We’ll get there but it’s a difficult task at a facility that attracts more than 1.5 million guests annually and has thousands of plants and animals that produce organic waste” Fisher said.

The Cincinnati Zoo proudly wears the title “greenest zoo in America.”

The team is known for its plant and animal conservation efforts. But they partner with various local organizations on other green initiatives as well.



For instance they teamed up with the Cincinnati Reds Procter and Gamble and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center to create an Urban Learning Garden at Rockdale Academy in Avondale.

In 2017 zoo personnel also looked at energy efficiency improvements in apartment buildings churches and other spaces throughout Avondale with the goal of extending the zoo’s energy efficiency efforts into the neighborhood.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL25ld3MuYWJwbGl2ZS5jb20vc2NpZW5jZS9zb2xhci1lY2xpcHNlLW9uLW1heS0xLWtub3ctd2hlbi1hbmQtaG93LXRvLXdhdGNoLWZpcnN0LXNvbGFyLWVjbGlwc2Utb2YtdGhlLXllYXItb25saW5lLXBhcnRpYWwtc29sYXItZWNsaXBzZS0xNTI4MDUz0gGbAWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hYnBsaXZlLmNvbS9zY2llbmNlL3NvbGFyLWVjbGlwc2Utb24tbWF5LTEta25vdy13aGVuLWFuZC1ob3ctdG8td2F0Y2gtZmlyc3Qtc29sYXItZWNsaXBzZS1vZi10aGUteWVhci1vbmxpbmUtcGFydGlhbC1zb2xhci1lY2xpcHNlLTE1MjgwNTMvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Solar Eclipse On May 1: Know When And How To Watch First Solar Eclipse Of The Year Online,"New Delhi: The first solar eclipse of the year will be a partial solar eclipse. It will be visible from southern South America parts of Antarctica and over the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans on April 30. Though the solar eclipse will not be visible from India it can be seen online.

For people in India the partial eclipse will begin on May 1 at 12:15 am IST.

What Is A Partial Solar Eclipse?

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon comes between the Sun and Earth casting a shadow on Earth or partially blocking the Sun's light in some areas according to NASA.

During a partial solar eclipse the Moon and the Sun are not perfectly aligned in a straight line. Therefore the Moon does not completely cover the Sun. This gives the Sun a crescent shape. It appears as though the Moon has taken a bite of the Sun.

The Moon casts only the outer part of its shadow called the penumbra on Earth.

When And How To Watch The Partial Solar Eclipse Online?

The partial solar eclipse will commence on May 1 at 12:15 am IST and end at 4:07 am IST.

The maximum eclipse phase is the one during which the eclipse reaches its maximum magnitude. During this phase 0.6396 per cent of the Sun will be eclipsed. On May 1 the maximum eclipse will occur at 2:11 am IST.

Since the partial solar eclipse will not be visible from India people in the country can watch it online. For instance the YouTube channel 'Gyaan ki gareebi Live' will start broadcasting the eclipse when it begins.

Also timeanddate.com will have a live blog available on its page which will provide live updates of the eclipse.

People can also use the orthographic map provided by NASA which is a detailed map of the eclipse visibility.

An interactive Google map of the eclipse can also be viewed on eclipsewise.com.

A NASA animation shows where and when the partial solar eclipse will be visible. In the animation the bright side of the globe depicts the daytime while the dark side represents the nighttime.

The grey oval-shaped portion shows where the Moon casts its shadow on Earth and where the partial solar eclipse will be visible according to NASA.

Phases Of A Partial Solar Eclipse

A partial solar eclipse has three distinct phases namely the beginning of the partial solar eclipse maximum eclipse phase and end of the partial solar eclipse.

The partial solar eclipse begins when the Moon starts moving over the Sun's disk.

The maximum eclipse phase is the one during which the eclipse reaches its maximum magnitude because the Moon covers more of the Sun's disk than at any other moment during the eclipse.

The partial solar eclipse ends when the Moon stops covering the Sun.

According to earthsky.org a partial solar eclipse occurs 4.7 days before the Moon reaches apogee which is its farthest point from Earth. The Sun is in front of the constellation Aries during a partial solar eclipse.

Solar eclipses occur two to five times a year and can happen only during New Moon. This is because the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth during that phase.

However not every New Moon results in a solar eclipse according to timeanddate.com. This is because the plane of the Moon's orbital path around Earth is inclined at an angle of approximately 5° to the planet's orbital plane around the Sun called the ecliptic. The points where the two orbital planes meet are called lunar nodes and solar eclipses occur only when a New Moon takes place near a lunar node.

About 35 per cent of all solar eclipses are partial solar eclipses which means that they occur more frequently than total or annular solar eclipses according to timeanddate.com.

The partial eclipse will be followed by a lunar eclipse on May 16 2022. Both the eclipses will occur during the same eclipse season which is an approximately 35-day period during which it is inevitable for at least two eclipses to take place. Sometimes three eclipses can occur during the same season.

Baker Mayfield’s new statue at Oklahoma would have had a different pose if it had been up to the quarterback himself.

Oklahoma unveiled the statue on Friday which depicts Mayfield stiff-arming an Oklahoma State player. Mayfield admitted that it was the second-best option solely because athletic director Joe Castiglione would not allow one of Mayfield’s famous flag plant at Ohio State.

Mayfield signaled his arrival on the national scene in 2017 by famously planting an Oklahoma flag on the Ohio State logo after a road upset of the Buckeyes. While obviously controversial and a big sore spot for Ohio State Oklahoma fans loved the act.

""When it comes to the best NBA team logos the Chicago Bulls top the list. It may be no surprise as the team’s classic red and black logo is immediately recognizable across the world"" Online Betting wrote.

It also didn't seem to be a surprise that Chicago was the most intimidating with the ""angry red bull and menacing bloody horns"" as the website described the logo.

Here were the best current logos in the NBA according to the list:

Chicago Bulls Charlotte Hornets Boston Celtics Minnesota Timberwolves Los Angeles Lakers Golden State Warriors Milwaukee Bucks Miami Heat Philadelphia 76ers Dallas Mavericks and Toronto Raptors (tie)

Though the Celtics logo ranked near the top of the best current logos list it also fell at No. 1 for worst logos - so fans seem to be a bit torn over their thoughts on the Lucky Leprechaun.

Under the Bulls for the ""most intimidating"" logos were the Memphis Grizzlies and the Hornets the list showed.

Chicago also came in on top as the ""most timeless logo"" for the classic image of a scowling bull that hasn't changed since 1966.

Many companies have scaled back or stopped their businesses in Russia but that isn’t true for FMC’s big agribusiness competitors like BASF and Syngenta which have significant business supplying seeds and chemicals to the country’s massive food industry Politico has reported.

Ukraine and Russia are both grain powerhouses. And crop production is not subject to various sanctions placed on Moscow. Companies say humanitarian concerns over food availability for Russian citizens and other countries justify their continued presence in Russia.

Among the giants Swiss agrochemicals group Syngenta employs around 800 people in Russia and 730 in Ukraine. It said in late March it has no plans to withdraw from Russia Reuters reported in late March.

FMC meanwhile operated a plant in the Russian town of Cheboksary about a 10-hour drive east of Moscow that formulated and packaged crop protection products for Russia and Kazakhstan. The company employed 83 workers and 20 contractors.

FMC described the exit announced on April 14 as simply walking away from the plant.

The company said that reports of war crimes and human rights abuses led to the decision after initially suspending new capital investments marketing and advertising and discontinuing research and development.

“Our values as a company and the realities of unprecedented sanctions no longer allow FMC to grow our business in Russia” Mark Douglas the company’s chief executive officer said in a statement. “FMC condemns the invasion and war and we join calls to end the violence immediately” he added.

FMC which acquired DuPont Co.’s pesticides business in 2017 was committed to helping farmers protect their crops and yields the company said.

FMC based in a University City tower said it has raised $270000 globally for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent in Ukraine.

FMC has 36 employees in Kyiv. They are still employed but working remotely. “We have been checking in on them regularly and we hear they’re OK” FMC spokesperson Lars Weborg said.

FMC’s stock has risen by about 15% over the last year going from $113 to close at $132.65 on Friday.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The actual birthday for those who pay attention to such things was February 4.

But as the automaker's next century dawns it finds itself at another turning point not unusual for a company that has faced many from the start.

The purchase of Lincoln by Ford was an act of revenge. After Henry Ford was forced out of his second car company Henry Leland was brought in by the board and the company was renamed Cadillac. Leland went on to establish the Lincoln Motor Company to build aircraft engines and by 1920 cars. Its first vehicle the Model L reached showrooms during the short sharp depression of 1920-21. Lincoln entered receivership and Henry Ford nabbed Lincoln for $8 million forcing Leland out and installing his son 28-year-old Edsel Ford as president.

It was fortuitous as Edsel's eye for design eventually resulted in such cars as the Art Deco 1936 Lincoln Zephyr followed four years later by the Lincoln Continental. But Edsel's unexpected death in 1943 deprived the company of its most discerning eye. Lincoln would thereafter struggle with its design. There were models that followed that are revered such as the elegant 1956 Continental Mark II and 1961 Lincoln Continental the 1968 neo-classic Lincoln Continental Mark III the muscular yet luxurious 1983 Lincoln Mark VII and the stately 1990 Town Car. But the brand has just as often had moments where it lost its aesthetic mojo: the bulbous 1949 Lincoln Cosmopolitan the generic 1953 Lincoln Capri the outrageous 1958 Lincoln Premiere the disco-ready Continental Mark IV and more recently the morbidly obese 2010 Lincoln MKT.

But under former design director David Woodhouse the brand regained its design moxie with the 2016 Lincoln Continental 2018 Navigator and the 2020 Lincoln Corsair. As a result the brand has prospered with average transaction price rising $19000 over last five years and the Navigator now attracting Lincoln's youngest buyers at 50 years old.

But looking ahead Lincoln is electrifying its lineup planning three new electric vehicles (EVs) by 2025 with a fourth to follow in 2026. By mid-decade Joy Falotico president of Lincoln said the luxury brand expects more than half of its sales will come from EVs. Some models will remain such as the Corsair which will reemerge as the Corsair-E. But others like the current Lincoln Nautilus will vanish.

To show what that could mean Lincoln debuted its new Lincoln Star Concept vehicle at a flashy event in Hollywood Wednesday night that included an appearance by Matthew McConaughey.

The Lincoln Star Concept designed under Lincoln Global Design Director Kemal Curic is built on Ford's rear- and all-wheel-drive flexible battery electric architecture and looks like nothing Lincoln has ever created.

""This doesn't have a proxy; it doesn't have a reference. This is a new species"" said John Jraiche global product director for Lincoln.

This is why the new vehicle has little if any reference to Lincoln's typical design cues and lacks chrome of any kind. Instead designers use backlit LED lighting on its front fascia and the edge of its front trunk the compartment typically used to house a gas engine. It's topped by a translucent electrochromic lid that turns opaque when the car is parked. An LED light band runs rearward from atop the windshield a design detail nicked from the 1956 Continental Mark II.

The Lincoln Star Concept is notable for its relative lack of any sort of heritage design aside from the star logos used on the car -- which have been redesigned -- and the shape of the rear taillights which were inspired by shape of the 1961 Continental's chrome taillight trim.

Inside unique trim details include crystal foot pedal and center console trim accented with etched Lincoln star. Its steering wheel can be hidden and the front seats can be rotated to face the rear seats. You'll also find the front windshield pillars are made of a 3D-printed metal latticework and covered on the exterior by glass. Its design is replicated elsewhere on the concept. It remains to be seen whether this will reach production but it eliminates a blind spot and lends the cabin a feeling of space.

And space is this concept's most impressive attribute. There's enough of it to house twin reclining rear seats. In fact the rear seat is positively indulgent with including hidden shoe storage fold-down tables and a fridge. There's also Lincoln Attaché a hidden compartment in the rear door for charging tablets and laptops and seamlessly detect incoming wireless content.

Since future Lincoln's will be sold primarily in the United States and China such opulence particularly in the rear seat is expected. In fact there's enough room for three rows of seats. But Lincoln only fitted two to provide the utmost in lavishness.

""The Lincoln Star Concept has given us the opportunity to showcase how creativity and design thinking at the same time push the boundaries of where we can take the brand in the future"" Curic said.

Well it's no MKT and for that we can all be grateful.

However a glimmer of hope came from the unlikely partnership between Ford and McLaren that resulted in 10 wild Fox bodies.

Photo: Ford Motor Co.

Due to the oil crises of the 1970s that crippled the economy and led to stricter emission regulations the muscle car era seemed like a distant dream. To sell new cars Detroit’s major corporation had to improvise especially since people were getting tired of the economy-focused models that bored them to death.At Ford talks centered around making the third gen Mustang even more appealing. Introduced in 1978 it was an improvement over the hideous Pinto-based model that helped keep the company alive during the first half of the 1970s and like its hideous predecessor the Fox-body ‘Stang was selling like hotcakes. In 1979 dealers sold a whopping 369936 units – the sixth-best sales year in the history of the nameplate but there was room for more.So how can you make the car even more popular? Build a ludicrous performance model of course. We all know that this endeavor led to the creation of the Special Vehicle Operations Department and the 1984 Mustang SVO which was a terrific yet underrated limited-production car  but the ludicrous performance model I’m alluding to was born several years earlier and it donned McLaren badges.It all starts in 1980 when representatives of a marketing firm commissioned by Ford to explore the feasibility of a thoroughbred performance variant approached McLaren’s American division based in Livonia Michigan with the idea of creating an IMSA-spec race car and a series of closely-related street-legal versions.The idea quickly became the Ford-sanctioned M81 project and in 1981 the race car made its debut at Daytona. With drivers Tom Klauser and John Morton taking turns behind the wheel the McLaren-engineered Mustang managed to finish the 24-hour race despite a crash in the early hours of the event. It crossed the finish line 21st but made headlines all across the globe for being patched up using countless rolls of duct tape.Back in Livonia McLaren engineers had finished 10 road-worthy cars all heavily resembling the Daytona car. Hand-built from production on the stock hatchbacks that were previously stripped to the bare chassis they featured bulging fender flairs grille-less front ends IMSA-style fiberglass hoods with massive scoops and BBS wheels wrapped in Firestone HPR tires.In addition McLaren engineers beefed up the suspension with fully adjustable Koni shocks stiffer springs and sturdier anti-roll bars with tungsten bushings taken from the Fairmont police cruiser.Inside the cars were equipped with a roll cage Recaro LS bucket seats Stewart Warner instrumentation and a Racemark steering wheel Unlike their competition-spec sibling that was powered by a legendary Cosworth BDA the street Mustang McLarens were fitted with the 2.3-liter turbocharged inline-four that Ford wanted to promote to its V8-loving customers. Linked to four-speed manuals these units were blueprinted received ported heads and everything was meticulously fine-tuned by the engineering team with performance and reliability in mind.To comply with emission regulations boost was limited to 5 psi (0.34 bar) so the rated output stood at only 132 hp – the same figure as the standard-spec 2.3-liter turbos. However the engines were more than capable of handling a lot more. Two of the cars were fitted with boost gauges and their turbos could go all the way up to 10 psi (0.69 bar) which translated into close to 180 ponies.Legend has it that with more time and money McLaren could have pushed the four-cylinder well over the 200-hp mark making it more powerful than Ford’s 5.0 V8 but unfortunately that never happened.Although the blue oval’s decision-makers were extremely pleased with the M81 project and a limited production run of 249 units was seriously considered they ultimately chose to redirect funds to the SVO division which was also developing a performance-oriented ‘Stang The completed cars were sold for $25000 ($79000 today) each and now and again one goes under the hammer. In 2020 chassis number 0F03A308227 was sold at a Barrett-Jackson event for only $37400.By today’s standards calling the Mustang McLaren M81 a performance car is laughable. Its output figure wasn’t particularly mind-blowing four decades ago either but it is unquestionably the wildest-looking Fox-body of them all. It helped pave the way for the fantastic SVO that hit the streets in 1984 and we can only wonder what could have transpired if Ford would have signed off on further development."

In real life Nicolas Cage is having an extended moment. His indie drama ""Pig"" got rave reviews last year a just-released book called ""Age of Cage"" articulates the importance of his long eclectic career and the new movie ""The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent"" is his first live-action starring role to receive a wide theatrical release in ages.

Ironically however the movie itself steers Cage straight back into a semi-fictionalized rough patch. In it Cage plays a version of himself: A desperate ego-driven overspending former star desperate for a comeback role. He’s introduced during a lunch where his overeagerness causes him to lose out on what he considers the ""role of a lifetime""— treating the audience to a scene where he over-emotes with a bad Boston accent as an impromptu audition.

So where does this low point take the fictional Nic Cage? To a job of course. As a stop-gap solution for some money woes he accepts a million-dollar offer to fly to Spain and appear at the birthday party of Javi Gutierrez (Pedro Pascal) a wealthy admirer of Cage’s work.

Cage is wary of potential catches to this weird offer but he doesn’t anticipate the actual problem – one explained to him by a couple of CIA operatives (Tiffany Haddish and Ike Barinholtz). Javi is apparently an arms dealer involved with a kidnapping and the CIA needs Cage to assist with a rescue mission. In other words a cheesy Nic Cage action movie keeps intruding on the actor’s attempts to get his money and get out — further complicated by the fact that he grows to genuinely like Javi.

Even before the movie kicks into parodic absurdity it’s clear that it won’t be ripping everything directly from Cage’s real life. Understandably his family situation is entirely fictionalized giving him a made-up ex-wife Olivia (Sharon Horgan) and teenage daughter Addy (Lily Sheen — the real-life daughter of Michael Sheen and Kate Beckinsale). Much of the movie is also about Cage’s inability to connect with his kid which lends the proceedings both a touching sincerity and a gloss of canned sitcom-esque conflict.

Though it’s a substantial step up from director/co-writer Tom Gormican’s previous film (the appalling relationship comedy ""That Awkward Moment"") ""The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent"" takes a choppy half-baked approach to its humor. Gormican and co-writer Kevin Etten clearly have ideas for comic set pieces: Cage accidentally dosing himself with a knockout drug while breaking into a security room; Cage and Javi workshopping a screenplay; Cage donning an outlandish disguise to elude bad guys. Yet none of those gags sustain for longer than a few moderately amusing minutes. Though the movie politely declines to mention Cage’s extended detour into direct-to-video films ""Unbearable Weight"" sometimes resembles the more watchable of those titles: a good premise anchored by a good Cage performance undermined by slapdash craft and a presumably limited shooting schedule.

Cage deserves a better class of meta-movie something as trippy existential and original as ""Being John Malkovich."" But then he more or less already had that in ""Adaptation"" (albeit channeled through the experiences of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman rather than his own life). That’s the movie ""Unbearable Weight"" most resembles when it starts winking at its impending transition from a ""grounded adult drama"" to the madness of its action-packed stakes-raising third act. But the comparison isn’t flattering for ""Unbearable Weight."" Indeed it only underlines the fact that some of the nuances of Cage’s career — the years of bargain-bin movies the early self-destructive instincts the fact that he already made ""Adaptation"" — get lost when reducing the actor’s filmography to merely the result of an endless art-versus-commerce struggle.

It’s especially strange to see Cage’s success-obsessed movie-star id embodied by his imagined younger self (played naturally by a digitally de-aged Cage). In imaginary conversations between the two Cages the younger version insists he’s a big shining star — even though his live-wire physicality is modeled on Cage’s wilder more experimental years. Would the guy from ""Vampire’s Kiss"" and ""Wild at Heart"" really be urging his older self to mount a big Hollywood comeback?

Yet within its own limited ideas about Cage’s career ""Unbearable Weight"" does maintain a vital and disarming sincerity one created and sustained by its lead performances.

Pascal has become an expert at locating the boyish neediness beneath adult ambitions. How many other actors could make a request to read their screenplay seem credibly innocent rather than opportunistic? Cage meanwhile does what he’s done so often even in his low-budget dreck: He punctuates a committed fully felt performance with expressive actorly flourishes. He knows when to show off and when — as in the movie’s lovely final scene — to pull back.

As a comedy ""The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent"" is pretty pedestrian. As a treatise on the simultaneous ridiculousness and transcendence of movie acting though it understands the allure of playing pretend.

Leaving Las Vegas (1995): This is the movie to show someone who somehow still believes that Nicolas Cage isn’t a generational talent. It earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor and that statuette was well-deserved. Not a light viewing experience but an incredibly worthwhile one. Rated R. 111 minutes. Dir: Mike Figgis. Also featuring Elisabeth Shue Julian Sands Richard Lewis Steven Weber.

Guarding Tess (1994): The legendary Shirley Maclaine earned a Golden Globe nod for this dramedy playing a former First Lady of the United States who seems to make exasperating her chief Secret Service agent (Nicolas Cage) her top priority. MacLaine is good of course but ""Tess"" is a true two-hander and the dynamic between these two powerhouse performers ensures that even when the story goes a little off the rails the movie never does. Rated PG-13. 95 minutes. Dir: Hugh Wilson. Also featuring Austin Pendleton Edward Albert James Rebhorn Richard Griffiths.

Bangkok Dangerous (2008): For an example of a decent Nicolas Cage performance in a very bad action movie try this remake of the 1999 Thai film of the same name. Cage plays a remorseless contract killer who finds himself training a young protégé and falling for a civilian in — where else? — Bangkok. Rated R. 99 minutes. Dir: The Pang Brothers. Also featuring Shahkrit Yamnarm Charlie Yeung Panward Hemmanee Nirattisai Kaljareuk.

Peggy Sue Got Married (1986): Kathleen Turner earned an Oscar nomination for her stellar performance as a 40-something woman on the verge of divorcing her high school sweetheart (Nicolas Cage) who suddenly finds herself transported back to her senior year. Director Francis Ford Coppola brings a welcome dose of humanity to this nostalgic 1980s-meets-1960s time traveling comedy. And Cage offers an early glimpse of the out-there energy that characterizes his signatures performances. Rated PG-13. 103 minutes. Dir: Francis Ford Coppola.

However a glimmer of hope came from the unlikely partnership between Ford and McLaren that resulted in 10 wild Fox bodies.

Due to the oil crises of the 1970s that crippled the economy and led to stricter emission regulations the muscle car era seemed like a distant dream. To sell new cars Detroit’s major corporation had to improvise especially since people were getting tired of the economy-focused models that bored them to death.At Ford talks centered around making the third gen Mustang even more appealing. Introduced in 1978 it was an improvement over the hideous Pinto-based model that helped keep the company alive during the first half of the 1970s and like its hideous predecessor the Fox-body ‘Stang was selling like hotcakes. In 1979 dealers sold a whopping 369936 units – the sixth-best sales year in the history of the nameplate but there was room for more.So how can you make the car even more popular? Build a ludicrous performance model of course. We all know that this endeavor led to the creation of the Special Vehicle Operations Department and the 1984 Mustang SVO which was a terrific yet underrated limited-production car  but the ludicrous performance model I’m alluding to was born several years earlier and it donned McLaren badges.It all starts in 1980 when representatives of a marketing firm commissioned by Ford to explore the feasibility of a thoroughbred performance variant approached McLaren’s American division based in Livonia Michigan with the idea of creating an IMSA-spec race car and a series of closely-related street-legal versions.The idea quickly became the Ford-sanctioned M81 project and in 1981 the race car made its debut at Daytona. With drivers Tom Klauser and John Morton taking turns behind the wheel the McLaren-engineered Mustang managed to finish the 24-hour race despite a crash in the early hours of the event. It crossed the finish line 21st but made headlines all across the globe for being patched up using countless rolls of duct tape.Back in Livonia McLaren engineers had finished 10 road-worthy cars all heavily resembling the Daytona car. Hand-built from production on the stock hatchbacks that were previously stripped to the bare chassis they featured bulging fender flairs grille-less front ends IMSA-style fiberglass hoods with massive scoops and BBS wheels wrapped in Firestone HPR tires.In addition McLaren engineers beefed up the suspension with fully adjustable Koni shocks stiffer springs and sturdier anti-roll bars with tungsten bushings taken from the Fairmont police cruiser.Inside the cars were equipped with a roll cage Recaro LS bucket seats Stewart Warner instrumentation and a Racemark steering wheel Unlike their competition-spec sibling that was powered by a legendary Cosworth BDA the street Mustang McLarens were fitted with the 2.3-liter turbocharged inline-four that Ford wanted to promote to its V8-loving customers. Linked to four-speed manuals these units were blueprinted received ported heads and everything was meticulously fine-tuned by the engineering team with performance and reliability in mind.To comply with emission regulations boost was limited to 5 psi (0.34 bar) so the rated output stood at only 132 hp – the same figure as the standard-spec 2.3-liter turbos. However the engines were more than capable of handling a lot more. Two of the cars were fitted with boost gauges and their turbos could go all the way up to 10 psi (0.69 bar) which translated into close to 180 ponies.Legend has it that with more time and money McLaren could have pushed the four-cylinder well over the 200-hp mark making it more powerful than Ford’s 5.0 V8 but unfortunately that never happened.Although the blue oval’s decision-makers were extremely pleased with the M81 project and a limited production run of 249 units was seriously considered they ultimately chose to redirect funds to the SVO division which was also developing a performance-oriented ‘Stang The completed cars were sold for $25000 ($79000 today) each and now and again one goes under the hammer. In 2020 chassis number 0F03A308227 was sold at a Barrett-Jackson event for only $37400.By today’s standards calling the Mustang McLaren M81 a performance car is laughable. Its output figure wasn’t particularly mind-blowing four decades ago either but it is unquestionably the wildest-looking Fox-body of them all. It helped pave the way for the fantastic SVO that hit the streets in 1984 and we can only wonder what could have transpired if Ford would have signed off on further development.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vY2EubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vYXJjYS1kcml2ZXItY3V0LWZyb20tY2FyLWFuZC1wbGFjZWQtb24tc3RyZXRjaGVyLWFmdGVyLXZpY2lvdXMtd3JlY2stYXQtdGFsbGFkZWdhLTE4NTUyNjUxNy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ARCA driver cut from car and placed on stretcher after vicious wreck at Talladega,"Safety workers had to cut the roof off Scott Melton's car to extricate him from his vehicle after a nasty crash during the ARCA race at Talladega on Saturday.

Melton who suffered a left leg fracture was placed on a stretcher and loaded into a waiting ambulance after he was removed from the car. He was awake as he was placed onto the stretcher and had dropped his window net after the crash the customary signal from a driver that he or she is conscious after a wreck. The Fox Sports 1 feed showed that he was also communicating with safety workers as he was removed from the vehicle and subsequently transported to a local hospital.

Melton's car collided with Eric Caudell's car as Caudell's car was sliding up the track from a wreck that had unfolded far in front of Melton. The wreck was initially triggered when Toni Breidinger's car got turned sideways and then Richard Garvie's car caught some air.

You can see Melton's No. 69 car smash into Caudell's at the 29-second mark of the video above. Melton and the two cars he was near on the track appeared to be attempting to get around the wreck by not slowing down very much though those apparent plans were foiled when Caudell's car slid up the track and Melton's hit it head-on.

Here's the roof of Melton's car after it was taken off the car.

The crash happened on lap 50 of the 76-lap race and the race was red-flagged immediately so that the wreck could be cleaned up and Melton could be removed from his car. Nick Sanchez won the race with less than nine laps to go after Daniel Dye went spinning at the front of the field. The race was deemed complete before the scheduled finish because the NASCAR Xfinity Series race was scheduled to begin approximately an hour later.

Melton 60 was making his second start of the ARCA season after finishing 30th at Daytona. The Michigan native has made 28 starts in the fourth-tier stock car series across five seasons and has finished in the top 10 in six of those races.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNtaC5jb20uYXUvd29ybGQvZXVyb3BlL3J1cGVydC1tdXJkb2NoLXJldHVybnMtdG8tYnJpdGlzaC10di1tYXJrZXQtcGlucy1ob3Blcy1vbi1waWVycy1tb3JnYW4tMjAyMjA0MjQtcDVhZm5mLmh0bWzSAX9odHRwczovL2FtcC5zbWguY29tLmF1L3dvcmxkL2V1cm9wZS9ydXBlcnQtbXVyZG9jaC1yZXR1cm5zLXRvLWJyaXRpc2gtdHYtbWFya2V0LXBpbnMtaG9wZXMtb24tcGllcnMtbW9yZ2FuLTIwMjIwNDI0LXA1YWZuZi5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rupert Murdoch returns to British TV market pins hopes on Piers Morgan,"London: Media mogul Rupert Murdoch is pinning his hopes of a successful return to the British TV news market on the star power of his former tabloid editor Piers Morgan and the professional provocateur’s ability to create worldwide controversy.

The 91-year-old executive chair of News Corp who has been out of the sector since he sold Sky four years ago is making his latest attempt to upset Britain’s broadcasting establishment through the UK’s newest television channel talkTV.

The station – with the brash Morgan as its star on a reputed three-year £50 million ($89 million) deal to front the daily talk show write columns for The Sun and New York Post and publish a book with HarperCollins – will launch on April 25 in Britain on subscription and free-to-air TV as well as online platforms including Amazon Apple TV and YouTube.

The first episode of Piers Morgan Uncensored – featuring an interview with former US president Donald Trump – has already attracted global coverage with the pair in a seemingly confected row about deceptive editing of a promotional clip. Morgan’s program filmed in a dedicated studio in west London will also be broadcast on the Murdoch-owned Sky News Australia from Tuesday and FOX Nation in the United States.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZGVzay5uZXQvbmV3cy9zbGluZy10di1kcm9wcy1zdGFkaXVtLXNwb3J0cy1uZXR3b3JrLXNpbmNsYWlyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dish Network streamer pulls Sinclair sports network Stadium,"Dish Network-owned streaming TV service Sling TV has stopped carrying Sinclair Broadcast Group’s Stadium sports network.

In a message to viewers first spotted by The Desk on Friday Sling TV told subscribers that the service is “continuously evaluat[ing] programming in order to provide the best content to customers.”

The move comes less than a year after Dish Network engaged in a carriage dispute with Sinclair after the broadcaster demanded carriage of its Bally Sports-branded regional sports networks.

“Today on our network we may have people who want to watch regional sports but it’s a fraction of what it was [in 2019]” Charles Ergen Dish Network’s co-founder and chairman said last year.

Dish Network and Sling TV emerged from that dispute somewhat victorious: Sinclair’s local broadcast channels are still available to customers but slowly the satellite and streaming services have pared down their sports offerings.

Stadium may not be viewed as a monumental loss to Sling TV subscribers: The channel has lower viewership compared to sports networks offered by Fox Corporation (FS1 FS2) the Walt Disney Company (ESPN) and Comcast (regional NBC Sports-branded networks).

For viewers who still crave Stadium there are a few ways to get access to the network. Stadium is carried as a digital channel on free broadcast television in many markets and the network itself is available to stream for free on Paramount Global’s Pluto TV Comcast’s Xumo and Sinclair’s own streamer STIRR."

We all know that this endeavor led to the creation of the Special Vehicle Operations Department and the 1984 Mustang SVO which was a terrific yet underrated limited-production car  but the ludicrous performance model I’m alluding to was born several years earlier and it donned McLaren badges.It all starts in 1980 when representatives of a marketing firm commissioned by Ford to explore the feasibility of a thoroughbred performance variant approached McLaren’s American division based in Livonia Michigan with the idea of creating an IMSA-spec race car and a series of closely-related street-legal versions.The idea quickly became the Ford-sanctioned M81 project and in 1981 the race car made its debut at Daytona. With drivers Tom Klauser and John Morton taking turns behind the wheel the McLaren-engineered Mustang managed to finish the 24-hour race despite a crash in the early hours of the event. It crossed the finish line 21st but made headlines all across the globe for being patched up using countless rolls of duct tape.Back in Livonia McLaren engineers had finished 10 road-worthy cars all heavily resembling the Daytona car. Hand-built from production on the stock hatchbacks that were previously stripped to the bare chassis they featured bulging fender flairs grille-less front ends IMSA-style fiberglass hoods with massive scoops and BBS wheels wrapped in Firestone HPR tires.In addition McLaren engineers beefed up the suspension with fully adjustable Koni shocks stiffer springs and sturdier anti-roll bars with tungsten bushings taken from the Fairmont police cruiser.Inside the cars were equipped with a roll cage Recaro LS bucket seats Stewart Warner instrumentation and a Racemark steering wheel Unlike their competition-spec sibling that was powered by a legendary Cosworth BDA the street Mustang McLarens were fitted with the 2.3-liter turbocharged inline-four that Ford wanted to promote to its V8-loving customers. Linked to four-speed manuals these units were blueprinted received ported heads and everything was meticulously fine-tuned by the engineering team with performance and reliability in mind.To comply with emission regulations boost was limited to 5 psi (0.34 bar) so the rated output stood at only 132 hp – the same figure as the standard-spec 2.3-liter turbos. However the engines were more than capable of handling a lot more. Two of the cars were fitted with boost gauges and their turbos could go all the way up to 10 psi (0.69 bar) which translated into close to 180 ponies.Legend has it that with more time and money McLaren could have pushed the four-cylinder well over the 200-hp mark making it more powerful than Ford’s 5.0 V8 but unfortunately that never happened.Although the blue oval’s decision-makers were extremely pleased with the M81 project and a limited production run of 249 units was seriously considered they ultimately chose to redirect funds to the SVO division which was also developing a performance-oriented ‘Stang The completed cars were sold for $25000 ($79000 today) each and now and again one goes under the hammer. In 2020 chassis number 0F03A308227 was sold at a Barrett-Jackson event for only $37400.By today’s standards calling the Mustang McLaren M81 a performance car is laughable. Its output figure wasn’t particularly mind-blowing four decades ago either but it is unquestionably the wildest-looking Fox-body of them all. It helped pave the way for the fantastic SVO that hit the streets in 1984 and we can only wonder what could have transpired if Ford would have signed off on further development.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vY2EubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vYXJjYS1kcml2ZXItY3V0LWZyb20tY2FyLWFuZC1wbGFjZWQtb24tc3RyZXRjaGVyLWFmdGVyLXZpY2lvdXMtd3JlY2stYXQtdGFsbGFkZWdhLTE4NTUyNjUxNy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ARCA driver cut from car and placed on stretcher after vicious wreck at Talladega,"Safety workers had to cut the roof off Scott Melton's car to extricate him from his vehicle after a nasty crash during the ARCA race at Talladega on Saturday.

Melton who suffered a left leg fracture was placed on a stretcher and loaded into a waiting ambulance after he was removed from the car. He was awake as he was placed onto the stretcher and had dropped his window net after the crash the customary signal from a driver that he or she is conscious after a wreck. The Fox Sports 1 feed showed that he was also communicating with safety workers as he was removed from the vehicle and subsequently transported to a local hospital.

Melton's car collided with Eric Caudell's car as Caudell's car was sliding up the track from a wreck that had unfolded far in front of Melton. The wreck was initially triggered when Toni Breidinger's car got turned sideways and then Richard Garvie's car caught some air.

You can see Melton's No. 69 car smash into Caudell's at the 29-second mark of the video above. Melton and the two cars he was near on the track appeared to be attempting to get around the wreck by not slowing down very much though those apparent plans were foiled when Caudell's car slid up the track and Melton's hit it head-on.

Here's the roof of Melton's car after it was taken off the car.

The crash happened on lap 50 of the 76-lap race and the race was red-flagged immediately so that the wreck could be cleaned up and Melton could be removed from his car. Nick Sanchez won the race with less than nine laps to go after Daniel Dye went spinning at the front of the field. The race was deemed complete before the scheduled finish because the NASCAR Xfinity Series race was scheduled to begin approximately an hour later.

Melton 60 was making his second start of the ARCA season after finishing 30th at Daytona. The Michigan native has made 28 starts in the fourth-tier stock car series across five seasons and has finished in the top 10 in six of those races.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNtaC5jb20uYXUvd29ybGQvZXVyb3BlL3J1cGVydC1tdXJkb2NoLXJldHVybnMtdG8tYnJpdGlzaC10di1tYXJrZXQtcGlucy1ob3Blcy1vbi1waWVycy1tb3JnYW4tMjAyMjA0MjQtcDVhZm5mLmh0bWzSAX9odHRwczovL2FtcC5zbWguY29tLmF1L3dvcmxkL2V1cm9wZS9ydXBlcnQtbXVyZG9jaC1yZXR1cm5zLXRvLWJyaXRpc2gtdHYtbWFya2V0LXBpbnMtaG9wZXMtb24tcGllcnMtbW9yZ2FuLTIwMjIwNDI0LXA1YWZuZi5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rupert Murdoch returns to British TV market pins hopes on Piers Morgan,"London: Media mogul Rupert Murdoch is pinning his hopes of a successful return to the British TV news market on the star power of his former tabloid editor Piers Morgan and the professional provocateur’s ability to create worldwide controversy.

The 91-year-old executive chair of News Corp who has been out of the sector since he sold Sky four years ago is making his latest attempt to upset Britain’s broadcasting establishment through the UK’s newest television channel talkTV.

The station – with the brash Morgan as its star on a reputed three-year £50 million ($89 million) deal to front the daily talk show write columns for The Sun and New York Post and publish a book with HarperCollins – will launch on April 25 in Britain on subscription and free-to-air TV as well as online platforms including Amazon Apple TV and YouTube.

The first episode of Piers Morgan Uncensored – featuring an interview with former US president Donald Trump – has already attracted global coverage with the pair in a seemingly confected row about deceptive editing of a promotional clip. Morgan’s program filmed in a dedicated studio in west London will also be broadcast on the Murdoch-owned Sky News Australia from Tuesday and FOX Nation in the United States.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZGVzay5uZXQvbmV3cy9zbGluZy10di1kcm9wcy1zdGFkaXVtLXNwb3J0cy1uZXR3b3JrLXNpbmNsYWlyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dish Network streamer pulls Sinclair sports network Stadium,"Dish Network-owned streaming TV service Sling TV has stopped carrying Sinclair Broadcast Group’s Stadium sports network.

In a message to viewers first spotted by The Desk on Friday Sling TV told subscribers that the service is “continuously evaluat[ing] programming in order to provide the best content to customers.”

The move comes less than a year after Dish Network engaged in a carriage dispute with Sinclair after the broadcaster demanded carriage of its Bally Sports-branded regional sports networks.

“Today on our network we may have people who want to watch regional sports but it’s a fraction of what it was [in 2019]” Charles Ergen Dish Network’s co-founder and chairman said last year.

Dish Network and Sling TV emerged from that dispute somewhat victorious: Sinclair’s local broadcast channels are still available to customers but slowly the satellite and streaming services have pared down their sports offerings.

Stadium may not be viewed as a monumental loss to Sling TV subscribers: The channel has lower viewership compared to sports networks offered by Fox Corporation (FS1 FS2) the Walt Disney Company (ESPN) and Comcast (regional NBC Sports-branded networks).

For viewers who still crave Stadium there are a few ways to get access to the network. Stadium is carried as a digital channel on free broadcast television in many markets and the network itself is available to stream for free on Paramount Global’s Pluto TV Comcast’s Xumo and Sinclair’s own streamer STIRR."

The first warning shots were fired last week when the inflation-adjusted rate on 10-year Treasuries briefly rose above zero for the first time in two years. While the level didn’t hold for long it did signal a turning point -- the era of negative yields that sent investors rushing to emerging markets in search of higher returns may be nearing an end as the Federal Reserve hikes rates aggressively.

A sustained and substantial increase in U.S. real yields would be bad news for developing nations as it typically boosts the dollar and sucks capital out of riskier assets -- just like it did in 2008 and 2013. Investors are already bracing for that outcome: Franklin Templeton is cutting positions in high-yield debt while Fidelity International bets against emerging-market currencies and State Street Corp. shuns local debt of nations with weak finances.

“As U.S. yields go into positive territory that starts tightening financial conditions and does put pressure on a lot of emerging markets particularly the weaker ones” Mohieddine Kronfol the Dubai-based chief investment officer for Middle Eastern and North African fixed income at Franklin Templeton. “We still think there is much to worry about from growth to geopolitics and from inflation to monetary policy.”

It’s not just that positive U.S. real yields are coming but that they’re coming at a bad time for emerging markets. Inflation in the developing world has stubbornly stayed high into the second quarter belying some money managers’ expectation that it would peak by the end of March.

That means it’ll take even longer before emerging economies themselves can offer investors positive real policy rates leaving them at a disadvantage versus the U.S. which can. As many as 35 of the 42 nations tracked by Bloomberg have negative rates. Turkey’s minus 47% is the world’s worst real rate.

“We were expecting that emerging-market inflation would start peaking as early as in the first quarter but all bets are off post the sharp increase in commodity prices post Ukraine war” said Guido Chamorro the co-head of emerging-market hard-currency debt at Pictet Asset Management.

Growth Conundrum

Investors are also grappling with the war’s impact on food and energy prices as well as concerns surrounding China’s sagging economy. Emerging market local-currency bonds have slumped about 4% this year surpassing the record full-year loss of 3.8% in the wake of the 2013 taper tantrum.

“Growth expectations continue to fall and inflation remains at generational highs in many countries providing a very difficult macro cocktail for investors” said Paul Greer a money manager at Fidelity International in London. “Higher U.S. real yields is a headwind for all risk assets and of course emerging markets will not be immune to that.”

Local-currency bonds of Turkey Indonesia and Mexico may be the most vulnerable to a surge in U.S. yields given their persistent fiscal and current account deficits lower foreign-exchange reserves and high foreign ownership of bonds said Emily Weis a macro strategist at State Street in Boston. Whenever U.S. yields jumped more than 50 basis points over a three-month period the yields on those developing countries’ bonds had risen by more than twice that she said.

Bullish Case

Meanwhile some investors argue though that positive U.S. real rates may herald a potential peak in the Fed’s policy hawkishness. For Nordea Investment that would be the time to turn “tactically bullish” on emerging-market currencies and sovereign debt said Witold Bahrke a Copenhagen-based senior macro strategist at the firm.

“I definitely think U.S. real yields crossing the zero-line is an important milestone on the path towards a peak in the monetary headwinds emerging-market investors are facing in 2022” said Bahrke. “Positive real rates would also bring us closer to peak Fed hawkishness which is the ultimate requirement for risk appetite to stage a meaningful comeback.”

But that remains a contrarian view for now. Most money managers believe emerging economies remain exposed to capital-flight risks because there’s little they can do to change the equation vis-a-vis improving yields in the developed world. Much of the inflation faced by them is not their own doing but driven by external factors. Many central banks have already raised rates to their limit and have little room to tighten further.

So despite being ahead of the curve higher U.S. real rates will put more pressure on policy makers to extend their tightening cycles said Ed Al-Hussainy senior currency and rates analyst at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. Monetary policy decisions in Russia Hungary and Colombia will be closely watched this week.

“The most vulnerable assets are low-yielding bonds in Asia and Eastern Europe which are exposed to inflation spillovers from the Russia war and the Covid disruptions in China but don’t have a real yield buffer relative to the U.S.” Al-Hussainy said. “Commodity exporters in Latin America who have been accelerating their tightening cycles have more of a buffer.”

Here are the main things to watch in emerging markets in the week ahead:

China’s April purchasing managers’ indexes due Saturday will probably show a deeper contraction in activity underscoring the damage to manufacturing and the service sector from Covid lockdowns China’s industrial profits for March are likely to register a decline according to Bloomberg Economics

Russia is likely to cut interest rates on Friday as policy makers shift their focus toward cushioning the impact of international sanctions on the economy Wednesday’s release of activity indicators will reveal how the first full month of war and sanctions have hit the economy

Hungary will probably raise its benchmark rate by a full percentage point on Tuesday as the war in Ukraine fans inflation

Colombia’s monetary policy meeting on Friday will also be closely watched with policy makers split on the appropriate speed of future rate increases

Turkey’s central bank will publish its inflation report on Thursday. The nation has maintained its ultra-loose monetary policy despite inflation accelerating to a two-decade high in March

South Korea Taiwan the Czech Republic and Mexico will report on gross domestic product

Two of the five former government servants charged by the CBI for their alleged involvement in the ₹3600-crore VVIP chopper deal were witnesses for the agency in the case.The duo - former Air Vice Marshal Jasbir Singh Panesar and former deputy chief test pilot SA Kunte (both retired) - were arrayed as witnesses in the first charge sheet filed by the CBI in 2017. Their alleged involvement in the chopper deal however emerged during the agency's probe because of which they have been turned as accused people in the know said.The agency filed the charge sheet against the duo last month along with former defence secretary Shashi Kant Sharma for indulging in a series of calculated manipulations to favour UK-based AgustaWestland in the deal to purchase helicopters to transport VVIPs.The agency has added nearly three dozen new witnesses in the supplementary charge sheet filed against Sharma and four former IAF officials. This is the agency's first chargesheet against government servants in the chopper scandal.The new witnesses include an executive of American asset management company Franklin Templeton a few bank officials and government servants.Significantly the agency has recorded the statement of a former key IAF official before a Judicial Magistrate under oath (under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code). The testimony of the IAF official is key to the agency's case against Sharma a 1976-batch IAS officer who was also a former Comptroller and Auditor General of India. Sharma has previously denied his role in the deal.In a text message to ET in September 2020 Sharma had described it a ""frivolous allegation"". ""I had a long unblemished service record for over 40 years and nobody can blame me for any mala fide action or decision"" he had said.The IAF official was posted as director-acquisition in 2007 sources said.The official has deposed that the Defence Procurement Board had raised certain objections to the report prepared by the Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC).The agency has alleged that despite knowing that American medium-lift helicopter Sikorsky S-92 was not compliant for field trials the TEC members had cleared the same. This was done to ensure that a single vendor situation did not arise because in such an eventuality a fresh request for proposal (RFP) would have to be issued said people in the know.The Board had flagged certain objections to the TEC report.The IAF official in his testimony deposed that the objections were allegedly manipulated by Sharma in collusion with Panesar a co-accused in the case. It has been alleged that Panesar (a witness-turned-accused) helped Sharma dilute the minutes of the Board to overcome its objections and favour AgustaWestland. The charge sheet alleges that had a single recommendation gone for field trials AgustaWestland would not have bagged the deal.Earlier this month a CBI court had taken a judicial notice of the supplementary charge sheet filed by the CBI against Sharma and four retired IAF officials.The court has asked Sharma to appear before it on April 28.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5iaXRjb2luLmNvbS9zaGliYS1pbnVzLW5ldy1idXJuLXBvcnRhbC1yZXdhcmRzLXNoaWItYnVybmVycy1mb3ItZGVzdHJveWluZy10aGVpci10b2tlbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shiba Inu's New Burn Portal Rewards SHIB Burners for Destroying Their Tokens – Altcoins Bitcoin News,,,,

MCC holds plant giveaways for the public

Amazing. It began more than a half-century ago and is only growing stronger. That is Earth Day and its 52nd anniversary was celebrated around the world on April 22. It included an observance that was quite special and unique at the Morenci Community Center.

The MCC staff had several tables set up on which a wide variety of plants were displayed. There were also many plants beneath the tables. Part of what made the day special was that all of the plants were offered free of charge to the public. The many types of succulent plants related to cacti offered to the public were among the most unique. The plants are smooth and looked somewhat akin to a blossoming flower. Also none of them had barbs or stickers as do most cacti.

Walt Mares Photo/Gila Herald: A member of the Morenci Community Center staff waters plants at the Earth Day celebration held in Morenci. The plants were offered for free to the community.

Along with the Morenci Community staff the Gila Watershed Partnership and the University of Arizona Extension Service participated in the event. Master Gardener Bill Cook of the U of A Extension helped people identify various plants and offered information on how to care for them. That included how much certain plants should be exposed to the sun and how often they should be watered.

The tables were set up under canopies as the sun shone brightly and very warm weather arrived. The outdoor temperature was above 80 degrees.

The Morenci Community Center is under the auspices of global mining giant Freeport-McMoran. It owns most of and operates the Morenci open-pit copper mine which is the largest such operating copper mine in North America.

An observer said “I tip my hat to Freeport for being so environmentally conscious and playing a role locally to observe Earth Day. That is really cool especially for a mining company.”

The first-ever Earth Day was observed in 1970. There are those who have little or no memory of the event especially those from remote rural areas. If anything it may have been considered a city thing involving do-gooders. Meanwhile it was a big thing a momentous event in places such as Paradise Valley where Susan Breen attended Camelback High School. It is near Phoenix.

Walt Mares Photo/Gila Herald: A young man ponders as to which of these succulents to choose. A wide variety of plants were given free to anyone who wanted one on Earth Day in Morenci. Several tables were set up with plants on them and underneath so there were a great many to choose from.

Breen a long-time educator who has lived in Clifton for almost 40 years recalled how Earth Day was a very very special event at her high school. She and a close friend had just received their driver’s licenses. That was a big deal as her friend had access to a car. It was something they looked forward to but they instead rode their bicycles to school on Earth Day. At the time the criteria to support Earth Day was to walk or bicycle wherever a person traveled to and from. Those observing the day were asked not to travel in vehicles or any other motorized means of transportation.

“We thought that was pretty cool” she said adding that several students at the high school who usually drove cars instead walked or rode bicycles Breen said over these many years she has observed Earth Day in one form or another.

History

Earth Day an event to increase public awareness of the world’s environmental problems is celebrated in the United States for the first time on April 22 1970. Millions of Americans including students from thousands of colleges and universities participated in rallies marches and educational programs across the country.

According to the History Channel website Earth Day was the brainchild of Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin a staunch environmentalist who hoped to provide unity to the grassroots environmental movement and increase ecological awareness. “The objective was to get a nationwide demonstration of concern for the environment so large that it would shake the political establishment out of its lethargy” Senator Nelson said “and finally force this issue permanently onto the national political agenda.”

Earth Day has been celebrated on different days by different groups internationally. The United Nations officially celebrates it on the vernal equinox. The 1962 publication of Rachel Carson’s book Silent Spring —about the effects of pesticides — is often cited as the beginning of the modern environmental movement in the U.S. Sustainability organic eating and the “back-to-the-land” movement continued to gain steam throughout the 1960s. According to the History website the first Earth Day indeed increased environmental awareness in America and in July of 1970 the Environmental Protection Agency was established by special executive order to regulate and enforce national pollution legislation. Earth Day also led to the passage of the Clean Water and Endangered Species Acts. The measure enacted to form the EPA was done by then-President Ricard Nixon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYnVsbC5jb20uYXUvYW5hbHlzaXMtb3Bpbmlvbi93aWxsLWNvYmFsdC1yZW1haW4tYW4tZXYtYmF0dGVyeS1zdGFwbGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will Cobalt Remain an EV Battery Staple?,"Speculation about the potential explosion in the demand for electric vehicles (EVs) in the midst of the last decade saw the prices of some of the metals needed to produce the batteries capable of powering those vehicles more than doubling by 2018. Lithium nickel and cobalt led the charge but when the speculation appeared to have arrived early on the scene the price of lithium and cobalt began a downward slide that would not be reversed until late 2020.

In the face of the expectation of rapidly rising demand commodity producers do what they do best – produce more and more leading to an excess of supply and downward price movement when expectations slip off into an uncertain future. In this case the move was accelerated by mining shutdowns and slowdowns in the face of the pandemic.

For the EV revolution to reach its full potential the cost of an EV must become competitive with comparable ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles. EV producers and other corporate consumers of li ion batteries are continually looking for more cost effective battery chemistry formulations.

Tesla began with the Nickel/Cobalt/Aluminum (NCA) formulation adding the NMC and now the LFP – lithium iron phosphate or lithium ferrophostate.

There is no nickel or cobalt in the LFP battery so newcomers to this sector might wonder why the prices of nickel and cobalt are not sliding if manufacturers are screaming for lower costs?

The nickel/cobalt formulations still offer some advantages over the LFP battery most notably range and higher energy density meaning better overall performance. Tesla is using the LFP battery on entry level models and will expand its use to all “standard” range models. Where distance and performance issues like acceleration matter Tesla will continue using the NCA formulation for now but plans to expand LFP use in the future. Ford and VW also have begun using LFP batteries.

China is leading the way in LFP battery adoption and the LFP market share there has risen in concert with manufacturer cost concerns.

In addition manufacturers are now getting more directly involved in mining and battery chemistry formulation. Multiple manufacturers are securing offtake agreements with producers of both cobalt and nickel to guarantee supply.

The debate over the advantages and disadvantages between LFPs and NCAs or NMCs rages with an edge slipping to LFPs. Global resource research firm Wood Mackenzie is predicting li ion battery manufacturing capacity will increase fivefold by 2030 but that LFP’s total market share will eclipse the fifty per cent market share currently held by NCM batteries by 2028. The company pointed to LFP market share gains in 2021 through its lower cost longer battery lifecycle and better safety. Should that prediction materialise what would happen to demand for Cobalt?

Other experts maintain a positive outlook for cobalt. The following graph is from Bloomberg New Energy Finance assisted by Darton commodities:

Darton Commodities is a UK based cobalt metals expert providing procurements and marketing as well as financing and research assistance. Here is their outlook and the supply/demand balance for Cobalt:

According to Benchmark Intelligence 2021 saw LFP dominate the China market. However a Benchmark analyst told investingnews.com those investors fearing the demise of cobalt are premature. The analyst had a simple explanation. LFP batteries are dominating the China market where people want and need small lightweight cars. Performance capabilities such as acceleration high speeds and greater range are not significant issues. The US market trails the world in EV adoption. In 2021 3.4 million EVs were sold in China while 608 thousand EVs were sold in the US. Small cars there are becoming almost obsolete in favor of the fondness Americans have for Sport Utility Vehicles (SUV). The thinking is the demand for bigger and more powerful cars that can go further faster will prop up demand for cobalt.

The LFP cost advantage could lead to the lower priced EVs experts have claimed for some time were needed to kick start the EV revolution into high gear. However without better overall performance in range and acceleration required by many drivers their market share could be more limited than some experts claim. Safety is another major advantage for LFPs but low tolerance for cold temperatures makes them less suitable for northern climates.

Battery chemistry is constantly changing so the two competitors might both hold market share at their respective ends.

Cobalt is rarely mined directly with around 98% of cobalt produced as a by-product of nickel or copper mining. The downside is cobalt’s dependence on a robust price of nickel and copper.

Although cobalt is essential for fire safety in NCA batteries major manufacturers have long had concerns about its use beyond its high cost.

First somewhere around 70% of the global supply of cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) presenting potential “country risk.” Although the country is rich in natural resources poverty is high and child labor is common. In response to concerns about child labor the DRC has pledged to end the practice by 2025.

Australia ranks a distant third in global cobalt production and second in global cobalt resources. Russia ranked second in cobalt production.

As expected most ASX nickel/cobalt stocks have seen substantial share price appreciation of late.

The following table includes two top ASX listed miners with cobalt assets.

Jervois Global describes itself as a “global supplier of cobalt and nickel.” In addition to its mining assets the company has a production facility in Kokkola Finland that manufactures cobalt powders for electric batteries and other industrial applications. Jervois is also acquiring a shuttered nickel and cobalt refinery in Brazil.

The core mining asset is the wholly owned Idaho Cobalt Operations (ICO) acquired in 2019. With construction well underway the company states first production by August of 2022 and full commercial production by December of 2022. When fully operational ICO will be the only cobalt producing facility in the United States.

In mid-2021 Jervois acquired another refining facility – Freeport Cobalt – also in the United States. Freeport is a joint venture between US based global miner of multiple commodities — Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) – and Canada based Lundin Mining (XSTO: LUMI).

Along with the Freeport facilities Jervois acquired four chemical related companies. Freeport Coal has an existing contractual arrangement with the Jervois Finland Kokkola refinery.

Jervois also has a nickel/cobalt asset in New South Wales in development – the Nico Young Project. The company has what it calls “non-core” mining assets in Canada Uganda and a JV (joint venture) near the border between Western Australia and the Northern Territory.

Cobalt Blue’s sole focus is cobalt. Not just the mining and refining of cobalt but also focusing on the technology needed for advancements in both refining and mining.

The company’s sole core asset is the Broken Hill Cobalt Project. Within the broader project two sites – Pyrite Hill and Big Hill – have a history of past cobalt mining. The company claims resource estimates will extend beyond the two into the Railway site and multiple other prospective sites.

Cobalt Blue sees itself as unique among cobalt miners due to is processing technology. Each stage of the refining process itself is already in use around the world. What is unique is the “book end” nature of the process combining processing steps from beginning to end in a single location.

Using small ore samples the company successfully tested the process in its own Pilot Plant and moved on to construct a commercial scale Demonstration Plant. The plant is targeted to be operational in late April. The Pyrite Hill site will mine 3500 to 4000 tonnes of ore to be processed at the Demonstration plant over a twenty week period.

Both Cobalt Blue and Jervois point to their mining operations as employing “ethical practices.” Companies and governments are increasingly looking for cobalt supply outside the DRC and Australia stands to benefit.

Australia and the United States have begun a “Strategic Economic Dialogue” focusing on critical and rare earth minerals. The Australian delegation led by the Minister for Trade Tourism and Investment met with the US Secretary of Commerce and CEOs of major critical minerals businesses.

The stock of Jervois and Cobalt is catching a ride on the coattails of the rising price of cobalt.

Market participants are notorious for “shooting first and asking questions later.” Although neither company suffered much in 2021 as the LFP alternative began to grab market share and worry investors it is possible all cobalt and nickel stocks will be hit by major positive developments in the future.

There are junior miners of interest if for no other reason than the possibility of acquisition. While many are multi-commodity miners looking for copper and nickel as well as cobalt for global use a newcomer spun out by Vulcan Energy (VUL) in August of 2021 – Kuniko Limited (KNI) – is strategically targeting the battery minerals needs of Europe.

With a market cap of $72 million dollars according to the ASX and extreme trading volatility since listing speculative investors seem to have abandoned the company while more mainstream investors are enamored with other ASX cobalt miners.

The thirty day average trading volume for Jervois is 6.5 million shares per day with Cobalt Blue trading an average of 2.3 million shares. Kuniko’s thirty day average is 528 thousand shares per day. Its current share price is $1.22 with a 52 week high of $3.60 and a low of $0.62.

The company intends to meet European guidelines for eliminating the high carbon footprint from traditional mining of nickel copper and cobalt. Kuniko has five licensed exploration areas in Norway. The target is zero carbon. Shortly after listing the company began exploration activities focusing on the Skuterud Cobalt Project and the copper projects in two other exploration areas – Vangrofta and Undal-Nyberget.

Geochemical sampling at the Skuterud Cobalt Project was promising enough to begin downhole geophysics surveys. On 13 April Kuniko announced the borehole results confirmed earlier positive findings with the company now ready to begin its first diamond drilling program targeting three prospective areas.

While a zero carbon goal may seem unrealistic to some Norway derives 95% of its energy from renewable sources eliminating the high carbon footprint of electricity generated from fossil fuels used by many miners.",,,,,,,,,

The Sussex Academy ninth-grader shot four-under par in the 54-hole contest among girls 12-15. Highlights included a 67 in the second round and birdies each day on the par 5 fifth hole.

Quoted on the AJGA website Brockstedt explained her par score in the final round: “I went out there today trying to stay patient and not be aggressive at all.”

Sussex Academy golf coach Doug Grove said “I’m really happy for her. She’s been working hard and I’m thrilled that her efforts paid off by winning a big event.”

Longleaf is the same course where Brockstedt won the U.S. Kids World Teen Championship in 2020. She has played well several times in the Pinehurst area including the regional playoff where she qualified for the national Drive Chip and Putt Championship at Augusta National in 2018.

Something about the Pinehurst area of North Carolina must agree with her.

Sawyer’s spring break continued at the seventh annual U.S. Women’s Amateur Four-Ball Championship which kicked off April 20 and continues through Sunday April 24 at Grand Reserve Golf Club in Puerto Rico. Brockstedt and her partner Ellison Lundquist of Furlong Pa. join a field of 128 golfers (64 sides) in Puerto Rico for a chance to win one of the most prestigious honors in golf a USGA title.

This is also the very first USGA championship to be held outside the U.S. mainland. Brockstedt and Lundquist are competing in their first USGA championship. Last June the two co-founded a charity junior golf tournament called the Ace Cup with a group of friends raising more than $70000 during its inaugural year in support of the Alzheimer’s Association.

Selling clothes with a cleaner conscience

Scott Morrison co-founder of Radmor Golf in Washington state had a 20-plus-year career in the denim industry. The former college golfer for the University of Washington left that clothing sector in part because of its troubling environmental impacts. As he noted denim creation produces pollution from indigo waste and other problematic elements.

He and co-founder Bob Conrad a fellow UW golfer and former touring pro decided to go a different route – still cotton-based but with a better environmental impact. That led to the creation of Radmor Golf in January 2020.

The company’s apparel uses predominantly Pima cotton sourced from Peru. “We use natural fibers whenever possible. That makes a huge difference in terms of waste” he said. Thompson noted that natural fibers biodegrade in landfills in a matter of months while the technical fabric can take decades or more to break down.

Thompson said the company uses no “virgin polyester.” Their Elastane polyester is often only 4% to 5% of the total in any garment and adds a bit of stretch. “Our customers are really happy with the product and we’ve had a lot of success in the direct-to-consumer market” he said.

The company is not completely serious thankfully.

The Radmor logo is a cartoon-style golf ball with eyes depicted just beginning to drop into a golf hole.

The clothing tag for each article also promotes environmentalism with a bit of whimsy. The recycled paper is cut so that when folded it becomes a practice putting cup – a form of double recycling in fact.

Radmor’s lines can be found currently at green grass shops on the West Coast and at major department stores Nordstrom and Saks. Thompson hopes to expand the line’s presence in more green grass shops throughout the United States.

Broad range of Garmin GPS units at PGA Show

Garmin is a popular GPS navigation technology company. Its products serve the outdoor/fitness markets as well as the auto marine and aviation sectors. In the Cape Region Garmin devices are often seen on sportfishing boats bikes and local golf courses.

At Demo Day for the 2022 PGA Merchandise Show in January I met Mike Paoli a district sales manager for Garmin and a 2001 graduate of Salesianum High School in Wilmington. We spent some time making the usual connections among Delawareans and then reviewed a selection of Garmin’s golf products.

I was most impressed at the range of attractive GPS options for golfers across several price points.

We began with the entry-level Approach S12 a black-faced GPS watch that keeps things simple. A sunlight-protecting face provides front middle and back distances to the greens for more than 42000 pre-loaded golf courses with a 30-hour battery life in GPS mode. Normally sold for $199.99 it was recently listed on sale at the Garmin website for $149.99.

The Approach S42 at $299 SRP adds to the S12 base with a color touchscreen display interchangeable watch band options and a view of each green. The Approach 62 at $549.99 SRP uses a bigger screen shot tracking options paired with Garmin’s CT10 sensors virtual caddie information and as Paoli described it “health and wellness options” including heart rate and a pulse oximeter.

If you want GPS data but don’t like wearing watches Garmin offers the Approach G10 at $129.99 SRP. This device can clip onto your belt or rest inside a pocket until you need to check its basic data much like the Approach S12. It will also keep score.

The Marq model was the top of the Garmin watch line I saw at $1850. This luxury smartwatch included the bells and whistles of lower-priced options and a lot more. It can be paired with the Garmin Golf app for strokes gained analysis. It will track how hydrated you are during a round and other features handy for skiing and trail hiking. It can also access other global navigation system data when GPS is hard to come by.

Paoli also showed me two handheld GPS options the Approach G30 ($249.99) and Approach G80 ($499.99). The G30’s 2.3-inch color display is easily readable and comes with Touch Targeting that provides precise distances to whatever you point to on screen. If you need to stay in touch with what’s happening off course the device displays smart notifications for emails texts and phone calls.

The G80 upscales to a 3.5-inch touchscreen display and includes an integrated launch monitor displaying club head speed ball speed tempo estimated distance and smash factor. With up to 15 hours of battery life in GPS mode the device should handle 18 holes a virtual round against your buddies and a few practice sessions.

We also looked at the Approach R10 ($599.99) Garmin’s entry into the small-scale launch monitor market. The fully transportable tripod-mounted radar device will last up to 10 hours on a single charge. Set 6 to 8 feet behind the golfer it uploads data to a smartphone attached to a golf bag with a mounting clip for quick viewing of the results.

The data include more than 10 metrics – not as much as a full-scale Trackman for example but enough to keep track of trends.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRhdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL3dvbWVuLXdlYXJhYmxlcy1tYXJrZXQtMzE0NTUzOC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Women and the wearables market,"Kaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority

From partnerships to advancing tech a number of factors continue to shape the smartwatch market. We may not be strapping on James Bond-level gadgets but we’re certainly wearing more tools than ever before. What’s even better is that women’s needs aren’t getting left out of the conversation. But how do women fit into the wearables market at large and what are the upcoming trends? Read more: The best smartwatches you can buy

Advancements for all

Kaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority

For starters most shoppers want the same thing from their device. No one buys a smartwatch hoping for flaky sensors minimal app support or terrible battery life. The nature of wearables is that they are useful accurate and (if it’s not too much to ask) easy on the eyes.

In fact the fastest way to hinder the female-identifying audience is to oversimplify a device on our behalf. Android Authority’s Lily Katz found this to be the case when reviewing the Garmin Lily. Garmin marketed the device as the “smartwatch women have been waiting for” but our Lily said it left her wanting. “With that phrasing we would have really liked to see something more capable. Something that doesn’t sacrifice features (Garmin Pay built-in GPS etc.) for a pretty design.”

In a surprise to no one women need the same basic features as men.

The typical woman shopping for a smartwatch wants notifications app support and fitness tracking. Moms doctors CEOs and everyone else want sleep analysis SpO2 monitoring and move reminders. Athletes want advanced training features and recovery tools. Runners and cyclists want onboard GPS. In short we’re all (regardless of gender identifications) standing in the same buffet line. Advancements to any popular features or specs are a win for everyone.

Size matters

Kaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority

As mentioned everyone benefits from advanced sensors hearty batteries and touchscreen displays. However in many cases women would like all these tools in a more compact device. I’ll be the first to say some women look very cool in oversized accessories but they don’t make for the most comfortable runs or lift sessions. And for those of us who are easily dwarfed by chunky devices that means looking both silly and uncomfortable. Large heavy smartwatches just aren’t going to cut it.

Women value intentional tools that don't leave them feeling like an afterthought.

In this regard the wearables market is making moves in the right direction. A number of the most popular devices now come in multiple sizes to accommodate smaller wrists. These include the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Apple Watch 7 and even a number of Garmin picks like the Fenix 7 Series and Venu 2 Plus. In testing the Instinct 2 I appreciated that such a feature-packed device could still slip under my wetsuit and didn’t weigh enough to disrupt my workouts (or shut-eye).

Simply put women value intentional tools that don’t leave them feeling like an afterthought. Sizing options open the door to more wearables that might not otherwise be a likely pick. The same goes for color options and I have to say we don’t all love pink.

Women’s health focus in the wearables market

Kaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority

Under the hood women’s health is a hot topic with many companies focusing their efforts on tools like cycle tracking and pregnancy. Some devices’ native health apps include cycle tracking tools complete with notifications reminders and resources. Meanwhile both Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store are brimming with third-party cycle tracking apps.

These apps largely focus on helping anyone with a female body track their symptoms and either accomplish or avoid pregnancy. With infertility affecting nearly ten percent of women in the U.S. such tools can have a huge impact. But these basic tracking features are just the beginning. A focus on cycles and pregnancy has so far merely scratched the surface of women’s health issues and there is still plenty of room to run. Broader resources about hormonal cycles and deeper integration with training and fitness tools will likely continue to develop.

Beyond babies and periods women have plenty of health concerns that wearables makers can invest into.

Body temperature perfusion resting heart rate heart rate variability and much more are all impacted by female cycles and hormonal changes. After recently tearing my ACL while skiing numerous doctors asked at what point in my cycle the injury occurred. I had no idea there was a correlation between specific phases and an increased risk of an ACL tear.

After researching it I found that Garmin actually notifies users of this exact risk if you use their native cycle tracking. Of course most people will have much more successful ski trips but this is just one of many examples of how women’s health resources on wearables can be valuable.

Women taking the lead

Kaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority

So where are the women? We hope in charge. Ida Tin founder and CEO of the popular tracking app Clue coined the term “femtech” a sector of software services and technology specifically aimed at improving the lives of women. Tin is just one of a growing number of female leaders in the multi-billion dollar femtech industry.

Any device neglecting the female consumer is frankly financially irresponsible.

With the increasing overlap of health and technology it is more important than ever for women’s health and wellness to be prioritized by wearable brands. Plus with a staggering share of the market’s purchase power women have unlimited potential to disrupt complacency. Any device neglecting the female consumer is frankly financially irresponsible. See also: The best smartwatches for women

Technological advancements (and a heavier focus on female users) mean that male-centric gender biases in tracking are hopefully a diminishing issue. At the same time new tools and female-focused software plus more inclusive design options make wearables increasingly accessible and useful to women.

According to rumors both the Apple Watch 8 and the upcoming Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 may feature thermometers that could bring extra insights to women tracking their cycles. We would love to see this and tap into the benefits.

It’s hard to say what else the market has in store for women but we’re hopeful that further innovation is around the corner.

If you can do without all the beefed-up chips six-pack cameras and lidars of the $1000 handsets mid-range options get the job done for not a lot of cash. Sometimes you even get more from the cheaper phones like an actual headphone jack.

This week Motorola and OnePlus announced some new phones that fall into that group. Lenovo-owned Moto has two new options. The Moto G 5G is the most basic. It’s just $400 and where it cuts corners in display tech (720p) it makes up for it with a more powerful processor (MediaTek Dimensity 700) and a 50-megapixel camera. For another $100 the Moto G Stylus 5G comes with—you guessed it—a built-in stylus. It also has a higher-resolution 1080p screen. Oh and it differs from the recently announced Moto G Stylus 2022 with NFC so you can tap and pay via Google Pay and 5G support. The Moto G 5G includes the latter but sadly lacks NFC. The Stylus 5G goes on sale on April 28 and the Moto G 5G launches on May 19.

The OnePlus N20 5G costs even less: For just $282 you get a 6.43-inch AMOLED screen 128 GB of storage and a 64-MP camera. This one will also be available on April 28. For now it’s exclusive to T-Mobile but an unlocked version should be coming sometime this summer. (Stay tuned for the full WIRED review.) Unlike the Moto phones though the OnePlus N20 is shipping with Android 11. That means you’ll miss out on some of Android 12’s features at least until OnePlus releases an update to the more recent OS.

Here's some other recent news in consumer tech land:

Zoom Put You in a Bad Mood? Now Zoom Knows It.

Videoconferencing company Zoom updated its software this week adding gesture recognition. The change allows you to trigger a reaction emoji by raising your hand or throwing a thumbs-up to the camera. This isn't an entirely new feature—Zoom introduced the feature on mobile iOS devices last year—but now it’s available on its desktop client.

The update that's a bit more controversial is limited to users of its Zoom for Sales service at least for now. Zoom's software is now using artificial intelligence to analyze how people interact on calls. This is just one step in the company's broader ambitions to develop “conversation intelligence software” that can creep on your Zoom calls to determine people's “emotional states” as reported by Protocol last week. That last part hasn't quite come to fruition yet though Zoom's new update lets users monitor calls to rank a person's talk time usage of filler words and “patience.”

Still the nonprofit privacy advocacy group Fight for the Future published an open letter to Zoom decrying the practice of emotion-tracking as manipulative discriminatory and just kinda creepy. So we definitely know how they feel about it even without Zoom-tracking.

Garmin Got the Band Back Together

This week Garmin revealed the first of its Vivosmart fitness trackers in four years. Its updates are … not as monumental as you might expect for a long-in-the-works device. But it might still have appeal for consumers who want to track health fitness but just don't want to wear a smartwatch.

The new Vivosmart 5 tracks activities monitors sleep and reads blood oxygen levels with a built-in pulse oximeter. Unlike the previous version this model has GPS tracking (though it still requires a connection to your smartphone). Garmin claims the Vivosmart 5 gets seven days of battery life in ""smartwatch mode"" which seems to mean without using the sleep or pulse oximeter. Garmin says it also offers stress monitoring with breathing exercises and there's menstrual cycle tracking in the compatible mobile app. The Vivosmart 5 is available now and costs $200. Check out WIRED'S review of the last model and peruse our picks of the best smartwatches.

Reposting? Instagram Wants to Slow Your Roll

On Wednesday Instagram head Adam Mosseri posted a video to Twitter (the irony!) in which he described a few changes coming to the photo-sharing platform. In addition to enhanced tagging settings Mosseri also said that Instagram is tweaking its ranking algorithm to prioritize “original content.” The specifics of how it will work aren’t exactly clear but the goal is to push original posts higher in the feed than reposts or shared content. Users across the platform will now be able to tag products and change their own tag settings to make it easier to identify the source of a post.

Instagram has tinkered with its resharing settings before. Last year the company tested out a feature that made it harder to regurgitate posts by adding a reshare sticker to anything being well reshared. But that experiment ended and Instagram still seems to be riddled with screenshots and non-original posts. It's clear Instagram is hoping this new fix is the one that works.

Time to Talk About Twitter

As you may have heard Elon Musk set out to buy Twitter last week. He had already acquired 9 percent of the company's stock and rejected a board seat. Then he decided he wanted the whole darn thing. It prompted a variety of responses including a confrontational rebuttal from Twitter itself. Now Musk says he has lined up the money—$46.5 billion to be more precise.

This week WIRED'S Gadget Lab podcast features a rousing conversation with Casey Newton a prominent journalist and the creator of Platformer on Substack about the latest Musk vs. Twitter drama (and the controversial edit button.)

Standalone satellite navigation and GPS units have been challenged by smartphones in recent years but that does not mean they still don't have much to offer.

Bigger and easier to read screens for starts.

Garmin has been at the forefront of the sat nav market for many years.

The company’s best devices offer solid audio and visual instructions as well as useful features such as built-in WiFi or Bluetooth for hands-free calling.

For the last couple of months I’ve been using the DriveSmart 76 as I’ve an older motor which has no built-in navigation system unlike many more modern vehicles.

It’s a far better option than using a smartphone because of its size and the fact that you don’t have to worry about your handset losing coverage at an inopportune moment.

DriveSmart 76 has an easy-to-see backlit 7in HD touchscreen display excellent voice assisted navigation Alexa integration and preloaded traveller content to help guide the way.

The screen has 1024 x 600 pixel resolution and offers great detail.

Setting it up is simple. The software itself walks you through the entire process which only takes a couple of minutes including the time it takes to download and register with the Garmin Drive app.

Installation is equally straightforward. An attachment goes into the back of the unit which clips onto a suction pad that quickly and easily fixes onto your car’s windscreen.

Neat features include built-in WiFi live traffic information lane assist alerts for dangerous bends reminders to watch your speed if you’re driving too fast for the applicable speed limit — and detailed maps of all of Europe which are free to download. Garmin’s navigation system is powered by Here Maps incidentally.

The use of street names and landmarks makes the voice guidance easy to follow.

The instructions are delivered with plenty of time for you to act too.

And bright and clear maps with 3D buildings help to clarify any complicated instructions if you have a chance to glance at them.

There is 32GB of internal storage and a built-in mono speaker which is quiet enough but can be useful occasionally (when my Bluetooth connection to the car speakers fails for example).

You get the most from DriveSmart 76 by pairing with the Garmin Drive app on your smartphone which gives you access to live traffic updates notifications and hands-free calling.

The updates and notifications appear in a split screen view on the right hand side.

The satnav has its own voice control too. Say ‘Okay Garmin’ and you can ask DriveSmart 76 to find an address or location ask for route information route place a call adjust brightness or change volume. You don’t need to touch the device at all and you can summons Alexa using your voice too which is handy for streaming music.

DriveSmart also includes handy Foursquare and Tripadvisor integration.

One of the things I didn’t like is that when you are searching for a location you can only choose from the list of options by touching the screen.

While a feature that could be simplified is how you add stops to your route. At the moment you have to search for a new location while your existing route is active. Doing so causes a new screen to pop up asking if you want to start a new route add this location as a stop on your existing route or add it as your current route’s final stop.

The unit is bundled with a USB charging cable that can connect to your vehicle’s cigarette lighter outlet (with the included d12v charger to USB adapter) or any other USB port in your vehicle.

You’ll need to keep it connected as the battery only lasts an hour.

Verdict

Drivesmart 76 is a fantastic piece of kit packed full of useful features.

The sat nav is simple to use finds great routes and delivers effective voice and visual guidance and after a few months of using it on every trip I’d not go back to a smartphone again.

Pricing

Garmin DriveSmart 76 costs €249 from Currys."

(WNDU/Gray News) - A Dollar Tree store in Indiana has come under fire after its manager at the time posted a “help wanted” sign that some were calling controversial and discriminatory.

WNDU reports a store manager recently put up a hiring sign after two young employees had quit.

The handwritten sign read:

“I apologize for us closing AGAIN. My 2 new cashiers quit because I said their boyfriends couldn’t stand here for their entire shift. Don’t hire Gen Z’s. They don’t know what work actually means. NOW HIRING! *Baby Boomers ONLY thanks!”

The Pew Research Center defines Generation Z as any person born between 1997 and 2012 and the baby-boomer generation includes any person born between 1946 and 1964.

The sign has since been removed but it was there long enough for potential customers to share photos and gain attention on social media.

“You’re going to get people from every group who are lazy and work hard. I’m sure when baby boomers were young they were probably also called lazy and it just keeps going on from generation to generation” said frequent Dollar Tree customer Lindsay Berger.

Dollar Tree was informed of the manager’s sign and released the following statement:

“We are aware that an unauthorized sign was posted at our store for a brief period of time. The handwritten message was absolutely not approved by or condoned by our company.”

Additionally Dollar Tree representatives said the manager was no longer employed by the company.

Federal law prevents employment discrimination based on race sex sexual orientation disability religion color and veteran status.

Considering the millennial workforce’s affinity for personal digital touch points with the likes of Amazon and Uber organizations are now envisioning their service desks to offer consumer-like experiences to their employees leveraging smart technologies such as AI analytics and automation. Research indicates that millennials are more open to using a variety of emerging means to get the IT support they need. Instant messaging (71%) video chat (54%) and the use of mobile apps to resolve IT issues (54%) are most popular.

To achieve the envisioned service desk the transactional first level IT support in the workplace will moderately be substituted by zero-touch service desk - an intelligent automated approach to resolving trouble tickets without any active involvement of the service desk agents. It promotes self-healing knowledge base portals and self-service actions routing the service agents’ skills towards high priority issues. This transformation of the traditional service management was imminent as over-burdened service desk agents were resolving improperly assigned incident problem and request tickets in an untimely manner. Ineffective resolutions resulted in negative employee experiences and reduced productivity levels. The pandemic acted as a catalyst in driving this further due to the surge in the ticket volumes accounting for the remote working employees. Challenges such as limited visibility of service experience levels lack of intelligence in the system emerging trend of BYOD and aggravated pressure on the agents compelled organizations to reduce costs and enhance productivity while optimizing the service desks.

Hence there is a need for organizations to reimagine and build an effective support system which is all- predictive proactive and pre-emptive. The future-ready service desk must have a foundation of intelligent employee-centric integrations that will lead to the evolution of the service desk to an enterprise desk that can sense employee sentiments seek feedback and pre-empt issues.

Persona-driven approach

The service desk of the future will not adopt a one-size fits all model but will incorporate persona-driven methodology that will help in creating user profiles of the employees basis the role devices workload etc. The desk will then use these profiles to offer hyper-personalized resolutions aligned to the business by identifying the devices and ascertaining the criticality of the issues as per the profile.

Experience management

The service desk will evolve into experience desks that will map the employee journey to identify “moments of truth” in the service levels. The employee’s experiences will be quantified with data to understand their sentiments and ensure that their expectations are being met. The outcome and value-based service desk with an XLA based approach will continuously move towards improvement to build customized knowledgebase by taking feedbacks for all digital touchpoints in the journey.

Automation integration

Leaner service desk

Evolution of the service desk with minimal human intervention will happen with zero-touch and automation capabilities. This will help in reducing the volume of service desk tickets and simplifying the process of ticket creation and resolution with automated ticket routing to the appropriate agent skilled for that issue and intelligent swarming for end-to-end agent accountability for that ticket. The service desk is also becoming leaner with shift-left initiatives wherein the level 1 tickets will be shifted to self-help and the other requests will be resolved through automation.

Self-heal

The IT teams are maturing wherein they now look at unreported issues or the ones with the potential to disrupt the employee’s work continuity rather than just addressing the raised tickets. The changing workforces are placing emphasis on having proactive maintenance to address issues before problems arise and the modern service desk must have the capability to meet these demands. Hence the network and the device performance are proactively measured and monitored consistently to identify diagnose and remediate anomalies and issues using self-healing AI-driven automated capabilities. This approach prevents the issues from happening in the first place reducing the tickets and improving employee productivity.

Self-help

It is observed that millennials attempt to fix workplace issues themselves as they do in their personal lives. According to Gartner “end users require an IT self-service portal where knowledge is readily available where passwords are easy to reset and that is very intuitive to use”. Hence an effective portal accessible from multiple channels with a cognitive virtual assistant will allow the employees to find the answers easily around how-to requests technical support IT equipment ordering and password reset requests. Resolving the latter issue with self-service information on automated password reset tools for example can save organizations the costs of supporting this type of request via more expensive channels. The employees should also be able to access service desk support from any device anytime anywhere.

Analytical metrics

The real-time data retrieval for conducting analysis of the data can help the agents in monitoring the employees’ ecosystem and identify potential issues to proactively resolve them in an automated manner. The analytics and reporting will capture the historical data and the feedback data which can be beneficial in visualizing a trend to create a hyper-personalized strategy.

Service desk has come a long way in terms of transformation. There is no doubt that the service desk of 2030 will look completely different from what it looks like today. For an evolved service desk equipped with advanced capabilities and focused on employee experience organizations will have to aggressively invest in its transformation to enhance productivity and satisfaction levels.

The BBB Scam Tracker has received numerous reports of a text message scam that attempts to trick people with the promise of a “free gift.”

The scam starts with you receiving a text message that says something like this: “Your bill is paid for March. Thanks here’s a little gift for you.” This message is followed by a link to an unfamiliar website.

The text doesn’t specify what bill you paid what company the message is coming from or what the total amount was. The BBB says the message may be a group text sent to a dozen or more other people none of whom are in your contacts list.

The text isn’t from a real company. The goal is to get your personal information which puts you at risk for identity theft.

In some versions of the scam you may be directed to a website asking you to “confirm your identity” so you can receive the gift. Scammers may also ask for your credit card information claiming you need to pay a few dollars to ship the “free” gift according to the BBB.

Officials with the BBB advise consumers to not click on links from strangers. Additionally be wary of suspicious links forwarded to you by friends too. Even well-meaning friends may forward suspicious links without realizing they’ve been scammed.

Scammers often use links along with either an exciting offer or a threat as part of a phishing scam.

If you think the message came from a company you do business with call them directly before you click on any links. And the BBB says to keep in mind that businesses need your permission to send you text messages.

Furthermore use good judgment. BBB representatives say scammers love to trick people with offers that are too good to be true.

The former two-star commander of the Air Force Research Laboratory was convicted of abusive sexual contact following a historic court-martial of an Air Force general officer. His sentence is expected to be handed down on Monday.

Maj. Gen. William T. Cooley was found guilty of forcibly kissing his sister-in-law in a car Aug. 12 2018 in Albuquerque N.M. He was charged with one count of sexual assault under Article 120 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice with three specifications. His trial which began April 18 is the first full court-martial and conviction of an Air Force general officer in the service’s 75-year history.

Cooley waved his right to a jury trial leaving his fate in the hands of Col. Christina M. Jimenez the senior military judge in the case and chief circuit military judge with the Air Force Trial Judiciary.

Over the course of five days 10 witnesses testified including the victim family members friends and an expert in digital forensics. “Hundreds of electronic communications including emails voice mails and text messages” also were presented. Cooley opted not to testify.

The victim who agreed to let the media disclose her relationship to Cooley without naming her described the assault as an “F5 tornado … ruining everything in its path” according to an Air Force press release.

She told the court that Cooley asked for a ride after a barbeque during which he had been drinking and “told her he fantasized about having sex with her” according to the USAF release. “She alleged he pressed her up against the driver’s side window forcibly kissing and groped her through her clothes.”

Cooley who received his commission in 1988 and pinned on his second star one month before the incident pleaded not guilty denying the allegations.

On April 23 Jimenez found him guilty of one specification forcibly “kissing [the victim] on the lips and tongue with an intent to gratify his sexual desire” according to an Air Force press release. He was found not guilty of the other two specifications “including causing her to touch him over his clothing and his alleged touching of her breasts and genitals through her clothes” according to the release.

Commander of Air Force Materiel Command Gen. Arnold W. Bunch Jr. removed Cooley from command of the Air Force Research Laboratory on Jan. 15 2020 citing a loss of confidence in his ability to lead. He has served as a special assistant to AFMC commander since focusing primarily on the the command’s Digital Campaign.

“As convening authority I want to say thank you” said Bunch in a statement after the trial. “Thank you to everyone who supported this process for their due diligence in the pursuit of justice and for doing everything possible to protect both the victim’s rights and the rights of the accused to a fair trial.”

Cooley could now get as much as seven years in jail potentially have to register as a sex offender and face dismissal from the Air Force and withholding of pay reported Air Force Times. His sentencing is expected April 25.

“This case clearly demonstrates the commitment of Air Force leaders to fully investigate the facts and hold Airmen of any rank accountable for their actions when they fail to uphold Air Force standards” said Col. Eric Mejia staff judge advocate for Air Force Materiel Command in the release.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9hbWQtcnl6ZW4tNy01ODAweDNkLXZzLWludGVsLWNvcmUtaTktMTI5MDBrL9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9hbWQtcnl6ZW4tNy01ODAweDNkLXZzLWludGVsLWNvcmUtaTktMTI5MDBrLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D vs. Intel Core i9-12900K: Benchmarks specs pricing,"The battle for the best CPU for gaming is on. AMD’s hot new Ryzen 7 5800X3D and Intel’s Core i9-12900K are two CPUs with very different approaches to high-end gaming performance but both are equally impressive.

With eight cores and several hundred dollars separating them it might seem like a foregone conclusion which is best. But with their unique hardware arrangements the title of which is the best gaming processor of 2022 — so far — really is up for grabs.

Pricing and availability

Intel released the Core i9-12900K in early November 2021 as the flagship of the new Alder Lake generation. It debuted with a recommend price of $589 though it more readily sells for around $600 at the time of writing.

The AMD Ryzen 5800X3D launched on April 20 2022 with a price tag of $450. This puts it more in line with the Core i7-12700K in terms of cost but performance-wise at least in gaming it is very much gunning for the Intel flagship.

Specs

AMD Ryzen 5800X3D Intel Core i9-12900K Architecture Zen 3 Alder Lake Process TSCM 7nm Intel 7 (10nm) Cores 8 16 (8 performance + 8 efficiency) Threads 16 24 Base clock 3.4GHz 3.4GHz Boost clock 4.5GHz 5.2GHz Total L3 cache 96MB 30MB TDP 105W 241W

These two CPUs have very different hardware makeups each representing exciting new directions for their respective companies. The Ryzen 7 5800X3D has a more traditional core layout of eight identical cores and 16 threads with simultaneous multi-threading. The Intel Core i9-12900K has 16 total cores split between eight performance cores and eight smaller efficiency cores.

The AMD CPU sports a more modest 4.5GHz boost clock a 200MHz reduction from the Ryzen 7 5800X it’s based on while the Core i9-12900K reaches to new heights with a 5.2GHz boost clock on a single core and a 5GHz boost clock across all of them at once.

Where the 5800X3D breaks new ground is in its cache. It has 64MB of 3D-stacked L3 cache on top of the die which when combined with the normal 32MB gives it 96MB of total L3 cache. That’s more than three times as much as the Core i9-12900K.

That additional cache dramatically boosts the otherwise standard specifications to new heights of gaming performance. There are some bandwidth- and latency-dependent applications that could also benefit from it but it’s games where we’re seeing the largest benefit.

Outside of specs power is a big concern. The Core i9-12900K draws more than twice as much power than the Ryzen 7 5800X3D and even more if you overclock it. The Ryzen 7 5800X3D doesn’t support overclocking unfortunately though that comes with the upside of less power draw overall.

Gaming

The Ryzen 7 5800X3D and Core i9-12900K were both sold as gaming CPUs so it only makes sense to start there. You can see how the two chips stack up on average in the chart below. Our tests were run at 1080p with an RTX 3090 and 32GB of DDR4-3200 memory. Keep in mind that the Core i9-12900K supports DDR5 though it doesn’t make a huge difference in games.

The extra L3 cache on Ryzen 7 5800X3D makes a big difference however. Overall the Ryzen 7 5800X3D is about 1.7% faster than the Core i9-12900K. That isn’t a massive lead but consider that AMD’s CPU has half of the cores a much slower clock speed and costs around $200 less.

It’s not perfect though. In intense open-world games like Red Dead Redemption 2 and Forza Horizon 4 the Core i9-12900K takes a lead with its larger core count. Some open-world titles still favor the Ryzen 7 5800X3D’s increased cache however as showcased by Far Cry 6 and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla.

AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D Intel Core i9-12900K 3D Mark Time Spy 17078 19396 Red Dead Redemption 2 119 fps 132 fps Assassin’s Creed Valhalla 121 fps 118 fps Forza Horizon 4 247 fps 250 fps Fortnite 205 fps 205 fps Halo Infinite 127 fps 113 fps Cyberpunk 2077 128 fps 122 fps Far Cry 6 147 fps 141 fps Civilization VI (turn time lower is better) 6.6 seconds 7.3 seconds

Where the Ryzen 7 5800X3D shoots ahead is in multiplayer. In Halo Infinite it leads by 12.4% and in Fortnite it matches the Core i9-12900K. AMD says the random nature of multiplayer games — think Apex Legends or Valorant — can benefit from increased cache and our benchmarks back that up.

It’s not just multiplayer titles either. Our Civilization VI turn time benchmark is a sign of that showing that an increased cache pool allows the processor to hold more instructions for AI opponents.

Processor performance

Although the Ryzen 7 5800X3D is a showstopping gaming CPU it’s not great in general processor performance. The higher core count on the Core i9-12900K allows it to run through applications much faster both in terms of single- and multi-core performance.

AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D Intel Core i9-12900K Cinebench R23 single-core 1460 1989 Cinebench R23 multi-core 14544 27344 Geekbench 5 single-core 1588 2036 Geekbench 5 multi-core 10209 18259 Handbrake (seconds lower is better) 69 47 PugetBench for Premiere Pro 882 1066

In tests like Cinebench and Geekbench which exclusively stress the CPU the Core i9-12900K is about 30% faster in single-core performance and around 80% faster in multi-core performance. The Core i9-12900K has a lot more general compute heft under the hood.

That translates into applications too with Intel’s CPU showing a 21% lead in Premiere and a 32% lead in Handbrake. If you’re a professional that needs optimal CPU performance the Core i9-12900K is your best bet especially considering its platform features.

PCIe and memory support

As much as raw performance cost and efficiency are major factors in buying a CPU you also need to factor in the ecosystem. The AMD Ryzen 5800X3D is running on AMD’s aged AM4 platform which supports DDR4 memory and PCIe 4.0. In comparison the Core i9-12900K is based on Intel’s newer LGA 1700 socket and supports DDR5 memory and PCIe 5.0. That not only means it has greater performance potential where memory bandwidth is paramount but that it can be upgraded to future DDR5 and PCIe hardware (GPUs and storage being the most prevalent) without the need to upgrade anything else.

Intel’s platform will also have one more generation of upgrades in Raptor Lake whereas AMD’s AM4 is very much on its last legs. It’s still capable and the 5800X3D represents an amazing upgrade path for existing AMD Ryzen system owners but it’s a harder one to recommend for new builds considering its lack of comparable longevity.

Power and thermals

Performant as it is the Core i9-12900K is a hot processor. During our tests it peaked at around 86 degrees Celsius which is right around where the Ryzen 7 5800X3D peaked. However Intel’s part drew a staggering 240 watts of power during that time while the Ryzen 7 5800X3D only sipped 101W.

We ran our tests with a 240mm all-in-one liquid cooler so there’s a little more thermal headroom with an intense cooling solution. Regardless the Core i9-12900K is a clear loser here. It draws a lot of power as is and if you overclock it it will draw even more. The beefed-up Core i9-12900KS is evidence of that nearing 300W and 100 degrees Celsius based on our testing.

Ryzen rips for gaming but Alder Lake is a better all-rounder

If you want the best gaming CPU the Ryzen 7 5800X3D is the cream of the crop. When it comes to the best processors however the Core i9-12900K still holds the crown. It comes with much higher performance in professional applications despite taking a decent back seat in gaming.

The main concern comes down to thermals and power. The Core i9-12900K is a hot chip and you’ll need one of the best PC power supplies to support it. That’s especially true if you’re overclocking where even a 360mm AIO can only keep temperatures around 90 degrees Celsius when the chip is pushed.

On the other hand the Ryzen 7 5800X3D doesn’t even support overclocking. That doesn’t make a huge difference in games but there are still applications that are sensitive to frequency (including older games). Keep that in mind before picking up the CPU you want.

Selina Wu (played by acclaimed actress Lydia Look) is the mob boss queen on the ABC daytime drama General Hospital.”

Wu is the leader of the Triad for the Wu family and a member of the Five Families. She is Port Charles’ hottest new vixen in town and hopefully she will be here to stay for a long time.

Look has taken the ABC soap opera by storm. She delivers a raw subtle and controlled performance as Selina Wu and she showcases the wide spectrum of her character’s layers. Wu is vindictive manipulative and ravishing all in one. She knocks her acting performances out of the ballpark each time.

She has great chemistry with her co-stars Maurice Benard (Sonny Corinthos) Kelly Thiebaud (Dr. Britt Westbourne) Donnell Turner (Curtis Ashford) and Parr Shen (who plays her nephew Brad Cooper on the show).

Wu is causing havoc in Port Charles and rightfully so. She bought stocks in Deception (with the company going public) and she hosts poker games and parties at the Savoy after she forms a working relationship with Curtis Ashford.

A spokesman for Iridium confirmed the two companies teamed up on a proposal in response to an SDA request earlier this year. The agency in January issued a request for proposals for the “ground operations and integration segment” of a $1.8 billion constellation known as Transport Layer Tranche 1.

Iridium’s CEO Matt Desch during an earnings call April 19 told analysts that the company was pursuing the SDA contract but did not discuss the teaming arrangement.

SDA has ordered 126 satellites from Lockheed Martin Northrop Grumman and York Space Systems. Each company is responsible for providing 42 satellites and operating them but SDA will select a separate contractor to manage the entire enterprise including the ground stations data links and user equipment.

“Iridium and General Dynamics Mission Systems have partnered and submitted an innovative proposal in response to SDA’s RFP for development of their proliferated LEO constellation’s system integration ground systems facilities ground stations and management of day-to-day operations of their network” Iridium said in a statement to SpaceNews.

The company operates a constellation of 75 communications satellites in low Earth orbit and provides satcom services to the U.S. government and commercial customers. General Dynamics Mission Systems develops and integrates satcom antennas and ground systems.

SDA’s technical director Frank Turner described the ground systems integration of Tranche 1 as a complex challenge. “What we need is a team of folks who can take a look at the missions at what we need to operate from a ground perspective and how to build the constellation mission and network management to make it all work together” he said last month at an industry conference.

The Transport Layer a mesh network intended to move data in space via optical links will have two operations centers at government facilities in Grand Forks Air Force Base North Dakota; and Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville Alabama. It will have multiple ground entry points external locations and terrestrial backhaul communications.

“The ability of this contractor to work with and manage inputs and actions from multiple other performers will be critical to successfully field and operate Tranche 1” SDA said. The agency is reviewing bids and expects to select a contractor in the coming months.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vdHJ1dGhvdXQub3JnL2FydGljbGVzL2dsb2JhbC1jYXBpdGFsaXNtLWhhcy1iZWNvbWUtZGVwZW5kZW50LW9uLXdhci1tYWtpbmctdG8tc3VzdGFpbi1pdHNlbGYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Global Capitalism Has Become Dependent on War-Making to Sustain Itself,"The Russian invasion of Ukraine has sparked fierce political debate on the geopolitical consequences of the conflict. But less noticed and equally as important the war has paved the way for a more sweeping militarization of what was already a global war economy mired in deep political and economic crisis. Geopolitical tensions and international conflicts may be tragic for those caught up in conflagrations such as in Ukraine — but advantageous for those seeking to legitimize expanding military and security budgets and open up new opportunities for capitalist profit-making in the face of chronic stagnation and social discontent.

In late March the Biden administration citing the Russian invasion called for a $31 billion increase in the Pentagon budget over the previous year and on top of an emergency appropriation weeks earlier of $14 billion for Ukraine’s defense. Prior to the invasion in late 2021 the U.S. government approved a nearly $800 billion military budget even as in the same year it ended the war in Afghanistan. Almost overnight following the Russian invasion the U.S. European Union and other governments around the world allocated billions of dollars in additional military spending and sent streams of military hardware and private military contractors into Ukraine.

Shares of military and security firms surged in the wake of the invasion. Two weeks into the conflict shares of Raytheon were up 8 percent General Dynamics up 12 percent Lockheed Martin up 18 percent and Northrop Grumman up 22 percent while war stocks in Europe India and elsewhere experienced similar surges in expectation of an exponential rise in global military spending. Russian President Vladimir Putin in the words of the managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory a Pentagon contractor is “unquestionably the best F-35 salesman of all time” in reference to a spike in U.S. government funding for the Lockheed Martin jet fighter. Said one consultant to Boeing General Dynamics Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Technologies: “For the defense industry happy days are here again. When the defense budget rises it tends to lift all boats in the industry.”

Militarized Accumulation

The Russian invasion — brutal reckless and condemnable by any standard — has sparked debate on NATO’s proposed expansion into Ukraine and the role that it played in motivating the Kremlin. U.S. officials were keenly aware in fact that the drive to expand NATO to Russian borders would eventually push Moscow into a military conflict. “We examine a wide range of nonviolent measures that could exploit Russia’s actual vulnerabilities and anxieties as a way of stressing Russia’s military and economy and the regime’s political standing at home and abroad” notes a 2019 study by the RAND Corporation a Pentagon-affiliated think tank. “The steps we examine would not have either defense or deterrence as their prime purpose” it states but rather “these steps are conceived of as elements in a campaign designed to unbalance the adversary leading Russia to compete in domains or regions where the United States has a competitive advantage and causing Russia to overextend itself militarily or economically.”

But the provocation could not be reduced to geopolitical competition however important as most observers were keen to do. Missing from the larger picture was the centrality of militarized accumulation — of endless low- and high-intensity warfare simmering conflicts civil strife and policing — to the global political economy. Militarized accumulation refers to a situation in which a global war economy relies on the state to organize war-making social control and repression to sustain capital accumulation in the face of chronic stagnation and saturation of global markets. These state-organized practices are outsourced to transnational corporate capital involving the fusion of private accumulation with state militarization in order to sustain the process of capital accumulation. Cycles of destruction and reconstruction provide ongoing outlets for over-accumulated capital; that is these cycles open up new profit-making opportunities for transnational capitalists seeking ongoing opportunities to profitably reinvest the enormous amounts of cash they have accumulated. There is a convergence in this process of global capitalism’s political need for social control and repression in the face of mounting popular discontent worldwide and its economic need to perpetuate accumulation in the face of stagnation.

Wars provide critical economic stimulus. They have historically pulled the capitalist system out of accumulation crises while they serve to deflect attention from political tensions and problems of legitimacy. It took World War II to finally lift world capitalism out of the Great Depression. The Cold War legitimated a half century of expanding military budgets and the Iraq/Afghanistan wars the longest in history helped keep the economy sputtering along in the face of chronic stagnation in the first two decades of the century. From the anti-Communist fervor of the Cold War to the “war on terror” then the so-called New Cold War and now the Russian invasion of Ukraine the transnational elite led by Washington have had to conjure up one enemy after another to legitimate militarized accumulation and deflect crises of state legitimacy and capitalist hegemony onto external enemies and contrived threats.

The events of September 11 2001 marked the start of an era of a permanent global war in which logistics warfare intelligence repression surveillance and even military personnel are more and more the privatized domain of transnational capital. The Pentagon budget increased 91 percent in real terms between 1998 and 2011 while worldwide total state military budget outlays grew by 50 percent from 2006 to 2015 from $1.4 trillion to more than $2 trillion. (This figure does not take into account the hundreds of billions of dollars spent on intelligence; contingency operations; policing; bogus wars against immigrants terrorism and drugs; and “homeland security.”) During this time military-industrial complex profits quadrupled.

However focusing just on state military budgets only gives us a part of the picture of the global war economy. As I showed in my 2020 book The Global Police State the various wars conflicts and campaigns of social control and repression around the world involve the fusion of private accumulation with state militarization. In this relationship the state facilitates the expansion of opportunities for private capital to accumulate through militarization such as by facilitating global weapons sales by military-industrial-security firms the amounts of which have reached unprecedented levels. Global weapons sales by the top 100 weapons manufacturers and military service companies increased by 38 percent between 2002 and 2016 and can be expected to escalate further in the face of a prolonged war in Ukraine.

Said one consultant to Boeing General Dynamics Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Technologies: “For the defense industry happy days are here again.

By 2018 private for-profit military companies employed some 15 million people around the world while another 20 million people worked in private security worldwide. The private security (policing) business is one of the fastest-growing economic sectors in many countries and has come to dwarf public security around the world. The amount spent on private security in 2003 the year of the invasion of Iraq was 73 percent higher than that spent in the public sphere and three times as many persons were employed in private forces as in official law enforcement agencies. In half of the world’s countries private security agents outnumber police officers.

These corporate soldiers and police were deployed to guard corporate property provide personal security for executives and their families; collect data; conduct police paramilitary counterinsurgency and surveillance operations; carry out mass crowd control and repression of protesters; run private detention and interrogation facilities; manage prisons and participate in outright warfare. Now these same private military and security firms are pouring into Ukraine with some mercenary companies offering between $1000 and $2000 a day for those with combat experience.

The Russian invasion has accelerated but did not originate the ongoing surge in military spending around the world. It is notable that state military spending worldwide skyrocketed in the wake of the 2008 global financial collapse even beyond the post-9/11 spending hike rising from about $1.5 billion in 2008 to over $2 trillion in 2022. The fact that this explosion in spending coincides perfectly with continued worldwide stagnation following the Great Recession suggests that the heightened militarization of the global economy is as much or more a response to this chronic stagnation than to perceived security threats. If bursts of militarized accumulation (such as that unleashed by 9/11 then by the 2008 financial collapse and now by the Russian invasion) help offset the overaccumulation crisis further into the future they are also high-risk bets that heighten worldwide tensions and push the world dangerously towards all-out international conflagration.

The Crisis of Global Capitalism

This crisis of global capitalism is economic or structural one of chronic stagnation in the global economy. But it is also political: a crisis of state legitimacy and capitalist hegemony. The system is moving towards “a general crisis of capitalist rule” as billions of people around the world face uncertain struggles for survival and question a system they no longer see as legitimate. Historically wars have pulled the capitalist system out of crisis while they serve to deflect attention from political tensions and problems of legitimacy.

Economically global capitalism faces what is known in technical language as “overaccumulation”: a situation in which the economy has produced — or has the capacity to produce — great quantities of wealth but the market cannot absorb this wealth because of escalating inequality. Capitalism by its very nature will produce abundant wealth yet polarize that wealth and generate ever greater levels of social inequality unless offset by redistributive policies. The level of global social polarization and inequality now experienced is without precedent. In 2018 the richest 1 percent of humanity controlled more than half of the world’s wealth while the bottom 80 percent had to make do with just 5 percent. The international development agency Oxfam reported in January that during the first two years of the coronavirus pandemic the 10 richest men in the world more than doubled their fortunes from $700 billion to $1.5 trillion while 99 percent of humanity saw a fall in their income and 160 million more people fell into poverty.

Such inequalities end up undermining the stability of the system as the gap grows between what is — or could be — produced and what the market can absorb. The extreme concentration of the planet’s wealth in the hands of the few and the accelerated impoverishment and dispossession of the majority means that the transnational capitalist class or TCC has increasing difficulty in finding productive outlets to unload enormous amounts of surplus it accumulated. In the years leading up to the pandemic there was a steady rise in underutilized capacity and a slowdown in industrial production around the world. The surplus of accumulated capital with nowhere to go expanded rapidly. Transnational corporations recorded record profits during the 2010s at the same time that corporate investment declined. Along with militarized accumulation the TCC has turned to unprecedented levels of financial speculation and to debt-driven growth to sustain profit-making in the face of the crisis. If left unchecked overaccumulation results in crisis — in stagnation recessions depressions social upheavals and war — just what we are experiencing right now.

But there is a related dynamic at work in the global war economy: the need for dominant groups to suppress mass discontent and deflect the crisis of state legitimacy. International frictions escalate as states in their efforts to retain legitimacy seek to sublimate social and political tensions and to keep the social order from fracturing. All around the world a “people’s Spring” has taken off. From Chile to Lebanon Iraq to India France to the United States Haiti to Nigeria South Africa to Colombia Jordan to Sri Lanka waves of strikes and mass protests have proliferated and in some instances appear to be acquiring an anti-capitalist character. Wars and external enemies allow the ruling groups to deflect attention away from domestic malaise in their effort to maintain a grip on power as the crisis deepens.

The transnational elite led by Washington have had to conjure up one enemy after another to legitimate militarized accumulation and deflect crises of state legitimacy and capitalist hegemony onto external enemies and contrived threats.

In the U.S. this sublimation has involved efforts to channel social unrest towards scapegoated communities such as immigrants or other marginalized groups — this is one key function of racism and was a core component of the Trump government’s political strategy — or towards an external enemy such as China or Russia which had clearly become a cornerstone of the Biden government’s strategy well before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. U.S. presidents historically reach their highest approval ratings when they launch wars. George W. Bush reached an all-time-high of 90 percent in 2001 as his administration geared up to invade Afghanistan and his father George H.W. Bush achieved an 89 percent approval rating in 1991 right as the U.S. declared the end of its (first) invasion of Iraq and the “liberation of Kuwait.”

It is unlikely that an increasing militarization of the world economy can in the long run offset either the economic or the political dimensions of the crisis of global capitalism. Global capitalism is emerging from the coronavirus pandemic with more inequality more authoritarianism more militarization and more civic and political strife. In the U.S. class struggle is heating up with a wave of strikes and of unionization drives in Amazon Starbucks and elsewhere in the gig economy. The current inflationary spiral and the escalation of class struggle in the United States and around the world point to the inability of the ruling groups to contain the expanding crisis. The drive by the capitalist state to externalize the political fallout of the crisis increases the danger that international tensions and localized conflicts such as in Ukraine will snowball into broader international conflagrations of unforeseen consequences.

As the Ukraine crisis continues to drag on and the global revolt escalates there will be a radical reconfiguration of global geopolitical alignments to the drumbeat of escalating turbulence in the world economy that will feed new political upheavals and violent conflicts making global capitalism all the more volatile. While it is hard to imagine a return to the status quo antebellum in Eastern Europe in the larger picture the Ukraine crisis is not the cause but a consequence of the general crisis of global capitalism. That crisis will only get worse. Fasten your seat belts; it will get much worse.

The tanks’ arrival will be a major development for Polish defense planners who say that they will immediately send the tanks to deter Russia in the country’s east.

But these tanks could serve another purpose: aiding Ukraine. Would Poland agree to send the tanks further east? Given Polish readiness to support Ukraine’s defense it is certainly possible. The Abrams bound for Poland could simply travel a bit further to the east and south to support the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The tanks would certainly be useful for Ukraine whose armed forces are currently transitioning from the hit-and-run dispersed combat that characterized Russia’s assault on cities like Kyiv to a more conventionally-oriented fight in the Donbas to the east.

If the U.S.-built Abrams tanks are sent from Poland to Ukraine they could be then backfilled by additional production (though this would depend on General Dynamics being able to generate more new variants for export). Certainly time is of the essence; Ukraine cannot sit and wait while the United States builds additional units of its M1A2 SEPv3 variant and it is unlikely that available tanks are lying around. Yet even if this is logistically possible it does not mean the Pentagon would have the appetite to do this. Russia has already warned that it considers Western arms convoys to Ukraine to be “legitimate targets”; avoiding the start of direct conflict between the United States and Russia a la World War III remains a top U.S. priority.

However several Eastern European countries have upgraded Russian T-72 tanks which may rival portions of Russia’s large but aging tank fleet. The Czech Republic is reportedly sending T-72 tanks to Ukraine. Germany’s Leopard 2 tanks are yet another possibility but would Berlin be willing to part with some of its most cutting-edge armor? Germany has been reluctant to send heavy weapons thus far.

Then there is the question of impact. Global Firepower reports that Russia operates as many as 12000 tanks however their potential effectiveness is dependent on how many of them have been modernized and properly maintained. Russia operates a small number of new T-14 Armata tanks but has mostly T-90 and T-72 Soviet era tanks. These have already proven vulnerable to Ukrainian anti-armor fire.

What if the Ukrainians were able to operate upgraded T-72s to repel a heavily mechanized Russian invasion? By extension what about the Abrams tank? A former battalion leader in the famous U.S. Army 3rd Infantry Division who led units which attacked and destroyed the Iraqi Republican Guard at Baghdad airport during Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) said that Iraqi T-72s could not compete with the Abrams tank in warfare engagements.

“There was no comparison the capabilities the night vision or you know the mobility the firepower that exists and most importantly the crew and the crew dynamics for us to be able to take advantage of training systems” Retired Lt. Col. Scott Rutter OIF and Gulf War Army veteran who is now the CEO of the Valor network told Warrior Maven in an interview.

Designed to incorporate brand new stealth technology and brand-new weapons systems the Zumwalt was to replace the aging Arleigh Burke-class. Initially the Navy was scheduled to procure 32 Zumwalts. But the program went rampantly overbudget while the new ship performed below expectations. The Navy withdrew support asking Congress to stop procuring Zumwalts and instead build more of the familiar reliable Arleigh Burke destroyers. Congress obliged and only three Zumwalts were ever delivered.

The Zumwalt-Class incorporated stealth technology

The Zumwalt was an ambitious project full of innovative technology. For starters the Zumwalt was a stealth ship. Despite being 40 percent larger than the Arleigh Burke the Zumwalt has a radar cross-section (RCS) comparable to a fishing boat. The key to such a deceptive RCS is the Zumwalts hull design. The Zumwalt’s hull grows narrower above the waterline in a tumblehome style. The tumblehome was common on wooden warships and had a flare of popularity with steel warships in the late 19th century. But when three of four Russian tumblehome battleships were lost in the Russo-Japanese War the design was declared ineffective for modern warfare and fell out of style for nearly one hundred years. Now stealth-seeking modern navies are reintroducing the shape to meet low-RCS requirements.

In addition to the tumblehome design the Zumwalt has a composite deckhouse which encases the ship’s sensory and electronic equipment in low RCS material. Between the tumblehome hull and the composite deckhouse the Zumwalt’s RCS is about 50 times harder to detect on radar than older destroyers. And the Zumwalt is quiet—with an acoustic signature more similar to a Los Angeles-class submarine than a surface warship.

However the applicability of the Zumwalt’s stealth has been called into question. The Zumwalt was designed to provide Naval Surface Fire Support with a focus on land attacks. So the Zumwalt was meant to operate in typically crowded near-shore waters where ships can be tracked visually. And the Zumwalt naturally was intended to fire its impressive arsenal—meaning that once the ship started firing its stealth properties would be compromised.

The Zumwalt-Class was outfitted with modern weaponry

To adequately provide Naval Surface Fire Support the Zumwalt was designed around a bevy of modern weapons. Actually a bevy of modern weapons were designed around the Zumwalt.

BAE built the Advanced Gun System (AGS) a naval artillery system specifically for the Zumwalt. And Lockheed Martin built the Long Range Land Attack Projectile (LRLAP) as ammunition specifically for the AGS. In fact the AGS cannot operate without the LRLAP—a rocket-assisted 155m projectile with fin glide trajectory. So when the Navy cancelled procurement of the LRLAP the AGS was left without ammunition. That’s right: The AGS does not have any ammunition.

The LRLAP worked well—performance wasn’t the issue. Testing proved the LRLAP could hit a target accurately from 59 miles away. No the LRLAP’s problem was cost. When the Zumwalt-class was slashed from 32 ships to just three the need for LRLAP shells went down too. Meaning the cost behind developing each shell went up. Way up. The cost per individual LRLAP shell rose to an unacceptable $800000-$1000000—roughly the same as a Tomahawk cruise missile. The Navy’s original plan to buy 2000 LRLAP rounds would have cost about $2 billion. The ammo-less AGSs will be removed from the Zumwalts in 2023.

Accordingly the Zumwalt-class will get a new weapons platform: hypersonic missiles.

Maxie's in Twin Falls has officially quietly sadly closed their doors.

UPDATE: We are getting reports that their final day will be April 30th

According to a Facebook post from one of the members of the Hayes family they stated that Maxie's in Twin Falls has had to close permanently. The building that Maxie's has been operating out of has been for sale for some time now. It appears it has not sold and the family will say goodbye to one of Twin Falls favorite Italian eateries.

Again we have reached out to the family and as soon as we get more information we will update. As of right now it appears that lack of work force increasing prices of supplies and health issues are the cause for the closure. I am unsure what is going to happen to the building now but we do hope that the family has a wonderful retirement and prospers in health and happiness on their next endeavor.

Selfishly I am incredibly sad that I will be unable to get that fantastic lasagna anymore. It was seriously one of the best things I have ever eaten in my life. Just judging by some of the responses from people in the community this place holds many memories over the last 66 years that they have operated.

We will miss you Maxie's so many don't know what they are missing out on now that you aren't here. Prayers and good health to the entire family.

The original story continues below.

General Motors will reportedly no longer provide battery replacements for the all-electric version of the Chevy Spark according to a report from EV-Resource (via InsideEVs). The Chevy Spark electric vehicle (EV) was first released in 2013 and GM continued to make new models until 2016.

A GM district executive confirmed to EV-Resource that the company is “no longer going to supply that [the Spark EV’s] battery.” GM’s inventory of Spark EV battery packs has reportedly run out as well and the company doesn’t plan on making any more. The Verge reached out to GM with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.

It’s unclear if GM will continue to honor the Spark EV’s battery pack warranty

With the oldest model of the Spark EV reaching almost 10 years old vehicle owners may find themselves without a working car if their battery pack fails. GM offers an eight-year / 100000-mile warranty specifically for the battery pack in its Spark EVs and other electric vehicles which means the warranty has already run out (or is very close to running out) for Spark EVs released in 2013 and 2014. It’s unclear if GM will continue to honor its warranty and somehow replace the battery pack in broken-down Sparks or as EV-Resource points out if GM will offer to buy back the vehicle instead of replacing the battery.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL21lZGlhLmdtLmNvbS9tZWRpYS9pbnRsL2VuL2NoZXZyb2xldC9uZXdzLmRldGFpbC5odG1sL2NvbnRlbnQvUGFnZXMvbmV3cy9jaGV2cm9sZXRjb21wYW55L2V1L2NoZXZyb2xldC9jb21wYW55X2luZm9ybWF0aW9uLzExXzE1X3N0dW1wZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Beate Stumpe,"Beate Stumpe Director Brand and Marketing Chevrolet Europe

GM is holding a three-day career fair Monday-Wednesday this week with hiring events at Factory ZERO – the site for the former Detroit-Hamtramck Plant now the company’s first all-electric facility.

GM is hiring a number different positions including some entry-level spots – those who assemble parts into packages that go into vehicles and those who move those parts around the building.

But Kristen Everhardt a GM HR executive tells WWJ AutoBeat Reporter Jeff Gilbert they’re also looking for experienced skilled trades workers.

That includes electricians millwrights pipefitters and tool makers. She calls the opportunity “very exciting” and it’s a good way to get a foot in the door.

“There’s no experience required. We are open arms and welcoming to having people who do not have prior manufacturing experience because we do do on-the-job training for those roles” Everhardt said.

April 23 2022 — A GM PCV (positive crankcase ventilation) lawsuit alleges Buick Chevrolet and GMC vehicles suffer oil leaks from ruptured rear main seals.

According to the seven owners who filed the Ford class action lawsuit a traditional PCV valve has been replaced with a small fixed orifice in the 2.4L engine as seen in the photo to the right.

But that tiny hole allegedly gets clogged with sludge water and ice in cold weather conditions.

The main symptom of a clogged PCV system is a blown rear main oil seal caused by pressure in the engine. A GM vehicle with a ruptured rear main seal will allegedly suffer a sudden oil loss and loss of power.

The GM class action also alleges a blown rear main seal can cause permanent damage to the engine which requires replacement of the engine.

The GM PCV lawsuit includes consumers who were purchasers or lessees of these vehicles from April 1 2016 to the present:

2010-2016 Buick Lacrosse (including Hybrid eAssist)

2011-2017 Buick Regal

2012-2017 Buick Verano

2010-2015 Chevrolet Captiva

2010-2017 Chevrolet Equinox

2013-2014 Chevrolet Malibu (including ECO eAssist Hybrid)

2010-2017 GMC Terrain

All the General Motors vehicles are equipped with 2.4L engines equipped with PCV systems used to regulate the amount of air and gas pumped through the engines.

In February 2019 GM issued Diagnostic Tip bulletin 19-NA-021 to dealerships and titled ""Diagnostic Tip for Oil Leak from Rear of Engine After Extended Driving in Cold Temperatures Below 0 Degrees.""

""Some customers may comment that an engine oil leak appeared as they were driving the vehicle in extremely cold ambient temperatures (Generally 0°F / -17°C or colder). Some customers may also comment that they heard a single 'pop' noise right before the oil leak started."" — Diagnostic Tip 19-NA-021

GM also warned technicians they may find an oil leak coming from the rear main oil seal of the engine.

The bulletin doesn't apply to rear main oil seal leaks found in warmer climates.

If the problem occurs in cold weather GM technicians should:

""Clean any ice/sludge/water/carbon out of the PCV pipes/hoses the PCV nipple on the cam cover the PCV orifice between the #2 and #3 intake runners (use a 1/16 inch drill bit) PCV orifice in the head...and the throttle body. Also inspect the related PCV hoses/connections for potential damage and replace if necessary.""

Technicians should also drain the engine oil for at least 15 minutes to remove all oil and condensation from the crankcase and repair any oil leaks caused by the frozen PCV system.

According to the GM class action the automaker hasn't recalled the vehicles to repair the alleged PCV problems and GM hasn't extended the warranty beyond the standard 5-year/60000-mile powertrain warranty. The plaintiffs assert a GM technician will use a drill bit to clean out the sludge and other debris.

General Motors also allegedly continues to conceal the PCV problems from consumers and has done so since 1985.

The plaintiffs named in the GM PCV lawsuit are:

Melissa Kiriacopoulos / Massachusetts / 2016 GMC Terrain

Craig Johnson / Minnesota / 2015 Chevrolet Equinox

Beverly Trevethan / Michigan / 2017 Chevrolet Equinox

Sarah Burns / New York / 2017 Chevrolet Equinox

Geralyn Darr / Wisconsin / 2017 Chevrolet Equinox

Steve Fiene / Wisconsin / 2016 GMC Terrain

Thomas Graham / Minnesota / 2013 GMC Terrain

The class action lawsuit argues all affected customers are entitled to ""recovery of the purchase price of their vehicles compensation for overpayment and diminution in value of their vehicles out-of-pocket and incidental expenses disgorgement of GM’s unjustly derived profits and an injunction compelling GM to replace or recall and fix the Class Vehicles.""

The GM PCV lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan: Kiriacopoulos et al. v. General Motors LLC.

The plaintiffs are represented by the Miller Law Firm P.C. and Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2hlcmVzLWhvdy1tdWNoLWEtMTk4Ni1wb250aWFjLXRvamFuLWNvc3RzLXRvZGF5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Is How Much A Pontiac Tojan Costs Today,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2hlcmVzLWhvdy1tdWNoLWEtMTk4Ni1wb250aWFjLXRvamFuLWNvc3RzLXRvZGF5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

European Union is preparing a sixth package of sanctions against Russia which expected to be presented early next week and may include a “some form of ban” on oil imports as well as more Russian banks expelling from the SWIFT international payments system Politico reports.

According to the article measures against oil imports are likely to vary depending on the type of oil and the method of its delivery (by sea or by pipeline). There is also discussion ongoing in Brussels about the need for potential transition periods to give EU countries time to prepare for any embargo on oil imports from Russia.

According to Bloomberg three options are being considered as EU restrictions on Russian oil: imposing an embargo setting a price cap and creating a payment mechanism to hold the profits that Russia has received since the start of war in Ukraine.

According to Politico the new package will be presented on Monday. EU ambassadors will discuss it for a week and will probably be able to adopt it by Friday.

As GMK Center reported earlier since the start of the war in Ukraine the Russian Federation and Belarus faced numerous sanctions from Western nations. At the beginning of this week an EU directive came into force banning Russian ships from all ports of the European Union.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMi8wNC8yNC96ZW5kYS1nZXRzLTktNG0tdG8tc3RyZWFtbGluZS1zY2hvb2wtZmVlLXBheW1lbnQtYW5kLW1hbmFnZW1lbnQv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoY3J1bmNoLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA0LzI0L3plbmRhLWdldHMtOS00bS10by1zdHJlYW1saW5lLXNjaG9vbC1mZWUtcGF5bWVudC1hbmQtbWFuYWdlbWVudC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Zenda gets $9.4M to streamline school fee payment and management,"Zenda a UAE-based startup looking to change how parents pay school bills and the way educational institutions manage fee collection is eyeing Africa as its next frontier for growth.

Zenda (formerly nexopay) told TechCrunch it plans to enter the continent through Egypt — its third market after India — in the coming months as it embarks on a growth drive accelerated by a $9.4 million seed funding it has raised.

Through its app Zenda allows parents to pay fees directly to schools all while streamlining collections by enabling schools to accept and manage payments online. This means that parents no longer need to provide bank deposit slips as proof of payment because all transactions on Zenda happen in real time. The startup also has an embedded financing option that extends tuition fee credit to parents on a flexible repayment structure.

The startup founded in June last year by Raman Thiagarajan and Haseeb Ahmed both ex-McKinsey & Company staff is the duo’s second venture.

Thiagarajan said that Zenda borrows from their first social edtech startup dubbed nexquare — a management and data analytics system for schools educators and regulators. Thiagarajan who previously led McKinsey’s financial services practice in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region told TechCrunch that their first startup helped them understand the education market at a granular level enabling them to build a fintech solution that solves the challenges encountered by parents and the schools around fee payment and management.

“Fee payments in schools are mostly manual and where it is digital it is cumbersome expensive and has a manual aspect to it” said Thiagarajan.

“With all the knowledge we have from our previous venture we understand the education sector. And so we have a parent-facing app… we also deeply integrate into educational institutions to remove the friction for both the parents and the schools” he said.

Among the investors that took part in the seed round were STV COTU Ventures Global Founders Capital and VentureSouq.

The STV general partner Ihsan Jawad said “Raman Haseeb and the team have identified a compelling gap in the market and in supporting families on a topic that is very important to them. Seeing their strong traction over the past several months we couldn’t be more excited about Zenda. The UAE itself is a $8+ billion market for private education fees and they are already well poised to capture leadership.”

Since launch Thiagarajan says Zenda’s users have increased 20 times with the app reaching over $100 million in annual contracted payment volumes by the close of last year. And the startup is eyeing greater growth this year as it accelerates its expansion beyond the UAE using the new funding which will also support the refinement of its product.

“Most of the funding is going to be used in the area of market development and customer experience” Thiagarajan said.

In the long term Zenda is envisioned to go beyond school fee payment by encompassing other personal financial management aspects.

In the midst of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine China's largest credit card brand Unionpay has become the latest financial services network to suspend its negotiations with the Russian banks after payment giants Visa and Mastercard closed down their services in the country fearing the devasting sanctions.

As per media reports the payment processor is reportedly worried about being the target of sanctions from the U.S. and other countries if it works with sanctioned Russian banks.



These sanctions might include being barred from doing business with an American individual or company or importing goods to or exporting goods from the U.S.



Effectively the sanctions could sever UnionPay from the global financial system--which is a lot more lucrative than Russia's domestic scene.

Launched in 2002 Unionpay is a state-led financial services network operated by China's central bank the People's Bank of China and is the world's second-largest card brand with a 32 per cent market share according to 2020 data from the Nilson Report.

On Wednesday Russian newspaper RBC reported that UnionPay the Chinese state-led financial services network had suspended negotiations with Russian banks on issuing new bank cards for their customers now unable to make purchases outside Russia as a result of Visa's and Mastercard's withdrawal. (Russians could still use the cards to make domestic purchases owing to Russia's local Mir payment system.)

The G7 leaders have already agreed on a ban on all new investments in key sectors of the Russian economy.

When Russia's invasion of Ukraine prompted payments giants Visa and Mastercard to suspend services in the country Moscow expected it could lean on the Chinese alternative UnionPay to plug the holes torn out of its domestic banking system. However the plan now appears to have fallen flat as UnionPay has reportedly decided not to expand its presence in the country.

Both the Bank of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China two of China's largest lending banks have also stopped offering clients finance options for purchases of Russian commodities reports Bloomberg.

And Huawei Technologies--one of the few remaining suppliers of 5G technology in Russia after Nokia and Ericsson pulled out of the country in February--has suspended new orders of network equipment for Russian customers notes Russian outlet Izvestia.

UnionPay's hesitance to enter the Russian market is the latest example of large Chinese companies growing wary of doing business in Russia despite the fact that China has not officially joined Western leaders in piling sanctions on Russia.

Officially China has refused to join Western sanctions on Russia deeming them counterproductive to the peace process. Chinese officials have also blamed the U.S. and Western organizations like NATO for escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine US media reported.

Furthermore ""China doesn't want to give ""western countries any excuses for sanctions bans or boycotts"" Bruce Pang head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance Securities told Fortune last month.

China in recent times has advised its companies to adopt a ""cautious"" approach towards deals with Russia as the country appears to be succumbing to the Western powers who have imposed severe sanctions on Russia.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhdG9kYXkuaW4vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9uZXdzL3N0b3J5L2luZGlhbnMtY2FuLW5vdy1tYWtlLXBheW1lbnRzLXVzaW5nLXVwaS1pbi11YWUtMTk0MDk3Ny0yMDIyLTA0LTIz0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kaWF0b2RheS5pbi9hbXAvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9uZXdzL3N0b3J5L2luZGlhbnMtY2FuLW5vdy1tYWtlLXBheW1lbnRzLXVzaW5nLXVwaS1pbi11YWUtMTk0MDk3Ny0yMDIyLTA0LTIz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Indians can now make payments using UPI in UAE,"Indian travellers can now seamlessly make payments in the UAE using the UPI-based apps. Wonder how? That is because the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has partnered with the Mashreq Bank’s NEOPAY to enable UPI-based payments in the Gulf Nation. The UAE has a humongous population of Indian expats and having UPI as one of the payment methods would make it so much simpler for Indian travellers to make payments in the country. Back in 2021 the UPI services were launched in Bhutan in collaboration with its central bank the Royal Monetary Authority.

Talking about UPI in UAE Ritesh Shukla CEO NIPL said “We are glad to witness BHIM UPI going live in the UAE through our partnership with NEOPAY. This initiative will enable Indian tourists to perform payments using BHIM UPI which has emerged as the preferred mode of payment of Indian citizens. NIPL is consistently working towards simplifying digital payments and driving digital public goods across the globe with our cutting-edge solutions. We are dedicated to building a vast global acceptance network for UPI to ensure seamless user experiences when it comes to payments.”

Here is how UPI in UAE works

It is important to note that UPI payments will only be possible in UAE shops that have NEOPAY terminals. The user should have a bank account with an Indian bank account along with a mobile app like BHIM that supports UPI payments. Currently UPI payments are accepted in Bhutan and Nepal. It is likely to go live in Singapore by the end of this year.

Vibhor Mundhada CEO NEOPAY said “The UAE is consistently one of the top source markets for Indian travelers and our collaboration with NIPL will enable thousands of Indian tourists who visit the UAE every year to enjoy safe and seamless transactions.”

How does UPI work?

If you are oblivious to UPI you should know that it was launched in 2016. It is a digital payment method that has revolutionised the Indian payment ecosystem. The UPI Platform was developed by NPCI and regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). To make UPI payments you need a smartphone a bank account a number linked to your bank account and most importantly an active internet connection.

Some of the apps that support UPI-based payments are BHIM Paytm Google Pay PhonePe and others.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vdHJhay5pbi90YWdzL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIvMDQvMjQvdmlzaXRpbmctZHViYWktbm93LW1ha2UtcGF5bWVudHMtdmlhLXVwaS13aXRob3V0LWFueS1leHRyYS1mZWVzLWhvdy1pdC13b3Jrcy_SAXpodHRwczovL3RyYWsuaW4vdGFncy9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyLzA0LzI0L3Zpc2l0aW5nLWR1YmFpLW5vdy1tYWtlLXBheW1lbnRzLXZpYS11cGktd2l0aG91dC1hbnktZXh0cmEtZmVlcy1ob3ctaXQtd29ya3MvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Visiting Dubai?

Sheri Elwood is a screenwriter director and showrunner. The first season of her TV series Moonshine can be streamed on CBC Gem and Netflix on May 2. The second season will be released later this year.

The morning I decided to radically simplify my life the regular security guard was out sick.

I pulled up to the gated entrance of Warner Bros. the studio where I was working as a writer-producer for the TV show Lucifer expecting to be waved through as usual. But the new guy didn’t recognize me. He insisted he see a photo ID. A driver’s licence.

My secret shame.

I’d lived in Los Angeles for more than a decade but was too scared to attempt the California road test. There are a few things I’m good at: roasting a chicken. Choosing the playlist. Sloth. Things I’m bad at: parallel parking – a trait inherited by my teenage daughter who aced every school test yet crashed our car so many times she once even blamed a tree she’d downed.

The guard waited. The jerk in the Tesla behind me honked. Fine. I fished out my old licence.

The guard examined it: Nova Scotia? Where was this exotic place? As far from L.A. as you could get without falling in the glacial North Atlantic. Did I have family there? Yes. Mom’s got a love-hate thing with her new hip. Stepdad spent the kitchen reno money on a backhoe. And the dogwoods are in bloom. Big pink flowers. I planted them 15 years ago but always miss spring. I paused. “Summer too.”

The guard nodded. Recognition tinged with sadness. That’s when I noticed the hint of an accent. “We’re all a little far from home huh?” He handed back my ID and opened the gate.

Moments later I pulled in to my parking spot alongside our writers’ bungalow my name stencilled in black on a cracked concrete curb a weird perk of having “made it” in Hollywood.

Then I turned off my ignition and burst into tears.

The urge to flee the big city in search of a simpler life is a relatively modern conceit. In my circle the feeling starts to creep in around the fortysomething mark – an itching desire to return to the cozy idyll of the place we’d grown up or even better finding an entirely new place the place we wished we’d grown up. I knew dozens of burnt-out city dwellers considering this reverse migration or as I liked to call it GTFOOD: Getting The F Out Of Dodge.

It was the classic Hallmark fantasy; ditching the high-pressure career deprogramming our city kids and reconnecting with THINGS THAT MATTER including but not limited to: an adorable pet goat/pig/rooster named after a Criterion Collection film character elderly neighbours with homespun-albeit-often-outdated advice a charming fixer-upper you magically knew how to renovate and acres of fertile land purchased for the price of an L.A. chaise.

You’d reconnect with family even if you didn’t have family because small towns welcome strangers with open arms. And butter tarts. There’s always butter tarts. The food varies depending on the season; rhubarb pie fresh steamed lobster poutine oysters plucked from Sober Island – you get the gist.

Prepandemic few actually indulged the fantasy my husband and I included. We were tethered to our careers an unwieldy house four kids two dogs turtles predicted to grow to the size of large dinner plates and a nanny Griselda long outgrown but who still showed up for work every day. We couldn’t just bail. Who would monitor the leaky pool no one swam in?

The answer came when a producer Charles Bishop asked if I had any interest in creating a show set in Nova Scotia. “Something about a family maybe there’s music?” I took it as a sign. Yes I had an idea. A story about an urban career woman who inherits half of her family’s failing campground.

So the actual plot of a Hallmark movie? Not quite.

My show would deal with family dysfunction long-buried trauma addiction sexual repression poverty infidelity tax evasion drug smuggling and crazed sibling rivalry. But funny! I pledged to pull all the skeletons out of the closet or in my case dig them up from the front lawn.

Specifically I wanted to dramatize the relationship of three sisters pushing 40 who most definitely did not have their shit figured out livestock they’d named or happy endings with high-school sweethearts who now ran the local bakery/organic farm/diner.

Moonshine a raucous tale of lust legacy and lobster would be inspired by my own family who ran a ramshackle summer resort and campground in Hubbards a small coastal town on the south shore of Nova Scotia. The idea checked no boxes served no political agenda but it felt timely and true. It was the show for anyone who’d ever longed to return home in search of a simpler life then made the insane decision to follow through. Low stakes Big Drama.

And yes there would be music. Moonshine would play out against a backdrop of classic rock because everyone knows that small-town radio has the same 20 songs on rotation – anthems burned into our national psyche. Even if women-of-a-certain-age stories weren’t your thing you’d watch my show and yearn to rock an old-school spliff with Joni and April Wine goddamnit.

Charles was intrigued but wondered about the autobiographical nature of the show: “Won’t your family mind?” I paused oblivious to my own obliviousness. “Why would they mind? They’ll be thrilled.”

We sold it to CBC the following week.

Inside the making of Moonshine. Early in the pandemic Nova Scotia with its strict COVID-19 rules would be a comfortable and safe place to make the show.

While Moonshine was green-lit for production in late 2019 no one anticipated what was about to befall the world. We went to camera in the summer of 2020 pandemic pioneers one of the first shows in the country to mask up and roll the contagion dice.

Even so I wasn’t worried about travelling back to Canada or the idea of returning to the workplace because nothing was scarier than L.A. at the time. No amount of sunshine or round of afternoon Negronis could paper over the growing homeless encampments protests the threat of Donald Trump being re-elected and the Fear. Everyone in Hollywood was losing their minds.

In contrast Nova Scotia with its strict rules was virtually COVID-free – a utopian beacon of sanity. While my husband is American I held the golden ticket a Canadian passport. It was our way out and we were taking it.

After we sold our L.A. home to a well-known actor-director who loved our easy access to the freeway in case the zombies rolled in we packed our belongings put a sight-unseen offer on a renovated church hall in the UNESCO World Heritage town of Lunenburg and waved goodbye.

It would be amazing I promised our youngest son 16. He’d gone to summer camp in Nova Scotia. Now he’d get to experience that feeling year-round. “Ticks bad food and pink eye?” Charlie wasn’t sold. “It’s not forever right? Please tell me we’re going back to L.A. after COVID?”

I assured him the world would right itself eventually then we’d see what’s what.

Traditionally the Maritimes have been a place people moved away from in search of greener pastures but for the first time in its history the greener pastures now had an ocean view. In 2021 Nova Scotia marked its largest population boom since the 1970s the modestly sized province topping more than one million people.

Business is booming and not everyone is happy about it. Housing prices have skyrocketed which means some locals can’t afford to rent in their own towns let alone buy. Tradespeople are few and far between because of the uptick of new builds. Even rental cars are in short supply – wannabe residents scouting for their new lives. Would we be welcomed back? Or was this a chase-the-newbies-with-torches situation?

While technically I was considered a “local” I suspected my return might be deeply annoying because it’s one thing to go home quite another to go home with a huge fleet of trucks and trailers and a cast and crew of 120 in tow.

Maybe I’d be given a pass? Hell I was hiring local and bringing a certain notoriety to the town. They should be thanking us right? Charles the producer was still worried about my folks.

Mellow by nature Mom took it all in stride. She claimed to enjoy monitoring the action from her front porch because she knew how bossy I could get and didn’t want my crew to revolt.

Then she reminded me about a prep meeting I was late for in the lunch tent. Of course she’d asked to be put on call-sheet distribution and had my line producer on speed dial.

Initially this clash of the personal and professional worked. I rode the bike I’d abandoned years ago from set to set weighing in on decisions ranging from tenor of a joke to the colour of the David Crosby-inspired beanie our fictional patriarch Peter MacNeill wore.

And while we writers had no parking with our names on curbs – or any real perks for that matter – we did score a cabin near the beach. A typical day: writing. Swim at lunch. Revisions in the sun. My colleague Moira would force-feed me a butter tart then I’d stop to check in on Mom to remind her to lay off the smokes and work on the hip. She’d smile politely. Then tell me to piss off.

The dream was manifest. If only I could find a decent place to sleep.

Our “charming fixer-upper” in Lunenburg turned out to be a huge empty space with rows of merciless church windows. It was freezing on cold days a sweltering terrarium in the sun. The downstairs gussied up just enough to be deemed “residential” had poured concrete floors only a fascist could love and no usable outdoor space.

The former owners also turned out to be giants. Countertops shelving even the built-in bed had been designed for 6½-foot-tall aliens. We couldn’t reach the mugs. Vertically challenged writers without caffeine is an ugly ugly thing.

This was a months-long reno at best (we’re currently on Year 2) which meant we couldn’t unpack our eighteen-wheeler’s worth of belongings. Think the warehouse from the last scene of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Rows and rows of identical brown boxes lovingly organized by our nanny Griselda. Most labels didn’t list the contents; instead there were sad faces drawn in Sharpie saying “I miss you” and “come home” in Spanish. Cute but not so helpful especially for a teenager searching for his vintage Air Jordans.

In the interim I asked my mom if we could crash on the campground near set. Sure she said but it was busy season – possibly their busiest ever. Nova Scotians who weren’t allowed to vacation outside of the province had been coming in droves. Between my crew and tourists from Truro the dreaded Cabin 3 was all that was available.

When my mother didn’t like the sound of a guest making a booking on the phone (she didn’t believe in online) she’d stick them in Cabin 3. When a band came to play the Shore Club and required accommodations the toothless roadie got Cabin 3. Cabin 3 was code for roughing it. A quiet fuck you from the owners.

The stove was a barely functioning hot plate. The shower worked fine if you didn’t mind rusty water. Rustic chic extended to the vintage mattress where judging from the smell I’m pretty sure the roadie had just taken a nap.

My siblings thought this was hilarious. L.A. Sheri in Cabin 3? “Mom must be pissed.” I assured them she wasn’t and that L.A. Sheri was no more. This was new back-to-basics Sheri. If I could handle flying coach with two dogs I could handle Cabin 3. They reminded me that my husband flew with the dogs. I flew business.

No matter. It was cheap which meant I could afford that Fleetwood Mac song for Moonshine’s soundtrack. And bonus I had a view of the main house so I could monitor Mom’s habits – and she mine. Rolling in after a night shoot. Trolling for cell signal. Hiding from Judy the local historian who was desperate to include me and my spectacle in the Hubbards historical records.

I was the story of a local girl who made good and Judy wanted the dirt. Sure the characters on Moonshine were fictional but which of my real siblings did I base the alcoholic brother on? Had Nora really slept with the entire volunteer fire department? More pressing that scene where the lead Lidia runs over a tourist with a golf cart? Judy was there when that actually happened years earlier. Were those charges ever dropped?

Open this photo in gallery: Corrine Koslo shown with Peter MacNeill on set plays the mother on Moonshine.

It’s one thing writing about your life. Quite another when you return to the scene of the crime to see it realized on TV. The meta nature of Moonshine could no longer be ignored as siblings cousins and parents visited set only to be met by their fictional counterparts.

Corrine Koslo who plays the mother Bea on the show even started shopping at my mom’s favourite dress shop and in turn my mother ordered Corrine her favourite lipstick so they could match. Yeah it was weird. And it was my own damn fault.

I’d been directing a scene about our fictional radio station COVE-FM set at the real radio station also named COVE-FM when I was approached by the town bookkeeper who kept an office next door. She gushed. Moonshine had given a much-needed boost to the local economy and everyone was so grateful. She couldn’t wait to see the show. “Your mother is so proud.” “And resilient” cracked my ex-husband our production designer Bill Fleming. Resilient? What the hell did that mean?

Tired of being damp and dirty in Cabin 3 I hightailed my giant rental Jeep to my mom’s parking spot and hauled dirty laundry to her door. It was locked. Impossible. Mom went out without telling me? Even the hidden key was gone.

Were my siblings right? Was Mom pissed? Sure I’d spent more than a few nights in my sister’s childhood bedroom. I was sick of set catering so was raiding their fridge on the daily. Our teenagers had taken up residence in Grandma and Grandpa’s den and yeah my crew was stopping by on the nightly for a bevy. My parents’ deck had become the hottest club in town and no one paid their tab.

Certain locals were also getting sick of us: We drove too fast up Shore Road. We depleted the liquor and organic-food aisles at the local grocery store. Night filming was loud disruptive and shone lights into the campground. And old Hilda Duncan was on the warpath because we’d blocked her path to the beach with our art-directed trailer park. But my own mother locking me out? This was next-level.

Open this photo in gallery: A sign at our trailer park marks the distance back to Laurel Canyon in California. We had come a long way to be here in more ways than one.

Children leave the nest because that is what mammals are designed to do. It’s healthy and natural. So if and when we make the decision to come back home we need to be okay if said nest is different. Smaller – if the nest is still there at all. Because that’s nature too. Parents miss us but the truth is they don’t want us gentrifying their coffee shops crashing in their den or naming their goats.

My family was okay with me making a show inspired by them. They were proud. What they weren’t okay with was me monitoring the life they’d built in my absence. If the old hippies felt like sneaking a butt or getting loco in the hot tub they wanted to do it in peace.

Production on Season 1 eventually wrapped – the last episodes had us filming a hot summer beach scene as an early snow flew and my gifted lead Jennifer Finnigan pretended to sweat. The 80-some-odd trailers and trucks moved on restoring my mom’s view and our cast and crew flew back to L.A. Ontario and B.C.

As for us reverse migrants I moved out of Cabin 3 and back into my sort-of-renovated behemoth in Lunenburg. My husband and I finally opened boxes piling dishes into drawers and shelves we could now reach and I had a moment to consider the gravity of what I’d done. Because transplanting your entire family to scratch that Hallmark itch had a dark side for the rest of the family too.

Charlie was struggling at the local high school unable to be the hero of his own story when he walked amongst “non-playable characters” – gamer speak for kids who didn’t know what to do with my arty L.A. teen. Masked shy and oh-so-different than his small-town Canadian counterparts he hadn’t made a single friend and our other three college-age children were separated by a COVID-ravaged border.

And as for my work-life balance? The “radical simplification”? Making a TV show is all-consuming and I hadn’t had a day off since we’d arrived. I never did get to visit the local farmers market and the days I was able to enjoy my dogwoods in bloom were few and far between. In trying to forcefully impose the warped Hallmark fantasy both real and fictional I’d created a much bigger problem. Yes I was back home but my big-city burdens had moved back with me. Great fodder for Moonshine bad fodder for life.

Open this photo in gallery: Making Moonshine didn't leave a lot of time to enjoy the small-town life I'd come to savour.

My mom called worried. She’d found a single boot in Cabin 3 and was concerned I was barefoot. Did we want to come for supper? SWEETJESUSYES. We were starving because our new oven arrived broken beyond repair. For the second time.

Now that filming was over it was quiet again in Hubbards a sunny day in October. We sat on my parents’ porch and ate. Glorious chowder.

We laughed that Judy never did get the full story and we admired the towering ancestral pot plants my stepfather cultivated and strategized how to move them inside mid-squall.

Then we screened the first episode of Moonshine.

It wasn’t the dysfunction the language or the tangled emotional dynamics that my parents recognized. Much to Charles’s relief they never assumed the show was “about” them as people rarely see themselves as their loved ones do.

What struck my parents glued them to the screen were the shots of their beloved small town. They clapped and gasped at every drone shot of the coastline the white sand beach our fictional band rocking out at the Shore Club.

“Look at where we live! Now the world will get to see it too.”

They were bursting with pride. For their home. And for me.

It was that moment tumbler of boxed wine in hand surrounded by the OG Moonshiners that I realized why I’d come back home and what the show was really about: what Hollywood execs call the “why now” of this tale.

Moonshine isn’t a show about the quest for a simpler life because simple is bullshit. It does not exist. Life is messy heartbreaking and unpredictable.

You can try to run from the complexity but it’s impossible to hide – especially in a town where everyone knows that the woman who ran over the tourist with the golf cart was you.

The reason I’d cried that day on the studio lot wasn’t because I hated my life in L.A. or because I craved simplicity. I cried because I was missing an important piece of the life puzzle. Family. Making time real time for the people who mattered. The people who called me on my bullshit. The mother who cared if I was hungry and barefoot.

Several months and a second season later I was back in L.A. settling a much-happier Charlie into his senior year of high school when I got the call. Mom had fallen over and couldn’t get up. This time it wasn’t a hip issue or too much gin. An emergency MRI had revealed rapidly spreading lesions on her brain stem. A rare form of cancer.

The whole clan came home. Me and my non-fictional siblings sat at Mom’s bedside thanking her for our lives telling her that we loved her and most of the time each other.

I called everyone I’d ever known and everyone they’d ever known to track down a neurosurgeon who might give us hope. Making a TV show during a pandemic is child’s play compared with navigating Nova Scotia’s health care system.

To no avail. Five weeks later my funny proud hot-tub-loving mother was dead.

While my grief is incalculable I worry my siblings’ suffering may be worse. Like most children who leave the nest they’d been away from home for many years – the complications of COVID-19 young children and busy careers. I was the only idiot naive enough to upend my life and move back to a small town that didn’t want me yet was kind enough to welcome me back … along with the circus I’d dragged along for the ride.

Was it fate? Opportunity? Had I sensed the fragility of time as the world was on the verge of falling apart? My children and I were lucky enough to have seen my mother every day for two years whether she wanted to see us or not. She’d remind me of this as she pulled us in for a hug.

It’s this loving spiky spirit this real-life messiness that infuses Moonshine and as I continue to grieve keeps me upright still.

Can you ever really go home again? No.

Go anyway.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ib3N0b24uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA0LzIzL2Eta2luZ3N0b24tZmFtaWx5cy1ob3VzZS13YXMtYm9tYmFyZGVkLXdpdGgtZ29sZi1iYWxscy10aGV5LXN1ZWQtdGhlLWNvdW50cnktY2x1Yi1uZXh0LWRvb3ItYW5kLXdvbi1uZWFybHktNS1taWxsaW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Kingston family's house was bombarded with golf balls.

Seven hundred golf balls were not included when the Tenczars bought their $750000 Kingston home.

But neither were the broken windows dented siding and gunshot-sounding golf ball hits that turned their dream home into a nightmare according to The Boston Globe.

The couple decided to pursue legal action and sued their neighbors at the Indian Pond Country Club for trespass over the continual bombardment the paper reports. In December a jury granted the Tenczars $3.5 million for damages and emotional and mental suffering after a six-day trial according to the Globe.

This award totals $4.9 million with interest the paper reports.

For the past four years Erik and Athina Tenczar have raised their three young daughters in a home that borders the country club’s golf course. During this time their home was regularly attacked by balls from the course’s 15th hole according to the Globe.

“We’re always on edge” Erik Tenczar told the paper. “It’s been emotionally taxing on us.”

The Globe goes on to describe the neighborhood where kids wear bicycle helmets when playing outside golf balls splash into kiddie pools and most recently a deck railing got knocked out.

When the family bought the house in 2017 the paper reports they fell in love with it — before the golfing season.

“Honestly if you have all these houses on a course I assumed it was safe” Athina Tenczar told the Globe.

The Tenczar family tried to call the country club but say they got little response according to the paper. After calling the police the Tenczars learned there was little law enforcement could do besides call the country club as well. So the family hired a lawyer and sued according to the Globe.

“They bought what they thought was their dream house” the Tenczars’ lawyer Bob Galvin told the paper. “And it became a nightmare for them.”

The country club’s lawyer John Flemming told the Globe the course’s owners took action by consulting an architect to find solutions. He disputed the golf course was unresponsive to the Tenczars according to the paper.

The country club has since fixed the course’s 15th tee and now the Tenczars have not seen a golf ball on their property for months the Globe reports.

The country club’s lawyers reportedly are planning to file an appeal according to the paper.

“In my opinion as a matter of law the verdict of $3.5 million for alleged emotional distress is against the weight of the evidence” Flemming told the Globe.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9nbG9iZWdhemV0dGUvbmFtZS9wZXRlci1ncmliYmVuLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM0NDIyNDE40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Peter Gribben Obituary (2022) - Mason City IA - Globe Gazette,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/globegazette/name/peter-gribben-obituary?id=34422418 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9nbG9iZWdhemV0dGUvbmFtZS9wZXRlci1ncmliYmVuLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM0NDIyNDE40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vbW9uZXlpbmMuY29tL2Jlc3QtdGhpbmdzLXRvLWRvLWluLWdsb2JlLWF6L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 20 Best Things to do in Globe AZ,"If you're looking for a fun and interesting place to visit look no further than Globe AZ.

While most of Wall Street focuses on large-cap and mega-cap stocks as they provide a degree of safety and liquidity many investors are limited in the number of shares they can buy. Many of the biggest public companies especially the technology giants trade in the hundreds all the way up to over $1000 per share or more. At those steep prices it is difficult to get any decent share count leverage.

[in-text-ad]

Many investors especially more aggressive traders look at lower-priced stocks as a way not only to make some good money but to get a higher share count. That can really help the decision-making process especially when you are on to a winner as you can always sell half and keep half.

Goldman Sachs is the premier investment bank in the world so we screened its outstanding research database and found five stocks trading under the $10 level that could provide investors with upside potential ranging from over 125% to 400%. For those leery of low-priced shares just remember that Amazon and Apple at one time traded in the single digits. Zynga a stock we have featured over the years recently was purchased by Take-Two Interactive Software.



While all five are rated Buy at Goldman Sachs they are much better suited for very aggressive investors. It also is important to remember that no single analyst report should be used as a sole basis for any buying or selling decision.

Angi

Shares of this popular home services company have been crushed and have huge upside potential. Angi Inc. (NASDAQ: ANGI) connects home service professionals with consumers in the United States and internationally.

The Angi Ads business connects consumers with service professionals for local services through the Angi nationwide online directory of service professionals in various service categories. It provides consumers with valuable tools services and content including verified reviews to help them research shop and hire for local services and it sells term-based website and mobile and digital magazine advertising to service professionals as well as provides quoting invoicing and payment services.



The company also owns and operates Angi Leads digital marketplace service which connects consumers with service professionals for home repair maintenance and improvement projects; offers consumers with tools and resources to find local pre-screened and customer-rated service professionals as well as online appointment booking; and connects consumers with service professionals by telephone and home services-related resources.Angi also operates Handy a platform for household services primarily cleaning and repair services; Angi Roofing which provides roof replacement and repair services; and home services marketplaces under the Travaux MyHammer Werkspot MyBuilder and Instapro names.

Goldman Sachs has a $12 price target for Angi stock while the consensus target is $11.59. The shares closed trading on Friday at $4.73. Hitting the Goldman Sachs target would be about a 128% gain.

Array Technologies

This company is still sometimes confused with a biotech with a similar name that Pfizer bought in 2019. Array Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: ARRY) provides solar tracking solutions and services for utility-scale projects. Its products include DuraTrack HZ v3 a single-axis solar tracking system and SmarTrack a machine learning software that automatically adjusts module angles in response to weather and site conditions.

This stock had a red-hot initial public offering in 2020. Shares charged out of the gate as the first trade was 34% above where the upsized IPO was priced. A total of 47.5 million shares were sold in the offering as the maker of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects sold 7 million shares to raise $154 million and a selling shareholder sold 40.5 million shares.

Since then Array Technologies stock has crashed and is offering investors an incredible entry point.

The Goldman Sachs target price is $21 and the consensus target for Array Technologies stock is $21.80. Shares traded on Friday at $7.02 down 5%. Hitting the Goldman Sachs target would be a 148% gain or so.

Kinnate Biopharma

If clinical data goes the way the analysts expect this stock could be an incredible home run. Kinnate Biopharma Inc. (NASDAQ: KNTE) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of small molecule kinase inhibitors to treat genomically defined cancers in the United States.

The company develops KIN-2787 a rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma inhibitor for the treatment of patients with lung cancer melanoma and other solid tumors; KIN-3248 small-molecule kinase inhibitors that target cancer-associated alterations in fibroblast growth factor receptors FGFR2 and FGFR3 genes; and small molecule research programs including Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 12(CDK12) inhibitor in its KIN004 program.

The company recently announced that the first patient has commenced treatment in its Phase 1 KN-4802 clinical trial evaluating its lead fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) product candidate KIN-3248. This is a next-generation pan-FGFR inhibitor being developed for the treatment of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and urothelial carcinoma as well as other solid tumors.

The $44 Goldman Sachs price objective is higher than the also incredible $41.50 consensus target. The shares closed trading at $8.26 on Friday. Hitting the Goldman Sachs target would be a moonshot 415% gain.



Vivint Smart Home

This off-the-radar company has been growing quickly as home security has become a priority for many. Vivint Smart Home Inc. (NYSE: VVNT) engages in the sale installation servicing and monitoring of smart home and security systems primarily in the United States and Canada.

The company’s smart home platform includes cloud-enabled smart home operating systems; AI-driven smart home automation and assistance software; software-enabled smart home devices; and tech-enabled services to educate manage and support the smart home.

The Goldman Sachs price target of $14 compares with a $12.14 consensus target and a $5.40 per share Vivint Smart Home stock price on Friday. Hitting the Goldman Sachs target price would be about a 166% gain.



Zevia

This is another micro-cap idea with incredible upside potential. Zevia PBC (NYSE: ZVIA) is a beverage company that develops markets sells and distributes various carbonated and non-carbonated soft drinks in the United States and Canada.

The company offers soda energy drinks organic tea mixers kids beverages and sparkling water. The company offers its products through various retail channels including grocery distributors national retailers warehouse club and natural products retailers as well as e-commerce channels.

Goldman Sachs has set a $16 price target. The consensus target is $11.27 and shares wrere last traded on Friday at $3.44. Hitting that Goldman Sachs target would be a gain of 300% or so.

Sports Editor

“Life moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop and look around once in a while you could miss it.” - Ferris Bueller.

As a nine year old watching Ferris Bueller’s Day Off I often wish I would’ve taken this quote to heart from the moment it hit my ears. These past four year have flown by at Florida State faster than I would’ve liked but I can happily say that I made the best of every opportunity while I was here.

Before my junior year of high school Florida State was never on my radar. Even when touring schools during the application process FSU wasn’t my first choice. Nonetheless I ended up in Landis Hall in the fall of 2018 unprepared for what college had in store for me.

After getting involved with V89 Sports my freshman year I met Gary Putnik. At the end of that spring Gary was promoted to Sports Editor and mentioned to the group that he was looking for writers. After expressing my interest he interviewed me over the phone and I started a short time later.

Writing for the sports section over the next two years provided me with some unique opportunities that any sports fan would dream of. I was fortunate enough to be on the football field when Odell Haggins who was interim head coach at the time helped FSU get its sixth win of the season to become bowl eligible. I also got to travel to Gainesville as a media member and eat lunch in the same room as the legendary Dick Vitale. Later on I was able to interview FSU greats Trent Forrest and Devin Vassell right after they took down the Gators.

As a writer the FSView gave me some special memories that can never be taken away and I will be forever grateful for that. At the end of my junior year Thomas Martinez gave me the opportunity to be the next Sports Editor of the paper. I was ready for a change and overseeing around eight writers for the past year has been extremely rewarding.

While I was here I was blessed enough to watch both Trent Forrest dunk on Jordan Nwora and 4th and 14 against Miami. These moments made me realize how proud I was to go to this school. Now as graduation sits less than a week away I can’t help but reflect on a few lessons I learned while here at Florida State.

Put yourself in uncomfortable situations. Being from Tennessee and not knowing a single person going into college can be a tough spot to be in. The only reason I had such a great college experience is because I put myself out there. I did things I was scared to do like attending different campus events or trying out various organizations.

Know that curveballs will be thrown your way. As Mike Tyson says “Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.” COVID-19 taught me that. One day I was attending classes and the next thing I know a whole year of college is gone. Life isn’t always going to go how you want or think it will. What matters the most is how you respond to whatever is thrown your way.

Once you find yourself stand up for what you believe in. By putting yourself out there and experiencing as much as possible while you’re in college you will find out what you enjoy as well as what you don’t particularly fancy. When you’ve established who you are and the person you want to be stick true to it. Don’t follow the crowd or do something that you know you won’t like. People will respect you for sticking to your standards.

Action cures fear. It’s pretty self explanatory. The fear goes away once you do whatever it was that you were afraid of.

Be kind. This one can never be said enough. Always be nice to others. It can go a long way.

Stop and look around every once in a while. College flew by for me. For many it can be a constant whirlwind between classes organizations work and social events. I distinctly remember being in the basketball student section this past semester during Wake Forest and just thoroughly enjoying the moment. Being in those packed bleachers in the Tucker Center has given me some of the most amazing memories I will always cherish.

I’m so blessed to have spent my college years at Florida State University. In the words of Sue Semrau “I am Nole Blooded and I’m proud to be a Seminole forever.”",,,,,,

One of their chants — “All lives can’t matter until Black lives matter” — distilled the message of the demonstration which organizers said intended to roll out the “unwelcome mat” in Hartford to New England Nationalist Social Club.

Aaron Joyner a freshman at the University of Hartford who attended with a half-dozen friends from the university said she learned about the rally and march through social media.

A demonstration organized by Black Lives Matter 860 marches down Albany Avenue in Hartford on Sunday protesting alleged white supremacist moves into Connecticut from outside the state.

“Nobody should have to constantly prove that like it’s our right to be here. It’s our right to even want to have equal rights” Joyner said. “I’m thankful as a Black woman that there are people here who have a common interest in being able to live the same and live in peace.”

Sunday’s event was touched off by a recent alleged flash demonstration in Hartford by the Nationalist Social Club and flyers distributed in East Hartford and Southington.

One of those leaflets from the Nationalist Social Club rooted in Boston declared a stand “for the security and prosperity of white New Englanders.” On Market Street in downtown Hartford on April 16 people representing to be group members held banners that read “White Lives Matter” “Defend New England” and “Defend White Lives.”

“It was incredibly close to the University of Hartford” Joyner a New Haven native said. “That’s less than 10 minutes from where we all sleep. It’s scary to think about and it’s simply because of the color of my skin. It’s ridiculous.”

Joyner carried a sign with a clear message for white supremacist groups: “Stop pretending your racism is patriotism.”

The Nationalist Social Club is defined by the Anti-Defamation League as a neo-Nazi group with regional chapters in the U.S. and abroad.

What concerns Ivelisse Correa chief executive of Black Lives Matter 860 the organizer of Sunday’s rally and march are “the people that will listen to them.”

“So there are remote pockets of the state that would support them and those remote pockets of the state do not have a minority presence or a very small percentage” Correa said.

Marchers in a Black Lives Matter demonstration hold up anti-racism signs along Albany Avenue in Hartford on Sunday.

A larger statewide rally is planned for Saturday at the state Capitol at noon Correa said.

Sunday’s event in Hartford began with a brief rally at the west entrance to Keney Park with a march stepping off on Woodland Street. Correa and others at the head of the march carried a banner emblazoned with “No Hate No KKK No Fascist USA.”

The march proceeded down the center of Albany Avenue and then turned up Edgewood Street.

Midway along Edgewood Street Neftali Serrano poked his head and torso outside a window on the first floor of one house and raised a fist over his head in solidarity.

“It’s showing the people in the community that Black lives matter all race lives matter” Serrano said in an interview a short time later. “It’s awesome.”

The 30-minute march wrapped up along Greenfield Street returning to the park entrance.

Shawn Fisher pastor of the Bloomfield Congregational Church said he and a dozen or so of the church’s parishioners decided to join the rally and march many of them involved in a program getting at how to end racism.

Fisher wearing a black clerical robe and red stole said the group has been learning about white privilege and hate organizations.

“And more about the things we need to know about each other and ourselves” Fisher said. “Our church is a very diverse congregation age-wise race-wise culture-wise and gender identity-wise. So we’ve been having these conversations and we were ready to take that next step of action.”

Fisher said it was critical for people who aren’t being attacked — himself one of them as a middle-class white male — to stand by those who are oppressed.

“To let them know we will stand beside them — not in front not behind them right beside them” Fisher said. “They are our neighbors. They are people who matter. We’re not going to put up with people who we care about and people that we love being attacked oppressed and harassed for who they are.”

Submitted

A Conard High School senior and a Hall High School sophomore have combined efforts to collect school supplies for Ukrainian students displaced by the ongoing war in their country. People are asked to donate supplies on Saturday April 30 from 9 a.m. to noon at Conard High School’s main entrance.

Supplies being collected include new or gently used backpacks writing and coloring supplies notebooks books tissues Band-aids gloves and hats decks of cards and small toys. A collection has been ongoing at both high schools and continues through April 29.

Conard senior Lydia Griffin said “When I started seeing the beginning of the war in Ukraine I was worried as many people were and I wanted to do something to help. I knew that it wouldn’t be something as easy as community service because I’m over 4600 miles away. I started doing a bit of research for a couple days but then I came across a post in Neighbors and Friends and that’s how I learned about Kathryn Olesnevich doing a backpack drive in Manchester and I thought that would be something great for us to bring to Conard.”

Olesnevich is a fifth grade teacher in Manchester and a mom to Conard students. She said “My momma died Feb. 11 and when it came to my return to work/teaching I didn’t want to go back but I checked my email and saw an email about a backpack drive. My momma was Ukrainian and was deeply rooted in giving to others and volunteered regularly. I saw the email as a sign returned to work and dove into this project as a way to celebrate her life and all that she taught me.

“In Manchester we collected over 100 backpacks weighing over 500 pounds. On the day we dropped it off – emotions were running high and I’ve never felt so certain my momma was with my poppa and I as we unloaded.”

“I have seen Conard do a variety of collections such as food books coats and more and from what I have seen they all appeared to be pretty successful. I know that there was many students like myself who wanted to help but weren’t sure what to do so this was a perfect opportunity for them” said Griffin. “As well with the students being tons of help in donating (from what I’ve collected so far) I also have to thank [Conard Career Center and Student Activities Coordinator] Mrs. Cersosimo for helping me out a ton with the collection and getting the word out on social media.”

Griffin added “Having Hall pick up the backpack drive was super exciting as well. Mrs. Shaffer Hall’s student coordinator reached out to me and then I recruited my friend Alyssa Puskarz to help me out because have a student in charge at the school definitely helps. I was impressed with what they were able to collect in such short time and I’m also grateful for everything I’ve seen from the two high school communities so far.”

Puskarz added “I was so eager to bring the drive to Hall because I felt that as a high school student it is difficult for me and my peers to help those in Ukraine. Being able to provide the materials for students to continue their academic path is such a fulfilling feeling.”

Donations are being coordinated through the Ukrainian National Home in Hartford. All supplies are being brought to Poland for distribution. “No matter what you bring even from pencils to a backpack is making a change” said Griffin.

Seibertron was part of a round table discussion with Hasbro a few days ago. Nothing new was revealed it was just a question and answer period. Our question was to know if there would be more weapon multipacks but we got the same non answer though Hasbro did clarify that sometimes weapons that are not included with a particular character could be released down the line with another if there is room in the budget and tooling for it. For instance we saw that with Core Class SS Ravage who had an accessory specifically for SS BB Soundwave.



One of the biggest points of discussion was the whole deal with Hasbro releasing Siege Soundwave  which was plentiful rather than the Netflix Soundwave which both had the G1 alt mode many fans wanted AND was only released as a Walmart exclusive at a higher price due to coming in a multipack. Well Hasbro was very blunt and honest regarding this it is due to the exclusive status of the molding. If new molding is released exclusively through a retailer then that retailer has the rights to the selling of that toy and the tooling for a certain amount of time. Not all contracts are the same. For instance Amazon had exclusive rights to the Kingdom Terrorsaur release/tooling but the time of that exclusivity was short enough that now Target owns the rights to selling that tooling since they will do that with the redeco coming soon.



But the time for Walmart's exclusivity on Netflix Soundwave has not expired yet and we don't know when it will expire or if Hasbro intends on rereleasing it when it does. But at least now we know why Hasbro is rereleasing Siege Soundwave instead of the other Soundwave. We have images of the packaging below.



Speaking of the packaging questions came up regarding the open box nature of the legacy line. This is where Hasbro clearly stated that the legacy line is still designed with kids in mind and they product tested this line with kids. It turns out kids prefer the open box design over closed box. Also Cybertron Metroplex was picked over other titan options for its appeal to kids. They said kids liked the idea of a big construction-type vehicle it added to the coolness factor of the giant robot.



There was also acknowledgement of price hikes that are not confirmed to end and of yellowing on toys they are looking into that.



Finally the question of Menasor's Combiner Wars ports came up . Yes they did use the same port system used in the Combiner Wars line but it was done simply because it's a good system for partsforming and not for backwards compatibility. It is only used in the leg segments and while people could attach legs from the combiner wars era it will not be 100% sturdy.

So...the exclusivity rules...those apply to Netflix Bumblebee as well. I know people have said he can't be rereleased because of VW but could it more have to do with Walmart's rights to the new tooling? Posted by MeGrimlock78 on April 24th 2022 @ 2:54pm CDT

Its probably both to be fair so even when the walmart part ends the VW part could still scupper him till the time they get the license again.

Thanks man I really wanted to give examples and context in a way that would help people understand.



I am looking at facebook comments regarding this and many fans are still having a really hard time acknowledging that their are not the main focus of any toyline especially one like Legacy.



Anyways people were talking about previous titans going on sale and I'm pretty sure I got both on sale. Not discounted that never happened. But pretty sure there were sales. @Kanrabat didn't Walmart have Omega on sale by the end? I bought mine at Toysrus though and they had like a 20% off sale so that was good enough for me. Bought Scorponok from them as well since we was also on sale at some point (and predaking who was on a really good sale once). People were probably talking of discount/liquidation though so me buying on sale is probably not the same thing. I won't be buying any titans anymore though no room and no interest. I got the big bots I wanted. Will probably sell fort max I don't take him out to play with him with my kids ever unlike Omega and Trypitcon.

Blitzwing got officially revealed not even 2 weeks ago and he's already out? I haven't even seen the wave 1 leaders yet wow (although that may have more to do with the glut of Slags & Grindors still sitting around taking up space more than anything).



If Blitzwing is THAT early I wonder how long it'll take to see Jhiaxus and the Deluxes...



Hopefully those BW repaints will hit the US soon. Posted by Nemesis Primal on April 24th 2022 @ 3:18pm CDT

Yeah I've seen comments and attitudes similar in other sites as well. Personally I'm fine with kids being the focus as they are the life blood of the franchise and have been since fhe beginning.



As for Titans I was always unlucky with the Titans I wanted when the class first started but after I moved a few years back I just didn't have the space to display bots of that size. Doesn't mean I can't enjoy pictures of them though Yeah I've seen comments and attitudes similar in other sites as well.

I never planned to get Omega for a long while but the more I saw people talking how awsome he was the more I regretted missing out.



Then Walmart online had a second run for 225$CAN instead of the going rate of 250/275$CAN so all my instincts SCREAMED to get him. I did and I'm glad my online purchase went through. I picked him up at the store in the highest point of the COVID panic. I was with my sister by car and we had to line up bumper to bumper for one hour to get my bot. Bless her heart.



No regrets at all because as for now Omega is the best titan ever. I still have to unbox my Select Black Zarak. I'm waiting for the last upgrade kits to arrive by mail before finally playing with him.

I'd like to see some evidence of their claim because I have huge doubts about kids being their target audience and source of decision-making input. Given a majority of their character choices are G1 (of which kids have nearly zero connection unless their parents force it on them) and the high pricepoint compared to other arguably more desirable toys in the same aisle I can't imagine much of the retail sales result in these toys going into the hands of children. It's even further evidenced by the exclusive nature of many of the toys resulting in scalpers making 3 to 4 times the retail value through reselling. No parent is going to spend that money to give their kid something they may not even care to have.



Regarding their claim that the open box was a kid-tested idea I suddenly envisioned the old shortly-lived Toy Box reality show where a panel of 5 kids decided the fates of new toy inventions. I can just imagine the main office having a bring-your-kid-to-work day and they asked those kids which box they preferred. ""There now we can say we product-tested the box with kids!""

I'd like to see some evidence of their claim because I have huge doubts about kids being their target audience and source of decision-making input. Given a majority of their character choices are G1 (of which kids have nearly zero connection unless their parents force it on them) and the high pricepoint compared to other arguably more desirable toys in the same aisle I can't imagine much of the retail sales result in these toys going into the hands of children. It's even further evidenced by the exclusive nature of many of the toys resulting in scalpers making 3 to 4 times the retail value through reselling. No parent is going to spend that money to give their kid something they may not even care to have.



Regarding their claim that the open box was a kid-tested idea I suddenly envisioned the old shortly-lived Toy Box reality show where a panel of 5 kids decided the fates of new toy inventions. I can just imagine the main office having a bring-your-kid-to-work day and they asked those kids which box they preferred. ""There now we can say we product-tested the box with kids!"" No it had nothing to do with them cutting corners to save money on packaging.

This is not the kind of thing that there's ever going to be ""evidence"" for you can either take their marketing at their word or you can disbelieve it. I think it's obvious that many of their decisions like character choice and the G1 focus more generally are obviously prioritizing collectors over children. But other choices like play features and box marketing could reasonably be expected to target children. I also wonder how much of this is based on what kids or parents want versus what retailer ordering professionals want.



Though on that topic and on the subject of exclusives you raised it's also clear that retailers know the adult collector demographic is important even if it's a bigger part of their web presence then in-store selling. Target Wal-Mart and Amazon have all done dedicated collector events and mini-sites which often include toys that have very limited appeal to children.



In sum I don't have any reason to doubt what Hasbro says at these events but I don't think it's as reductive as they sometimes imply or as fansites sometimes infer. And as an aside and with no evidence other than my own biased recollection it seems to me that they often use kids as an excuse for things they know fans broadly don't like such as the open-window packaging. I'm curious why Transformers is keeping it even as many of their Marvel Legends products are moving to closed-box and I can't imagine there's that much difference in the demos for those lines.

Just because the new toys are G1-inspired doesn't mean they can't appeal to today's children. If their parents tell them they had similar figures representing the same characters when they were kids that's just a bonus. A kid will walk down a toy aisle and be drawn to whatever they find fun and visually stimulating. And the Legacy figures are nothing if not colorful especially the packaging. Even if they know nothing of G1 the new toys can be appealing.



I think if we look for which figures are considered more adult-focused we would have to look at prices. So the Titan class commander class and maybe even leader class (since it's now $60 if taxes are added) are more towards adults I would think. But maybe leader class is a gray area. I know when I was young only rich kids got Fort Max. Posted by Rodimus Prime on April 24th 2022 @ 6:34pm CDT

I live in KCMO and the first sighting I had of any deluxe (Arcee) was back on Monday April 4th.

This same store had two Legacy Blasters (one I bought) 3 Bulkheads 2 Galvatrons and 1 Laser Prime.

Being almost literally in the middle of the midwest I just thought that if I was seeing stuff most likely everyone would be especially by now.

I went to 4 different Target stores today 2 of which had Arcee; one Walmart had an Arcee and 2 Skids but no luck with Kickback or Dragstrip anywhere. I've had some bad luck with timing so far.

I have both on preorder but after seeing Arcee at the beginning of the month I really thought I'd score at least one of those two that I want.



If you're not seeing anything yet hang in there; I don't see how it could be much longer.

Someone mentioned a while back that the deluxes are the most difficult to find and I 100% agree with that.

Not surprising but I've seen Bulkhead the most.

The Walmart I was at today had 6 Bulkheads and 2 Blasters (and 1 Galvatron and 1 Laser Prime on the shelf below):

I am surprised at both someone finding Blitzwing already and that it seems like a decent amount of people haven't seen anything from wave 1 yet...I live in KCMO and the first sighting I had of any deluxe (Arcee) was back on Monday April 4th.This same store had two Legacy Blasters (one I bought) 3 Bulkheads 2 Galvatrons and 1 Laser Prime.Being almost literally in the middle of the midwest I just thought that if I was seeing stuff most likely everyone would be especially by now.I went to 4 different Target stores today 2 of which had Arcee; one Walmart had an Arcee and 2 Skids but no luck with Kickback or Dragstrip anywhere.

That's right and Hasbro has always said that. Everytime they do fans speak out against it as if they run the company. But yeah you are 100% on the ball.

Of course fans buy too and are a big part of sales (supposed 30% that counts anyone aged over 8 ) so these G1 characters are definitely there to get their sales. But that doesn't mean they are the only ones buying taht's what people have to realize. Do fans really think it was other older collectors who bought all those Earthrise Arcees?

This is not 100% Hasbro verified fact it's the thoughts from an industry professional but it definitely lines up with Hasbro's statements and it's explained in a way that may help those not in the know of robot toys within the toy industry.



In the end any cool looking transforming robot would sell to kids. ANY. But to get that also very lucrative adult market they make it characters we'd also like to buy.



Someone asked for evidence. We have it. In terms of marketing strategy we have the adds for kids as well as the channels and places these toys are.

They look identical to Legacy boxes just with a window. Most like this is done at the request of Walmart since that's the sort of thing they'd have a say in with an exclusive. Incidentally Target Silverstreak's box is also the same as a Legacy box just in Buzzworthy deco.



People were denying a page ago that prices would go up again but that does seem to be the case. The latest Marvel Legends reveals this past week brought single figures up to $28 (the previous reveals were $26 only a couple weeks ago) and two packs to $55. PR Lightning Collection and SW Black also hit $28. Likewise we were prepared for Legacy Metroplex to be priced at $190 based on listings from store computers only for it to be announced at $200 a $30 rise from last year (and they still had to make cuts to meet the budget for the price point)! I suspect they'll be giving us some bad news pricewise yet again with Legacy wave 3.



As for why Marvel Legends isn't getting window boxes it's pretty obviously because the heads on those are made to pop right off. I have heard reports of Legacy figures being found without heads but we wont know just how big of a deal that's going to be until they become more available.



Also Scott did a well timed video on the subject Sunday and makes a few points about the new packaging and kids. Their new windowless Power Rangers Zord action figures don't seem to be selling as well as the figures they replaced.

Exactly.



If only ""the fans"" would buy Transformers (or any mainline toys) those lines would be either shut down permanently or Hasbro will go the 3P route. Meaning selling them in very limited quantities at 50$+ a core 100$+ a deluxe 150$+ a voyager 200$+ a leader 300$+ a commander and 500$+ a titan.

I don't think so. BUT they could work with Walmart and reissue Soundwave (or release Soundblaster) through another round of exclusives. I think Target did that with some exclusive GIJoe figures.

And I don't get why these toys are literally sold in the kid toy aisle next to all other kid toys like Bakugan Batman and Power Rangers.



Maybe it's the way this is mentioned which brings it back to kids. I don't know if instead it would be better to simply say that these kids toys are also made with collectors in mind. While all are made to be sold to kids some are not made to be sold to fans (like 90% of Cyberverse toys and all the upcoming 2022 ROTB toys) but some are (like the SS series and the Legacy series). Would that be a better way of saying it? Comes out to the same thing but at least fans are placed on some kind of pedestal by mentioning them.



I do find it a bit disgusting that some fans are blaming Hasbro's mention of kids as the reason we are getting Cybertron Metroplex over a G1 Metroplex (or over another Titan). UT fans finally have their moment in the sun and it's being trivialized by G1 fans. Sure kids are a mentioned factor but it's still a big beautiful homage to Cybertron Metroplex that was definitely made with fans in mind. And FYI ALL titans are done with kids still in mind regardless who the target market for that specific toy is. Or else there would not have been mention of whether or not a drop test was done for Fort Max.



It is interesting though how different aspects of the roundtable discussion trigerred some fans. A part I did omit here because it was not clear at all was the part about some non G1 having more preorder sales than some G1 characters (which turns out to be trivial when you consider that most of these toys are being sold at retail stores and not through preorder). That was the first line mentioned in the TFW roundup and that's all that was discussed. Fans never got to the bit about open boxes being preferred by kids. Just like we never got to the part about CW compatibility not being intended.



And thanks Emerje for that video on boxes I watched it too. I didn't know that ""try me"" features upped the chance of sale by 80% and that the open box system was a subset of that feature. Still it does mess with my brain when he talks of Marvel Legends because him being worried of the impact and what it says to parents means that there are parents out there spending $30 on a Spider-man Noire figure. Not saying that isn't the case at all I just find it crazy that it is. I mean that's more than I'm willing to pay for the present my kids bring to a friend's birthday. And I don't get why these toys are literally sold in the kid toy aisle next to all other kid toys like Bakugan Batman and Power Rangers.Maybe it's the way this is mentioned which brings it back to kids. I don't know if instead it would be better to simply say that these kids toys are also made with collectors in mind. While all are made to be sold to kids some are not made to be sold to fans (like 90% of Cyberverse toys and all the upcoming 2022 ROTB toys) but some are (like the SS series and the Legacy series). Would that be a better way of saying it? Comes out to the same thing but at least fans are placed on some kind of pedestal by mentioning them.I do find it a bit disgusting that some fans are blaming Hasbro's mention of kids as the reason we are getting Cybertron Metroplex over a G1 Metroplex (or over another Titan). UT fans finally have their moment in the sun and it's being trivialized by G1 fans. Sure kids are a mentioned factor but it's still a big beautiful homage to Cybertron Metroplex that was definitely made with fans in mind.

About the whole ""Adult Collector"" thing... like we discussed previously I was never in denial that toys in general are made for kids including Transformers. I mean there is an adult collector market high end statues models toys that cost hundreds if not thousands of dollars but that's besides the point.



I always agreed that kids were the focus but starting in 2007 (ish??) whenever Classics came out I think the idea was to make toys that would appeal to adult nostalgia but still look really cool and really appeal to kids. I mean I took notice even though I stopped collecting. For the better part of 2007-2015 as I saw Classics change to Generations they got more and more appealing but as I've mentioned many times I didn't dive back in until the tail end of CW.



My confusion mostly came from the fact that...If these toys were FOR kids where were they? I mean when I was a kid I was probably with my mom 75-80% of the time she got me a new toy I was the one picking it out (unless it was a holiday gift in which I obviously wasn't supposed to be there). But in the past several years I've seen more middle-aged losers like myself browsing the toys aisles like Gollum looking for our precious' than kids with parents.



I mean I do recall happily giving advice on an occasion or two to a hapless parent about what Transformer they should get but it's been a long time. Again I 100% believe the toys are intended for kids and they are the future if a line is going to survive. Maybe just more parents are buying online or they are buying without the kids present because its easier? I don't know... I guess it's just a different time. Kids are still the target audience even if they are a phantom one but it is nice that Hasbro can occasionally design standard toys that happen to appeal to adults as well and have reveal videos for us. I really do enjoy Spectre Creative. Scott's way of presenting information is very informative and fun and not in an annoying way like many other Youtubers.About the whole ""Adult Collector"" thing... like we discussed previously I was never in denial that toys in general are made for kids including Transformers.

As an adult collector of multiple toy lines it's hard to judge how the mass market ""collector"" lines are or are not kids' toys. I assume they all have similar demos of a mix of kids and adults but I don't have any direct evidence for that. If we grant that Legacy is designed at least in part for kids at the $12 $25 $35 and $55 price points why couldn't that also apply to Marvel Legends Star Wars: Black Series McFarlane's DC Multiverse and NECA TMNT as well? With the exception of NECA TMNT those are generally all shelved in the traditional kids toy aisle too instead of collector sections near electronics in Walmart and Target.



I used to be more confrontational on the kids versus adults point but I think it's becoming increasingly clear that it's not one versus the other it's how companies can most effectively reach both. The Legacy character selection as covered in the related video the other day suggests that these decisions are collector- and adult-oriented because it's not an important factor for kids. Other times choices appeal to both sides--I remember being incredulous that Marvel's Boom-Boom was a kid-oriented pick but someone countered that it was also a bright pink character that would meet a different non-collector mandate.



I don't know where I was going with this exactly I think my main take is that the industry and even collector lines are kids toys first but we also can't act like one market matters and the other doesn't. I've said before with no evidence just my opinion that I think what Lego has done in the last couple years will probably become a model for other toy brands in the near future. Specifically more product designs and branding that explicitly privileges adults over children. I don't know when or if Hasbro will make a Star Wars product that says it's not for children but when they're selling $300 lightsabers advertised as ages 4 and up I have to figure it'll happen eventually.

I may have told this story here before but I got back into Transformers when I was at university and Beast Wars came out. I was in a Toys 'R Us looking at the Fox Kids repaints collection saying to myself ""How are these older toys on sale? These are a fortune online what am I missing?"" and a school-age kid helpfully told me that they were new different colors.



Then his mom came up gave me the nastiest look I've ever gotten in my life and dragged her kid away while I looked foolish.

The one thing I find difficult to believe is using Kids as a reason for their choice in Metroplex because I don't know very many kids that can afford $200 for one toy or parents of said kid who feel it's justifiable for just one toy for one kid. Especially of a very complex item that will likely be broken within a week.



So does that mean 1000's of little kids only get one toy all year long and it's this? Seems a large stretch to me unless I'm living in a new world where parents have lost all concept of rationale.



Yeah there might be a few spoiled kids who get everything just by asking but if that's the case would they even waste time on Metroplex an item they most likely won't even see in a store or be aware of? I can't believe it generates enough interest from kids to claim that's why they chose a construction vehicle for his alt mode. Dinosaurs sure as those will be seen in stores and be visible to said kids eliciting a ""cool I want that"" response. Posted by Till-all-R1 on April 25th 2022 @ 1:23pm CDT

I'll admit their statement regarding Metroplex is the one I find most incredulous. Like I get how they have to adhere to safety regulations not to prevent a parent from buying it but I wouldn't have thought it mattered more than that. However to answer your point about some parents have lost all concept of rationale that's happened. We now live in a new world where young kids ask for IPads for Christmas and get them.





Same with those remote vehicles they can ride that cost 300-500$.some kids today don't know how good they have it.



And AxademyofX thanks for your reply. I was puzzled a bit because while TFs SW black series and ML toys are all on those same shelves TFs are different types of toys offering the puzzle aspect which is what hooked me and still keeps me coming back. ML doesn't have that they are just more expensive versions of characters that are sold for cheaper on neighboring pegs. Plus there's the idea that unlike TFs which have a whole section in my walmarts I rarely see Marvel legends toys. We get one wave stocked once or twice and they get wolfed up. I have seen every Transformers toy at retail in one way or another but those No Way Home Spideys? Never. So those Marvel legends always felt more niche/collector than the generations TFs which can last months on shelves. Basically I can wait to find most TF toys for my collection on retail shelves but for Marvel legends I would have to preorder somewhere or else I won't get it.



But I'll be dead honest I don't really know what I am talking about.

You're right. They do. But those same kids still don't get 50 + TOY TOYS random days of the week. It's usually a birthday or a good report card from school. The perceived value of an iPad and all that can be done with it exceeds that of 'average plastic toy' by far.



That rationale concept has some elasticity to it.

Exactly this.

I just want to bring this to the discussion it's not the first time Hasbro has made efforts to promote a

Titan Class toy as something of interest to kids



https://www.seibertron.com/transformers ... pen/36776/



Plus Fort Max was on a bunch of ""must have"" lists for kids the year he was out and he was sent to influencer parents as well. I remember those campaigns because all it was was companies promoting their biggest most expensive toy no matter how terrible it was.



And parents would also review him for other parents (not sure if he was provided free of charge by hasbro for these review purposes)

Yeah that's the reality of it. We are still a big market big enough to make all those reveal events worth it for them.



About that phantom target audience I totally get it. I too see kids only sometimes. Though that one time I did see a dad shopping with his kids I was super glad to warn him that those good looking RED figures his kid wanted did not in fact transform (he was very thankful as that would have been a downer).



But back to your comment it goes beyond the whole legacy line of asking if TF toys are still bought for kids in general. And while we may not see people we can still see the evidence. You can look at the Cyberverse line. there have been 4 one step wheeljack releases in Cyberverse in the span of a couple years. If none were ever bought you would see all 4 of them. What about those terrible early warrior class figures of Cyberverse with that Soundwave that didn't have knees. Almost no fans bought it and these things were made by the ton. But are they still on shelves? No. Neither are the majority of warrior class releases nor is that voyager starscream or leader Optimus in the pic below. And it's not like these toys were reported in droves to appear at TJMaxx or Ross. So they were bought.









Also a plethora of fans reported empty shelves the past 3-4 years. Yet they also complained about a huge influx of Cyberverse that they didn't want. Those 2 statements can't coexist so it means that all those Cyberverse toys sold leaving empty shelves.



So yeah we may not see a bunch of kids and their parents buying toys but we can still witness shelves changing over time in a span of years (since the biggest movement is during the holiday season) proving that the transformers toys made just for kids do in fact sell out.

I find this really odd because the Unicron Trilogy is older than the Bayverse. Meaning there's many adults whose first TF toys from their childhood are Bayformers. Even more so from the U.T.



That Metroplex must have been quite the nostalgia rush for so many ADULT fans! Fans that are being completely dismissed by those who self proclaim being ""true fans.""



I'm looking forward the time when the year's titan will be announced as the DOTM Shockwave's worm driller. There will be as much celebration as there will be flowing salt!

These photos come from a review by Chefatron.



























We have new images of one of Amazon's 2022 exclusives for the Transformers Legacy line. The theme will be the Wreckers and we now have a good look at what Twin Twist will look like. While he does have the Wrecker symbol the colours are of his original Diaclone toy. It is still not 100% certain if these toys will be issued in multipacks with other toys or individually but they are set to be Amazon exclusives.These photos come from a review by Chefatron.

The toys and games industry has been growing for a number of years. Projections for the sector's growth should lead to good returns for investors especially since toy stocks are modestly valued right now. But which toy stock should you buy?

Hasbro (HAS 0.41%) the maker of Transformers and G.I. Joe has significantly outperformed Mattel (MAT 0.27%) in recent years. A $10000 investment in Hasbro 10 years ago would be worth $33000 today with dividends reinvested. The same investment in Mattel would be worth $9350. Obviously Hasbro looks like the better stock to own but it's not that simple.

Mattel is not the same company it was a few years ago. New management has significantly improved growth on the top and bottom lines and the maker of Barbie and Hot Wheels is only getting started.

Growth in a growing industry

Hasbro increased revenue 17% in 2021 with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) soaring 41% year over year. But Hasbro reported mixed results to start 2022. While revenue growth of 4% over the year-ago quarter beat the consensus analyst estimate adjusted EPS of $0.57 missed estimates calling for $0.62.

Analysts expect Hasbro to post revenue growth of 3.8% in 2022 with adjusted EPS flat over 2021 at $5.23. The expectation for slower growth this year is consistent with one forecast that calls for industrywide revenue to fall to $378 billion from $382 billion in 2021.

However by 2026 total sales across toys and games are expected to rise to $492 billion according to Statista. This growth is anticipated to be driven by balanced growth across video game consoles plastic toys construction sets puzzles and dolls.

Mattel's momentum in its largest sales category (dolls) makes it an attractive stock to consider right now. Its dolls segment posted sales growth of 13% year over year in the fourth quarter and 22% for the full year in 2021. Analysts expect Mattel to post revenue growth of 7% in 2022 which is nearly twice the rate of Hasbro.

Dolls are an important category for Mattel generating roughly twice the level of revenue of its other segments in the fourth quarter. On that note Barbie was the No. 1 toy property globally in 2021 and management expects to maintain this momentum in 2022 driven by the relaunch of Monster High Barbie later in the year and expanding brand experiences to multiple platforms.

Analysts expect Mattel to grow earnings by 12.3% in 2022 -- notably better than Hasbro's flat earnings growth based on analyst estimates. Mattel's focus on improving operating efficiencies under its Optimizing for Growth program should produce solid earnings growth even if sales come in below expectations due to things outside the company's control such as higher consumer prices caused by inflation or a recession.

Mattel is priced for better stock performance

Mattel is moving forward on its long-term initiatives to expand its toy franchises beyond just physical toys. As of the beginning of 2022 the company had 14 films in production. It also is ramping up digital game offerings including a joint venture with Chinese mobile game developer NetEase.

Most importantly investors can buy Mattel's superior growth at a discount to Hasbro. Mattel currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15.8 based on the consensus analyst earnings estimate for 2022. That is a better deal than Hasbro's forward P/E of 17.

Mattel has looked like the better buy for a while now and Hasbro's stumble to start 2022 reinforces the former's superior value to investors. If you need a value stock to hedge against struggling growth stocks in your portfolio Mattel might be the one.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9jb2xsZWN0aWJsZXMvc3BpZGVyLW1hbi1ub2lyLWNvbWVzLXRvLXRhcmdldC13aXRoLWV4Y2x1c2l2ZS1tYXJ2ZWwtbGVnZW5kcy1maWd1cmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Spider-Man Noir Comes to Target with Exclusive Marvel Legends Figure,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://bleedingcool.com/collectibles/spider-man-noir-comes-to-target-with-exclusive-marvel-legends-figure/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9jb2xsZWN0aWJsZXMvc3BpZGVyLW1hbi1ub2lyLWNvbWVzLXRvLXRhcmdldC13aXRoLWV4Y2x1c2l2ZS1tYXJ2ZWwtbGVnZW5kcy1maWd1cmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vbHlsZXNtb3ZpZWZpbGVzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA0LzIzL3N0YXItd2Fycy10aGUtYmxhY2stc2VyaWVzLWNsb25lLWNvbW1hbmRlci1jb2R5LXJldmlldy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Star Wars The Black Series Clone Commander Cody review — Lyles Movie Files,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://lylesmoviefiles.com/2022/04/23/star-wars-the-black-series-clone-commander-cody-review/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vbHlsZXNtb3ZpZWZpbGVzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA0LzIzL3N0YXItd2Fycy10aGUtYmxhY2stc2VyaWVzLWNsb25lLWNvbW1hbmRlci1jb2R5LXJldmlldy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vYWlybWFpbC5uZXdzL2lzc3Vlcy8yMDIyLTQtMjMvbGFuZGluZy1nZWFy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Robocom VR and More Tech and Gadgets from Jonathan Margolis,"Robocom VR

One might safely assume that our readership is split into two camps: those who played with Hasbro Transformers as children from the 1980s onward and those who dutifully bought them for those children while slightly baffled by the toys’ phenomenon in all its spin-off guises—animated TV shows comic books movies and video games.

For the uninitiated Transformers are humanoid robots that can transform into vehicles animals and other objects. Discovered in concept by Hasbro at the Tokyo Toy Fair in 1983 they were on show as a Japanese toy line called Microman by the Takara company and have been going strong ever since. It’s inevitably more complicated than this but broadly Transformers come in two flavors Autobots (good) and Decepticons (evil).

Maybe it’s not such a surprise that these humanoid-machine hybrids captured the global imagination. The idea of taking on a different physical form and swooping hither and thither equipped with superpowers goes back into pre-history. And who hasn’t fantasized even as a 21st-century adult about their car transforming into a flying vessel to beat traffic—or even discarding their city clothes and becoming a muscular superhero?

But imagining you could transform into a machine or even playing a Transformers video game on-screen packs a minuscule experiential hit compared with the extraordinary three-dimensional hyper-immersive physical assault on the senses provided by Robocom VR the ultra-enhanced virtual-reality gaming machine from a Beirut start-up.

Their $100000 Transformers VR Simulator licensed by Hasbro and built in Lebanon transforms the user into a human-size Transformer. Strapped into the machine like an astronaut in training you have an Oculus VR headset placed on your head and are launched into ferocious gun battles with the Decepticons on city streets.

The level of immersiveness the machine creates is beyond anything you are likely to have seen. You are physically tossed and pitched alarmingly almost violently one moment spinning around to shoot a bad guy you sight up in your V.R. visor. The next you’re swinging onto your back to deal with an aerial attack. It would be possible one imagines to become blasé about the experience of playing in the machine but even for a non-gamer it is exceptionally exciting. Breathtaking actually.

Robocom VR machines have been featured as an attraction in malls in the Middle East for a couple of years but now the energetic tech retailer Smartech has the exclusive on Robocom VR machines to buy. Smartech founded by an Israeli pro-soccer player Jacov Nachtailer started with a booth in London’s Selfridges store. The Robocom VR is also currently on show—and can be tried out—at Printemps in Paris and is due to be at Neiman Marcus in San Francisco later this year.

Measuring up: the Meazor can precisely assess a room’s dimensions in a few seconds. ($199 hozodesign.com)

Meazor

Your columnist is in the process of buying an 1816 house on one of London’s most historic greens. The place was last remodeled by a renowned TV-drama director in 1964 and before that would have been well known to its eccentric near neighbor George III the English king who carelessly lost the American colonies.

Whether the walls or anything else were straight when it was built is moot but even in the 58 years since a builder last crossed its threshold the little house has been on the move in every which way. The dimensions are completely unpredictable to the extent that measuring it up so it’s possible to plan a modern kitchen or bathroom or just to work out how much flooring to order is impossible with a regular measuring tape.

Imagine how floored we were then when this fancy multi-function two-dimensional laser measurer arrived from Hozo Design in Hong Kong. Meazor can perform many complicated tasks beyond the needs of a regular homeowner—there are functions for architects craftspeople and others.

But being able to set the Meazor up on its included tripod have it map a (preferably emptied) room to precision in a few seconds and then Bluetooth its inch-perfect map to a phone tablet or computer is a huge labor-saving novelty.

Give your trove of dusty 35-mm. color slides another spin with SlideScan. ($39.99 for two years photomyne.com)

SlideScan

A collection of old 35-mm. color slides—the type we used to take for about 50 cents a shot on vacations before loading into a projector to view—can be an invaluable family possession but one which is more likely to go moldy in the garage than ever be brought out for nostalgic projector evenings. If you have a sizable trove of such slides you might wish to paraphrase Paul Simon someone would take your Kodachrome away.

Which is a shame. Aside from capturing scenes from decades ago old color slides have a dreamy grainy quality that can’t be convincingly replicated with digital cameras. But digitizing slides is a drag. You either need to buy a scanner and ideally remove each slide from its plastic or cardboard mount or to take the photos to an expensive professional lab. All severely non-optimal.

But with this quite ingenious app developed in Israel you can scan slides using your smartphone and a laptop or P.C. Not only is the process perfectly good enough for most non-professional uses but it’s fast and strangely addictive. You hold the slide in one hand sight it up with your phone in the other hold down a big red button for three seconds and watch as the image is captured then its quality improved and perfected using cloud-based A.I. techniques.

Photomyne the company behind SlideScan has a suite of related software photo services you can use if you join (rather than use the free basic service) along with cloud storage and community-photo-appreciation features that some although we suspect few users might like.

So why do you need a computer to digitize slides you may ask when your smartphone and Photomyne’s cloud are doing all the processing grunt work? The answer is that Photomyne has devised a clever way to provide the steady bright-white backlight essential for copying transparencies. You just type in photomyne.com/backlight to be taken to a bright pure white screen—your own temporary light box.

Louvre X CASETIFY

A glance across a lunchtime-restaurant table and it was instant love—with an iPhone case. It was of beautiful quality and superbly printed with a detail from Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres’s 1814 painting La Grande Odalisque a reclining nude. At the bottom of the case was the logo of the Louvre in Paris.

Life could not continue without this. However a search later that afternoon of the Louvre online store was not successful. But googling for “Louvre” and “iPhone cases” brought to light an equally wonderful-looking case from a popular San Francisco accessories retailer depicting Raphael’s St. Michael Vanquishing Satan also at the Louvre.

It turned out to be a truly horrible buy—cheap quality with a grim fuzzy print in a distorted aspect ratio. The company decently refunded the $47 price with an explanation that brightened a dull day: “The low resolution is part of the artist’s original file” they said. An entertaining response even if blaming the poor I.T. skills of an artist who died in 1520 was possibly a bit of a stretch.

The hunt for the real official Louvre cases continued ending in success with the proper Louvre-branded Ingres model originally sought from Casetify a Hong Kong–based firm. They have a small range of Louvre products all for various iPhone and Samsung models but the quality is supremely good and the envious glances across restaurant tables are now directed toward this writer.

As well as the beautiful Ingres Casetify has (inevitably) Leonardo’s Mona Lisa the Venus de Milo and Eugène Delacroix’s Liberty Leading the People."

Celebrants to the black tie 2022 Frist Gala at the Frist Art Museum in Nashville today will be greeted by nurses with a reminder of the less-than-celebratory record of the Frist family and the health care corporation it cofounded while reaping enormous profits during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Frist family are the underwriters of the gala.

In addition to its nurse members handing out informational flyers to gala attendees National Nurses United is also sponsoring a mobile billboard that can be seen around Nashville today.

“We are requesting the patrons of fine art to encourage Thomas Frist Jr. and his family to use their enormous influence within HCA Healthcare to encourage using its vast wealth to invest in improved patient care and workplace protections for nurses and other health care workers and end its cuts in services for local communities” said Kansas City HCA RN Jennifer Caldwell.

The Frist family are the founders and biggest shareholders owning over 20 percent of stockholder shares of HCA the largest for-profit hospital conglomerate in the United States. From March 2020 to March 2021 the Frist family more than doubled its personal wealth from $7.5 billion to $15.6 billion.

HCA also recorded nearly $7 billion in profits in 2021 during the pandemic.

Yet as the pandemic has raged NNU notes the company has closed hospitals and maternal health departments cut staffing while eliminating rural cancer care and primary care clinics in an Asheville N.C. hospital and reduced staffing levels to such a dangerous degree at a San Jose Calif. hospital that it received a notice of termination from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

HCA has also been repeatedly fined for violating federally mandated Covid-19 safety protocols including failing to report a hospital-contracted Covid case that resulted in the death of a nurse.

“For two years of the worst global pandemic in a century as nurses have risked their lives and the safety of their families to care for gravely ill and too often dying patients HCA has repeatedly cut corners on hospital safety increasing the risk to our patients and our communities” said Madison Bhagalia an HCA RN in Kansas.

“As nurses have spoken out for months about inadequate PPE and having to reuse single-use equipment like masks and gloves HCA has disgracefully cut supply costs by $112 million” added HCA RN Juan Anchondo who works in El Paso Texas.

Inadequate staffing has become so endemic in HCA hospitals that at many of its facilities nurses have left due to deplorable working conditions. The impact on patient care is apparent.

Central line-associated bloodstream infections a common indicator of understaffing increased by 60 percent at many HCA facilities. This was more than double the increase nationally. Catheter-associated urinary tract infections another common indicator of understaffing increased by 43 percent at many HCA facilities both in 2020.

“Thomas Frist and his family should show the same commitment to our patients those who care for them and the communities who support their facilities and generate the astronomical wealth HCA and the Frist family have accumulated” said Nicole Taylor an HCA Las Vegas RN.

The Frist Art Museum which has Frist-related foundations manage its investments has a role to play in pressing HCA as well says NNU. Billy Frist the chair of the Frist Art Museum and HCA executive board member has remained silent as HCA has eroded community health care systems cut patient services and undermined safety protocols.

“At a time when almost one million people in the United States have died in this pandemic we all have an obligation to prioritize public safety even those who invest and support institutions that are major contributors to the health care industry. That is our message to Frist Gala donors today” said Florida HCA RN Marissa Lee.

(WJHG/WECP) - One Florida healthcare system wants to help make sure its patients can always reach out for help no matter the time of day.

HCA Florida Healthcare recently launched a new statewide program called Consult-A-Nurse.

When consumers call the 24/7 line they’ll speak with nurses who will provide quick expert care advice and support. It also provides a resource for consumers who have questions about any symptoms or illnesses they may be having.

”One of the things we wanted to provide was continuity of care. And so ensuring that we got our patients where they can be best served. So we have these nurses available to provide that service and provide just that. And not only for our adult patients but also for pediatric patients as well” Dr. Brittany Durr HCA Florida Gulf Coast Hospital Chief Nursing Officer said.

The new statewide Consult-A-Nurse line number is (844) 70-NURSE (6-8773).

Kayleigh Hartigan the founder of independent fertility clinic review service Fertility Mapper said: ""The pricing of egg freezing is not clear or simple as it stands. It's almost impossible to compare clinics currently because there is no standardised way of pricing.

""People need to know what they are signing up for and feel comfortable with the costs otherwise there is a risk of considerable stress later on during what is already an emotional and physically demanding process.""

Demand for egg freezing soared by 523 per cent between 2013 and 2018 according to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority.

The Covid pandemic further fuelled demand for egg freezing for ""social reasons"" – where there is no medical reason for preserving fertility – with some clinics reporting a 50 per cent rise in inquiries in 2020.

Yet some studies suggest as few as 3.3 per cent of eggs frozen by women aged between 36 and 39 the most common age for egg freezing in the UK lead to a live birth. British fertility clinics have been criticised for giving women ""false hope"" by implying that the technology is more reliable than it really is.

Last June the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) and regulators the Human and Fertilisation and Embryology Authority issued an enforcement notice to the fertility industry telling it to present prices ""in an intelligible way"" and be transparent about the costs of ""add-on"" treatments.

It came as the Competition and Markets Authority ordered clinics to ""address concerns such unclear pricing and misleading success rates"" on IVF and other treatments including egg freezing.

But The Telegraph's investigation found many clinics are still failing to provide clear pricing with some requiring patients to hand over contact details before being given access to a full price list or refusing to give further price information until they attend an initial consultation.

Some clinics failed to spell out the additional cost of fertility medication which can be anything between £450 and £2900.

Several including Care Fertility Concept Fertility and the London Women's Clinic started charging an annual fee of around £350 to store eggs from the point they were frozen rather than including the first year's storage within the quoted price.

Both the CREATE and Concept Fertility chains even charged additional fees for sedation the anaesthetic used during the surgical procedure in which doctors extract the eggs from a woman's ovaries.

The Telegraph calculated the likely cost of egg freezing based on the price for an initial consultation monitoring blood tests the procedure to extract and freeze the eggs and storage of frozen eggs for two years as well as the highest price listed for medication.

Where drug prices were not available a conservative estimate of £1500 based on costs from other clinics was assumed."

A federal grand jury has indicted Marlin S. Hershey along with his business partner Dana Bradley on charges of mail and wire fraud conspiracy mail fraud securities fraud and money laundering conspiracy for the alleged scheme that lasted from 2009 to 2021.

The charges were announced Friday by the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Western District of North Carolina. Hershey was released on bond following a court hearing Friday during which he pleaded not guilty. Bradley is scheduled to appear in court Monday.

The indictment says Hershey and Bradley both 52 years old provided false and misleading materials to investors buying the securities.

For example investors were told that nobody would be paid a commission when in fact Hershey and Bradley took a 10% commission on initial investments with additional commissions levied on follow-up investments according to the indictment. Hershey and Bradley also both received undisclosed “management fees” from the various entities through which they took investments the indictment says.

Hershey and Bradley also hid the true financial condition of investments by making undisclosed loans to various entities so they could pay investment returns and then used money from new investors to repay those loans the indictment says. They also used new investments to pay returns to earlier investors the indictment says.

The mail and wire fraud conspiracy charge and the mail fraud charge each carry a maximum prison term of 20 years and a $250000 fine. The securities fraud charge carries a maximum prison term of 20 years and a $5 million fine. And the maximum prison term for money laundering conspiracy charge is 10 years and a $500000 fine.

The indictment is the second time Hershey and Bradley were linked to illegal investments.

In October 2019 the Securities & Exchange Commission opened a civil fraud case against them alleging they raised $20.2 million from dozens of investors including family and friends and then used $2.7 million to pay themselves commissions and earlier debts.

That SEC case was settled in September 2020 when Hershey and Bradley without admitting guilt each agreed to forfeit $20000 profit and pay a civil penalty of $193000.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndic3Blbmd1aW5zLmNvbS9wZW5ndWlucy1yZWxlYXNlLWZpcnN0LXJvdW5kLXBsYXlvZmYtc2NoZWR1bGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PENGUINS RELEASE FIRST-ROUND PLAYOFF SCHEDULE | WBS Penguins,"Spread the love

Honoring this year’s Earth Day theme “Invest in Our Planet” Hilton has released its latest Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) Report which emphasizes its renewed commitment to taking real-world actions to reduce the environmental and social impact of its hotels and operations worldwide in pursuit of a better world to travel.

Across its global network Hilton continues to considerably close the gap toward meeting key sustainability targets from its Travel with Purpose 2030 Goals. In 2021 Hilton recorded:

70% reduction in landfilled waste per square meter from 2008 baseline (2030 goal: 50%)

per square meter from 2008 baseline (2030 goal: 50%) 49% reduction in CO2 emissions intensity per square meter from 2008 baseline (2030 goal: 61%)

intensity per square meter from 2008 baseline (2030 goal: 61%) 39% reduction in water consumption per square meter from 2008 baseline (2030 goal: 50%)

per square meter from 2008 baseline (2030 goal: 50%) $1B+ cumulative savings in energy costs since 2009 monitored through LightStay.

In Asia Pacific Hilton focuses on driving responsible and sustainable tourism through a wide range of initiatives aimed at making a positive environmental and social impact - from advancing restoration efforts to reimagining business events as corporate travel makes a comeback.

Driving Holistic Water Stewardship

Leading river cleanup organization Sungai Watch aims to protect waterways on the Indonesian island by developing and testing trash barriers that prevent plastics from entering the ocean. As Bali’s waterway guardians the group also documents data on trash found in rivers to deepen the conversation with companies on how to use more environmentally friendly materials.

In support of its efforts in leading environmental restoration and providing communities access to clean water Hilton has named Sungai Watch as one of its 2021 Hilton Effect Foundation grantees. The grant will enable the organization to install more trash barriers to lessen the impact of plastics on the community.

Team Members at Conrad Bali and Hilton Bali Resort also pitched in by taking part in an island-wide cleanup initiative with Sungai Watch which cleared more than 30 tons of plastic waste.

Hilton Ningbo Dongqian Lake in China is at the forefront of rainwater harvesting and recycling. Its rainwater recovery system collects rainwater from the property’s premises which goes through ultraviolet disinfection and automatic replenishment systems to improve water quality. The hotel uses the treated rainwater for various non-potable purposes such as cleaning roads and watering plants.

The system recycles approximately 1400 tons of rainwater each year which is equivalent to the amount of water consumed by a family of three for one year.

Sustainable Dining and Green Kitchens

Hilton continues to make progress in its responsible sourcing journey with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between Seafood Legacy Co. Ltd. and UMITO Partners Inc. to procure more sustainable seafood for its hotels in Japan and Korea. The procurement of Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) and Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) Chain of Custody-certified seafood in these markets has surpassed 25% in the month of December 2021 — a marked improvement from less than 1% in 2018.

Amid supply chain disruptions Conrad Seoul and Hilton Tokyo Bay made strides in sustainability achieving MSC and ASC Chain of Custody certifications – a first for any hotel in South Korea and a first for any Hilton hotel in Japan respectively. Diners who are looking for fresh organic and locally sourced food at these hotels can now opt for food items marked with the MSC and ASC ecolabels from either a specially curated sustainable seafood menu or the buffet spread.

In South East Asia leading the farm-to-table experience is Conrad Koh Samui’s Iris Farm. Built at the onset of the pandemic Iris Farm provides a multitude of organic herbs and vegetables for the hotel’s bars and restaurants. The farm produces 1300 kg of food and processes 2400 kg of compostable waste per month recycling organic resources while conserving landfill space.

Guests can look forward to picking up eco-friendly farming techniques in addition to other meaningful and engaging activities at Conrad Koh Samui’s Iris Farm.

Meanwhile Hilton Shenzhen Shekou Nanhai is scaling up on circular food production and keeping food waste at bay. Using smart kitchen waste treatment equipment the hotel turns kitchen waste into carbon dioxide water and organic fertilizers. Byproducts are used for hotel greening the hotel's organic ecological garden as well as the greening of neighbouring communities. The hotel has recycled 390 tons of kitchen waste and produced about 20 tons of organic fertilizer since the equipment was installed last year.

Reducing Environmental Footprint by Redefining Events

With the return of business travel and in-person events almost 300 of Hilton’s hotels across Asia Pacific including Conrad Shanghai Conrad Bengaluru Hilton Tokyo Hilton Sydney and the largest Hilton hotel in Asia Pacific Hilton Singapore Orchard have rolled out the Plan It Forward offer to help businesses and event planners further reduce their environmental impact when hosting events.

Plan It Forward gives event planners an opportunity to host a Carbon Neutral Meeting or earn double Hilton Honors Event Planner Points at one of its participating hotels when bookings are made by June 30 2022 and held by December 31 2022.

For event planners who opt for a Carbon Neutral Meeting Hilton will offset their event’s carbon emissions as identified by its Meeting Impact Calculator report on its award-winning LightStay platform and invest in a portfolio of high-quality carbon reduction projects with global partner South Pole.

Alternatively event planners can earn double Hilton Honors Event Planner Points per USD$1 spent on guest rooms meeting rooms etc. for qualifying events at participating hotels. Hilton Honors Points can be donated to charity through PointWorthy or redeemed for future events or hotel stays among other benefits.

For its various environmental and social initiatives Hilton was named a global sustainability leader on the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices for the fifth consecutive year and was the only hotel company to earn Gold Class distinction in S&P Global’s Sustainability Yearbook.

These soaps are the single most-utilized amenity at hotel chains: 86% of guests who stay at a hotel for 1-2 nights use it handily outranking other popular offerings like the in-room TV (84%) hair dryer (36%) and valet parking (28%).

Hotels take great pride in selecting their toiletries and invest a tremendous amount of time and money into finding the right brand partners.

Zachary Crockett / The Hustle

But these tiny bars come with a big problem.

While some of us smuggle home every bar we can get our hands on (a totally acceptable move according to hoteliers) most guests leave behind sizable half-used hunks of soap.

At scale this is a big deal:

There are ~ 5m hotel rooms in the US alone.

in the US alone. Pre-pandemic the average occupancy rate was ~66%.

That means that in normal times hotels go through ~3.3m bars of soap every day.

Every year it has been estimated that the hospitality industry generates ~440B pounds of solid waste — much of it soap and bottled amenities. That’s the equivalent weight of 2m blue whales.

What happens to all that leftover soap?

Fourteen years ago one man asked that very question. And the answer led him down a path that has since saved tens of thousands of lives all over the world.

One man a pickle bucket and a potato peeler

The thought first struck Shawn Seipler in 2008 while staying at a hotel in Minneapolis.

Seipler was a road dog. A technology executive he spent 150 days per year in hotels on business trips. And one night after a few room service cocktails he wondered what became of unused hotel room soap.

So he called the front desk and asked.

“Excuse me what do you do with all that leftover soap?”

“Sir would you like another cocktail?

“Absolutely… but also what happens to all that soap?”

“Well we throw it away.”

“Do all hotels throw it away?”

“Yes sir it all goes to a landfill.”

Seipler did some back-of-the-napkin math and realized that millions of bars of perfectly salvageable soap were going to waste.

“I couldn’t stop thinking about that” Seipler told The Hustle. “And I decided I had to do something about it.”

A few weeks later in his hometown of Orlando he walked into a Holiday Inn and asked if they’d be willing to part with their unused soap. The general manager happily complied and Seipler left with a giant bag of half-used toiletries.

“I went to 6 other hotels that same day and they all said the same thing” recalled Seipler: “‘Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!’”

Armed with thousands of bars of soap Seipler and a few friends set up a small “workshop” in a single-car garage in downtown Orlando.

The group sat on upside-down pickle buckets and scraped the outside of the soap bars off by hand with potato peelers pulverized them in a meat grinder melted them down in Kenmore slow cookers poured the mixture into soap molds dried it overnight and cut it up into new bars.

At his best Seipler could churn out ~500 new soap bars per day.

The next question was what he was going to do with it all.

He laid out a bunch of stats and came to a realization:

Hotels were wasting millions of bars of soap.

of soap. At the time ~9k children under the age of 5 were dying from hygiene-related illnesses every day globally.

children under the age of 5 were dying from hygiene-related illnesses every day globally. Studies showed that regular hand-washing could cut those deaths in half.

Seipler launched Clean the World and set out on a mission of getting those millions of bars of wasted soap to children in need.

To do that the first thing he’d have to do is scale his operation. But getting monetary support for a real facility proved to be difficult.

“I put together a grant application for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation imagining that Bill would walk up our driveway and hand us a check for $1m” said Seipler. “We got a rejection notice within 8 hours of submission with a note that said ‘Please do not reapply for 3 years.’”

Donated hotel soap was piling up. The economy was in a bad spot. And if Seipler didn’t figure out a solution the whole idea would die.

So Seipler came up with an annuity model:

Hotels pay a small fee ($0.50 to $1 per room per month) to participate in a soap recycling program. They’re provided with everything they need to streamline donations and get rid of their waste: storage bins shipping staff training. They also get impact reports detailing the social and environmental impact of their donations.

For hotels this serves 2 purposes: 1) It was a relatively affordable way to get rid of all their waste and 2) it helped them meet sustainability goals.

How the hotel soap recycling process works

Today Clean the World partners with more than 8k hotels — roughly 1.4m rooms in total — around the world.

Its clients include major chains like Hyatt Marriott InterContinental Walt Disney Resorts and Hilton in addition to cruise ship lines casinos and airlines.

Since 2009 the company has:

Collected 13m pounds of discarded soap from hotels

pounds of discarded soap from hotels Distributed 68m bars of reprocessed soap to 127 countries

bars of reprocessed soap to countries Diverted 23m pounds of plastic and soap waste from landfills

Its biggest partner Hilton which signed on all of its worldwide locations in 2019 has contributed 14.5m bars of soap in less than 3 years.

To recycle all of this soap Clean the World has a $750k production facility in Orlando and satellite facilities in Las Vegas Hong Kong the Dominican Republic Montreal and Amsterdam.

“It’s a much more professional operation now” said Seipler. “No more potato peelers or meat grinders.”

The process to convert hotel soap into new bars works like so:

Clean the World provides a participating hotel with storage bins; when full they’re shipped to a Clean the World facility Soap goes into a giant refining machine which filters out hair dirt and other debris and churns out “soap noodles” Soap goes into a mixer and is sterilized with diluted bleach Soap goes into a duplex plodder where it’s pummeled into a powdery substance and compressed into long solid blocks Soap is cut into bars stamped and packed into boxes Soap is sent to countries in need

Hotels all use different types of soap and there’s a whole science to mixing the right bars together. Holiday Inn Macau’s oatmeal bars for instance pair well with Aloft Taipei’s Bliss bars. Clean the World relies on 20k+ volunteers to determine the right sorting process.

Every donated bin is weighed so Clean the World can give hotels detailed impact reports chronicling things like:

The number of new bars contributed

The total pounds of landfill waste diverted

Carbon footprint reduction (in kg of CO2)

The number of refugees the soap directly impacted

Water and energy use reduction

Once the soap is repurposed and ready for its second life Clean the World works with humanitarian partners like UNICEF United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees World Vision and Children International to determine where it’s most needed around the world.

With these partners they’re able to work with local clinics and schools where they teach kids hygiene protocols and monitor effectiveness.

The organization played a big role in providing soap to Syrian and Somalian refugees and Haitian residents in the wake of the 2010 earthquake.

Millions of bars of soap have been sent to help refugees and others without access to basic hygiene products (via Clean the World)

By volume the largest amount of soap has gone to countries like the Philippines Zambia and Honduras.

But in recent times another country has been added to the list: the US.

A pandemic pivot

In 2020 Clean the World faced a frustrating problem:

Supply was crimped by massive hotel closures Demand for soap in the US was at an all-time high

“We were nearly on the brink of extinction at a time when people needed soap more than ever” Christina Flores Clean the World’s marketing director told The Hustle. “We had to let 80% of our staff go.”

When hotels began to slowly open back up many big chains — including Marriott and IHG (the parent company of Holiday Inn) — also pivoted from packaged soaps to big refillable dispensers.

Facing a diminished supply Clean the World launched a new arm that provides at-home kits consumers can fill up with unused soap and other toiletries at home.

To date the organization has distributed 5m+ of these kits to US homeless shelters and other countries facing sanitation supply chain shortages.

These initiatives have had a considerable global impact.

As the largest hotel soap recycler in the world Clean the World has helped lead to a 60%+ reduction in the number of children who die from diarrheal diseases each year.

One 3-ounce bar of soap is good for 100 hand-washings — enough to significantly cut down the risk of contracting such illnesses.

Zachary Crockett / The Hustle

A big problem still looms: worldwide an estimated 3B people still don’t have access to hand-washing facilities with soap. And thousands of hotels still throw away their soap waste.

Luckily Clean the World isn’t the only organization working on solving this problem:

EcoSoap partners with 1k+ hotels and has provided 250k+ pounds of soap to children in 10 countries

Diversey a leading provider of hotel hygiene products has repurposed 25m bars of soap since 2013

Thanks to these efforts hotel toiletries that otherwise would’ve ended up in landfills have been given a second use case.

Seipler has seen mothers cry with joy when they’re given soap. The small commonplace things we often take for granted he said can make a world of difference when reallocated.

“I know it sounds funny” he said “but that little bar of soap on the counter in your hotel room — that thing can literally save a life.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vdG9waG90ZWwubmV3cy9sb25nZXZpdHktbHV4dXJ5LXdvb2QtY291dHVyZS1kZWxpdmVycy1vbi1hLXN0eWxpc2gtbHV4dXJ5LW9hc2lzLXRoYXQtc3RhbmRzLXRoZS10ZXN0LW9mLXRpbWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Longevity & Luxury: Wood Couture delivers on a stylish luxury oasis that stands the test of time,"Bespoke luxury manufacturer discusses Waldorf Astoria at the heart of the Dubai International Financial Centre that has continued to maintain the international brand’s prestigious standards over the years

Among the guests were local officials brand leaders some of Patel’s fellow hoteliers and the VHG employees who he said made it all possible.

“I know many of you are tired and have early flights tomorrow so I’ll do my best to keep this short but I have a lot of people to thank I’m sorry” Patel said in his speech near the end of the gala following many presentations and a full dinner on the terrace at the Hunter Museum of American Art.

The museum is next door to The Edwin Hotel one of VHG’s several boutique hotels in Chattanooga alone. Some guests for the gala also enjoyed complimentary housing at The Edwin for the special anniversary event which was announced in March.

Founded in 1997 Vision Hospitality began with a Homewood Suites by Hilton Chattanooga/Hamilton Place Patel developed in Chattanooga where the company is still headquartered. Then as the U.S. economy struggled to overcome the 9/11 attacks of 2001 Patel went on to develop 10 more hotels.

“Our story started 25 years ago this week” Patel said. “One small hotel but one very big dream. It’s been an incredible journey. From these humble beginnings to where we are today this journey would not be possible without these amazing men and women in this room this evening. So please bear with me I have a lot of people to thank.”

Presentations for the evening began with a proclamation from Tim Kelly mayor of the Chattanooga and Jim Coppinger mayor of surrounding Hamilton County declaring April 21 as Vision Hospitality Group Day.

“From small bakeries to logistics to paving machines we’ve always kind of figured things out in Chattanooga and Mitch is a perfect example” Kelly said. “He started Vision Hospitality when he was just 27 with his first hotel here and it has grown that to about 16 hotels just in the Chattanooga area $350 million of investment here and tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue.”

Coppinger said Patel and VHG did much to help the county make it through the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Mitch served on the task force that we put together and was an integral part” Coppinger said. “They called in every week we did all this virtually but Mitch played a big part in that sharing what the vision was for the community not only is as an entrepreneur of hotels but also for the tourism industry. It was really important to have his insight.”

Other VIPs at the gala included Liam Brown group president of the Americas for Marriott International; Danny Hughes president of the Americas for Hilton Hotels; and Chip Rogers president and CEO at the American Hotel and Lodging Association. Other hoteliers present included Al Patel president and CEO of Baywood Hotels in Columbia Maryland; D.J. Rama president and CEO of Auro Hotels in Greenville South Carolina; and former AAHOA Chairwoman Jagruti Panwala who also is president and CEO of Wealth Protection Services in New Hope Pennsylvania.

Mitch Patel’s family wife Parul and children Aleyna Arjun and Ishani also attended the gala.

“There is no more important role no more important role in my life than those of a son husband and a father” Patel told his family. “I hope I can be the same role model for you as my parents have been for me.”

As VHG’s market cap approaches $1 billion Patel plans to expand the company’s footprint through strategic investments acquisitions and repositioning opportunities. He also aims to continue working with current partners as well as building new relationships in targeted markets.

“This milestone is a great opportunity to pause to reflect on the past gratitude and also look out into the future. Together we’ve accomplished a lot these past 25 years” Patel said in conclusion. “But our journey is not over. Even though our industry just went through an unprecedented crisis I’ve learned that you can never bet against the American spirit. There’s an African proverb says smooth seas have never made a skilled sailor. We’re stronger smarter more efficient more resilient than ever. This is a sustainable industry with tremendous opportunities.”"

HD,Home Depot,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA0LzIzL2hvbWUtZGVwb3QtaXMtZG9pbmctYW4tZXhjZWxsZW50LWpvYi1jYXB0dXJpbmctdGhpL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Home Depot Is Doing an Excellent Job Capturing This $900 Billion Market,"The home is arguably more important than ever and consumer spending proves it.

The coronavirus pandemic was a boon to the do-it-yourself segment of the home improvement market as folks took on a multitude of projects including painting rooms adding a home office and adding outdoor entertainment spaces.

Indeed in 2019 the home improvement industry was estimated to be worth $650 billion. Now it is projected to generate $900 billion in sales annually. So primarily because of the effects of the pandemic the market grew by $250 billion.

Home Depot (HD -0.47%) is capturing a meaningful share of this massive and growing market. Let's take a closer look at how it's succeeding in doing so.

Home Depot is the largest home improvement retailer in the world

Interestingly Home Depot's total sales for its fiscal 2021 which ended on Jan. 30 were $151 billion. That was 14.4% higher than the year before. Several macroeconomic factors fueled consumer spending on home improvement. Fiscal stimulus payments to households rising home values and limited inventories of homes for sale spurred homeowners to improve their living spaces.

If you take the $150 billion sales figure and divide it by the $900 billion market size Home Depot's market share is an estimated 17%. Home Depot is the world's largest home improvement retailer and boasts the most significant market share. Lowe's Companies (LOW -0.10%) its formidable rival achieved sales of $96 billion in fiscal 2021. A substantial sum to be sure but considerably behind Home Depot.

What's more Home Depot has set a new target of reaching $200 billion in sales. Of course that may take some years to achieve but it highlights that management sees growth opportunities ahead. For fiscal 2022 Home Depot forecasts its revenue will remain relatively flat as economies reopen and folks spend less time at home. Home Depot has grown revenue at a compound annual rate of 7.9% in the last decade. The long-run growth rate is likely to be closer to that of the previous decade rather than what has happened since the outbreak.

The market likes a winner

Home Depot's superior market share leads to a superior operating profit margin. The company has outperformed Lowe's its biggest competitor in this metric over the last decade. That's evidence that the home improvement industry has economies of scale. In other words profit margins grow with sales. One reason could be that Home Depot pays lower prices for inventory because it buys in bigger batch sizes.

Unsurprisingly Home Depot's stock is trading more expensively than Lowe's due to the better market share and operating profit margin. Regardless of how the home improvement market evolves as the world progresses against COVID-19 Home Depot is likely to perform better than Lowe's until the latter can improve operating performance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5ZG90LmNvbS9pcmwvaG9tZS1kZXBvdC1kb2ctZmlnaHQv0gE2aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHlkb3QuY29tL2lybC9ob21lLWRlcG90LWRvZy1maWdodC8_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘No dogs should be allowed in stores’: 2 dogs start fighting at Home Depot sparking debate,"A TikToker caught two dogs fighting in a Home Depot and documented the chaotic aftermath it caused shoppers.

The original video has reached nearly 6000000 views since being posted on April 20 and has thousands of users debating whether dogs should be allowed in stores.

In the video uploaded by @wtfisthis211 a small crowd pulls apart two dogs one much larger than the other. Two women who appear to own the smaller dog run to grab its belongings and leash that appears to have been left in an aisle.

Other shoppers look on shocked. One woman who appears to be the dog’s owner is visibly distraught yelling and crying. At one point she asked for the dog’s name and asked for the police to be called.

The video sparked a discussion on if the incident was avoidable. Many users seemed adamant that dogs shouldn’t be allowed in stores at all.

One user said “Why are dogs in the store in first place???”

Another added”i dont blame the dogs i blame the people keep them home where there safe”

One commenter said “No dogs should be allowed into regular stores only pet shops. I have been in a regular store caught between two dogs about to go at it in line.”

Other users joked about one woman asking for the dog’s name. “It’s the “get the dog’s name” for me.”

The Daily Dot reached out to @wtfisthis211 via TikTok comment and Home Depot for comment.

But there is a store that opened Tuesday in west Santa Rosa that is perfectly made for these economic times combining the thrill of a treasure hunt with the practicality of bargain-basement prices.

It’s evident in the shop’s name: Falling Prices.

The store receives liquidated items from such retail giants as Amazon Target Home Depot Lowe’s and Wayfair on a weekly basis that are less than $50. They range from pet food and children’s clothes to duvets and some food items such as flavored almonds.

The twist is its pricing operates on a sliding scale based on the day of the week. All items on Tuesday are priced at $6 then on Wednesday at $4 Thursday at $2 and Friday at $1. Everything left on Saturday is just a quarter so the inventory can be all cleared for next week.

Another new batch of products are then refilled into the plywood bins which are spaced out through the store like a checkerboard. The process begins again the following Tuesday morning with about 8000 various items for sale and eager customers ready to rummage through the product mix.

“I love this because it’s real” said Richard Cawood a Bennett Valley resident who operates the store on College Avenue with his wife Ruth.

Cawood is an independent dealer within the RL Liquidators network out of Sacramento that helps facilitates the weekly truck deliveries into the location.

“Yes it makes money. But the people that will shop here really need us … the small food section toys or books or household items. They're buying stuff that has just come off the shelf at Target that they can pay for a fraction of the cost.”

Those shoppers on Wednesday included Al Siedentopf a retired veteran from Santa Rosa.

While other shoppers were more eager on grabbing items Siedentopf was carefully perusing one bin being very selective on what he would put in his cart. He had selected two reams of printer paper from Amazon costing $8.

“That’s a pretty good price to pay” Siedentopf said.

He also had eyed the 10-pound bag of organic chicken feed but found it too expensive for $4 on Wednesday as he typically buys his chicken feed at Tractor Supply Co. Siedentopf said he may visit later in the week when the price for the bag comes down even further.

But Cawood noted the bags could all be gone if he waits too long given that word-of-mouth spreads in the local community which has a sizable number of chicken owners. A check on Cawood’s smartphone revealed a comparable item sells at a price near $20 a bag at Walmart.

“Come back on $1 day and make sure you get your dollar chicken food” Cawood informed Siedentopf.

“I like 25 cents better” Siedentopf chuckled.

That exchange epitomized the give-and-take that goes into a decision that the more than 50 customers on Wednesday morning were making. They ranged from moms to millennials and they all were looking for special deals.

The store activity also reflects the crucial role that liquidation plays in the U.S. retail market allowing major companies to quickly get rid of their merchandise that is seasonal being discontinued or doesn’t sell well.

The liquidation market in this country has more than doubled since 2008 and reached $688 billion in 2021 according to Zachary Rogers assistant professor of supply chain management at Colorado State University.

The business is seeing an upswing with inflation said Larry Morgan chief executive officer of RL Liquidators who has 10 Falling Prices locations in the Sacramento area and is expanding his reach.

His company also has another operation BidRL where consumers can bid on more premium items that are typically offered at retail for $50 and above such as mattresses laptop computers and coffee makers. Overall RL Liquidators receives more than 1000 semitrailer loads a month Morgan said.

Cawood also operates a Santa Rosa location for BidRL where customers have to come and pick up their purchases if they are successful. That pickup location will be moved to the Falling Prices store in the near future.

“As inflation rises people have to find ways that they can save on items they buy every day” said Morgan. “It’s like Black Friday every single day.”

Cawood said there were 60 people outside the store before the doors opened at 10 a.m. on its first day of business as shoppers looked to get the first pick of any bargains at $6 per item. Bags of dog food sold out quickly and one man found a framed autographed picture of a San Francisco 49ers player he said.

Anticipating its popularity Cawood already is giving thought on ways to manage crowds especially on Tuesday mornings. Shoppers can download the Falling Prices app on their smartphone to reserve a space in line up to 24 hours in advance to help limit customer flow and ensure it is orderly.

“We only have a limited number of shopping carts so by getting a line pass you can have coffee in your car and stand up at 10 o’clock when I say who is number one?” Cawood said.

During the latter part of the week the store will attract shoppers looking for items that they can later resell via their own garage sales Cawood said keeping the business cycle going.

Cawood previously worked as an executive for Charles Schwab & Co. and got interested in the reselling market as a result of his son Ben who had been running a small business selling on Amazon and eBay.

When Ben left for college in Boston Cawood became more interested in “reverse logistics” which is taking back items from retailers in large volume and selling them back to the public. He and his wife connected with Morgan in 2018.

“We were intrigued. By operating a store where you reduce the price of every item based on the day of the week you can empty a store during the week so you can restock and go again” he said.

Opening a retail store was a big step but Cawood said he relied on advice from Teejay Lowe whose family operated G & G Supermarket before selling to Safeway in 2016. Lowe who is now managing the commercial shopping center where the Falling Prices store is located.

“It’s an exciting retail model quite honestly” Lowe said of the store. “If you provide people a value they will shop with you.”

Refinery to Create North America's Largest ...,"In a sweet SAF switcheroo huge news arrived from California-based World Energy a carbon-net-zero solutions provider that it secured the critical permits required to completely convert and increase output by 700 percent at its Southern California renewable fuels production facility the world’s first and North America’s only commercial-scale Sustainable Aviation Fuel production site. World Energy is teaming up with Air Products the world’s largest hydrogen producer and Honeywell an innovator in SAF technology to build the most technologically advanced production and distribution hub ever constructed – in a $2 billion project that will yield 340-million-gallons of annual capacity and collaboration to advance green hydrogen too.

In today’s Digest an exclusive Digest inside look at how World Energy is converting its Southern California refinery to create North America’s largest SAF hub the players the reactions including from the U.S. Department of Energy the Mayor and U.S. Congress why it’s such a huge deal what it all means and more.

The Transformation

Let’s start with the switch from a regular ole’ oil refinery to a leading advanced sustainable aviation fuel super duper hub. The former oil refinery site will never again refine fossil fuels. By 2050 the facility will produce fuels that will displace over 76 million metric tons of carbon dioxide the equivalent of 3.8 million carbon-net-zero flights from Los Angeles to New York. It will also significantly reduce the fine particulate emissions in the trucks trains and planes powered by World Energy’s fuels. Air Products and World Energy will collaborate on innovations to transition to green hydrogen inputs further reducing the carbon intensity of the fuels it produces.

Ok ok we hear some of you saying how can this be “North America’s only commercial-scale Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production site – what about Neste? SkyNRG? Alder Fuels?” When asked about this World Energy spokesperson told The Digest that World Energy has been producing SAF at a commercial scale since 2016 and “Neste makes SAF outside of the U.S. and SkyNRG and Alder are pre-commercial though we have supplied SkyNRG for years.”

The huge positive economic impact can’t be ignored either – The Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation (LAEDC) Institute for Applied Economics (IAE) conducted a multiregional economic impact analysis and estimates that between 2019 and 2024 World Energy’s ongoing operations and conversion will contribute $19.2 billion to the U.S. economy and generate more than 18000 jobs. Now we are talking!

Together along with more than 15 other leading firms the companies are collaborating to speed up and expand the decarbonization of aviation. Global air transport leaders and those heavily reliant on aviation are now entering into long-term agreements to secure access to the plant’s current and expanding supply to make carbon-net-zero aviation real.

That means real SAF into real airplanes and real soon.

The Tech

World Energy’s SAF is a paraffinic product that is refined through a process called Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA). This produces a SAF called HEFA-SPK. The HEFA process that World Energy uses refines renewable inputs including inedible agricultural fats and waste oils into SAF through a process that uses hydrogen (hydrogenation). According to World Energy the process of procuring feedstocks and making and distributing their fuels is completely ethical and sustainable from start to finish to create the best product possible for the air environment and society. You can check out their production process video here.

When will the 700% increase in output take affect?

“The Paramount facility will be online and in full production by 2025” World Energy told The Digest over the weekend. “By IATA’s target of 2050 World Energy’s fuels will have already displaced over 76 million metric tons of carbon dioxide the equivalent of 3.8 million carbon-net-zero full aircraft flights from Los Angeles to New York.”

Where will the fuel go?

We know World Energy already has deals with United Airlines but they are also “currently in discussions to finalize long-term contracts with a number of aviation companies including airlines cargo shippers FBOs and others. More information will follow as these contracts are finalized” World Energy spokesperson told The Digest over the weekend.

Reactions from the stakeholders

The Mayor: “World Energy’s transformation of its facility to producing 100 percent sustainable fuel is good for the planet and it’s good for our City” said Paramount Mayor Vilma Cuellar Stallings. “Locally the refinery will never again deal with petroleum products which of course will be healthy for our residents. We welcome this change.”

The Feds: James Spaeth Systems Development and Integration Program Manager U.S. Department of Energy said at the Earth Day celebration “To see this expansion is up to what is it 350 million gallons it’s the first real major building of SAF production in the U.S. and perhaps the largest in the world so the administration is just thrilled to be here to see this investment.”

The Leader: “Getting real about net-zero aviation is going to require the mobilization of expertise and resources far beyond anything that has come before” said Gene Gebolys CEO World Energy. “We are pulling together the very best companies in the world with the expertise experience commitment and focus to collaborate on pushing the frontier of what can be done to decarbonize aviation today while building a platform for what needs to be done to decarbonize flight entirely by 2050. This is an immense undertaking. But it must be done and it requires that we move with the speed coordination and determination befitting the problem we are working to tackle.”

Gerbolys also told The Digest “Between now and 2050 we will produce enough fuel to displace enough carbon to effectuate 3.8 million net zero flights between LA and New York. Airplanes are going to run on high density liquid fuels for the foreseeable future and what we need to do is get into that fuel tank with lower carbon fuels so our approach to making net carbon zero real is to take existing aircraft and make them fly in a much-less carbon intensive way. It’s fitting that we’re doing this on Earth Day. Earth day is all about taking action and today we’re announcing a two-billion-dollar investment in attacking the carbon emissions in aviation.”

Another World Energy leader Adam Klauber Vice President ESG and Sustainability told The Digest “This project is all about green-collar jobs – we’re going to create over 1000 jobs with a focus on local hiring. By 2025 World Energy supply will replace over 10% of LAX’s fuel supply and this will benefit local air quality because we’ll be swapping the conventional fossil-fuel that has high particulate matter with fuel that has very low particulate matter which is much better for breathing and the lungs of all the residents in the local community. So we’re going from 250 barrels of sustainable aviation fuel a day all the way to 25000 barrels of sustainable aviation fuel a day this will make California home to the largest advanced biofuel producer for sustainable aviation fuel anywhere.”

Hydrogen Head-Honcho: “This project is another pioneering moment in Air Products’ commitment to help support the energy transition. We are already building the world’s largest green hydrogen facility with our partners in Saudi Arabia and the world’s largest blue hydrogen facility in Louisiana. Now we are teaming up with World Energy to build North America’s largest SAF facility” said Seifi Ghasemi Air Products’ Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer. “We are very pleased to be working with World Energy enabling another U.S. megaproject that will provide measurable sustainability benefits and advance California’s decarbonization goals by producing a renewable fuel to meet the growing demands of the aviation industry.”

Hot Honeywell: “As one of the pioneers of the SAF market with Honeywell UOP Ecofining technology our long-term engagement with World Energy continues to help transform the industry and support the goal of a significantly reducing CO2 emissions” Bryan Glover President and CEO Honeywell UOP. “Our participation in this project will not only enable World Energy to build a technologically advanced SAF production and distribution hub it also helps accelerate the energy transition of the aviation industry.”

A bit of background

The world’s first and North America’s only commercial-scale SAF facility was launched in Paramount using Honeywell UOP’s Ecofining technology in 2013 with production commencing in 2016. World Energy and Honeywell have continued to collaborate and have strengthened this critical relationship with a technical development agreement to advance the next generation of carbon reduction technologies. This collaboration will further innovations integrating more efficient SAF production processes new process pathways using new sustainable feedstocks low-carbon hydrogen and carbon capture technologies.

The bottom line is this is huge news for SAF and the aviation industry in seeing a big impact on aviation sustainability – perfect timing for Earth Day weekend but just the beginning of seeing more real SAF in real planes real soon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2RldGFpbC8wMDAwNDI0MzMzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary for Steve Kahn,"Kahn Steve passed away on 4/23/22 at the age of 75 due to complications related to lung cancer.

Over the years the Laos native has seen waves of newcomers from Latin America in the 1990s then others from Africa in the early 2000s and from Southeast Asia more recently.

This southern Minnesota community has seen dramatic growth in diversity in recent decades especially when compared with similar-sized cities in the state.

Today if you randomly picked two people from Austin there's a 54% chance they would be of a different race and Hispanic origin according to the city's diversity index score from the 2020 census. This is more than triple what the score was in 2000.

Austin a city of just over 26000 in southern Minnesota is named for Austin R. Nichols a fur trapper and the area's first European settler. Hormel Foods Corp. which is known for Spam and other meat products is the city's largest employer giving it the nickname ""Spam Town USA.""

Some Austin residents say diversity increased because of job opportunities at places like Hormel low crime rates and a welcoming environment.

Some newcomers have also found success by opening businesses like salons and markets clothing stores and restaurants.

Van Vugt said she stayed in Austin because the community tries to support diversity. But it still has flaws she said. Local leadership is heavily white and the schools continue to grapple with mostly white teachers.

""There's that potential for growth and there's a desire for growth"" Van Vugt said. ""And there's a lot of support here for that change.""

But adapting to the growing diversity has not been easy.

In December there were protests and racial tensions in the city after an Austin police officer shot and killed Kokou Christopher Fiafonou a Black man.

At the high school some students said there have been incidents of white students using racial slurs.

""There [are] still students that have mindsets where they think they can say certain things to minorities and it's not OK"" said Mayra Zarate a high school senior of Mexican descent.

John Alberts the district's director of education services said the administration is aware of these incidents when students report them but declined to elaborate citing student privacy.

Bonnie Reitz Austin's mayor from 1997 to 2007 said she dealt with people who did not want the city to support newcomers. Some people even came from other towns to speak out against increasing diversity she said.

""There were some really tough times and very likely there are still people who would not be real excited about it"" Reitz said.

Austin's population which had been predicted to decline grew nearly 6% between 2010 and 2020. The white population was the only racial group that decreased.

""The people coming our immigrants and refugees are a big part of the reason why Austin is doing well"" Reitz said.

Increasing representation in government

Oballa Oballa the first and only person of color on the City Council started as an honorary council member — a program created to try to diversify local government.

Originally from Gambela Ethiopia Oballa fled the country in 2003 and spent 10 years in a Kenyan refugee camp before resettling in the U.S. He became a citizen in December 2019 and ran for City Council a year later.

Oballa said the city needs more people of color in leadership positions so that it reflects the community.

""But me being the first refugee and first person of color on the City Council it has really opened the eyes of so many people"" Oballa said.

City Council Member Jason Baskin said Austin has seen more diverse candidates run for local office in the past four years than ever before.

In 2018 the mayor appointed a task force to develop a strategic welcoming plan with goals for the next five years to increase representation.

Nearly four years later some programs are succeeding while others were paused because of the pandemic Baskin said. For example the city wanted to hire a multicultural liaison but hasn't yet done it because of the pandemic.

One success was the honorary council position which allows residents to become temporary nonvoting council members.

Martirez Barrios Vasquez originally from Mexico and an Austin resident for 20 years said she feels the city has improved accessibility.

""Now we can talk to them and ask if we can do certain things or certain activities in certain places"" Barrios Vasquez said. ""They've been pretty helpful and accessible.""

Supporting students of color

Austin Public Schools passed a key milestone during the 2019-20 school year marking the first time the student population was majority people of color.

One of the district's challenges though is the lack of diverse teachers Alberts said. There were fewer than 10 teachers of color out of more than 300 teachers in the district during the 2020-21 school year.

Zarate said she never felt connected to her teachers — something she thinks is important because it allows students to feel more comfortable asking for help. She also said she noticed that other kids who speak Spanish or other students of color don't feel as close to their teachers as white students.

One way the district is trying to diversify its staff is by helping former students become teachers in the district Alberts said. This involves partnering with surrounding colleges so students can earn a teaching degree at Riverland Community College (RCC) in Austin and student teach there. This would hopefully create a pipeline of diverse teachers Alberts said.

There is also a scholarship program funded by the Hormel Foundation to help Austin graduates get to college in the first place providing two years' free community college.

The district has also implemented resources like ""success coaches"" to support students of color Alberts said.

Valentina Gallegos one of the district's 14 success coaches said she helps involve parents in their students' academics connects students with resources and provides interpretation services.

High school juniors Natural Soe who is Karen and July Oo who is Karenni said they would like to see more celebration of culture in schools.

Soe and Oo said the school should create a day where students can share traditions or other aspects of their cultures. They said this would help students connect better with each other.

""There's always a connection you can make with other people"" Soe said.

One of the most visible celebrations of the city's diversity — the Taste of Nations where residents share their cultural food with the community — will be held May 21.

Van Vugt the program coordinator for Austin's Welcome Center which helps plan the event said she expects many people will come this year because it was canceled in 2020 and hosted virtually in 2021.

The Welcome Center also helps immigrants and refugees transition to life in Austin. The center provides interpretation services and connects people with resources to address medical social legal financial or educational needs Van Vugt said.

""Having all these diversity initiatives ... that really helps our immigrant communities"" Van Vugt said. ""It's saying … everyone is different and it's OK.""

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

For full-year 2023 Host's revenue was $5.3 billion up 8.2% over 2022 according to the REIT's earnings release.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million — which was up 17% year over year — and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

The company's portfolio achieved full-year revenue per available room of $211.71 which was up 8.1% year over year. Average daily rate was $300.66 which was 1.8% above full-year 2022. Hotel occupancy was 70.4% up 6.2% from 2022.

As of publication time Host's stock was trading at $20.48 per share up 5.2% year to date. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7% for the same period.

For repairing or replacement purposes however these 11th gen CPU mainboards are now on sale complete with CAD and electrical documentation for tinkerers.

Framework made a name for itself last year when it launched its 13.5-inch laptop simply called Framework Laptop. Unlike most other laptops in the market the Framework model promised easy serviceability and repairability for any component — not just RAM or storage. A major part of that initiative would involve selling the individual components themselves to customers who may need them for replacement purposes.

The manufacturer is now offering the mainboard of the Laptop complete with processor and cooling solution for the following prices:

Core i5-1135G7 mainboard - $399 USD

Core i7-1165G7 mainboard - $549 USD

Core i7-1185G7 mainboard - $799 USD

In essence existing Core i5 owners of the Framework Laptop can easily upgrade to a Core i7 by just swapping out their mainboards. Based on our benchmarks jumping from the Core i5-1135G7 to the Core i7-1165G7 should boost CPU and GPU performance roughly by about 15 percent each.

Unfortunately there is no word yet on when Alder Lake-U mainboards will become available. There is very little reason to upgrade within the same processor generation as the biggest performance gains will be inter-generational and not intra-generational. The latest Ultrabooks from major OEMs like Dell HP and Lenovo are already widely available with 12th gen CPUs while the Framework Laptop continues to be limited to 11th gen options. Hopefully the 12th gen mainboards will be made available sooner rather than later.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9ocC1jb25maXJtcy1vbWVuLTE3LWdhbWluZy1sYXB0b3Atd2lsbC1zaGlwLXdpdGgtMTYtY29yZS1pbnRlbC1jb3JlLWk5LTEyOTAwaHgtY3B10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HP confirms Omen 17 gaming laptop will ship with 16-core Intel Core i9-12900HX CPU,"Intel Alder Lake-HX in HP Omen 17 gaming laptop

HP joins other laptop manufacturers now confirming that Intel 12th Gen Core Alder Lake-HX series will offer up to 16 cores.

The company is now listing its Omen 17 2021 laptop with Core i9-12900HX processor. The product page was clearly not meant to go live this soon as even the ‘shop now’ button does not lead to any such offer. Not to mention the fact that the sub-title mentions “11th Gen Core” series.

What the listing does confirm though is that the upcoming Core i9-12900HX processor with boost up to 5.0 GHz will feature 16 cores and 24 threads. Even the Gigabyte AORUS 17X laptop that leaked a few days ago did not mention the core count. Therefore this is the first official confirmation that this part will indeed feature more than 14-cores which was thus far the limit of Alder Lake mobile series.

The Core i9-12900HX is a desktop-class CPU featuring 8 Performance and 8 Efficient Cores. The 12th Gen Core H and P-Series of laptop processors released in January this year are limited to 6 Performance and 8 Efficient.

The updated Omen 17 is a high-end gaming laptop featuring DDR5-4800 memory and up to GeForce RTX 3080 Ti 16GB graphics based on GA103 GPU. If not for the 1080p 144Hz screen this could have been the best-spec’ed gaming laptop on the market.

With the launch of Alder Lake-HX Intel will become the first company to launch a 16-core processor series designed specifically for laptops. However it won’t be the first time we get such a core count on a mobile platform. We have already seen attempts to launch desktop CPUs for workstations systems that shipped with a full desktop socket and allowed customers to choose high-performance CPUs as long as they were limited to 65W. Therefore it is technically possible to buy a laptop with Ryzen 9 5950X CPU but it will not be as fast as the full fledged desktop system.

It is significantly more powerful than the average front-wheel-drive Corolla hatchback thanks to all-wheel drive and a 300-horsepower turbocharged 3-cylinder engine. Here’s all you need to know about the latest entrant.

The Toyota Corolla has been reigning as the world’s best-selling car for quite some time now mostly because it is inexpensive and fuel-efficient. However since its original production run back in 1966 Toyota has experimented with some high-powered car versions. While these performance-driven variants of the Corolla saw only a limited run the company has taken a bold step with the latest iteration of the vehicle.

The all-new Toyota GR Corolla announced recently is the company’s most powerful Corolla yet with all-wheel-drive and a massive 300 hp engine. Although the engine is a turbocharged 3-cylinder the new GR Corolla should be more powerful than the standard hatchback model.

How is the GR Corolla different from the Corolla Apex?

Toyota currently offers a variation of the standard Corolla the Apex. Although the Apex has a stiffer suspension and an optional manual transmission it has the same engine as the standard hatchback model. On the other hand the GR Toyota Corolla has a much more powerful engine that makes it an entirely different car.

Furthermore the GR is available with a 6-speed manual transmission only. There is no option for automatic transmission with the new GR.

Why the name “GR”?

Toyota seems to have picked the initials GR at random but the truth is far more interesting. GR in the GR Toyota Corolla stands for Gazoo Racing Toyota’s official racing team so you know they mean business with this one. According to the reports Toyota’s president Akio Toyoda an avid racer was personally involved in the development of the new GR.

Toyota GR Corolla Design and Features

One of the car’s most interesting features is the variable all-wheel-drive system. The system allows the driver to select how much power is given to the rear and front wheels. According to the company the front wheels can receive as much as 60% of their total capacity and the rear wheels can receive 70% of their power at most. The ability to control the power to a specific set of wheels allows for better control and makes the car a lot safer especially for newer drivers.

Another effort to improve handling can be seen in the fenders extending out from the body giving the car a wider stance. The roof is entirely made from high-quality carbon fiber and helps cut down the GR Corolla’s weight. The vehicle also has quite a low center of gravity due to being bottom-heavy which helps in improving the handling of the car.

The doors and the hood are made from aluminum further cutting down the weight. Aerodynamically designed front fenders allow the air to pass through the car’s body reducing the drag quite a bit. Also the car sports three exhaust pipes in the back giving it quite a unique look.

GR Corolla Hatchback Performance and Competition

There is quite a bit of competition for the Toyota Corolla in the performance sedan market. Some of the most popular cars in this segment include the Volkswagen Golf R and the Honda Civic R. The compact performance sedan has its roots in rally racing. Traction and agility are very important as the rally racer needs to run on twisting dirt roads.

The company has paid special attention to the design of the car to improve the Toyota hatchback’s performance and handling in a rally racing environment. According to the company GR’s variable all-wheel driving system was developed as a rally racer.

Although not a lot is known about the pricing of the new Toyota Corolla it is going to be available in two variants. The base version is named “Core” and the fully-loaded version “Circuit Edition.” The production is set to start in Japan’s special GR production facility later this year.

It should be interesting to see how the GR Toyota Corolla performs in real-life conditions and whether it can be a viable option in the power sedan market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3RoaXMtaG9tZS1tYWRlLTIwMDAtaHAtbWF6ZGEtcngtNy1pcy1oZWxsLWJlbnQtb24tc2hyZWRkaW5nLWl0cy10aXJlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Home-Made 2000 HP Mazda RX-7 Is Hell-Bent On Shredding Its Tires,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3RoaXMtaG9tZS1tYWRlLTIwMDAtaHAtbWF6ZGEtcngtNy1pcy1oZWxsLWJlbnQtb24tc2hyZWRkaW5nLWl0cy10aXJlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL3ZvbGtzd2FnZW4vamV0dGEtdmVudG8tYm9yYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,All VOLKSWAGEN Jetta / Vento / Bora Models by Year (1992-Present) - Specs Pictures & History,"For three decades the Jetta was the best-selling Volkswagen on the market thanks to its compact size and three-box sedan look which made it suitable for families and company cars as well.

In 2021 the German carmaker introduced a facelifted version for Jetta’s seventh generation which modified the styling and some of the engines.

On the outside the car featured a new grille with two distinctive chromed bars that flanked the VW logo in the middle. For the GLI version a red strip ran across the bumper connecting the standard LED headlights. From its sides the chromed trims around the windows were another standard feature for the 2022 model year.

Inside the German carmaker upgraded the infotainment system to the MIB3 version fitted as standard for the GLI and available as an option for the rest of the range. Volkswagen also included an 8” display for the instrument cluster with an option for a 10” unit dubbed Digital Cockpit Pro. As expected the car featured wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity.

Under the hood Volkswagen adopted the 1.5-liter turbocharged unit for most of the range. On the other hand the GLI provided the same 2.0-liter turbocharged powerplant as its predecessor. Depending on the options and version an automatic (dual-clutch) transmission will be available for the entire range."

Its keyboard was quite unlike most others of its time which means that a PCjr without an original keyboard is pretty much a dust collector. That’s what led [Jozef Bogin] to create the KeybJr a piece of hardware that allows one to use any AT XT or PS/2 keyboard with the IBM PCjr.

What was strange about the PCjr’s keyboard? From the outside it looked pretty normal but it definitely had its own thing going on. For one the PCjr keyboard operated over a completely different protocol than the other keyboards of the time. In addition its connection to the host was either by IR or via its own wired cable adapter.

The KeybJr solves this by using an Arduino-based board to turn inputs from other keyboards of the time into something the PCjr expects. These signals are sent out and received either over infrared or by the PCjr’s “K” port for a wired keyboard link.

Why bother with the IR functionality? Well the connector and pins on the PCjr are not very rugged and sometimes they are damaged. In those cases it is nice to have the option of using a normal (for the time) keyboard over the IR link. Vintage hardware is not always in perfect shape after all. That’s why things like ATX power supply adapters for the PCjr exist.

Want to give it a shot? There is a GitHub repository for the KeybJr and you can see it in action in a brief video embedded below.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlb3BsZW1hdHRlcnMuaW4vYXJ0aWNsZS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2Nhbi10ZWNoLWhlbHAtdXMtY3JlYXRlLWEtYmV0dGVyLWVhcnRoLTMzNzA10gFYaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGVvcGxlbWF0dGVycy5pbi9hbXAtdGVjaG5vbG9neS1jYW4tdGVjaC1oZWxwLXVzLWNyZWF0ZS1hLWJldHRlci1lYXJ0aC0zMzcwNQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can tech help us create a better earth? IBM's Arun Biswas weighs in,"The window to take that action in time to stave off a climate disaster is narrowing. Not only that amidst rising geopolitical tensions and the looming food and energy crisis there is a real chance that bold climate action will take a backseat.

It’s ironic that on Earth Day – which fell on April 22 – the theme was “Invest in our Planet”. Ironic because the first Earth Day in 1970 changed its central theme from “environmental teach-in” to “environmental action”. And 52 years later we’re still waiting to take bold collective action. The window to take that action in time to stave off a climate disaster is narrowing. Not only that amidst rising geopolitical tensions and the looming food and energy crisis because of the war in Ukraine there is a real chance that bold climate action will take a backseat.

Over the past year the IPCC a UN body for assessing the science related to climate change has released a comprehensive set of reports that call out the enormity of the challenge and the need for urgent action by governments businesses and the civil society. The figures are staggering – up to 50 per cent of the world’s population (3.3 to 3.6 billion people) are living in settings that are “highly vulnerable” to climate change as per the latest IPCC report.

The good news is that we already have many of the solutions needed and the scale of investment needed is large but not prohibitive. It is estimated that we will need to invest a few percentage points of the world’s GDP to get to net-zero by 2050. “Having the right policies infrastructure and technology in place to enable changes to our lifestyles and behaviour can result in a 40-70 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050” says IPCC co-chair Priyadarshi Shukla. “This offers significant untapped potential.”

The role of IT

It’s therefore pertinent to ask how tech especially information tech (IT) can help us create a better Earth. Let’s look at a few examples:

Measuring and monitoring: First we need to be able to measure and monitor the impact of our activities on the planet. This is a complex task that requires the gathering and processing of massive amounts of data in real-time. Technology solutions such as Envizi a recent acquisition by IBM enable leading companies such as Uber Honeywell and Merck to analyze manage and report environmental goals find efficiency opportunities and assess sustainability risks. Another example is IBM’s collaboration with the Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW) to build a data platform on the cloud to track and monitor plastic waste.

Building sustainable operations and supply chains: Second we need to use the insights from all the data and information gathered to decarbonize operations and supply chains and mitigate environmental impact. The IBM Food Trust is a great example of using emerging technologies such as IoT and blockchain to provide greater transparency and visibility in the food supply chain —so food can be fresher safer and more sustainable.

Climate innovation: Third we need to continue to innovate and not only find new solutions but also continue to bring down the cost of existing technologies and solutions and help scale them. One of the areas where cost-effective and scalable solutions are needed is carbon capture use and storage (CCUS). IBM is using the latest advancements in quantum computing technology to discover new carbon-absorbing materials and more effective ways of storing carbon.

Singapore’s journey

Singapore offers an excellent example of leveraging tech to benefit the planet.

“Singapore is one of the few countries to create a balance between urban development and environmental protection” notes the US International Trade Administration. “Singapore offers multiple opportunities in smart AI-based environment technology biomedical and water and wastewater treatments.”

In February 2021 the country released the Singapore Green Plan 2030. It sets targets for sustainability in Singapore by 2030. The plan is spearheaded by five Ministries including Education National Development Sustainability Transport and Trade and Industry. A S$50 million “SG Eco Fund” was set up in 2020 to support projects to boost environmental sustainability and partner with businesses and the community.

“Projects should have technological and/or social innovation and new ways of implementing solutions” the Eco Fund states. “Projects should create sustained impact through building local expertise creating resources and/or developing scalable solutions.”

Sustainability accelerator

Singapore’s sustainability goals echo those set by IBM. On April 12 2022 it launched IBM Impact a new framework for the company's ESG (environmental social and governance) work. It comprises three pillars – environmental impact equitable impact and ethical impact. IBM aims to become the catalyst for a better world and it aims to do so through investing in ecosystem-based initiatives such as the IBM Sustainability Accelerator. Launched in February this is a pro bono social impact scheme that applies AI and hybrid cloud to assist non-profits and government organisations with climate change extreme weather and pollution-related vulnerabilities. The program provides support for two years to selected organisations. The first three to join are Heifer International The Nature Conservancy India and Plan21 Foundation for Sustainable Human Development.

Committing to act together

A healthy planet is a bottom line for everyone to strive towards. “For Earth Day 2022 we need to act boldly innovate broadly and implement equitably” the Earth Day website notes. “It’s going to take all of us. All in. Businesses governments and citizens – everyone accounted for and accountable. A partnership for the planet.”

We may make money when you click on links to our partners. Learn More.

For the better part of a decade Hitachi Vantara has been providing network-attached storage (NAS) systems to enterprise markets.

Their NAS products are built for high performance and scalability using object-based storage and a proprietary architecture designed to boost CPU-demanding tasks.

See below to learn all about where the Hitachi Vantara NAS Platform stands in the NAS market:

The NAS market

With many attractive NAS products on the market today Hitachi Vantara stands out as one of the largest NAS providers. Some of its most significant competitors include HPE with its 3PAR StoreServ NAS IBM with its FlashSystem solution Dell EMC’s PowerScale and NetApp’s FAS Series.

Some industry analysts project the NAS market to grow at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 20% over the next five years. At this time more than 80% of mid-market and enterprise organizations use NAS devices to complement their broader storage platforms. Their popularity is driven by their purpose-built efficient designs that push performance at a sensible cost.

Features

Scalability is at the heart of Hitachi Vantara’s NAS platform. Virtual capacity is unlimited though there is a 1PB cap on individual file sizes.

The filesystem is designed to span across multiple namespaces and across public and private clouds. In addition the platform has a multitenancy capacity of up to 64 Hitachi Enterprise Virtual Servers for NAS which operate across multiple security domains.

From a hardware perspective Hitachi NAS nodes are powered by Intel Xeon quad-core CPUs 64GB RAM and non-volatile DIMM (NVDIMM) to provide data resilience in the event of a power outage. The devices also carry multiple field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) to facilitate and parallelize data transfers support encryption services manage system space and support system backups.

At the software level Hitachi NAS uses a next-generation small file IO cutting down capacity requirements for data storage by 28% over its previous iteration and providing other optimizations to cut down on write operations. Data can be managed using hard or soft quotas on users groups and volumes so administrators can provision capacity and tasks.

The platform also has a cluster namespace feature which produces a single directory that can span across numerous storage units.

The platform is designed to offload unused data into archival cloud storage supporting AWS Azure and IBM’s cloud services and of course Hitachi’s own cloud platform.

Disk usage is optimized using a tiered file system (TFS). TFS separates metadata and user data putting metadata on a storage tier geared toward higher performance and placing user data on a lower tier or in cloud backup if it is rarely accessed. These cloud files are linked across volumes maintaining their accessibility while still appearing within the one-folder architecture of a traditional NAS appliance.

Data maintains a high availability with an automated synchronous disaster recovery feature. Deduplication is similarly automated and made transparent to the end user. Hitachi Vantara claims users can expect the automated deduplication can “achieve up to 90% capacity savings.”

Configuration and deployment are also automated as is data self-healing. Snapshots can be made based on a variety of options including single file or whole directory clones or file system snapshots that are hidden read-only and designed to integrate with Microsoft’s Volume Shadow Copy Service recovery tool.

Benefits

The flexible scalability of a NAS gateway with easy cloud integrations makes Hitachi’s NAS platform a solid solution for any growing enterprise with expanding data storage needs. Further the system can be complemented with a Hitachi Virtual Storage Platform all-flash array providing the speed and performance of flash drives at the back end.

Use case

A Belgian research organization the Space Pole studies weather and climate and how it is impacted by stellar activity. Their data is shared all over the world and the organization produces a lot of it.

The organization is made up of three different research institutions and in order to advance their mission they recognized the need to consolidate how they manage and serve data.

The Space Pole engaged with a dozen storage hardware vendors to develop a solution. Ultimately they sided with two Hitachi NAS Platform 4080 systems back-ended by two Hitachi Virtual Storage Platform G400 models with a collective capacity of 8PB.

The system supports asynchronous disaster recovery a useful feature for the multi-campus organization. But ultimately what swayed the team toward Hitachi Vantara was the simplicity of their solution.

“We received a lot of very different proposals and the Hitachi Vantara offering stood out” said Fabienne Leclère a project manager at the Space Pole. “What initially attracted us to the Hitachi solution was how clear and straightforward it is; there was no unnecessary complexity.”

The Space Pole reports that the new storage solution reduced their direct storage costs by 50% while doubling overall performance thanks to the parallelization of disk usage. The company was also pleased with Hitachi’s preventative maintenance replacing disks often before they reached a critical failure.

Differentiators

Hitachi’s NAS products operate in a gateway configuration. While client devices interact with gateway devices the same way they do legacy NAS appliances gateways can seamlessly distribute storage across multiple drives while still providing a single folder interface. New drives can be introduced into NAS gateways without disruption to the existing file system providing theoretically infinite scalability.

In practice Hitachi NAS gateways can scale up to 80 NAS nodes supporting up to 4 trillion objects namespace with an aggregate 384GBps of throughput. The company claims to be the only major vendor of gateway NAS devices today.

User reviews

Reviewers on Gartner Peer Insights give Hitachi Vantara’s NAS gateway a collective 4.2 out of 5 star rating. Customers praised the hardware reliability and the responsiveness of Hitacha Vantara’s customer service. In addition the platform was received well for its high performance.

Although some customers wanted a greater degree of administrative options offered from the GUI as opposed to interfacing via the command line.

Pricing

Hitachi Vantara provides several purchase or lease options through their EverFlex service even offering a pay-per-use consumption model similar to typical cloud storage pricing schemes.

They also have an interactive Value Selector tool to help customers evaluate their storage-as-a-service needs. Due to the broad range of possible configurations with a NAS gateway it’s important to carefully evaluate your storage needs before pricing out a solution.

Conclusion

For a company seeking the scalability and versatility of a NAS gateway platform there are few options out there that match Hitachi Vantara’s NAS Platform. Historically NAS gateways carry added complexity to setup and administration but many customers praise Hitachi Vantara for providing an easy-to-use product and a reasonable price.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWxsYXNtb3JuaW5nbmV3cy9uYW1lL3dpbGxpYW0tcm93ZWxsLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM0NDIxOTA20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,William Rowell Obituary (1947 - 2022) - Dallas TX - Dallas Morning News,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://obits.dallasnews.com/us/obituaries/dallasmorningnews/name/william-rowell-obituary?id=34421906 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWxsYXNtb3JuaW5nbmV3cy9uYW1lL3dpbGxpYW0tcm93ZWxsLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM0NDIxOTA20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The focus of the new platform is the performance of the new CPUs - but the efficiency is worrying. New spec sheets with battery life numbers from Lenovo indicate that laptops with the 2022 Intel platform might have worse battery life than their predecessors.

4 Reviews

Intel's 2022 platform codenamed ""Alder Lake"" officially known as ""Intel 12th Gen Core i"" has a huge innovation with the hybrid architecture. The construction with fast P cores and ""small"" E cores enables Intel to boost the multicore performance. At the same time the E cores promise better battery life as the ""E"" stands for ""efficiency"". This is also a necessity: In the fight with AMD Ryzen 6000 and the Apple M1 platform Intel needs more than brute force performance.

In practice however the hybrid architecture might underdeliver on the efficiency part. At this point many Alder Lake laptops have not been reviewed yet so no final verdict can be made. However new spec sheets from Lenovo for 12th Gen laptops indicate that Alder Lake will not increase the battery life. On the contrary Alder Lake might actually lead to worse battery endurance.

For example: The Lenovo ThinkPad X13 G2 (available from Amazon affiliate link). This 2021 model was supposed to achieve a battery life of 14.5 hours with the bigger 54.7 Wh battery in the MobileMark 2018 test. Its successor the ThinkPad X13 G3 that is identical to the G2 except for the new processor Intel Core i5-1240P is rated for 11.8 hours in the same test.

This is not an exception: The ThinkPad X1 Nano G2 has a battery life rating of 11 hours in MobileMark 2018 less than the X1 Nano G1 (13.6 hours) even though the new model has a slightly larger battery (49.5 Wh instead of 48 Wh). Same goes for the X1 Carbon G10: 15 hours in MobileMark 2018 are significantly less than the 16.7 hours for the X1 Carbon G9.

If these numbers translate into worse battery life across all Alder Lake laptops the outlook for Intel is not too good. After all the upcoming Alder Lake refresh ""Raptor Lake"" will still be manufactured in the same Intel 7 process. An efficiency improvement will probably not happen until the 2023 release Meteor Lake arrives which will be the first Intel architecture to use the new ""Intel 4"" process.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2NoaW5hLWV4Y2x1c2l2ZS1pbnRlbC1jb3JlLWk1LTEyNDkwZi1jcHUtbm93LXNlbGxpbmctYXQtMjA3LXVzZC1tb3JlLWNhY2hlLWZhc3Rlci1jbG9ja3Mv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vY2hpbmEtZXhjbHVzaXZlLWludGVsLWNvcmUtaTUtMTI0OTBmLWNwdS1ub3ctc2VsbGluZy1hdC0yMDctdXNkLW1vcmUtY2FjaGUtZmFzdGVyLWNsb2Nrcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China-Exclusive Intel Core i5-12490F Gets Major Price Drop Now Selling For Around $205 US: More Cache & Higher Clocks Than $199 Core i5-12400,"Earlier this year Intel introduced its Core i5-12490F Alder Lake CPU exclusively for the Chinese DIY market. The 'Black Edition' CPU offered much higher clocks and increased cache compared to the Core i5-12400 but its pricing came close to the Core i5-12600KF at around $250-$260 US. Now the chip has been adjusted to a much lower price.

Intel Core i5-12490F Offers Higher Clocks & Increased CPU Cache For Just $8 US More Compared To The Core i5-12400

The Intel Core i5-12490P is a special Alder Lake chip that's been designed and sold exclusively to China. It features the C0 die which is the same used by all hybrid chips except the 12490P comes without hybrid cores. It packs 6 Golden Cove cores and 12 threads. The CPU being an F variant is excluded from iGPU support so the Xe-LP graphics that you'd otherwise find on the non-F chips is not there.

2 of 9

In terms of clock speeds the chip retains the same clocks as the Core i5-12500 at a 3.0 GHz base and 4.6 GHz boost and is faster than the Core i5-12400. One major difference however is the cache. The Intel Core i5-12490P rocks a 20 MB L3 cache compared to 19 MB on the Core i5-12500 & 18 MB on the Core i5-12400. Other than that it features up to 128 GB memory support 65W base TDP and a 117W maximum turbo power rating.

Now one thing we have seen with the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D is that extra cache does help in games and while the Intel Core i5-12490F features just 2 MB more L3 over the Core i5-12400F the clocks & general stability of the chip will lead to better performance. Now in terms of pricing the CPU sold at around $250-$260 US but has now been adjusted to 1349 Yuan or $207 US. The MSRP for Intel's Core i5-12400 CPU is set at $199 US.

Intel Core i5-12490F (Old Price) - $250 US

- $250 US Intel Core i5-12490F (New Price) - $207 US

- $207 US Intel Core i5-12400 (Retail MSRP) - $199 US

- $199 US Intel Core i5-12400F (Retail MSRP) - $179 US

For just $8 US more you can get a chip with faster clocks and more cache. For users who still want to go with the Core i5-12400 the better option is the 'F' CPU variant which retails for around $174.99 US (MSRP). That's a $35 US price difference but for those who can find the Core i5-12490F for $205-$210 US

it will definitely be a great choice over the Core i5-12400 (Non-F). You do end up with no stock cooler and no integrated graphics but considering that the Core i5 Alder Lake CPUs don't run that hot even entry-level air-coolers will do the trick. When the Core i5-12490F was first introduced it didn't make any sense given its high price but now it can actually be a competitive solution against AMD's Ryzen 5000 mainstream options.

Intel was the first to offer hardware AV1 decoding with its Xe-LP GPUs in 2020. This week it released version 1.0 of its speedy open-source Scalable Video Technology AV1 encoder and decoder for CPUs. SVT-AV1 works with all modern processors.

The AV1 open-source video codec was designed for ultra-high-def resolutions wide color gamut and high-dynamic range enhancements. AOMedia said in 2018 that its AV1 was 30% more efficient than existing codecs (implying primarily on H.265/HEVC that is designed for similar 4K+ content) which is a big deal. But one problem with highly-efficient codecs is that they are extremely hungry for resources and generally require hardware acceleration to work correctly. Meanwhile modern CPUs have a lot of resources and new instructions that can be applied to decoding and encoding which is precisely what SVT-AV1 does.

SVT-AV1 is a scalable standard-agnostic encoder/decoder library that can take advantage of the multi-core nature of modern CPUs and AVX2 instructions. The SVT-AV1 also adds further AVX2 optimizations to boost performance image quality improvements fast-decode for more preset levels and S-frames support reports Phoronix.

Intel's SVT-AV1 libraries are supported on modern x86 machines (Intel 5th Generation Core 'Broadwell' and higher) running Apple's macOS Microsoft's Windows and Linux.

Intel and Netflix initially started the SVT-AV1 project to develop a production-quality AV1-encoder with performance levels applicable to various applications from premium video-on-demand to real-time and live encoding/transcoding. In August 2020 the SVT-AV1 encoded/decode library was adopted by AOMedia's Software Implementation Working Group (SIWG) to make AV1 more popular. The SVT-AV1 version 1.0 release marks a milestone in the development of the encoder/decoder libraries.

Version 1.0 of SVT-AV1 encoder/decoder libraries is a milestone and good news for content creators and end-users. However for companies like Netflix Intel now offers Arctic Sound-M accelerators based on DG2 silicon that can handle eight simultaneous 4K streams and supports hardware-accelerated AV1 encoding and decoding.

The single-tile Intel Arctic Sound 1T features an Xe-HP GPU with 384 EUs and 16GB of HBM2E memory offering a peak bandwidth of up to 716 GB/s (which probably means that we are dealing with two stacks of HBM2E that use a 2048-bit interface). The accelerator is a short single-slot full-height card rated for a 150W TDP.

Intel's Arctic Sound 2T card carries an Xe-HP GPU with two tiles 960 EUs (480×2 to be more accurate) and 32GB of HBM2E DRAM. The accelerator uses a full-length full-height (FLFH) form factor and is rated for a 300W TDP delivered using one eight-pin power connector. (One thing to keep in mind is that IgorsLab edited the images of the cards to protect the source.)

Intel's Xe-HP architecture is a far cry from the company's Xe-LP architecture we know from the Iris Xe consumer-grade GPUs. The Xe-HP card supports more floating-point formats (e.g. FP16 FP32 FP64 for general purpose bfloat16 format for AI/ML computing) more compute-specific instructions DP4A convolution instruction for deep learning and Intel's XMX extensions.



The datacenter-oriented Xe-HP GPUs use all-new execution units (EUs) with various IPC improvements feature HBM2E memory support and are made using Intel's performance-optimized 10nm SuperFin process technology. In short the Xe-HP is not the Xe-LP or Xe-HPG on steroids but something completely different.

Intel now allowed some of its customers to preview its Arctic Sound compute cards carrying single-tile and dual-tile Xe-HP implementations. Intel announced a quad-tile Xe-HP implementation last year and even demonstrated one of such accelerators in action offering over 42 FP32 TFLOPS of performance. However the company is not ready to sample it right now or is only sampling it with select customers.



Intel's Xe-HP plans are not completely clear as the company has never detailed them. Meanwhile the EU count of these two cards is somewhat lower than expected (assuming that one Xe-HP tile features 512 EUs). At present we don't know how old these cards are and which configurations Intel plans to ship.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9hbWQtcnl6ZW4tNy01ODAweDNkLXZzLWludGVsLWNvcmUtaTktMTI5MDBrL9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9hbWQtcnl6ZW4tNy01ODAweDNkLXZzLWludGVsLWNvcmUtaTktMTI5MDBrLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D vs. Intel Core i9-12900K: Benchmarks specs pricing,"The battle for the best CPU for gaming is on. AMD’s hot new Ryzen 7 5800X3D and Intel’s Core i9-12900K are two CPUs with very different approaches to high-end gaming performance but both are equally impressive.

With eight cores and several hundred dollars separating them it might seem like a foregone conclusion which is best. But with their unique hardware arrangements the title of which is the best gaming processor of 2022 — so far — really is up for grabs.

Pricing and availability

Intel released the Core i9-12900K in early November 2021 as the flagship of the new Alder Lake generation. It debuted with a recommend price of $589 though it more readily sells for around $600 at the time of writing.

The AMD Ryzen 5800X3D launched on April 20 2022 with a price tag of $450. This puts it more in line with the Core i7-12700K in terms of cost but performance-wise at least in gaming it is very much gunning for the Intel flagship.

Specs

AMD Ryzen 5800X3D Intel Core i9-12900K Architecture Zen 3 Alder Lake Process TSCM 7nm Intel 7 (10nm) Cores 8 16 (8 performance + 8 efficiency) Threads 16 24 Base clock 3.4GHz 3.4GHz Boost clock 4.5GHz 5.2GHz Total L3 cache 96MB 30MB TDP 105W 241W

These two CPUs have very different hardware makeups each representing exciting new directions for their respective companies. The Ryzen 7 5800X3D has a more traditional core layout of eight identical cores and 16 threads with simultaneous multi-threading. The Intel Core i9-12900K has 16 total cores split between eight performance cores and eight smaller efficiency cores.

The AMD CPU sports a more modest 4.5GHz boost clock a 200MHz reduction from the Ryzen 7 5800X it’s based on while the Core i9-12900K reaches to new heights with a 5.2GHz boost clock on a single core and a 5GHz boost clock across all of them at once.

Where the 5800X3D breaks new ground is in its cache. It has 64MB of 3D-stacked L3 cache on top of the die which when combined with the normal 32MB gives it 96MB of total L3 cache. That’s more than three times as much as the Core i9-12900K.

That additional cache dramatically boosts the otherwise standard specifications to new heights of gaming performance. There are some bandwidth- and latency-dependent applications that could also benefit from it but it’s games where we’re seeing the largest benefit.

Outside of specs power is a big concern. The Core i9-12900K draws more than twice as much power than the Ryzen 7 5800X3D and even more if you overclock it. The Ryzen 7 5800X3D doesn’t support overclocking unfortunately though that comes with the upside of less power draw overall.

Gaming

The Ryzen 7 5800X3D and Core i9-12900K were both sold as gaming CPUs so it only makes sense to start there. You can see how the two chips stack up on average in the chart below. Our tests were run at 1080p with an RTX 3090 and 32GB of DDR4-3200 memory. Keep in mind that the Core i9-12900K supports DDR5 though it doesn’t make a huge difference in games.

The extra L3 cache on Ryzen 7 5800X3D makes a big difference however. Overall the Ryzen 7 5800X3D is about 1.7% faster than the Core i9-12900K. That isn’t a massive lead but consider that AMD’s CPU has half of the cores a much slower clock speed and costs around $200 less.

It’s not perfect though. In intense open-world games like Red Dead Redemption 2 and Forza Horizon 4 the Core i9-12900K takes a lead with its larger core count. Some open-world titles still favor the Ryzen 7 5800X3D’s increased cache however as showcased by Far Cry 6 and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla.

AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D Intel Core i9-12900K 3D Mark Time Spy 17078 19396 Red Dead Redemption 2 119 fps 132 fps Assassin’s Creed Valhalla 121 fps 118 fps Forza Horizon 4 247 fps 250 fps Fortnite 205 fps 205 fps Halo Infinite 127 fps 113 fps Cyberpunk 2077 128 fps 122 fps Far Cry 6 147 fps 141 fps Civilization VI (turn time lower is better) 6.6 seconds 7.3 seconds

Where the Ryzen 7 5800X3D shoots ahead is in multiplayer. In Halo Infinite it leads by 12.4% and in Fortnite it matches the Core i9-12900K. AMD says the random nature of multiplayer games — think Apex Legends or Valorant — can benefit from increased cache and our benchmarks back that up.

It’s not just multiplayer titles either. Our Civilization VI turn time benchmark is a sign of that showing that an increased cache pool allows the processor to hold more instructions for AI opponents.

Processor performance

Although the Ryzen 7 5800X3D is a showstopping gaming CPU it’s not great in general processor performance. The higher core count on the Core i9-12900K allows it to run through applications much faster both in terms of single- and multi-core performance.

AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D Intel Core i9-12900K Cinebench R23 single-core 1460 1989 Cinebench R23 multi-core 14544 27344 Geekbench 5 single-core 1588 2036 Geekbench 5 multi-core 10209 18259 Handbrake (seconds lower is better) 69 47 PugetBench for Premiere Pro 882 1066

In tests like Cinebench and Geekbench which exclusively stress the CPU the Core i9-12900K is about 30% faster in single-core performance and around 80% faster in multi-core performance. The Core i9-12900K has a lot more general compute heft under the hood.

That translates into applications too with Intel’s CPU showing a 21% lead in Premiere and a 32% lead in Handbrake. If you’re a professional that needs optimal CPU performance the Core i9-12900K is your best bet especially considering its platform features.

PCIe and memory support

As much as raw performance cost and efficiency are major factors in buying a CPU you also need to factor in the ecosystem. The AMD Ryzen 5800X3D is running on AMD’s aged AM4 platform which supports DDR4 memory and PCIe 4.0. In comparison the Core i9-12900K is based on Intel’s newer LGA 1700 socket and supports DDR5 memory and PCIe 5.0. That not only means it has greater performance potential where memory bandwidth is paramount but that it can be upgraded to future DDR5 and PCIe hardware (GPUs and storage being the most prevalent) without the need to upgrade anything else.

Intel’s platform will also have one more generation of upgrades in Raptor Lake whereas AMD’s AM4 is very much on its last legs. It’s still capable and the 5800X3D represents an amazing upgrade path for existing AMD Ryzen system owners but it’s a harder one to recommend for new builds considering its lack of comparable longevity.

Power and thermals

Performant as it is the Core i9-12900K is a hot processor. During our tests it peaked at around 86 degrees Celsius which is right around where the Ryzen 7 5800X3D peaked. However Intel’s part drew a staggering 240 watts of power during that time while the Ryzen 7 5800X3D only sipped 101W.

We ran our tests with a 240mm all-in-one liquid cooler so there’s a little more thermal headroom with an intense cooling solution. Regardless the Core i9-12900K is a clear loser here. It draws a lot of power as is and if you overclock it it will draw even more. The beefed-up Core i9-12900KS is evidence of that nearing 300W and 100 degrees Celsius based on our testing.

Ryzen rips for gaming but Alder Lake is a better all-rounder

If you want the best gaming CPU the Ryzen 7 5800X3D is the cream of the crop. When it comes to the best processors however the Core i9-12900K still holds the crown. It comes with much higher performance in professional applications despite taking a decent back seat in gaming.

The main concern comes down to thermals and power. The Core i9-12900K is a hot chip and you’ll need one of the best PC power supplies to support it. That’s especially true if you’re overclocking where even a 360mm AIO can only keep temperatures around 90 degrees Celsius when the chip is pushed.

On the other hand the Ryzen 7 5800X3D doesn’t even support overclocking. That doesn’t make a huge difference in games but there are still applications that are sensitive to frequency (including older games). Keep that in mind before picking up the CPU you want.

Until now the firmware was only provided as a closed-source binary and Coreboot developers published an open letter to open the source code for the PSE firmware last December and it’s been successful with Intel releasing the Intel PSE SDK based on Zephyr OS.

The SDK combines open-source components (code samples services etc…) released under a permissive Apache 2.0 license (“License A”) and closed-source libraries and tools released under an Intel license (“License B”) allowing the redistribution and use in binary form without modification. You’ll find everything on Github including documentation explaining how to get started with the Zephyr SDK the installation script and build samples. Intel also explains how to stitch a signed PSE firmware into an Integrated Firmware Image that can then be flashed to the SPI NOR flash on the board through a DediProg SF600 Plus programmer.

While the Intel PSE SDK is not entirely open-source this may still help with integration into open-source bootloaders alleviated some of the security/privacy concerns and possibly enable some new use cases for the Intel Programmable Services Engine.

If there’s one thing that can be said about Rage Against the Machine it’s that they’re a band that lives up to their name especially when it comes to their activism if that’s what you want to call it.

Some of the younger generation might be unaware of the specific details of the events that took place in 2000 when they caused the temporary shutdown of the New York Stock Exchange but Rage proved to be the quite literal antithesis of trying to be The Wolf of Wall Street.

So how exactly did they manage to do this? Shutting down Wall Street sounds nearly impossible so how did one band manage to do it? It all started with the recording of their music video for the song ‘Sleep Now in the Fire’ a track taken from their album The Battle of Los Angeles which centres primarily around calling out corporate wealth greed and capitalism.

The video was directed by Michael Moore who had the members of Rage Against the Machine perform on the steps of Federal Hall in lower Manhattan New York City. Although they obtained a federal permit for the shoot NYC authorities denied Moore a sound permit. This led to the NYPD shutting down the shoot after the band went through six takes after which the group rushed the New York Stock Exchange across the street while he was being threatened with arrest.

Director Moore said of the events later: “We decided to shoot this video in the belly of the beast. For a few minutes Rage Against the Machine was able to shut down American capitalism—an act that I am sure tens of thousands of downsized citizens would cheer.”

Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine recalls the events stating: “So we’re on the steps and we’re performing and it’s going well. And then he says ‘OK now we’re going to play on the sidewalk the un-permitted sidewalk.’ And so we get down on the sidewalk and the police sergeant comes up to me and he’s like ‘You guys got to get back up on the steps.’ I remember what Mike said so I’m like ‘Something’s happening. I’m going to keep playing.’ And then he’s like ‘Get back on the fucking steps right now.”

He continued “And he’s mad. The cop vein in his neck begins to pulse. And then he unplugs my guitar and the riff keeps playing. And then he unplugs Timmy’s bass and takes Brad’s drumsticks. The look on his face is one of religious terror. He doesn’t understand how the song is happening. So he arrests Michael Moore. Then Michael in his second directorial edict of the afternoon says ‘Take the New York Stock Exchange.'”

Detailing further Morello added: “In retrospect it felt like a historic victory against evil but on the day it felt so chaotic because our director was in jail… At the end of the day it was a pretty spectacular historic rock and roll thing we made. They don’t make them like that anymore.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hleHBsb3Jpc3QuY29tL3dhdGVyLWNvbW1vbi1ldXJvcGEtaWNlLXNoZWxsLzQ2NjUwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Water may be common within Europa's ice shell,"Jupiter’s moon Europa is a prime candidate for extraterrestrial habitability in our solar system. The surface landforms of its ice shell express the subsurface structure dynamics and exchange governing this potential. Double ridges are the most common surface feature on Europa and occur across every sector of the moon but their formation is poorly understood with current hypotheses providing competing and incomplete mechanisms for the development of their distinct morphology.

Now increasing evidence reveals the ice shell may be a site of potential habitability in its own right.

Ice-penetrating radar observations that captured the formation of a “double ridge” feature in Greenland suggest the ice shell of Europa may have an abundance of water pockets beneath similar features that are common on the surface. The findings which appear in Nature Communications on April 19 maybe compelling for detecting potentially habitable environments within the exterior of the Jovian moon.

“Because it’s closer to the surface where you get interesting chemicals from space other moons and the volcanoes of Io there’s a possibility that life has a shot if there are pockets of water in the shell” said study senior author Dustin Schroeder an associate professor of geophysics at Stanford University‘s School of Earth Energy & Environmental Sciences (Stanford Earth). “If the mechanism we see in Greenland is how these things happen on Europa it suggests there’s water everywhere.”

A terrestrial analog

On Earth researchers analyze polar regions using airborne geophysical instruments to understand how the growth and retreat of ice sheets might impact sea-level rise. Much of that study area occurs on land where the flow of ice sheets is subject to complex hydrology – such as dynamic subglacial lakes surface melt ponds and seasonal drainage conduits – that contribute to uncertainty in sea-level predictions.

Because a land-based subsurface is so different from Europa’s subsurface ocean of liquid water the study co-authors were surprised when during a lab group presentation about Europa they noticed that formations that streak the icy moon looked extremely similar to a minor feature on the surface of the Greenland ice sheet – an ice sheet that the group has studied in detail.

“We were working on something totally different related to climate change and its impact on the surface of Greenland when we saw these tiny double ridges – and we were able to see the ridges go from ‘not formed’ to ‘formed'” Schroeder said.

Upon further examination they found that the “M”-shaped crest in Greenland known as a double ridge could be a miniature version of the most prominent feature on Europa.

Prominent and prevalent

Double ridges on Europa appear as dramatic gashes across the moon’s icy surface with crests reaching nearly 1000 feet separated by valleys about a half-mile wide. Scientists have known about the features since the moon’s surface was photographed by the Galileo spacecraft in the 1990s but have not been able to conceive a definitive explanation of how they were formed.

Through analyses of surface elevation data and ice-penetrating radar collected from 2015 to 2017 by NASA’s Operation IceBridge the researchers revealed how the double ridge on northwest Greenland was produced when the ice fractured around a pocket of pressurized liquid water that was refreezing inside of the ice sheet causing two peaks to rise into the distinct shape.

“In Greenland this double ridge formed in a place where water from surface lakes and streams frequently drains into the near-surface and refreezes” said lead study author Riley Culberg a Ph.D. student in electrical engineering at Stanford. “One way that similar shallow water pockets could form on Europa might be through water from the subsurface ocean being forced up into the ice shell through fractures – and that would suggest there could be a reasonable amount of exchange happening inside of the ice shell.”

Snowballing complexity

Rather than behaving like a block of inert ice the shell of Europa seems to undergo a variety of geological and hydrological processes – an idea supported by this study and others including evidence of water plumes that erupt to the surface. A dynamic ice shell supports habitability since it facilitates the exchange between the subsurface ocean and nutrients from neighboring celestial bodies accumulated on the surface.

“People have been studying these double ridges for over 20 years now but this is the first time we were actually able to watch something similar on Earth and see nature work out its magic” said study co-author Gregor Steinbrügge a planetary scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) who started working on the project as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford. “We are making a much bigger step into the direction of understanding what processes actually dominate the physics and the dynamics of Europa’s ice shell.”

The co-authors said their explanation for how the double ridges form is so complex; they couldn’t have conceived it without the analog on Earth.

“The mechanism we put forward in this paper would have been almost too audacious and complicated to propose without seeing it happen in Greenland” Schroeder said.

“We are another hypothesis on top of many – we just have the advantage that our hypothesis has some observations from the formation of a similar feature on Earth to back it up” Culberg said. “It’s opening up all these new possibilities for a very exciting discovery.”

“Our observations provide a mechanism for subsurface water control of double ridge formation that is broadly consistent with the current understanding of Europa’s ice-shell dynamics and double ridge morphology. If this mechanism controls double ridge formation at Europa the ubiquity of double ridges on the surface implies that liquid water is and has been a pervasive feature within the brittle lid of the ice shell suggesting that shallow water processes may be even more dominant in shaping Europa’s dynamics surface morphology and habitability than previously thought.” Study quotes.

Beike which went public in New York in August 2020 and has seen its stock price slide 64 percent since that debut has until 12 May to clear up the matter or face a delisting of its American depositary shares which trade under the name KE Holdings.

The Beijing-based company was added to a US Securities and Exchange Commission watch list on Thursday after falling afoul of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act which requires that companies listed on US exchanges make available the source documents behind their audited financial statements.

“The company has been actively exploring possible solutions to protect the interest of its stakeholders” Beike said Thursday in a release. “The company will continue to comply with applicable laws and regulations in both China and the US and strive to maintain its listing status on the New York Stock Exchange.”

Held to Account

According to the SEC the records of the companies on the watch list including Ke Holdings cannot be inspected or investigated completely by the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board due to a position taken by an authority in a foreign jurisdiction.

The companies identified under the US rules are primarily Chinese concerns including big names like internet company Sohu cafe chain Luckin Coffee wealth management firm Noah Holdings and Hong Kong-based casino operator Melco Resorts & Entertainment led by Lawrence Ho.

Beike which owns the Lianjia property agency in China and the Ke.com property listing website saw its accounting come under the microscope last December when Muddy Waters Research issued a report accusing the company of “systemic fraud” and “massive discrepancies” in its financial statements.

Among other disparities US-based Muddy Waters alleged a 126 percent inflation of the number of new home sales handled through Beike’s platform a metric that forms the primary basis for the company’s revenues. The investment firm has been short-selling Beike’s shares which are down about 35 percent since the report.

Beike issued a statement at the time portraying the Muddy Waters report as without merit and riddled with factual errors unsubstantiated statements and misleading speculations and interpretations that showed “a lack of basic understanding of the housing transactions industry in China”.

But the firm founded by Carson Block has been on target before making a name for itself by exposing fraud at since-bankrupt Chinese firms like Luckin Coffee Sino-Forest and NQ Mobile while shorting their stocks.

Fending Off Legal Action

Beike filed its annual report for 2021 with little fanfare earlier this week. In the document Beike acknowledged that a US class-action lawsuit had been filed against the company in late December with the plaintiffs seeking damages as a result of alleged misstatements and omissions in Beike’s SEC filings and public disclosure documents.

“We intend to vigorously defend ourselves against this and any related litigation” Beike said in a filing with the SEC.

The firm founded by the late Zuo Hui posted 2021 revenue of RMB 80.8 billion ($12.7 billion) up 14.6 percent year-on-year and a net loss of RMB 524.8 million ($82.3 million) backsliding from a net profit of RMB 2.8 billion in 2020.

Last September Reuters reported that Beike was planning a Hong Kong stock listing and had gone so far as to hire Goldman Sachs to lead a float but the company denied having an “imminent plan” for an HKEX listing or any share sale.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9lY29ub215LXBvbGljeS9ldi1hZG9wdGlvbi1saWtlbHktdG8tc3RlbS1mb3JlaWduLWV4Y2hhbmdlLW91dGdvLW9uLW9pbC1pbXBvcnRzLTEyMjA0MjIwMTQwNV8xLmh0bWzSAZEBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3Mtc3RhbmRhcmQuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlL2Vjb25vbXktcG9saWN5L2V2LWFkb3B0aW9uLWxpa2VseS10by1zdGVtLWZvcmVpZ24tZXhjaGFuZ2Utb3V0Z28tb24tb2lsLWltcG9ydHMtMTIyMDQyMjAxNDA1XzEuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EV adoption likely to stem foreign exchange outgo on oil imports,"The sharp increase in imported fuel prices could well speed up the day when the overall foreign exchange outflow on an electric car powered by a 30 kWh lithium ion battery will be equal to or below that of an internal combustion engines (ICE) car of the same model.

Strategic divestitures and cost management reflect a proactive approach to market challenges.

Legal and regulatory hurdles pose potential risks to IFF's operational stability.

Investment in R&D and productivity gains signal a commitment to innovation and efficiency.

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (NYSE:IFF) a global leader in specialty ingredients production has recently disclosed its financial performance for the first quarter of 2024. Despite a slight decrease in net sales from $3.027 billion to $2.899 billion the company has shown an impressive increase in gross profit from $964 million to $1.024 billion indicating effective cost management and operational efficiency. As we delve into a SWOT analysis of IFF we'll explore the company's internal dynamics and external market conditions that could influence its strategic decisions and future growth.

Beyond the Balance Sheet: What SWOT Reveals About International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (IFF)

Strengths

Robust Gross Profit Margin Improvement: IFF's ability to increase its gross profit margin from 31.8% to 35.3% amidst a sales decline is a testament to its strong operational management. This improvement suggests that IFF has effectively controlled its cost of goods sold which decreased significantly by $188 million and has optimized its manufacturing processes to enhance profitability.

Strategic Divestitures and Portfolio Optimization: The company's strategic decision to divest certain business units such as the Savory Solutions and Flavor Specialty Ingredients (FSI) businesses reflects a focused approach to streamline operations and concentrate on core growth areas. These divestitures while impacting sales have allowed IFF to reallocate resources and reduce associated costs positioning it for more targeted growth.

Investment in Research and Development: IFF's commitment to innovation is evident in its increased R&D expenses which rose to $166 million. This investment is crucial for the company to maintain its competitive edge by developing new and improved products thereby ensuring long-term sustainability in a rapidly evolving industry.

Weaknesses

Dependence on Global Economic Conditions: IFF's performance is closely tied to global economic trends as seen in the impact of unfavorable exchange rates on its sales. The company's reliance on international markets exposes it to currency fluctuations and economic volatility which can affect its financial results.

Increased Selling and Administrative Expenses: The rise in S&A expenses to $490 million primarily due to higher legal fees and professional consulting costs indicates potential inefficiencies and increased overheads. These expenses if not carefully managed could erode the company's profitability over time.

Story continues

Legal and Regulatory Challenges: IFF faces ongoing legal proceedings and regulatory investigations such as the antitrust investigations into its fragrance businesses. These issues not only incur additional costs but also pose reputational risks and could lead to significant financial penalties.

Opportunities

Productivity Gains and Favorable Net Pricing: IFF has demonstrated the ability to achieve productivity gains and secure favorable net pricing as reflected in the increased Segment Adjusted Operating EBITDA for its Nourish and Scent segments. These achievements provide an opportunity for IFF to further enhance its operational efficiency and pricing strategies to boost profitability.

Focus on Health & Biosciences: The Health & Biosciences segment showed a sales increase indicating strong market demand for biotechnology-derived products. IFF's position in this segment offers significant growth potential particularly in the areas of probiotics enzymes and specialty ingredients which are increasingly sought after in the health and wellness markets.

Emerging Markets Expansion: With sales to Israeli and Russian customers representing a small percentage of total sales there is an opportunity for IFF to expand its presence in emerging markets. By leveraging its global footprint and diverse product portfolio IFF can tap into new customer bases and drive sales growth.

Threats

Competitive Industry Landscape: IFF operates in a highly competitive industry where innovation and customer preferences rapidly evolve. The company must continuously adapt to maintain its market position against competitors who may offer more innovative or cost-effective solutions.

Regulatory and Compliance Risks: The complexity of operating in multiple jurisdictions brings about various regulatory challenges. IFF's involvement in legal disputes and the necessity to comply with diverse regulations can lead to increased compliance costs and potential disruptions to its business operations.

Global Economic Uncertainties: Macroeconomic factors such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the potential impacts of the Israel-Hamas war could disrupt IFF's supply chains and affect its sales. The company must navigate these uncertainties while managing the risks associated with its international operations.

In conclusion International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (NYSE:IFF) exhibits a strong financial foundation with improved gross profit margins and strategic portfolio management. However the company must address its increased S&A expenses and navigate legal and regulatory complexities. Opportunities for growth lie in its Health & Biosciences segment and potential expansion into emerging markets. Nevertheless IFF must remain vigilant against competitive pressures and global economic uncertainties that pose threats to its operational stability. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses IFF can capitalize on opportunities and mitigate threats positioning itself for continued success in the specialty ingredients industry.

Positive Points

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (IFF Financial) achieved volume growth for the first time since Q1 2022 with mid-single digit growth in Q1 2024 driven by strong contributions from Scent Nourish and Health & Biosciences segments.

Negative Points

Despite positive volume growth the company noted that pricing was modestly positive and would have been negative without FX-related pricing benefits indicating underlying challenges in pricing power.

The company's Pharma Solutions segment experienced lower volumes due to ongoing destocking trends which could impact short-term performance until the completion of its divestiture.

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (IFF) reported a negative free cash flow of $19 million in Q1 2024 although it was an improvement from the previous year highlighting ongoing challenges in cash flow generation.

What happens next now that it's pulled out?,"Following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine multinational companies have withdrawn from Russia in staggering numbers.

As of April 22 more than 700 U.S. companies have scaled back suspended or exited their Russian businesses including Starbucks McDonald's and Pepsi according to the Yale School of Management.

Russia is Pepsi's second-largest international market after Mexico. The company generated $3.4 billion in Russia in 2021 about 4% of its $79 billion in revenue.

But not every company is scaling back its operations in Russia. Over 190 companies including International Paper and Emirates are still operating normally in the country.

So what led to Pepsi's decision to pull back in Russia and how likely is it for the soft-drink maker to resume normal operations after the conflict is no longer in the spotlight?

The DSA includes new rules that will require Big Tech platforms – including Facebook and Instagram (owned by Meta) and YouTube (owned by Google) – to assess and manage systemic risks posed by their services such as advocacy of hatred and the spread of disinformation.

For the first time Big Tech companies will also need to submit to independent yearly audits and to give regulators and third-party researchers including civil society access to platform data and insights into their algorithmic ‘black boxes’ to ensure greater scrutiny and accountability.

The DSA moves us towards an online world that better respects our human rights by effectively putting the brakes on Big Tech’s unchecked power Claudia Prettner Legal and Policy Adviser at Amnesty Tech

“Today’s agreement on the Digital Services Act represents a watershed moment in the history of Internet regulation. The DSA moves us towards an online world that better respects our human rights by effectively putting the brakes on Big Tech’s unchecked power” said Claudia Prettner Legal and Policy Adviser at Amnesty Tech.

“For too long our most intimate data has been weaponized to undermine our right to privacy amplify disinformation fuel racism and even influence our own beliefs and opinions. The DSA will finally protect EU citizens from intrusive data harvesting and ads that use personal information – such as religious beliefs political opinion or sexual preferences – in ways we would have never expected or wanted.

“It is a missed opportunity that the DSA did not go further and phase out all invasive surveillance-based advertising practices to truly uphold people’s rights to privacy data protection and non-discrimination.

“It is now crucial that the DSA is robustly enforced so that it does not turn into a mere paper tiger. It is also vital that other jurisdictions around the world follow suit and adopt strong laws to further protect people from the harms caused by Big Tech’s surveillance-based business models.”

By taking a systemic approach to tackling abuses the DSA will help in protecting core human values – dignity autonomy and privacy – in the digital age. It marks a first step towards overhauling Big Tech’s dominant profit-led surveillance-based business model to one that must finally mitigate human rights risks.

Amnesty International welcomes that the DSA will now require major platforms to consider how their algorithmic systems advertising models and data practices contribute to systemic risks and adapt their systems and processes accordingly where flaws are identified.

The DSA will also ensure people now have the right to choose how content is presented to them in their newsfeeds; for example by choosing chronological order instead of algorithmic profiling that is tuned to maximize and maintain engagement.

Background

The Digital Services Act was proposed by the European Commission on 15 December 2020 to upgrade rules governing digital services in the EU. Amnesty International has campaigned and advocated for the legislation to ensure adequate protection of people’s human rights online.

Following discussions and months of advocacy and campaigning from civil society negotiators from the European Parliament the French Presidency of the Council of the EU and the European Commission today reached an agreement on the DSA.

Although the final text of the law has not yet been released the deal includes key provisions fought for by civil society despite unprecedented lobbying efforts by tech companies.

In a poll published by Amnesty International and Global Witness earlier this year small business leaders in France and Germany said they wanted alternatives to Facebook and Google’s dominant tracking-based advertising.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9jb250YWluZXJib2FyZC1tYXJrZXQtd29ydGgtdXNkLTE1My0wNjE5MDA2MDAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Containerboard Market to Worth USD 153.51 Billion by 2029 | Containerboard Industry CAGR of 2.4% by (2022-2029),"Fortune Business Insights

Author and Islamic scholar Nelly Lahoud told 60 Minutes correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi that bin Laden who had a degree in civil engineering explained exactly how to do it in a 2004 letter.

""He wanted to have 12 meters of steel rail removed so that this way the train could be derailed. And we find him explaining the simple toolkit that they could use"" Lahoud said. ""You know he said 'You could use a compressor. You could use a smelting iron tool.'""

Fortunately he was never able to execute his plan.

According to Lahoud who analyzed thousands of pages of the documents al Qaeda had been gutted by the war. After 9/11 bin Laden went on the run and didn't communicate with al Qaeda associates for three years during which time top leaders were killed or forced into hiding - rendering the terrorist organization rudderless.

She read a letter from Tawfiq a young associate who was running operations for al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan. He told bin Laden just how incapacitated the terror organization had become.

""The weakness failure and aimlessness that befell us were harrowing"" Tawfiq wrote. ""We Muslims were defiled and desecrated. Our state was ripped asunder our lands were occupied our resources were plundered.""

Lahoud said the letter shows bin Laden didn't realize the weakened state of al Qaeda.

""And [Tawfiq] actually warns him that 'I'm gonna tell you the truth as it is. And I know that some of the brothers here are not telling you everything in detail because they don't want to upset you particularly because of the delicate situations in which you find yourself with'"" Lahoud said.

That delicate situation was bin Laden's life in hiding.

Al Qaeda was also running low on cash. Documents showed that in 2006 al Aaeda had just $200000 in its coffers and was unable to support or control an increasingly fractious jihad Lahoud said.

Still bin Laden kept plotting Lahoud told Alfonsi. She showed 60 Minutes a letter that laid out his plan for another terror attack in 2010. This time he wanted to target multiple crude oil tankers and major shipping routes around the Middle East and Africa.

""He says 'It does not escape you the importance of oil for industrialized economy today. And it is similar to blood for human beings. So if you cause somebody to bleed excessively even if you don't kill him you will at least weaken him.' And that's-- he really-- what he really wanted to do to the American economy"" Lahoud said.

She said bin Laden detailed how al Qaeda operatives should integrate themselves into those port areas as fishermen. He instructed them exactly where to buy a specific kind of wooden boat to evade radar and then went into the granular details of his plan.

""The boats need to carry a large volume of explosives preferably placed in an arch position facing the vessel"" the letter read.

But his final plan to attack seems to have been halted by something he never saw coming the Arab Spring. According to a family notebook a unique item seized in the raid the peaceful protests were confusing and concerning to the bin Ladens.

""On one level they were very excited by the fact that the people were able to bring down dictators"" Lahoud said. ""But at the same time there were all these question marks about 'What is the value of jihad at the moment?' And we find this really throughout this notebook. Is jihad still necessary?""'

Lahoud said bin Laden was struggling with the answer to that question before he was killed."

These homeowners are fighting back.,"In the Potters Glen neighborhood of Charlotte residents have seen a rise in corporate-owned homes going for rent. MUST CREDIT: Photo by Travis Dove for The Washington Post.

Charlotte N.C. — Her 3-bedroom 2-bath house with vinyl siding had never attracted so many admirers. Every week the mail brought more postcard offers: Sell now! Will buy as is! Everyone in the neighborhood was getting them.

To Valerie Hamilton then president of the Potters Glen Homeowners Association it didn't sit right. Already more than 20 homeowners in her Charlotte neighborhood had sold out to investors and their houses had been quickly converted to rentals.

""We were being bombarded"" Hamilton said.

Like hundreds of communities across the United States Hamilton's neighborhood had become the target of large companies amassing empires of suburban homes for rent. Since the Great Recession when millions of Americans lost their homes to foreclosure these companies have been expanding their portfolios of tens of thousands of single-family houses a disproportionate number of them located in majority-Black neighborhoods like Potters Glen.

The rise of investor purchases has spawned complaints that the companies flush with Wall Street money are pricing out first-time home buyers and renting to tenants who have not been properly screened. In Potters Glen one house owned by Invitation Homes a $24 billion company created by a Wall Street firm drew several reports of illegal drugs and gunfire according to police reports and neighbors.

Facing the influx Hamilton started asking: ""Can't we stop them?""

The answer it turns out appears to be yes.

Using the same legal authority that allows homeowners associations to punish people who fail to cut their grass the Potters Glen board erected a hurdle for investors: a new rule required any new home buyer to wait two years before renting it out.

Since the board adopted the rule in 2019 property records show the pace of investor purchases has dropped by more than half.

""We didn't want to become a renter's paradise"" said Hamilton a retired executive assistant from Ohio. ""We want people who are going to plant flowers and trees because it's their home.""

As neighborhoods in several states have moved to adopt similar rules advocates for rental home companies argue that the restrictions make housing less affordable. They say rental exclusions also can be discriminatory echoing a past when real estate restrictions were used to keep out racial minorities and have asked state legislatures in Florida Georgia and Tennessee as well as North Carolina to protect them from such restrictions.

""Preventing single-family rental home companies — of any size — from purchasing homes in a community does nothing but reduce the availability of affordably priced rental housing"" said David Howard executive director of the National Rental Home Council.

Invitation Homes one of several big firms that own houses in Potters Glen called the rental restrictions ""prejudicial discriminatory uninformed and misaligned with the concept of fair housing."" The company said it was ""disheartened by the trend of HOAs (homeowners associations) determining that renters are not welcome in their neighborhoods.""

Of the house in Potters Glen where neighbors had reported gunfire Invitation Homes said it had used a reputable third-party screening company to vet the adult tenants — and that it eventually asked them to leave.

Hamilton scoffed at the idea that the new rules discriminate against renters arguing that the board has the right to encourage homeowners to live in the community.

""Don't get me wrong — there are some very good renters in this neighborhood"" she said. ""But people who own their homes usually take more pride in their property and we wanted to make sure we keep a place for them.""

As investors have targeted the American suburbs faraway companies have begun to take over entire blocks. Last year investors bought nearly 1 in 7 homes sold in the nation's top metropolitan areas — the most in two decades of record-keeping according to a Washington Post analysis of data from realty company Redfin.

In Charlotte and elsewhere according to The Post's analysis investors have purchased a disproportionate number of homes in neighborhoods where a majority of residents are Black. Last year 30% of home sales in majority Black neighborhoods across the nation were to investors compared with 12% in other Zip codes The Post's analysis shows.

In Charlotte and surrounding Mecklenburg County landlords backed by Wall Street own roughly 11500 houses — more than 4% of single family homes according to an analysis last year by the University of North Carolina at Charlotte Urban Institute. Most of the houses are in the starter home price range ""likely putting the most pressure on the lower end of the market"" said the institute's Ely Portillo.

Most of those purchases were made by one of six major out-of-state companies: Progress Residential American Homes 4 Rent and Invitation Homes each owned more than 2000 homes according to the Urban Institute analysis while Tricon Amherst Residential and FirstKey each had more than 1000 homes.

Faced with this surge of corporate landlords many homeowners associations have begun to fight back.

At the Reserve at Back Creek a subdivision of 39 houses near UNC-Charlotte neighbors last year adopted a rule requiring an owner to live in a house for a year before renting it out. No more than 18% of the houses can be approved for rental at any time.

""Our main concern was with the faceless investment groups who were buying the homes more than just the renters"" said Justin Kerner 41 a former association board member. ""If we're sending a notice about garbage on the lawn to a company in Las Vegas it's going to end up on the desk of someone who doesn't care what the neighborhood looks like.""

At Avalon at Mallard Creek a community of 110 townhouses not far from Potters Glen a shooting last year that damaged several properties prompted the neighborhood to impose a one-year waiting period on rentals and cap them at 40% of units. They also required leases to be approved by the homeowners association board which can reject a rental agreement based on investigative background reports.

""Six homes had bullet holes"" said Keri Miller the homeowners association treasurer. The shooting which involved outsiders targeting a tenant in a rental Miller said made her not only fearful but angry that the association had to pay for the repairs.

""Our gate was broken. We had all this traffic coming in and there was this shootout"" Miller recalled. ""At this point I said 'This has to stop.'""

Since the new rules took effect some investors have sold their properties Miller said. The homeowners association has organized monthly neighborhood cleanups and property values have risen she said.

""It's working"" she said.

Restricting rentals is not always easy. Charlotte attorney Mike Hunter said homeowners associations come to him about once a week asking for advice. Some like Potters Glen are worried about long-term corporate leases while others want to curtail short-term rentals offered by companies like Airbnb and VRBO.

In North Carolina Hunter said at least 67% of homeowners in a community typically must approve new rules and reaching that threshold can be a challenge.

""There can often be a lot of apathy in neighborhoods. A lot of people don't even bother to return the ballots"" he said. ""But if the rental properties are causing a lot of problems it's much more likely that residents will rally and approve restrictions.""

The going initially was slow in Potters Glen. The homeowners association board seemed desperate for members when Hamilton moved from Ohio in 2015. A year later she was board president.

She was in a way a natural pick. Formerly the executive assistant to the city manager of Middletown Ohio Hamilton knew her way around meetings boards and votes.

""I'm a meticulous person. I believe in order"" she said.

Walking out her front door one February afternoon she shook her head at lawn equipment littering the yard of a nearby home a corporate rental.

""It irritates me every time I set foot outside"" she said ""There's so much clutter. So ... unkempt.""

The idea for rental restrictions rose during an all-day board meeting in 2018. Gathered at a local Holiday Inn Hamilton asked board members how to improve the neighborhood. They considered among other things whether to prohibit chain-link fences whether sex offenders and other felons should be allowed in and whether residents should be permitted to keep pit bulls and Rottweilers breeds previously forbidden.

But the main topic was renters. The 280 houses of Potters Glen most of them built in the early 2000s are conveniently located between Uptown Charlotte and the UNC-Charlotte campus. Investors were flocking to their neighborhood.

""I'd never heard of these companies who wanted to buy in all of a sudden"" said Andrea Turner a board member who worked with Hamilton to pass the rules. ""We looked them up and realized they weren't from Charlotte. We wondered: What do they want with us?""

So along with the ideas about the Rottweilers and felons the board had a lawyer draft the rental restrictions and put up them up for a vote. They were not immediately popular.

""People didn't like the idea at first. Some were worried that they wouldn't be able to rent their properties"" Hamilton said. ""But we assured them that the rental restrictions would not apply to the owners at the time.""

After three community meetings Hamilton and Turner won the neighborhood over and more than three-fourths of the community voted for the rental restrictions.

""People realized we couldn't just become a community of renters"" Hamilton said. ""These are our homes. We had too much to lose.""

The trouble with some rental homes persisted however. In the spring of 2020 multiple police visits to the Invitation Homes property prompted Hamilton to write a letter to company CEO Dallas Tanner demanding more intensive screening.

""Would you want to live next door to lawless people?"" she wrote. ""I must express my disappointment. ... This home has been a problem where the (police department) has been called out on several occasions.""

Invitation Homes did not renew the renters' lease but it didn't immediately kick them out. In a statement the company said that the incident in May 2020 ""involved minors"" and that the company notified the adult tenant that the lease would not be renewed when it expired a few months later.

Before the lease expired however police visited the block twice more once after a drive-by shooting at the house in August according to police reports. After that incident the company said it asked the tenants to leave.

""When the shooting occurred in August we asked the resident to vacate the home which they did"" the company said.

The rental restrictions have slowed the pace of investor purchases in Potters Glen however. In each of the three years before the rental limits investment groups purchased about 12 homes in the subdivision. Since then the pace has slowed to about four per year according to property records.

Companies affiliated with some of the nation's big rental firms have continued to purchase homes at Potters Glen according to property records. Invitation Homes bought one in September 2020 about a year after the rental limits went into effect. The company said that the ""neighborhood restriction was not noted in our system.""

Amherst bought one too. In a statement the company said it aims to work collaboratively with homeowners associations and that ""it does not appear this waiting period was communicated (to us) in documentation related to purchase of this home.""

Hamilton meanwhile recently learned that spurning investors can come with a cost.

After completing her term as board president she put her home up for sale. She and her husband had moved to Charlotte to help her daughter raise their grandchildren. Now it was time now to go back to Ohio where she has family.

Adamant that she would not sell to rental companies Hamilton added a line to the real estate listing for her home: ""Per seller investors will not be considered!""

Investors tried anyway deluging her real estate agent with calls. The Hamiltons received seven bids offering all-cash payment according to her agent Andre Dockery. But they took the one that came with a personal letter.

""Thank you for the opportunity to make an offer on your beautiful home"" began the letter from a teacher working at a local school who had two kids ages 9 and 3. The 9-year-old already had claimed rights to a purple bedroom.

The teacher's offer was $13000 less than the investors' highest offer. But Hamilton said ""She touched my heart.""

Is the price going up down or sideways? Simple enough. But looking at something in isolation only reveals part of the story. If a bank is down 20% from its highs but the rest of the bank sector is down 40% you would call this a relative winner.

Look at a chart of the FANMAG stocks and you’ll see that they peaked in November 2021 and have given up all of their gains back to September 2020. But once you compare the tech giants to the S&P 500 an entirely new image emerges. You can see that their relative performance peaked in July 2020 and all of their outperformance since the summer of 2018 has vanished.

There are two different markets right now; Companies that got the benefit of low rates versus companies that can handle rising rates. It’s all one trade and the simplest visual to express this trade is short duration bonds versus long ones.

Short-term rates have risen more and faster than long ones but the latter is more sensitive to them. This is why long-term bonds can see a fraction of the rate increase and four times the destruction as shorter-term ones. 3-7 year bonds are in a 10% drawdown while zero-coupon bonds are down 36% from their highs.

And this is what’s driving the market. When rates rise and inflation is high investors are more sensitive to earnings today versus the potential of great earnings in the future. That’s why long-duration stocks are getting killed while cash-flow rich companies are holding up okay.

Nobody has time for disruptive technology during uncertain times when the incumbents are tried and true. We roughly know what JPMorgan is going to do and look like in the next couple of years whether or not a recession comes. Buy now pay later is cool and all but the business model is unproven and investors aren’t willing to subsidize losses when money actually costs something.

Here’s more of the same.

IBM might not be growing like it used to but it still generated >$8 billion in free cash flow last quarter with $700 million hitting the bottom line. Robinhood burned through $400 million in cash and lost nearly $1 billion. Investors are like “Umm yeah we’re not doing that anymore.”

In an inflationary environment consumers and investors value physical items. CF Industries one of the largest producers of fertilizers is up 36% on the year. Facebook I mean Meta is down 45%.

One of the areas of the market that’s most sensitive to rising rates is homebuilder stocks. While they’re down 20 and 30% build-to-rent names like Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent are basically flat on the year. Absolute duds but relative home runs.

On the podcast this week I spoke about how Disney was flat since 2015. I know the challenges that Disney has gone through and continues to struggle with but seven years of no returns really blew my mind. And then I saw Jim Bianco tweet this and my head almost exploded. Disney has underperformed the S&P 500 since the inception of SPY (1993) and basically on every other time frame as well.

Some people might see this and say “This is why you shouldn’t pick individual stocks.” I get that and I mostly agree. Disney is one of the most iconic companies in the world and even that wasn’t good enough to beat the index. But for me the more salient point is to diversify. Don’t put all of your eggs in one basket. It’s okay to buy actively managed mutual funds but I wouldn’t recommend putting your entire net worth in three or four stocks.

The market isn’t fun right now and it’s all being driven by interest rates inflation and the fear of a slowing economy. That’s the bad news. The good news and I’m admittedly reaching here is that a lot of stocks already got pancaked. Meanwhile nobody is bullish and good things tend to happen when most investors think they can’t.

Next week is a huge one for earnings which certainly feels like a make-or-break moment for the markets. We’ll hear from Google Facebook Microsoft Apple and Amazon as well as D.R. Horton and Chipotle and Caterpillar. If you want to listen to earnings calls like a podcast check out the Quartr App it’s terrific. Slides embedded in the app 1.5x speed skip to Q&A fuhgeddaboutit.

Over the past several months Tom Wender and a crew of volunteers have been transforming the century-old Pine Creek School into a space where locals can utilize woodworking equipment and learn about the trade.

An open house for Pine Creek Woodworking is planned from 2 to 4 p.m. Sunday May 1.

“I would like the community to come out and see how far we have come” said Wender a former industrial trades instructor. “This has been done with a lot of hard work.”

The majority of the construction of the 1200-square-foot interior has been completed with the exception of a few minor finishes.

“We still have some painting and need to install the handrails for the steps which will all be done prior to the open house” Wender said.

The full basement has also seen a lot of work. “Every bit of space will be utilized” he added as the lower level houses the heating unit dust collection system and equipment room.

Wender said he’s pleased with how the space has developed including being able to restore a lot of the original woodwork.

A local resident volunteered his time refinishing all the old window trim. “Those pieces went back up the way it came off — I never had to cut one piece” Wender said.

The work benches are another special touch as they were all built by volunteers. “They are all made by different species of wood and their own designs” he noted.

Many of the finishes in Pine Creek Woodworking are pieces Wender repurposed from the farm including reclaimed tin from an old barn and a copper sink that was his grandmother’s wash tub. “I just took it and modified it for the space in the shop” Wender said. “It’s just a neat piece.”

They still haven’t bought a single board and don’t plan to Wender stressed. “So far everyone has been so generous” he said. “We also haven’t had to pay for a dime of labor — we have some great volunteers.”

Work on the exterior will be done throughout the summer. Funds for the projects completed to date — including landscaping painting and installing a ramp for handicapped accessibility — have been donated.

Wender said they hope to be up and running by January. But to operate they have to have money for machinery.

“At the point we still need at least $50000 to purchase the equipment” Wender said. “We need everything to be up-to-date for safety reasons.”

Along with the monetary donations they hope to be able to obtain grants.

Wender said he continues to get positive responses and already has 17 volunteers who have committed to teach classes and help supervise the shop. “They are all either retired contractors or teachers and good around equipment” he added.

A Facebook page for Pine Creek Woodworking will eventually be established to keep the community informed of classes and activities.

While the nonprofit plans to first focus on seniors and veterans the facility will be available to anyone interested in woodworking.

“Everyone is getting excited as we see it all coming together” Wender said.

The competition was held on Thursday March 30 and Friday April 1 in Washington D.C.

The group included: Michelle Abramson (Iron Mountain) Nicholas Belka (Hopkins) Zachary Bemben (Grand Rapids) Dylan Dankenbring (Peck) and John Vary (Plymouth). The team’s advisor was Bob Burtch adjunct instructor of Surveying Engineering.

“The exercises our students faced were developed by the Young Surveyors Network within the National Society” said Burtch. “Our team showed great initiative that first day by choosing to secure bicycles for a surveying monument scavenger hunt. They felt this approach would yield better results than the Metro light rail system and then walking to the desired monument. It turned out they made an excellent choice.”

On the first day of the competition the students were able to locate all the markers by traveling approximately 25 miles point-to-point. This put them in the lead of 12 teams.

On the second day teams were asked to triangulate to an unknown control point. The Ferris students used the top of the Washington Monument and a monument near the World War II Memorial. The competition also included a three-level wiring exercise. It also featured completing a traverse using a compass and chain. In the 1800s this was the method used in land surveys.

“Our team had great preparation having practiced with some of the equipment” said Burtch. “The accuracy of the student’s work solidified their lead in the competition.”

Around 7 p.m. authorities received a report of a fire near State Route 14 about five miles east of Cedar City. When police and fire crews responded they found the burning remains of a Diamond DA-40 single-engine aircraft.

The plane had flown from the Spanish Fork Municipal Airport to the Cedar Regional Airport Saturday afternoon according to the Iron County Sheriff's Office. The group then took off at 6:38 p.m. for a sightseeing tour of Zion National Park and was flying east along SR-14 but radar communication was lost four minutes later.

“It appears that they tried to get turned around and were flying back west when their wing clipped a tree and caused them to go into the side of the mountain” said Iron County Sheriff Ken Carpenter.

The sheriff’s office said there was no distress call made before the crash.

Four people were on board and they were all pronounced dead at the scene.

Officials identified the victims as Steven Eatchel of Springville Lindsay Eatchel of Springville Thomas Eatchel of Heber City and Danielle Deagostini of Sandy.

Steven Eatchel the pilot was a deputy with the Utah County Sheriff’s Office. He worked in the county courts and had been with the sheriff’s office since 2010.

“It starts to sink in a little bit” said UCSO Sgt. Spencer Cannon. “It almost seems unreal.”

Steven and Lindsay Eatchel were married and they leave behind four children.

“He was a genuinely kind person. He had a perpetual smile on his face you know?” said Cannon.

Thomas Eatchel and Steven Eatchel were brothers according to the family and Danielle Deagostini was Thomas Eatchel's girlfriend. They had stopped to visit family in Cedar City before taking off again and crashing just minutes later.

Carpenter said it was especially difficult for responders once they learned Steven Eatchel was a fellow deputy.

“That really kind of brings it home to us"" he said. ""This is a family here in Cedar City who was affected and it’s a member of our law enforcement family.""

Investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration landed in Cedar City Sunday to investigate the cause of the crash.

“I think what we’re all reaching for when we talk to somebody in a circumstance like this is an answer to questions that’s going to make it all go away and that’s not going to happen” said Cannon.

Shelley Simpson chief commercial officer of the US trucking giant JB Hunt told investors on an April 21 earnings call that supply chains have experienced “a temporary relief” from shipping delays and labor shortages since last year.

But risks loom: West Coast port workers are bargaining for a new union contract which could lead to strikes if negotiations fall through. And covid-lockdown related delays in Shanghai home to the world’s busiest container port could extend the high shipping prices and product shortages that plagued the global economy in 2021.

“That certainly is going to make its way back into the US here this summer” said Simpson. “It just takes a little bit of disruption to really change the environment all over again.”

Last year’s supply chain crisis was the result of a series of smaller disruptions including covid-related lockdowns at the Chinese ports of Yantian and Ningbo and a stuck ship blocking the Suez Canal. The Shanghai lockdown could set the overall recovery back extending the economic pain into the middle of the year.

Ships idle in the Port of Shanghai

Shanghai is in the grips of its worst covid outbreak since the start of the pandemic. Authorities have responded by enforcing a city-wide lockdown that has kept most residents confined to their homes but they have tried to limit disruptions by requiring workers to sleep at the port in a “closed loop” bubble.

Even so ships are being loaded and unloaded more slowly. The volume of goods shipped out of Shanghai fell 23% between March 12 the day before partial lockdowns began in Shanghai and April 16.

JB Hunt expects the delays that Shanghai is experiencing today to spread to the US West Coast by July. “We do forecast that to get a lot worse as we come into the summer months particularly with what’s happening in the supply chain from an ocean perspective or in China coming inbound” Simpson said. “We have had a lot of customers talk to us about that.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyL2Fwci8yMy9ob2ctZC1saW5lLWNvYWNoLWRla2UtYWRhbXMtaW1wcmVzc2VzLTQtc3Rhci1kZWZlbnNpdmUtbGluZW1hbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deke Adams impresses 4-star D-lineman,"Arkansas defensive line coach Deke Adams made quite an impression on a 4-star defensive lineman during his visit to Fayetteville on Saturday.

Jamarious Brown 6-3 280 of Moss Point Miss. has visited Alabama Auburn Ole Miss Souther Miss and Florida State.

“It was great. Coach Adams made everything sweet” Brown said. “He made everything understandable. He broke down…the playing time if I was to come here. He broke down like film practice. He broke down a lot of stuff.”

He couldn’t pinpoint just one highlight of the vist.

“There was a lot of highlights” he said. “Everything was good. I don’t know.”

He recorded 84 tackles 16 tackles for loss 5 sacks and 3 forced fumbles as a junior. He’s an On3.com 4-star prospect the No. 19 defensive lineman and No. 146 overall prospect nationally in the 2023 class.

Brown said he was blown away by what he heard during the trip.

“There’s just a lot of stuff I didn’t know” Brown said. “I learned a lot of stuff today like Tyson chicken JB Hunt Walmart.”

He praised the Arkansas facilities while saying he would probably make his way back to Fayetteville again.

Brown has offers from Arkansas Alabama Florida State Mississippi State Arizona State Auburn Ole Miss Florida State and other schools.

He also communicates with assistant defensive line coach Keith Jones. He felt a connection with Adams who is a Meridian Miss. native.

*GAAP revenue is comprised of services and support and processing revenues (see page 2). Reducing services and support revenue by deconversion revenue for the three months ended March 31 2024 and 2023 which was $843 for the current fiscal year quarter and $6143 for the prior fiscal year quarter results in non-GAAP adjusted services and support revenue growth of 6.4% quarter over quarter. There were no non-GAAP adjustments to processing revenue for the three months ended March 31 2024 and 2023. Reducing services and support revenue by deconversion revenue for the nine months ended March 31 2024 and 2023 which was $9861 for the current fiscal year-to-date period and $17042 for the prior fiscal year-to-date period and by $2 of revenue from acquisition in the current fiscal year-to-date period results in non-GAAP adjusted services and support revenue growth of 7.2% period over period. Reducing processing revenue by revenue from acquisition for the nine months ended March 31 2024 which was $1943 results in non-GAAP adjusted processing revenue growth of 8.5% year-to-date period over year-to-date period. **The VEDIP program expense for the nine months ended March 31 2024 was related to a Company voluntary separation program offered to certain eligible employees beginning in July 2023. ***Non-GAAP adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing non-GAAP adjusted operating income by non-GAAP adjusted revenue.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting in the United States. GAAP includes the standards conventions and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP we have provided certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted revenue adjusted operating income adjusted segment income adjusted cost of revenue adjusted operating expenses adjusted operating margin adjusted segment income margin non-GAAP earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (non-GAAP EBITDA) free cash flow return on invested capital (ROIC) and non-GAAP adjusted net income.

We believe non-GAAP financial measures help investors better understand the underlying fundamentals and true operations of our business. Adjusted revenue adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted segment income adjusted segment income margin adjusted cost of revenue adjusted operating expenses and adjusted net income eliminate one-time deconversion revenue and associated costs the effects of acquisitions and divestitures the VEDIP program expense and the gain on sale of assets net all of which management believes are not indicative of the Company's operating performance. Such adjustments give investors further insight into our performance. Non-GAAP EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to the Company before the effect of interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted for net income before the effect of interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization attributable to eliminated one-time deconversions acquisitions and divestitures the VEDIP program expense and the gain on sale of assets net. Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities less capitalized expenditures internal use software and capitalized software plus proceeds from the sale of assets. ROIC is defined as net income divided by average invested capital which is the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and stockholders' equity for a given period. Management believes that non-GAAP EBITDA is an important measure of the Company's overall operating performance and excludes certain costs and other transactions that management deems one time or non-operational in nature; free cash flow is useful to measure the funds generated in a given period that are available for debt service requirements and strategic capital decisions; and ROIC is a measure of the Company's allocation efficiency and effectiveness of its invested capital. For these reasons management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its assessment and management of the Company's performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable with calculations of similar measures for other companies.

Any non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to related GAAP measures are included.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.20% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1 1988 through April 1 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can and often do change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available pricing information was not collected or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties including but not limited to the issuer.

I am trying to understand how you went from being one of the most progressive innovative and inclusive superintendents in the history of Flagler County to a shill as one of two Florida senior chancellors of education for the single most regressive reactionary and frankly just plain mean state departments of education in the nation. Something isn’t adding up.

This isn’t the Jacob Oliva we knew unless you’ve placed a bet on Ron DeSantis becoming president and your next nameplate getting laminated in Washington. Even so: has your ambition become so primeval that you’re willing to make these Faustian bargains the way you have on covid safety measures on gender identity on sanitized civics and history and now degrading math textbooks for something as innocuous–if not provably useful–as their social-emotional learning content?

I remember one of your few big stumbles back when you were the principal at Flagler Palm Coast High School. You probably recall how you and Superintendent Janet Valentine at the time agreed to cancel the student production of “To Kill a Mockingbird” 12 years ago. Only one person had raised objections to the play in the community a clueless member of the Palm Coast City Council who’d objected to the play’s use of the n-word. He fabricated claims that it would be dangerous to stage the play even though the book was all over your high schools as standard reading and Harper Lee herself a few years earlier had written pridefully of Flagler County thanking Mary Ann Clark for making her novel the inaugural title in the annual Flagler Reads Together event. But you went along anyway.









I remember the deer-in-headlights look you had from the angry public reaction and the way Flagler County became a national laughing stock. I saw that look during the appeals committee meeting when you began to backtrack. You eventually made the right decision the play was staged there was applause and of course no trouble. The episode suggested you were not dogmatic. You could adapt and you prized diversity. You then quickly climbed up enriching the district’s pluralist approach along the way.

You were always political. You wouldn’t have gotten where you were–where you now are–without a little Machiavelli in you. Nobody does. But that’s not what defined you. The work the ideas the problem-solving narrowing achievement gaps raising scores imagining new opportunities out of nowhere like the computer-for-every-student initiative or the flagship programs: that’s what defined you. You even found a new way to recite the Pledge in a flagless pinch. That’s the Oliva we knew. An Oliva who’d have laughed at any intersection of education and ideology. It just didn’t seem to be your game.

And now this. It’s not so much the positions you defend. We all have a right to our beliefs even to our ideology. No one is asking you to be a liberal though you certainly were more of one when you were down here. The problem is your willingness to defend the indefensible to be Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran’s lackey more than his conscience.









You argued in court that mask mandates made no difference which was scientifically false. They may have made no significant difference among children because relatively few got sick. That’s a given. But children were carriers. The masks were intended to keep them from bringing death home to parents and grandparents which they did: The governor’s happy-faced graffiti on 74000 graves aside Florida’s numbers are dismal. You knew that. But you lawyered it in court. If your hands were callused from carrying Corcoran’s water the Zoom connection didn’t show it.

In Flagler you’d have never put up with anyone sanitizing history books of America’s more sinister past. Now you’re all in with the kind of nationalistic whitewashing Putin is inflicting on Russian students. Your department is endorsing a return to teaching history as selective hero-worship. “Yet what kind of history do you have if you leave out all the bad things?” the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. asked 30 years ago when he was worried the liberals were pushing too many feel-good tomes. The answer is simple: propaganda.

In your time here you were all about inclusion. Transgender issues were just then beginning to be discussed at school board association seminars but the local district’s focus was on acceptance by whatever means. Or am I remembering all those pastoral collegial school board meetings incorrectly? Now your department is pushing purposefully mercenary assaults on LGBTQ students to placate the evangelical wing of your party. You are defending outright harm and second-class status to a suicide-prone segment of the students you should be protecting and used to. Your department is throwing fuel on any fire it can.

Just last week your department pulled off that Orwellian ploy of throwing out dozens of math books from the list public schools could choose from on claims that they indoctrinated students with critical race theory or so-called social emotional learning. Four measly examples aside the department never showed how or why the books are a problem. Here was your department barely a few weeks ago touting transparency with school books–giving parents the right to examine every book every page every brochure–now hiding outright censorship behind the preposterous claim that these math books used in thousands of schools have proprietary information.

Claims that the books contain “critical race theory” are too laughable to entertain. But they do contain social-emotional learning which has been around for years has been proven to help raise test scores and resonates with common sense if not common decency.

The New York Times managed to analyze a lot of content from the books your department rejected finally giving us a glimpse of the horrors you’re protecting our kids from. Are you really telling us Jacob that a math book giving a child a little pointer about “disagreeing respectfully” with a wrong answer is indoctrination? That asking a young child to write a “math biography” maybe to reveal that math makes us a bit anxious somehow harms that child? (I wish I’d had the chance to do that in my day instead of trembling through math class.)

Do you really agree that as the governor so cynically put it math is not about feelings? That it’s a back-door to critical race theory as Chris Rufo the inquisitor who almost single-handedly fabricated the CRT hysteria now claims though it’s been made very clear that there’s no such thing as CRT in school textbooks? All this from a department that still now crams “character education” down our children’s throats though it’s nothing more than the bumper-sticker version of social-emotional learning?









How far will you go in defense of the unconscionable? It’s like you’ve transgressed from the Atticus Finch of the original Mockingbird for the Atticus Finch of Go Set a Watchman the atrocious sequel that should have never seen the light of day.

It was good to see you interview for the Miami-Dade superintendent job in January. You were clearly the best qualified by far. It was the perfect fit. But the fix was in. The school board wanted Jose Dortes all along. The Miami-Dade board did to you what the Flagler school board did to your competitors when you were named superintendent here in 2014 though they also had it in for you in Miami over that mask nonsense you’d imposed on them. But it told us that maybe you were looking for a way out of the state Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice.

I hope you are because if you weren’t so blinded by those whitewashed books your department is peddling across the state you’d know you’re on the wrong side of history. You’d recall the ordinary gravel you treaded on our campuses and the extraordinary students you touched before the Tallahassee junta’s echo chamber blew your compass.

The package I’ve been impatiently waiting for finally arrives: A cardboard box about as tall as your average Olympic gymnast. It’s covered in yellow packing tape stamped fragile and has a return address in a town in the Netherlands.

Inside this box is a thing of beauty—and absurdity. It’s a one-of-a-kind puzzle created just for me by one of the greatest puzzle makers in the world. It is almost surely the hardest puzzle ever to exist. But before I open the box let me tell you how the puzzle came to be and why I think it’s not a trivial pursuit.

To do that I’ll need to start with the Chinese ring puzzle. I was introduced to it by a puzzle collector named Wei Zhang who along with her husband Peter Rasmussen is famous in the puzzle community for having one of the world’s best collections of Chinese puzzles. Also called a “patience puzzle” the ring puzzle dates back about 2000 years at least in its simplest form. What particularly fascinates me about this kind of puzzle is that it’s recursive: It gets much much harder the more rings it has.

The goal is simple: remove a set of rings from a bar to which they’re attached. But the catch is that for each additional ring you have to make an exponentially greater number of moves. Solving a three-ring puzzle takes only five moves. But a six-ring puzzle takes 42 moves. A nine-ring puzzle takes 341 moves. This is because to remove the ninth ring you first have to repeat the entire process of removing the first ring the second ring the third ring and so on. Imagine if you had to run a marathon but at every additional mile you had to return to the starting line and repeat the entire sequence that got you there.

You see how many miles you have to run to get to even the third-mile marker? If I actually did the diagram for 26 miles the book this article is excerpted from would be taller than the Eiffel Tower. That’s a recursive pattern.

Turns out the ring puzzle has several cousins in the puzzle family tree. They are called “generation puzzles” because they take generations to solve. You’re supposed to pass them on to your kids who pass them on to their kids who pass them on to their kids and on and on.

I love this idea—the ambitious scope the connection to my descendants. I’ve always wanted an heirloom that I can hand to my sons on my deathbed. The closest I have is a blazer my grandfather gave me—it’s red-and-white checkered and could double as a tablecloth at an Italian bistro. It’s fraying and won’t last. But a generation puzzle? That would be perfect. It’d be an amazing reminder of the vastness of time. I recently interviewed a mathematician who told me that gazing at space made her feel like she was touching infinity. This would be my version of that.

But first I needed a collaborator. A friend suggested that I contact a man named Oskar van Deventer a Dutch puzzle creator. I’d often heard Oskar’s name dropped in puzzle circles. He’s considered one of the greats. He has made many famous puzzles including a fractal jigsaw and a Rubik’s-type cube with gears and cogs on the outside. (He also caused a minor kerfuffle when he posted a video of a penis-shaped puzzle a copy of which is now housed at the Kinsey Institute a sex-research center.)

I called Oskar in the Netherlands and asked him if he could create a generation puzzle for me. “Let me think about it” he said with a hint of a Dutch accent. “I don’t want to just create a big Chinese ring puzzle. That would be boring.”

A few days later Oskar emailed me a sketch. It looked like a cross between a Jenga tower a giant corkscrew and a girder from a skyscraper. The puzzle’s main wooden column was covered top to bottom with 55 interlocking wooden pegs which together trapped a black corkscrew rod inside. The goal was to turn the pegs in the proper order to remove the rod. But the catch was that you have to turn the pegs many many many many times.

The solver would start by twisting the bottommost couple of pegs in the proper sequence allowing the corkscrew to move an inch or so upward before it got stuck again. To pull the corkscrew out farther you would have to start over and repeat the sequence and then also add an additional sequence for the third peg. And so on until the 55th. It would be even more recursive than the Chinese ring puzzle: With every new level instead of doubling the number of moves required would go up by a factor of four. “We could call it ‘Jacobs’ Ladder’” Oskar said.

I was sold. “Would it break the record?” I asked.

“I don’t know if I can do that” he said. “But I can try.”

The current record for hardest-to-solve generation puzzle was a 65-ring Chinese puzzle owned by the collector Jerry Slocum. Solving it would take 18 quintillion moves. That’s a 1 followed by 19 zeros.

In the following weeks Oskar sent me updates. Things were not going well. He’d tried to 3-D-print the puzzle out of gold-colored plastic but it had melted and warped. He was worried it would be too big to ship to the United States. He had to take a week off to paint his house.

And then on a Friday morning I woke up to an email from Oskar. He had finished making the puzzle—and it worked. He had made a 55-pin Jacobs’ Ladder. Solving it would take 1.2 decillion moves (the number 1 followed by 33 digits). Written out that’s: 1298074214633706907132624082305023 moves.

We’d crushed the old record by 13 orders of magnitude. Oskar did some delightfully nerdy calculations on just how long it would take to solve this puzzle. If you were to twist one peg per second he explained the puzzle would take about 40 septillion years. By the time you solved it the sun would have long ago destroyed the Earth and burned out. In fact all light in the universe would have been extinguished. Only black holes would remain. Moreover Oskar said if only one atom were to rub off due to friction for each move it would erode before you could solve it.

On a summer day in our living room with my wife and three sons assembled I slice open the cardboard box. I pull out the Jacobs’ Ladder and put it on the floor. It’s about four feet tall. “One decillion moves to solve it” I say. “It’s impossible for our brains to conceive of how many that is.”

The Jacobs’ Ladder

Jacobs’ Ladder is a physical manifestation of so much of what I love about puzzles. Doing them can make us better thinkers—more creative and more incisive. Jacobs’ Ladder may not offer the same logical and creative challenges that cryptics or chess problems do but like all great puzzles it contains lessons about ingenuity fresh perspectives and optimism. And for me it has one more thing I value in puzzles: a meditative angle.

I’m terrible at just-sitting-and-breathing meditation but Jacobs’ Ladder will be my version of meditation. I’ll let my thoughts flow in and out of my brain as I calmly twist the pegs. And it will teach me to be okay with lack of closure. As the late Maki Kaji—widely known as the godfather of Sudoku—told me in 2020 puzzles are a journey. He rendered the experience in three symbols:

? → !

Kaji said that the key is to embrace the middle part the arrow the journey. Don’t be obsessed with endings and perfection.

“It’s about the journey not the destination!” my youngest son says rolling his eyes.

“Exactly!” I say. “Except without the eye-roll part.” I twist one of the plastic pegs. It doesn’t turn easily. It gives resistance like a cap on a soda bottle makes a soft clunking sound and then locks into place. I turn to my wife. “Okay it’s your turn.”

One by one each member of the family dutifully twists a peg. At least to me it feels like a sacred ritual like we are lighting the candles on a menorah or ringing bells in a temple. I pledge to turn a peg every day. Or at least every week. Maybe every month. But we will do it.

“We’re on our way” says my middle son.

It’s true. Only 1298074214633706907132624082305018 moves to go.

Marjorie Taylor Greene met for a second day at the Capitol on Tuesday political adversaries trying to engineer an off-ramp from the escalating standoff over her threat for a vote to oust him from office.

The stakes are high for both.

Republican Johnson is hoping to avoid a politically fraught outcome in which he would keep his job but only after relying on Democrats who have pledged their support to save him at least this time.

Greene a top ally of Donald Trump faces her own potentially embarrassing setback if her motion to vacate the speaker fizzles as is expected.

“Right now the ball is in Mike Johnson’s court” said Greene R-Ga. “I am so done with words. For me it’s all about actions.”

In a brazen move Greene has forced her way to the negotiating table and outlined four demands — including no more funding for Ukraine as it fights Russia and an end to the Justice Department special counsel’s legal cases against the indicted former president Trump.

Throughout Johnson has tried to portray himself six months on the job since the ouster of then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy as in control of the situation and not beholden to the hard-right forces that have created chaos throughout this session of Congress.

“Look they’ve been very productive discussions. that’s what I’ll say” Johnson R-La. said after Tuesday’s 90-minute meeting.

Johnson downplayed the idea that there was any deal to be made saying the meetings are simply part of his open-door policy to hear out the ideas of fellow Republican lawmakers as is his practice as the new leader.

“It’s not a negotiation” Johnson said.

But it’s clear whether or not Greene proceeds with her plan to call the vote this week — or lets the moment slip away — the threat of removal will trail the speaker’s tenure and force him to consider concessions to the far-right forces to keep members satisfied.

Greene said she had “high expectations” the speaker would deliver.

“This is what people all over the country are screaming for” Greene said Tuesday on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast. “They want to see this vote.”

Another hardline congressman Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky has joined in the meetings and warned Johnson not to draw out a decision.

“If his plan is to drag this out so the pressure comes off of this and to drag it out for weeks or days even without making some movement in our direction then he would just be far better off to have this vote and get it behind him” Massie said.

The effort to oust Johnson has been panned by Trump who gave his nod of support to the speaker and it has failed to gain traction among Republicans leaving Greene almost alone with just a few colleagues on her side.

But the demands Greene is making are mostly popular among Republicans and could be difficult for Johnson to ignore. That gives both her and the speaker incentive to embrace a deal — particularly since Trump would almost certainly be supportive.

In a signal of what’s to come Johnson lashed out at the Justice Department’s two cases from special prosecutor Jack Smith against Trump — over mishandling classified documents as well as the effort to overturn the 2020 election in the runup to the Jan. 6 2021 Capitol attack.

Johnson echoing Greene’s claims of sham trials called the Justice Department cases against Trump “election interference” that “has to stop” as the former president is the party’s presumptive nominee in the 2024 race for the White House.

“President Trump has done nothing wrong here” said Johnson who led one of the defeated president’s legal efforts trying to overturn Biden’s 2020 election victory before the bloody Capitol siege.

Johnson said the House will consider the flow of federal funds to the Justice Department and oversight of the special prosecutor’s office. “Stay tuned” he said.

Greene is also demanding that Johnson abide by the Hastert rule named for another former Republican speaker that requires leaders to proceed with voting on bills only when they have support from the majority of their members.

Relying on the Hastert rule could have tanked congressional support for Ukraine since the recently approved $61 million foreign aid package did not have backing from most Republicans. It passed with Democratic support.

Greene also wants to insist on federal spending reductions championed by Massie which would require a 1% across-the-board cut if Congress fails to pass the regular appropriation bills by the Sept. 30 deadline for the end of the fiscal year. A similar deal was struck last year lending support to the idea.

Other Republicans even if they agree with some of the ideas being proposed are wary of Johnson making any deals with a select few.

“I don’t have a problem with him listening but what I will have a problem with and we had this problem with Speaker McCarthy is when you start making special special deals and hidden deals “said Rep. Kevin Hern R-Okla. “And then people not just conservatives but moderates and everybody else says where’s my deal?”

But ultra-conservative Rep. Tim Burchett R-Tenn. said Greene backing off the motion to vacate for now would be a “a wise move.” He said it signals “she’s going to play her best hand and that’s to get what you can get.”

The speaker is working to show he is in control of the House and not being led by Democrats who are in the minority but have outsized influence because they have provided the votes for much of the consequential issues this Congress.

Rep. Hakeem Jeffries the Democratic leader has emerged as an empowered speaker-in-waiting if Democrats win party control in November. He and his leadership team have promised to vote to table Greene’s motion essentially saving Johnson’s job.

But Johnson insisted Tuesday he has no interest in relinquishing the gavel any time soon. Even though some Republicans have said he should step aside Johnson said he intends to continue leading the House Republicans well into next year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvbWFyam9yaWUtdGF5bG9yLWdyZWVuZS10aHJlYXQtbWlrZS1qb2huc29uLWhvdXNlLXNwZWFrZXItbW90aW9uLXRvLXZhY2F0ZS_SAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9tYXJqb3JpZS10YXlsb3ItZ3JlZW5lLXRocmVhdC1taWtlLWpvaG5zb24taG91c2Utc3BlYWtlci1tb3Rpb24tdG8tdmFjYXRlLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marjorie Taylor Greene backs away from imminent threat to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson,"Washington — Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene appeared to retreat from her threat to imminently trigger a vote to remove Speaker Mike Johnson as House leader after lengthy meetings with him this week.

""Right now the ball is in Mike Johnson's court"" Greene said Tuesday. She added that the timeframe for following through on her promise to force a vote is ""up to Mike Johnson and it can't drag out.""

She said Johnson was not given a ""specific timeline but it's pretty short.""

Greene met Monday and Tuesday with Johnson as the Georgia Republican weighed the exact timing of forcing a vote to remove him from leadership. Greene said last Wednesday she would start the clock on a vote to overthrow Johnson a Louisiana Republican this week after dangling the threat since March.

But she emerged from the meetings to offer few details about her plans to force a vote signaling that tensions could be cooling — at least until he makes another misstep in the eyes of the far-right.

Greene demanded that Johnson promise no more aid for Ukraine no bill be brought to the floor unless the majority of Republicans support it stripping funding for Justice Department investigations into former President Donald Trump and automatic spending cuts if the 12 appropriations bills are not passed individually.

""I have high expectations and they have to be met in full"" Greene said in an interview with former Trump adviser Steve Bannon on his ""War Room"" podcast before Tuesday's meeting. ""There is no middle ground there is no compromise.""

Johnson a Louisiana Republican said Tuesday the initial conversation was ""productive"" and ""it was not a negotiation."" He also described the second meeting as ""productive"" and said he was ""optimistic"" about finding a resolution on the suggestions. They did not have more meetings scheduled he said.

""I take Marjorie's ideas and Thomas' and everybody else's equally and we assess them on their own value and where we can make improvements and changes and all of that we do. That's what this is. There's nothing more than that going on"" he said Tuesday morning.

Rep. Thomas Massie a Kentucky Republican joined both meetings. He and GOP Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona are the only two Republicans who have publicly backed Greene's effort at this point.

Johnson has repeatedly noted that he's leading a divided majority with a one-vote margin. Special elections in May and June to fill the seats of Republicans who retired in recent months are expected to help give more cushion to the GOP majority.

If Greene does eventually trigger a vote Johnson is expected to survive the attempt to strip him of the gavel thanks to Democratic support that puts him in a stronger position despite the GOP's razor-thin margin of control. Democrats said they would thwart the effort to remove him after he defied conservative members of his party to support more aid to Ukraine.

Democrats offering to help a GOP leader keep his power demonstrates how far conservatives' unwillingness to compromise has pushed the House toward this unique moment. But Democrats say the move is more about beating back the far right than saving Johnson.

""Our view would traditionally be 'Let the other side work its own mess out'"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries a New York Democrat recently told ""60 Minutes."" ""But when that mess starts to impact the ability to do the job on behalf of the American people then the responsible thing at that moment might be for us to make clear that we will not allow the extremists to throw the Congress and the country into chaos.""

Johnson said Tuesday he expects to remain in power next year.

""I intend to lead this conference in the future"" he said at his weekly news conference. ""I expect I'll be doing that in the future. I'm glad to have the support of President Trump.""

Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene R-Ga. and Thomas Massie R-Ky. met with Johnson behind closed doors for roughly two hours late Monday afternoon after promising last week to force a House-wide vote on his removal. They declined to give details to reporters immediately after the sit-down but said they would have a follow-up discussion with Johnson on Tuesday.

However Fox News Digital was told they are broadly seeking four points – including no more funding for Ukraine nor special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into former President Trump.

They are also demanding that Johnson vow to block any legislation from getting a House-wide vote unless it has the support of a majority of the House GOP – a longstanding informal provision called the Hastert rule named after a former Republican speaker.

MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE FILES MOTION TO OUST SPEAKER JOHNSON

On government funding the conservatives are also pushing Johnson to adhere to the Massie rule which would require automatic federal spending cuts if an agreement is not reached on fiscal year 2025 funding by the Sept. 30 deadline.

Fox News Digital reached out to Greene Massie and Johnson's offices for comment. A spokesman for Greene declined to discuss the contents of a private meeting.

Meanwhile Rep. Paul Gosar R-Ariz. the third GOP rebel who signed onto Greene's motion to vacate the chair – a resolution calling for a House-wide vote on removing the speaker – suggested to reporters on Monday evening that he wanted Johnson to have some more time to change course.

HOUSE DEMS SAY THEY’LL BLOCK MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE FROM OUSTING SPEAKER JOHNSON

""I don't think it's going to happen this week. I hope it doesn't happen this week"" Gosar told reporters. ""I think it would be nice to see him go back to regular order get things coming from committees you get a majority of the majority to get something on the floor.""

Greene is leading the push to oust Johnson amid conservative frustrations over his bipartisan work on critical legislation related to government funding and foreign aid. She and Massie pledged to force the vote sometime this week.

To do so she would have to notice her resolution as ""privileged"" – meaning the House would have two legislative days to vote on the measure itself or first vote on scuttling it via a procedure known as ""tabling"" the resolution.

Democrats have pledged to block the ouster vote by voting to table the resolution whenever it comes up something that could save Johnson while also likely raising more conservative frustrations.

Johnson told reporters on Monday evening that his meeting with Massie and Greene was ""lengthy"" but ""constructive.""

""We have discussed some ideas and we're going to meet again tomorrow"" Johnson said. ""I just want to say and I told them and I've said this repeatedly that I understand the frustration. I share it. I would really like to advance much more of our conservative policy on a daily basis here. But the reality is we are working with the smallest majority in U.S. history with a one-vote margin."""

Thomas J. Courtney age 73 passed away suddenly on April 13 2022. Tom was born on June 7 1948 in Kaukauna WI. Tom will be lovingly remembered by his wife of forty years Linda Anderson-Courtney; his siblings Jim (Ann) Matt Dan John (Ginnie Showers) Eileen Rob (Mary McPhail) Pat Westphal Mary Peterson and Joe May (Cindy); his brother-in-law Marv Weber; his brother and sister-in-law Jim and Vicki Anderson many nieces nephews cousins and friends.

By the age of 12 he had achieved not only an Eagle Scott award but also the Boy Scouts of America Order of the Arrow. He graduated from Kaukauna High School in 1966 graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1971 with a degree in construction engineering and pursued his JD from the Hamline School of Law graduating in 1981.

Before settling in Wisconsin Tom worked as a travel agent leading tours across the U.S. and Canada and he spent the entire summer of 1971 riding a Ducati motorcycle across America's southwest. He then moved to Minnesota and worked as a project manager for Kraus Anderson - a highlight of his career being the building of a beautiful hotel in Scottsdale AZ. He later returned to Minnesota and pursued his law degree and after law school settled in Milwaukee with Linda and worked for Johnson Controls Inc.

The water was a special place for Tom and together he and Linda and many friends sailed hundreds nautical miles first on the Irish Mist and then on Frivolous Motion. They sailed all of Lake Michigan the North Channel and several areas in the Caribbean and California. His last sailing adventure was in California where the boat engine failed and they had to be towed more than seven hours which brought them under the Golden Gate Bridge and to the slip.

Tom was a devoted wine maker for more than thirty years. He and Linda joined the Wisconsin Vintners Association in 1995 and have been active members since that date. During those years he successfully completed a four-year course with the American Wine Society and became a certified wine judge. He also won a two gold medals and one bronze medal at American Wine Society annual conferences. He judged for the American Wine Society the Wisconsin State Fair and the Ozaukee County State Fair.

Over the years family and friends were the lucky recipients of his many wonderful creations from expertly made wine and truffles to beautiful stained glass. He was expanding his chocolate making journey with many experiments and had plans to attend a chocolate candy making class in Peru. Tom also had a quick dry wit--honed from his large family--that yielded simultaneous grins and groans from his friends and family members.

Harkening back to his travel agent days Tom planned many thoughtful and wonderful trips including crossing the Arctic Circle (twice - first in Alaska and then in Norway) and the Antarctic Circle and touring wine vineyards across Europe and the Americans east and west coasts. He also persuaded traveling companions to visit a cork museum in France and the Green Bay Packer Bar in Paris.

Visitation and a short memorial service will be held on May 22 2022 from 1:00-2:30 pm at Schmidt & Bartelt 10280 N Port Washington Rd Mequon WI followed by a celebration of life with friends and family at the South Shore Pavilion 2900 South Shore Dr Milwaukee 531207 from 3:00-6:00 pm. In lieu of flowers memorial gifts can be made to the Youth Sailing Club of the Milwaukee County Sailing Center 1450 N. Lincoln Memorial Drive 53202 - for Youth Sailing Center.

For this purpose Al Salem Johnson Controls (YORK) a leading provider of integrated solutions that incorporate HVAC equipment fire and security systems building management systems and controls is implementing its district cooling solutions — one of the most efficient cooling solutions — for the Holy Mosque perfectly suitable for a range of operating conditions.

District cooling is one of the most cost-effective and performance-effective HVAC solutions for modern buildings and densely populated cities. These solutions provide many economic and environmental advantages over other systems – the cooling plants use renewable energy sources (such as solar energy and bioenergy) which helps to rationalize consumption and preserve energy revenues.

On the other hand a group of buildings using individually designed cooling systems could see up to 50% more energy consumption than using a district cooling solution making it more effective and economically feasible not only in terms of energy savings but also space utilization.

Al Shamiya and Ajyad cooling plants designated for cooling Al Haram (with a total cooling capacity of 150000 TR) which is equivalent to cooling 20000 apartments the cooling plant of the Makkah Clock Royal Tower (with a cooling capacity of 46000TR) and the cooling plant of Jabal Omar (with a cooling capacity of 49000TR) are examples of the company’s district cooling solutions currently in operation in Makkah.

For district cooling chillers are installed and operated inside a plant which is usually a few kilometers away from the buildings and facilities that are to be cooled. The cooled water is pumped from the plant to the air handling units inside Al Haram the Clock Tower or the hotels and residential buildings in the Jabal Omar area which in turn are equipped with high-quality filters with a filtration rate of more than 95 percent. This ensures the purity of indoor air in these buildings thereby protecting the pilgrims from catching any air-bone diseases or infections.

It is worth noting that Al Salem Johnson Controls (YORK) in addition to district cooling solutions provides various other cooling solutions such individual chillers plants to many hotel buildings and residential towers in the central area of Makkah and beyond it. These include Makkah Hotel and Towers InterContinental Dar Al Tawhid Makkah Al Rajhi Towers and others.

The company also provides after-sales and maintenance services which includes maintenance and repair contracts operation and maintenance contracts and preventive maintenance. To this end the company has allocated a special service branch for the Makkah region led by more than 100 engineers technicians and administrators to serve Al Haram district cooling plants hotels and towers.

In order to ensure quality of service and comfort provided to the pilgrims the number of technicians is increased during peak seasons such as Ramadan and Hajj. The team is able to quickly respond to emergencies and deal with malfunctions in record time.

The Covenant House Georgia will be able to serve more homeless youth thanks to a successful capital campaign that raised $10.1 million — $400000 more than the initial goal.

The campaign helped build the Gift of Hope Apartments a 30-unit building that will house homeless youth on the seven-acre Covenant House campus in Northwest Atlanta. The Covenant House held a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the apartment building during an unusually warm afternoon on April 22.

Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens who participated in the ribbon-cutting said the Covenant House serves a special need in the community.

“The Covenant House of Georgia has been at this for over 20 years” Dickens said. “It is consistently on the front lines of this issue. Unfortunately COVID-19 made a serious problem even worse. The Covenant House now will be able to offer assistance to even more young people who are extremely vulnerable.”

Alieizoria “Alie” Redd executive director of Covenant House Georgia said the campaign also funded a 20 percent expansion of the P.J. Garcia Crisis Center. Last year the Covenant House of Georgia served more than 1300 youth providing them with shelter educational and vocational services health and wellness services as well as independent living skills.

“This growth allows CHGA to serve an additional 189 youth who are overcoming homelessness and escaping trafficking each year offering unconditional love absolute respect and relentless support to empower their stability” Redd said.

Ben Deutsch board chair of Covenant House Georgia has been on the board since 2012.

“We are offering them a real path to long and fulfilling lives” said Deutsch who thanked the donors and fellow board members for the success of the “Building on a Promise” campaign.

Key contributors included the Gift of Hope Foundation the Home First initiative JPMorgan Chase The Robert W. Woodruff Foundation the Delta Air Lines Foundation the Schoen Foundation the James M. Cox Foundation Tull Charitable Foundation the Waterfall Foundation the Zeist Foundation the Fraser-Parker Foundation among others. The board of directors gave more than $610000 to the campaign.

Cooper Carry designed the more than 20000-square-foot building which was built by Hogan Construction with Silverman Construction Program Management serving as project manager.

Robert Fink president of the Gift of Hope Foundation and his daughter — Donna Vassil got special recognition but it was not disclosed how much they contributed to the campaign.

Fink president of the foundation said his family learned about Covenant House nationally.

“It’s the biggest movement to take care of homeless youth” Fink said. “The Covenant House is like a bridge between homelessness and hope. That’s the purpose of our foundation. We look at this like it’s a tremendous bridge.”

Covenant House Georgia is a subsidiary of Covenant House International the largest privately funded nonprofit service organization serving young people experiencing homelessness in the Americas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZW56aW5nYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMi8wNC8yNjc3NTcyMy9qZWZmLWJlem9zLWlzLWEtdmVyeS1zbWFydC1ndXktd2FycmVuLWJ1ZmZldHQtcHJhaXNlcy1hbWF6b24tZm91bmRlci1hbmQtd2hhdC1oZXMtYWNjb21wbGlzaGVk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jeff Bezos Is A 'Very Smart Guy': Warren Buffett Praises Amazon Founder And What He's Accomplished - Berkshire ...,"If Jeff Bezos had asked Warren Buffett his thoughts on moving out to Washington to create an online bookstore empire things might have turned out different for the future of Amazon.com Inc AMZN.

What Happened: Buffett who is the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) praised Bezos during an hour-long interview with former CBS journalist Charlie Rose.

“Jeff is a friend of mine” Buffett said.

Buffett added he only sees Bezos around once a year has never sent him an email and can’t recall talking to him on the telephone.

Buffett is proud of what Bezos and his former wife Mackenzie Scott accomplished in the creation of Amazon but acknowledged things might have been different if Bezos stopped in Omaha Nebraska for advice along the way to Washington.

“I would have said good luck” Buffett said with a laugh.

Buffett acknowledged that Amazon “couldn’t happen but it did.”

“He’s a very very very smart guy” Buffet said of Bezos.

Buffett also praised the philanthropic work being done by Scott and encouraged listeners to read her recent letter.

Health Care Effort: Buffett also acknowledged the effort put forth by himself Bezos and JPMorgan Chase JPM CEO Jamie Dimon to address America's healthcare problems.

“We had as good an accommodation you could have” Buffett said.

The Berkshire CEO said they approached the challenge with great intent and hope and the downside of creating a new healthcare initiative was zero.

Buffett praised the doctors and medical schools in the U.S. saying they’re the best in the world. He also said that the healthcare system is “so much better than it was 20 years ago.”

“A rich country like America should make sure everyone has access (to healthcare)” Buffett added.

While the initiative created by the three CEOs was wound down Buffett said it wasn’t a failure. “We all got our money’s worth we all learned something.”

Lenovo ThinkStation P620: Dream Machine Showdown,"Apple Mac Studio M1 Ultra Vs. Lenovo ThinkStation P620: Dream Machine Showdown

Top-of-the-line work powerhouse desktop computers from Apple and Lenovo go head-to-head for a heavyweight computing match pitting Apple’s latest silicon against AMD’s big boss processor the Ryzen Threadripper.

While we realize that the constant Mac Vs. PC bickering is mostly a dog whistle meant to drum up fiery debates among fandom in each camp the allure of a scorecard featuring two heavyweight desktop computer brawlers in their prime was too good to ignore.

Apple turned a lot of heads this year with the springtime announcement of its Mac Studio featuring its “system on a chip” M1 Ultra processor. The release was a wild roundhouse punch aimed squarely at top chips from AMD and Intel. AMD’s Threadripper offers blistering speeds needed for the most demanding and graphic-intense work. But Apple came in strong with serious performance in a compact workstation.

Desktop PC giants collide as CRN examines the Mac Studio with M1 Ultra chip vs. the Lenovo ThinkStation P620 featuring AMD’s Threadripper CPU.

Getting Ripped With The P620 While Apple Slices Size

Lenovo’s research and development department must have been seeing stars when they started writing down plans for this monster which can weigh up to 50 pounds depending on configuration. The simple no-frills housing on the ThinkStation 620 gives easy access to internals for those who like to do their own upgrades although we’d like to meet the person who needs more power than even the base configuration wields. Lenovo’s machine is no dainty workstation coming in at 18.1 inches tall 6.5 inches wide and 17.3 inches long. But even with a substantial presence Lenovo keeps things toned down with its all-black simple design.

Of course Apple’s design approach is austere as well if not a little slicker in the branding consistency department. Where it really shines though is overall size. Apple has somehow managed to squeeze its most monstrously powerful computer yet into a 7.7-inch square footprint at a height of just 3.7 inches. It’s basically just a bit larger than two Mac Minis stacked on top of each other (someone at Apple missed out on a Big Mac cross-promotion opportunity with McDonald’s).

In overall aesthetics and form we simply must give the nod to Apple here.

Let’s Talk About Specs

Let’s face it: This is more compute power than any of us needs. Even graphics-intense content creators and those doing thread-heavy tasks would have a hard time finding the upper limit on either of these machines. But benchmarks and numbers matter and both titans came to play.

Lenovo chose to house the groundbreaking AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro 3945WX processor (which is yet-to-be-bested in a benchmark CPU speed test – not even by Apple’s M1 Ultra). The Threadripper thrashes with up to 4.30 GHz 12 Cores 24 threads and 64MB Cache. We’ve outfitted our dream machine with upgraded RAM at 64GB and SSD storage of 1TB to match the base M1 Ultra offering from Apple. Both machines are configurable beyond the $10000 mark if you do so desire. You could add up to three graphics cards on the Lenovo but we thought the Nvidia Quadro P620 2GB was plenty for our purposes.

Apple does love to make things simple and gives you a knock-out base package that includes the M1 Ultra chip with 20-core CPU 48-core GPU and 32-core Neural Engine 1TB SSD storage and 64GB unified memory.

As various testers have noted that the M1 Ultra doesn’t quite stack up with the performance of the Threadripper we’re going to give the slight edge to Lenovo and AMD here especially considering the giant box leaves you enough room and flexibility to upgrade as you go.

Ports Pricing And Declaring A Winner

Considering Apple’s tendency to go light in the port department the Studio gives you some really great options including two Thunderbold4 ports and one SDXC card slot on the front and Four Thunderbolt 4 ports two USB-A ports one HDMI port one 10GB Ethernet port and one 3.5mm headphone jack.

The Lenovo is tricked out with ports galore including dual USB-C ports and dual USB-A ports on the front. On the back you’ll find an additional six USB-A ports four of which support USB 3.2 and two that support USB 2.0. With the AMD chipset no need for a Thunderbolt port here. You’ll also get PS/2 ports for legacy peripherals audio/microphone ins and outs and a 10GB Ethernet port.

If it were a match to determine sheer brute strength the Lenovo would win handily. But Apple brings finesse and value providing a worthy entry to their iconic lineup. Then there’s the value proposition: These are expensive machines considering zero accessories are included. The ThinkStation P620 with this setup will run you $4924. The base Mac Studio M1 Ultra starts at $3999 with similar specs.

We give the trophy to Apple for providing a truly remarkable machine in a small package. While still very expensive Apple also kept this dream machine within reach for the “prosumer” market.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In its annual Summer Gas Outlook published on 14 April the UK’s National Grid plc a British multinational electricity and gas utility company noted that the UK will increase its gas exports over the next 6 months to help Europe fill its gas storage sites ahead of next winter.

European gas storage was at 27% at the end of this winter as compared to 30% the same time a year ago.

The UK has been a net importer of gas since 2005 covering 50% of demand with its own production from the North and Irish Seas plus associated petroleum gas from oil fields.

Norway supplies about 30% of UK imports via pipeline with LNG from Qatar the US and Russia accounting for a bit more than 15% according to the Outlook.

Any surplus gas in the system can then be exported to Europe via the BBL pipeline to the Netherlands (Bacton to Balgzand) or through the Interconnector pipeline to Belgium (Bacton to Zeebrugge.) The ability to regasify LNG from anywhere in the world and then deliver it to Europe by pipeline makes Britain an “energy bridge” that can wean Europe off Russian energy while longer-term solutions are put into place.

This summer UK gas exports to the EU could reach 5.1 Bcm far beyond the volumes of 2021 when exports totaled only 0.7 Bcm because cold summers had drawn down the UK’s gas reserves according to National Grid which noted that the increased exports are to be based on “commercial agreements” as opposed to intergovernmental agreements.

LNG is expected to play a major role in boosting EU gas supplies from new sources globally with more cargos directed in the near term to the UK’s three regasification terminals—Grain LNG (the UK’s largest) on the Thames Estuary Kent; and the South Hook and Dragon regasification terminals in Wales.

The UK is Europe’s second-largest LNG importer after Spain and given its subsea pipeline connections to the continent it is also a gas transit state to the EU.

So far the US has agreed to increase LNG exports to Europe by 15 Bcm and Qatar has promised not to redirect Europe-bound cargoes to Asia as is the practice when buyers in Asia offer higher premiums to sellers.

Fred Hutchison chief executive of the US trade group LNG Allies confirmed to Reuters that delegations from Latvia and Estonia as well as diplomats from Bulgaria Estonia France Germany Hungary Latvia and the UK toured the Golden Pass LNG export project in Sabine Pass Texas in early April and met in Houston with US shale gas producers.

Top executives from Chesapeake Energy Coterra Energy EOG Resources and EQT Corp. participated in the event which was intended to foster discussion of how US energy producers could assist Europe in replacing Russian imports of oil coal and LNG.

The meeting co-organized with the American Exploration and Production Council touched also on the topic of building new infrastructure in both Europe and in the US echoing testimony that Pioneer Natural Resources Chief Executive Scott Sheffield gave the same day when he told a congressional hearing that new LNG facilities are needed in the northeast according to Reuters and C-SPAN.

As for Europe Germany—which had staked its energy security largely on Russian pipeline gas—now expects to commission its first LNG regasification plant in 2026.In March Germany’s Economic Minister Robert Habeck was in Doha lining up a long-term supply contract with Qatar.

Meanwhile Algeria has agreed to increase gas exports to Italy through the Trans-Mediterranean Pipeline to Sicily via Tunisiaunder an agreement announced during Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi’s visit to Algiers for talks with Algerian president Abdelmadjid Tebboune.

Italy like the rest of the EU relies on Russia for about 40% of its energy imports. In 2021 the EU imported 155 Bcm of Russian gas which represented about 45% of EU gas imports nearly 40% of total gas consumption according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Chicago Bulls and Klarna first announced their multi-year experiential partnership in January. Lavine and Lonzo Ball have also joined in with Klarna in the partnership.

“The Chicago Bulls are one of the most renowned teams in basketball history and share Klarna’s commitment to challenging the limits of success within culture and commerce” said David Sandstrom CMO Klarna. “Together we will showcase how brands and teams can align to provide a more meaningful and engaging experience for fans.”

In the future Klarna and the Bulls will partner for initiatives including exclusive fashion collaborations that are inspired by the franchise’s run of inspiring on and off-the-court attire.

“We’re excited to partner with Klarna to leverage the intersection of sports fashion and commerce to provide Bulls fans opportunities to engage with our brand in a new way” said Chicago Bulls Executive Vice President Revenue & Strategy Matthew Kobe. “Our partnership with Klarna will further the Bulls’ commitment to combining sports and tech to create revolutionary experiences for our fans.”

During Game 4 Giannis Antentokounmpo and Chicago public enemy number one Grayson Allen buried the Bulls deep into a 3-1 hole. Antentokounmpo had 32 points and 17 rebounds Allen had 27 points with six 3-pointers and the Bucks ran away with the game after the first quarter despite a raucous Chicago crowd and multiple runs from the Bulls.

Zach Lavine led the Bulls with 24 points and 13 assists DeRozan added in 23 and Patrick Williams added in an important 20-point win and 10 rebounds. In the closing moments of the game Lavine and former teammate Bobby Portis got involved in a minor scuffle. Lavine dismissed the moment as “old friends catching up.”

Bulls coach Billy Donovan had a message after the game “There were times where we gave really really good effort and they still scored. I think there were times we moved the ball and generated pretty good looks for each other and the ball didn’t go in the basket. That I think gets deflating. And you could kind of sense that a little bit.”",,,,,,

Princeton British Columbia (Princeton and District Arena)

Princeton perseveres. After a forest fire threatened their community two years ago they were hit by widespread floods that are still impacting residents today. “How can I help?” is the mentality of this community and together they have been able to overcome any obstacle in their way. The next obstacle is upgrading the Princeton and District Arena which is the hub of the community. It’s not just a place for hockey but a place to create memories like weddings dances fundraisers and more. With its roof in disrepair water has been pouring onto the ice during games. Winning Kraft Hockeyville would allow the community to keep a roof over their skaters’ heads which means so much to them after all they’ve been through as a community.

Douro-Dummer Ontario (Douro Community Centre and Arena)

Douro Arena is a place where all members of Douro-Dummer feel welcome. Whether you’ve stepped on the ice for the first time or have been at it for decades members of the community care about your experience as much as they care about their own. Youth hockey is only part of why the arena is so important to the community. It’s also a place for the community to come together to support fundraising for the local food banks and toy drives. The community continues to strive to help make hockey more accessible for everyone and winning Kraft Hockeyville will allow them to make long-overdue upgrades to their lobby and dressing rooms so all members of the community and visitors feel welcome.

Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu Quebec (Aréna Marcel-Larocque)

Celebrating its 50th anniversary Aréna Marcel-Larocque sits in the centre of a small town with an unparalleled excitement for hockey. In the Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu community the passion for the game is only half of what matters. The arena is the community’s hub where youth make lifelong connections and parents reconnect with old friends. Parents have passed their love of hockey to future generations who now claim the arena as their second home. It’s clear that the arena is a source of joy for all members of the community. Winning Kraft Hockeyville would allow the community to build 50 more years of meaningful memories by helping fund much-needed upgrades throughout the arena including its changerooms washrooms and ice plant.

Sydney Nova Scotia (Canada Games Complex)

Cape Breton is a small island with a huge passion for hockey. Locals describe the island the way they describe their love for community hockey: fierce resolute and resilient. The Canada Games Complex in Sydney was built 35 years ago to host the 1987 Canada Winter Games but has since had to close its doors to hockey. Since then the demand for rink access on the island has outweighed the supply making it difficult to accommodate the sharp increase in participation in girls’ hockey the community has seen over the last number of years. Winning Kraft Hockeyville would help the community purchase the new compressor it needs to reopen its arena’s doors and empower the girls on the island itching for ice time.

The 2022 grand prize winner will have an opportunity to host an NHL® preseason game on a date to be determined by Kraft Heinz Canada the NHL and NHLPA and receive $250000 to be used towards arena upgrades as well as the coveted title of Kraft Hockeyville 2022. This year’s winner and each of the three runner-up communities will also receive $10000 worth of new hockey equipment for their minor hockey programs courtesy of the NHLPA Goals & Dreams fund.

These finalists are now tasked with rallying their community and Canadians from across the country.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is on track to invest more than $33 billion in the space of 18 months.

This year the famed investor's company has plowed about $7 billion into Occidental Petroleum stock in 11 days and snapped up $4 billion of HP shares. Buffett also struck a deal to acquire Alleghany for $11.6 billion in under two weeks.

James Shanahan a senior equity analyst at Edward Jones expects a couple more deals to materialize over the next year. Berkshire is likely to spend about $4 billion to raise its ownership of Pilot Flying J to 80% in early 2023 he told Insider.

Moreover Buffett's company may soon buy the 8% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy owned by the family of Walter Scott Jr. a Berkshire director until his death last September. That would raise its ownership to over 99% Shanahan said.

If Berkshire shells out $33 billion that would exceed the $30 billion it piled into stocks in 2020 and dwarf the $8 billion it invested in equities last year (ignoring stock sales in both years).

It would also surpass the $25 billion it spent on share buybacks in 2020 and the $27 billion it plowed into repurchases last year.

Regardless Berkshire might still struggle to put a dent in its cash pile. The company generates about $33 billion of free cash flow every five quarters Shanahan told Insider.

""There is a good chance that Berkshire is still holding $150 billion in cash by mid-2023 unless there are additional investments"" he said.

Berkshire shares have climbed 14% this year bucking the S&P 500's 8% decline over the same period. Shanahan downgraded the stock to a ""hold"" rating this week asserting its current price already reflects the likelihood it outperforms its financial-services peers this year its recent strong earnings and its flurry of purchases.

The conglomerate owns scores of businesses including Geico See's Candies and the Burlington Northern Railway. It also holds multibillion-dollar stakes in Apple Coca-Cola Kraft Heinz and other public companies.

Buffett whose nickname is the ""Sage of Omaha"" is expected to field questions for several hours at Berkshire's yearly shareholder gathering in his hometown next week. The centibillionaire investor recently touted the event as a ""very very important meeting.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8va2V6ai5jb20vb25lLW9mLXR3aW4tZmFsbHMtZmF2b3JpdGUtcGl6emEtam9pbnRzLXF1aWV0bHktY2xvc2VkLXRoZWlyLWRvb3JzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,One Of Twin Falls Favorite Pizza Joints Quietly Closin Doors,"We have reached out to the Hayes family to get more information but as of right now this is the information we have found. Maxie's in Twin Falls has officially quietly sadly closed their doors.

UPDATE: We are getting reports that their final day will be April 30th

According to a Facebook post from one of the members of the Hayes family they stated that Maxie's in Twin Falls has had to close permanently. The building that Maxie's has been operating out of has been for sale for some time now. It appears it has not sold and the family will say goodbye to one of Twin Falls favorite Italian eateries.

Again we have reached out to the family and as soon as we get more information we will update. As of right now it appears that lack of work force increasing prices of supplies and health issues are the cause for the closure. I am unsure what is going to happen to the building now but we do hope that the family has a wonderful retirement and prospers in health and happiness on their next endeavor.

Selfishly I am incredibly sad that I will be unable to get that fantastic lasagna anymore. It was seriously one of the best things I have ever eaten in my life. Just judging by some of the responses from people in the community this place holds many memories over the last 66 years that they have operated.

We will miss you Maxie's so many don't know what they are missing out on now that you aren't here. Prayers and good health to the entire family.

For Christina Lamey president of the Cape Breton Blizzard Female Hockey Association a potential victory over three other selected Canadian communities could mean a much-needed home-ice advantage for women’s hockey teams.

Related stories

“This whole arena we’re trying to fix up and open is driven entirely by girls and women’s hockey” Lamey said. “That’s who is going to fill the arena.”

Kraft Heinz Canada in partnership with the National Hockey League and the National Hockey League Players' Association on Saturday night picked Sydney as one of four Canada communities competing for a chance to host an NHL pre-season game and a chance to receive $250000 in arena upgrades.

Nothing would please the Blizzard more than winning some extra funding cash to revive the Canada Games Complex and allowing the venue to become its home arena.

'Chances are pretty high'

“I think our chances are pretty high” said Julia Brown an under-13 AAA player with the Blizzard. “I know we have a great community who can help out knowing how many people want this (the Canada Games Complex) to be our home rink. And now that we’ve made it to the top four we know this could actually happen.”

And now that the Canada Games Complex has reached the top four nominations it will receive $25000 in arena upgrades and compete for the top prize of $250000 and the right to host an NHL pre-season game.

The arena currently needs new ice-making equipment and a Zamboni in addition to some interior renovations which the program hopes will be covered by the prize money from a Kraft Hockeyville win.

“That equipment was at the end of its life cycle anyway” Lamey said. “And when you walk into the building you can see it’s like a time capsule — all the equipment in there is vintage 1986; there’s even old phones from the 1980s.

“The building is perfect for what we need but it definitely needs some upgrades.”

The three other communities (and arenas) vying for that same opportunity are:

Princeton B.C. (Princeton and District Arena) west of British Columbia’s Okanagan Valley about 160 kilometres southwest of Kelowna

Douro-Dummer Ont. (Douro Community Centre and Arena) about 11 km northeast of Peterborough

Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu Que. (Aréna Marcel-Larocque) just over 40 km southeast of downtown Montreal

The winning community will be announced on May 7.

'No ice times'

As Lamey notes interest in women’s ice hockey continues to grow. But she adds it’s no secret the Blizzard organization often scrambles to seek whatever free ice time is available at other venues — especially in the Cape Breton Regional Municipality.

“We have no ice times available at any local government-owned or funded arenas” Lamey said. “We have no girls teams playing at County Arena Emera Centre Northside the New Waterford and District Community Centre or Miners Forum. We get some ice time at Centre 200 but not much.”

Lamey added that she has had better success with the Membertou Sport and Wellness Centre the Dan K. Stevens Memorial Arena in Eskasoni as well as the Whitney Pier Community Rink.

“Both First Nations arenas have really been fantastic accommodating us and we wanted to continue with that” Lamey said. “But generally speaking we need some consistency in getting ice time.”

Blizzard U13 'AAA' player Julia Brown: ""Now that we’ve made it to the top four we know this could actually happen."" IAN NATHANSON/CAPE BRETON POST - Ian Nathanson

Distribute ice time

Lamey cites cities such as Halifax Ottawa Toronto where “they have in the arenas they own or fund a community access policy their ice-allocation equity policy and they distribute the ice time and take all of the users into account. It’s mainly something you see in bigger cities but it should be everywhere.”

Yet some aging arenas like the nearly 50-year-old Victoria Highland Civic Centre in Baddeck were built to only accommodate boys and men’s hockey. Interestingly the Baddeck arena’s board of directors president John Trickett said last year he and his board commissioned an engineering report from Dillon Consulting to look at how they could add a female dressing room in the building spurred on by a growing interest from girls’ minor hockey teams.

“What we’re doing now with our league is not new” Lamey said. “Women were playing hockey in the 1920s and up until the 1950s and 1960s. In some ways we just want to reclaim our spaces that were taken away from us all those years ago.”

(WKYT) - Tens of thousands of country music fans packed Kroger Field Saturday night as Chris Stapleton took the stage for ‘A Concert for Kentucky.’

It was the first-ever concert at the football stadium on UK’s campus - and it was for a good cause. The money benefits a non-profit partnering with different organizations across the state.

“Feeling good very excited” said Nick Carozza. “I bought tickets two years ago so it’s nice to have a concert out here at Kroger Field. it’s been a long time coming.”

“Been waiting forever for this and what a gorgeous day right?” added Michael Martin.

People we spoke with came from Georgia and Montana after buying tickets two and half years ago and made the trek tonight. For those that finally got to take in the day at Kroger Field the wait was worth it.

“I thought he would just cancel here but he we are now” Carozza said.

Some in attendance hope this could become a regular occurrence bringing much-needed business to Lexington.

“Hopefully this is just one of many out here at Kroger Field” said Carozza. “It’s a great atmosphere and us Wildcat fans we need this.”

“I think between concerts they’re putting out and Keeneland and different festivals this would be great as an annual event” Martin said.

Autoplay

The Chris Stapleton concert with Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson as openers was scheduled for April 2020. It was postponed two years in a row due to COVID.

“I’ve been listening every single day for the whole week because I want to sing every single song” said Martin. “I don’t have a favorite everything he puts out every single song is on. I thought I’d wake up today with it pouring rain.”

But the sun - and the artists – prevailed leading to Lexington seeing one of its busiest weekends in a long time. It was a Saturday stuffed with Keeneland several UK Athletics games and one concert many thought they’d never see.

“So many artists won’t reschedule or don’t reschedule or don’t want to wait that long to be able to see them” said Robin Dehate. “When I saw that opportunity I jumped on it. I was thrilled.”

(LEX18) — Chris Stapleton's long-awaited performance at Kroger Field brought tens of thousands to Lexington Saturday.

The performance had been delayed multiple times over the past 2 years building anticipation for an event fans said was well worth the wait.

""It's frickin' awesome"" said Shantelle Rose whose family came together from across the state to attend the concert. ""I’m here with Chris Stapelton and 55 thousand of his closest friends"" said David Rose.

Outside the field fans said they experienced football-like weather the warmth making it great for tailgating.

Also performing was Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson. Proceeds from the event went toward multiple charities.

Stapleton also paid for a group of about 150 from his high school alma mater Johnson Central High School to attend.

""He's a big inspiration to us in the mountains"" said high school senior Reece Goss.

You really want to zip out so you head to the self-checkout and it's a little awkward with all your items. Oops. It's not just you – in fact a lot of people do that.

In the coming weeks dozens of local Kroger stores in greater Cincinnati Northern Kentucky and the Dayton area will get a couple of new larger self-checkout lanes that the supermarket giant has been testing in Columbus.

At the new stations shoppers will still scan their own purchases but once an item is swiped a belt moves it to a bagging station. There's no cashier but a courtesy clerk will bag your groceries.

Olivia Shrewsbery left of Hilliard uses the new conveyer belt self check out at the Kroger store in Dublin Ohio. Kroger is experimenting with a self-checkout technology where shoppers use a conveyor checkout.

As Kroger and many retailers continue to grapple with a nationwide labor shortage the new checkout system might be just the thing to speed the checkout process.

""We are excited to roll out this new enhancement to the customer shopping experience"" said Kroger spokeswoman Jenifer Moore

Kroger is testing out a new self-checkout machine that uses a conveyor belt for shoppers with larger purchases at the Oakley Kroger.

Until this month only two stores in the nation – both in the Columbus area – were testing the lanes. This spring 42 stores or roughly a third of local Cincinnati region stores will get two lanes apiece. The first ones were installed last week.

On Thursday Libby Bien a 21-year-old Xavier University nursing student from Norwood tried it out at the Kroger Marketplace on Marburg Avenue in Oakley – and gave it high marks.

""I like it I like self-checkout – I can't remember the last time I used a lane with a live checker"" Bien said.

Bien said it was an improvement because she also prefers to stock up when she shops and visit the store less. That's a problem in the self-checkout because the unit typically pauses around 20 items and has to be restarted by a nearby attendant.

""It always beeps out at you"" Bien said.

Noah Derese a 25-year-old Clifton resident and student at the University of Cincinnati said he has the same problem: he prefers self-checkout but wants to scan more items per visit.

""I try to keep it just under the limit but it still goes off"" Derese said. ""This is some concept!""

In addition to Kroger stores the Cincinnati-based grocer operates several regional supermarket chains in 35 states including Fred Meyer Harris Teeter Ralphs Mariano's Fry's Smith's King Soopers QFC and others. The company has nearly 2800 stores and employs 465000 workers.

According to the details the simulator has been acquired from a UK-based company L3 Harris and it has been installed at PIA Training Centre.

The new Reality Seven Full Flight Simulator supplied by L3 Harris is the first of its kind simulator in Pakistan and will give the airline’s pilots the highest-quality training a PIA spokesman said.

The vision and aviation expertise of CEO PIA Air Marshal Arshad Malik has led to the acquisition of the much-awaited latest technology A320 flight simulator keeping in view the present and future needs of PIA. The prime objective is to save costs incurred on training PIA Crew and also to create additional revenue inflows for the airline by giving training to Crew of other airlines of Pakistan and foreign airlines as well.

PIA previously used to get training of pilots of A320 aircraft in Bangkok Thailand and other countries at very high costs and also payments in foreign currencies. The airline will now have foreign currency inflows. The A320 aircraft is widely used by PIA and other airlines in the region and its numbers are increasing a PIA spokesman added.

Meanwhile CEO PIA Air Marshal Arshad Malik congratulated PIA officials on the commencement of installation work at the Training Centre and instructed the officials to complete the installation within the shortest time period for maximum utilization.

He said that the simulator building complex offers lesser rates in the region than others for training on the upgraded B777 simulator which is at par with international standards; this new simulator would bring in additional revenue by offering training to other airlines crew apart from training to PIA crew at low costs.

The A320 flight simulator will be used for the training of more than 400 pilots. He further said that there is great demand for training on the A320 Flight simulator as A320 is being regarded as a narrow body economical fuel-efficient aircraft being utilized the world over and also in this region. With the commencement of training it is expected that PIA will break even on the capital expenditure in the next five years. The Simulator Training Complex imparts training to PIA cockpit crew as well as of other airlines at the most competitive prices and flexible schedules. The Training Centre is adjacent to PIA Hotel thereby providing security convenience and affordable stay.

The new flight simulator addition Reality Seven Full Flight Simulator supplied by L3Harris is the first of its kind simulator in Pakistan and will significantly enhance PIA’s in-house pilot training capabilities.

The simulator would lead to safer training and cost savings for the local airlines as they have to spend a significant amount of money on training their pilots overseas.

The state-of-the-art digital 7E Evolution Airbus A320 Full Flight Simulator acquired from L3Harris Technologies will be installed at the PIA Training Centre in Karachi.

Currently the national flag carrier operates 11 Airbus A320 aircraft. The simulator will not only benefit PIA’s own pilots who fly Airbus A320 but also other Pakistani airlines like Airblue and AirSial that use the aircraft. Pakistan has 670 Airbus A320 pilots.

The simulator will not only benefit PIA’s pilots but also those of private airlines

The acquisition of the simulator “is a wonderful step by PIA as it will assist all pilots who are flying Airbus A320 in Pakistan” said Imran Aslam Khan director of Sky Wings and an aviation expert.

He said Airbus A320 pilots must go through four hours of simulator training every six months. “Now the question is whether one simulator will be sufficient for hundreds of Airbus pilots” he wondered.

Mr Aslam said that sending a pilot abroad for simulator training costs between $400 and $500 per hour in addition to the instructor’s fee and other charges. All the expenses are borne by the airline.

He explained that in the early days the plane manufacturing company would supply simulators to its customers at a lower cost under an agreement but such arrangements were not considered by the officials concerned.

Over the course of almost 60 years the information age has given the world the internet smart phones and lightning-fast computers. This has been made possible by about doubling the number of transistors that can be packed onto a computer chip every two years resulting in billions of atomic-scale transistors that can fit on a fingernail-sized device. Even individual atoms may be observed and counted within such “atomic scale” lengths.

Physical limit

With this doubling reaching its physical limit the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) has joined industry efforts to prolong the process and find new techniques to make ever-more powerful efficient and cost-effective chips. In the first PPPL research conducted under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with Lam Research Corp. a global producer of chip-making equipment laboratory scientists properly predicted a fundamental phase in atomic-scale chip production through the use of modeling.

“This would be one little piece in the whole process” said David Graves associate laboratory director for low-temperature plasma surface interactions a professor in the Princeton Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering and co-author of a paper that outlines the findings in the Journal of Vacuum Science & Technology B. Insights gained through modeling he said “can lead to all sorts of good things and that’s why this effort at the Lab has got some promise.”

While the shrinkage can’t go on much longer “it hasn’t completely reached an end” he said. “Industry has been successful to date in using mainly empirical methods to develop innovative new processes but a deeper fundamental understanding will speed this process. Fundamental studies take time and require expertise industry does not always have” he said. “This creates a strong incentive for laboratories to take on the work.”

The PPPL scientists modeled what is called “atomic layer etching” (ALE) an increasingly critical fabrication step that aims to remove single atomic layers from a surface at a time. This process can be used to etch complex three-dimensional structures with critical dimensions that are thousands of times thinner than a human hair into a film on a silicon wafer.

Basic agreement

“The simulations basically agreed with experiments as a first step and could lead to improved understanding of the use of ALE for atomic-scale etching” said Joseph Vella a post-doctoral fellow at PPPL and lead author of the journal paper. Improved understanding will enable PPPL to investigate such things as the extent of surface damage and the degree of roughness developed during ALE he said “and this all starts with building our fundamental understanding of atomic layer etching.”

The model simulated the sequential use of chlorine gas and argon plasma ions to control the silicon etch process on an atomic scale. Plasma or ionized gas is a mixture consisting of free electrons positively charged ions and neutral molecules. The plasma used in semiconductor device processing is near room temperature in contrast to the ultra-hot plasma used in fusion experiments.

“A surprise empirical finding from Lam Research was that the ALE process became particularly effective when the ion energies were quite a bit higher than the ones we started with” Graves said. “So that will be our next step in the simulations — to see if we can understand what’s happening when the ion energy is much higher and why it’s so good.”

Going forward “the semiconductor industry as a whole is contemplating a major expansion in the materials and the types of devices to be used and this expansion will also have to be processed with atomic scale precision” he said. “The U.S. goal is to lead the world in using science to tackle important industrial problems” he said “and our work is part of that.”

OpenSea Delists Sands Vegas Casino Club Gambler NFTs.

This month two U.S states issued cease-and-desist orders to Sands Vegas Casino Club for NFT sales.

Sands Vegas Casino Club reportedly sold NFTs to fund a Metaverse casino classifying them as securities.

It has been a mixed year for leading NFT marketplace OpenSea. In January OpenSea saw trading volumes hit a record high before a sharp decline through February and March.

NFT market conditions have improved in April with OpenSea Ethereum (ETH) based NFT trading volumes already sitting above March levels.

According to Dune Analytics Ethereum-based NFT trading volume for April sits at $2.68bn with a week to go. For March trading volumes stood at $2.49bn.

With NFT market conditions improving OpenSea appears to be taking a more cautious approach to avoid regulatory fallout.

OpenSea Delists Sands Vegas Casino Club NFT Sales

This week OpenSea suspended the sale of Sands Vegas Casino Club Gambler Ape NFTs. This time last week OpenSea continued to allow the trading of the Gambler NFTs despite regulatory action against the virtual casino.

According to the Sand Vegas roadmap Sand Vegas Casino acquired 27 plots in Sandbox in January 2022. The virtual casino aimed to meet all regulatory/legal requirements between March and August 2022.

The OpenSea Help Center states that it delists NFTs if it determines the NFT to:

The delisting will cut a funding source for the virtual casino.

Owners of the Gambler NFTs purportedly share in half the casino profits generated.

The OpenSea delisting follows the cease & desist orders from the states of Texas and Alabama.

While the casino website is still up and running and states that the SVCC NFTs are sold out the Twitter account @sandsvegascasino no longer exists.

Alabama and Texas Issue Sands Vegas Cease-and-Desist Orders

This month FX Empire reported on Alabama and Texas issuing Sands Vegas Casino Club with cease-and-desist orders.

The two states said that the online casino sold NFTs to fund operations. According to the state laws of Alabama and Texas the NFTs constituted an illegal securities offering.

The Texas State Securities Board press release stated that the virtual casino offered

“11111 Gambler NFTs in connection with their development metaverse casinos in popular metaverses such as the Sandbox (SAND) Decentraland (MANA) Infinity Void and NFT Worlds.”

Story continues

The press release went on to say

“Gamblers acting through avatars can enter the metaverse casino and play poker and other games using cryptocurrencies. Purchasers of the Gambler NFTs profit from these operations. Not only do they become owners of the metaverse casinos but they also purportedly share in half the profits generated.”

The project is on 35 acres that were annexed into the city in February northwest of the intersection of Timberline and Trilby roads.

The hearing officer also approved two modifications to the planned development: one that would reduce the number of solar-oriented lots and allow front- and rear-loaded two-family dwellings to be classified as two different housing types.

Fort Collins requires a certain percentage of homes to be oriented in a solar-friendly way and requires four or more different housing types on projects larger than 30 acres.

Steve Schroyer of Schroyer Resources who represents AADT Land Holdings said the long narrow site and the city-required block-and-grid layout for homes made it difficult to meet the solar requirement.

AADT is under contract with Lennar Homes to build the project.

Housing news:Parklane Mobile Home Park residents receive $1 million from Larimer County to buy park

The site will be accessible from South Timberline Road and include a 1-acre park.

All homes will be for sale. The development will include 83 single-family homes 66 paired homes — some front-loaded some alley-loaded — and 48 townhomes. The project will be built in one phase and begin as soon as all the necessary permits are in place which are anticipated in late summer.

The project is in an area teeming with new construction including the Rennat subdivision and Hansen Farm developments that would bring about 500 new dwelling units to the area.

After Priscilla Presley graduated from high school she started spending a lot more time with Elvis Presley at his home in Graceland on the road and behind the scenes. The pair were madly in love and would rarely be seen without one another. But Priscilla recalled their relationship was not always perfect. She wrote about one occasion in which Elvis lost his temper and ""threw her onto the bed"".

Priscilla penned the details of her relationship with Elvis in her 1985 memoir Elvis and Me. She explained how the pair would have play fights over ""who would hit the hardest"". And on one occasion they had just indulged in drugs she called ""uppers"" before starting to throw pillows at the King's face. With newfound excitement running through her veins she got out of hand quickly. Elvis was doing his best to duck out of the way of the pillows Priscilla was launching at his face but eventually one connected. Elvis was not happy.

The four-year two-month contract takes effect Monday April 25.

IAM members at the Fort Worth facility build the F-35 the world’s most advanced multi-role fighter. The IAM has long championed continued support for the F-35 program.

The new contract includes:

– 16% effective general wage increase over the life of the contract

– Additional cost-of-living adjustments and a $1000 yearly cost-of-living supplement

– Improvements to retirement plan and maintains strong healthcare plan

– $4000 ratification bonus

– Improvements in field pay annual progression raises shift premiums and more.

The IAM District 776 negotiating committee unanimously recommended the proposal. Contract negotiations had been ongoing since February. The contract also covers IAM members at Edwards Air Force Base CA and Patuxent River MD.

“We have once again proven why the IAM is the largest and strongest aerospace and defense labor union in the world” said IAM International President Robert Martinez Jr. who began his IAM career as an aircraft assembler at the Fort Worth facility. “Our members stood strong and demanded a strong contract every step of the way. I want to thank the District 776 leadership and negotiating committee the IAM Aerospace Department the IAM Southern Territory and every department at the IAM Grand Lodge who supported these important negotiations.”

Negotiations were pivotal not only for IAM District 776 families but for the Dallas-Fort Worth community the state of Texas and the aerospace industry. The F-35 supply chain supports over 254000 jobs with 1800 suppliers spanning 48 states and Puerto Rico.

“We demanded an equitable contract that fairly compensated the best aerospace and defense workers in the world—and today we succeeded” said IAM District 776 President and Directing Business Representative Paul Black. “The solidarity and strength of our membership and negotiating committee carried us through this process.”

The IAM District 776 negotiating committee prepared for contract talks for more than six months including a preparation session at the IAM’s Winpisinger Education and Technology Center which included trainings on contract language strategic planning contract costing and a negotiation simulation.

“Our negotiating team made it clear that retirement security and increasing 401(k) plan funding was critical to ratifying a contract” said IAM Aerospace General Vice President Mark Blondin. “I’m proud to report that we have delivered on retirement security and much more for our membership.”

“IAM District 776 members are rightfully proud of the work they do to support our military” said IAM Southern Territory General Vice President Rickey Wallace. “Thanks to the strength of this negotiating committee and the membership we have secured a fair and equitable contract that will secure the futures of our members and their families.”

“I could not be more proud of the work done by this negotiating committee” said IAM Aerospace Chief of Staff Jody Bennett. “We used every resource necessary to achieve our goal—a contract that delivers pay and benefit increases for our membership.”

The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) is one of the largest and most diverse industrial trade unions in North America representing approximately 600000 active and retired members in the aerospace defense airlines railroad manufacturing transit healthcare automotive and other industries.

The facility — which last housed Bittner Vending along Miller Picking Road in Conemaugh Township — currently employs approximately 20 workers. But company officials said they are hoping to bring that number to 100 by the end of the year.

What does Lockheed Martin make?

For 35 years Lockheed Martin has had a presence in the Johnstown area. Its main location is located along Industrial Park Road in Richland Township where part manufacturing is conducted.

At the Miller Picking location the F-16 fighter jet is to be the focus.

Lockheed Martin quality engineer David Oswalt who was at the event Thursday said that rather than parts being machined at the Miller Picking location they will be assembled. He called it a ""structural assembly.""

From there Oswalt said the parts will be shipped to Greenville South Carolina where they can be used in the production of F-16 aircraft.

Cost of new Lockheed facility?

When asked what type of investment was made into the Miller Picking facility Lockheed Martin Johnstown site General Manager Wayne Davis said: ""We don't like to talk about the economic development.""

He added however that the investment has been significant in the ""millions.""

""We're here to stay"" Davis said.

Lockheed Martin jobs

With a tough economy at the moment Davis said that he has had former employees return to him seeking jobs.

If the current 20 jobs at the Miller Picking location are increased to 100 by the end of the year as planned Davis said that will bring the total number of Lockheed Martin jobs in the Johnstown area up to approximately 500.

""Our wages are very competitive for the area"" he said. ""There are so many job opportunities that are here now.

""The world is hungry for F-16s — it's a very strong aircraft. ... I tell the team all the time: 'The future is ours to earn.'""

U.S. Rep. John Joyce R-Blair County was at the event Thursday. He touted the area's workforce.

""These are careers"" Joyce said of the Lockheed opportunities.

LOW,Lowe's,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9tbGIvcmFuZ2Vycy9uZXdzL3RleGFzLXF1aWNrLWhpdHMtbmF0aGFuaWVsLWxvd2UtaG90LXN0YXJ00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas Rangers Quick Hits: Nathaniel Lowe's Hot Start,"The Texas Rangers have won back-to-back games for the first time this season and are now 4-9. With the weekend now here you may have a busy weekend like I do. So here are a couple quick hits to put the 4-9 record into perspective.

It's Still Really Early

Prior to these two wins the Rangers were dead last Major League Baseball in team ERA (6.09). Despite Taylor Hearn's outing in Thursday's win over Seattle the Rangers have moved to 29th lowering the mark by 41 points to to 5.68 ERA.

Now this is still not ideal. However two good outings from the bullpen and Glenn Otto's brilliant start on Friday had that large of an impact on the season total. There is still plenty of time to right the ship. And it was refreshing to see a pitcher like Otto who did not win a roster spot in spring training come in and put up the best outing for a Rangers starter thus far.

Neville E. Guard-USA TODAY Sports Glenn Otto Lindsey Wasson-USA TODAY Sports John King Neville E. Guard-USA TODAY Sports Adolis García (left) Nathaniel Lowe (right)

Get Lowe

Nathaniel Lowe has been the Rangers' best hitter through the first 13 games of the season. He's appeared in all games thus far starting in 12 of them. Meanwhile Lowe is slashing .412/.455/.529/.984 with one home run and nine RBI. His batting average leads the American League and his 0.9 BWAR thus far is tied for fifth. His total bWAR in 2021 was 2.4.

Now this type of production is not sustainable. However Lowe has done a brilliant job of taking what the opposing pitcher gives him. He's perfectly fine with slapping the ball into the outfield for a single. Also as he displayed Friday he can still do damage when he gets his pitch.

It will be interesting to see how Lowe handles the league's adjustment to him. His ground-ball rate is slightly higher than it was last season which is not a good sign. Lowe will need to hit the ball in the air more often if he is to really hit that next level.

The good thing is Lowe's whiff percentage is in better shape thus far. He ranked in the 60th percentile last year while this year he is in the 70th. And if Lowe continues to hit balls in the strike zone he'll get walked more. Remember his plate discipline was on full display last season as he led the team with 80 walks.

There are still 149 games left. There's a long way to go. But Lowe is off to a better start this year than he was a year ago.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL2hpZ2gtc2Nob29sLXNwb3J0cy9iYXNlYmFsbC8yMDIyLzA0LzI0L2Jhc2ViYWxsLXBsYXllci1vZi10aGUtd2Vlay00MjQtcm9ja3dhbGwtaGVhdGhzLWpvbm55LWxvd2Uv0gGMAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL2hpZ2gtc2Nob29sLXNwb3J0cy9iYXNlYmFsbC8yMDIyLzA0LzI0L2Jhc2ViYWxsLXBsYXllci1vZi10aGUtd2Vlay00MjQtcm9ja3dhbGwtaGVhdGhzLWpvbm55LWxvd2UvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Baseball player of the week (4/24): Rockwall-Heath’s Jonny Lowe,"Click here to see the softball player of the week.

The stats: On the mound Lowe is 8-0 with one save. In 48 1/3innings he has a 1.30 ERA a 0.87 WHIP and has 64 strikeouts. At the plate he is batting .390 (32 for 82) with 25 RBIs. He has seven doubles five triples two home runs and has stolen five bases. Lowe has helped Rockwall-Heath the top-ranked team in The Dallas Morning News’ Class 6A area poll compile a 24-3 record 10-0 in 10-6A.

He said it: “Winning on Friday was the best part. It was cool to go over there to win the district championship. … My best pitch was my breaking ball. I have a lot of confidence in my breaking ball and I can throw it for strikes maybe when the batter is expecting a fastball. … I have always had a lot of desire to win. That includes winning the state championship again. It’s go big or go home really.”

Coach said it: “Jonny was not only throwing his fastball for strikes on Friday his breaking ball was unhittable. It was awesome to watch. He has been a part of many playoff wins for us but when it comes to regular-season district game that was about as good as I’ve seen him play. … He has always had that desire to win and that goes for a lot of our returning players from last year. They figure they have reached the top of the mountain and they don’t want to fall off” – Rockwall-Heath coach Greg Harvey.

Did you know? Lowe’s father Sean also played at McLennan after a high-school career at Mesquite. A pitcher Sean also played at Arizona State before a seven-year major-league career with five teams most notably the Chicago White Sox between 1999 and 2001. … Lowe’s favorite courses in school are math and history especially algebra and U.S. History. … His favorite meal is sirloin steak (medium) with a salad with ranch or caesar dressing and a Coca-Cola. … Lowe’s favorite player is Los Angeles Angels pitcher/designated hitter Shohei Ohtani. Lowe said he wants to pitcher and hit like Ohtani as long as he can but he anticipates being strictly a pitcher in the long run.

'So when I moved here four years ago the tiny kitchen at the back of the house was an issue. It was dark with hardly any work space or storage and nowhere to sit or entertain - in fact it was smaller than the bathroom' she says.

'I wanted to extend and add light and my must-have was an island with a big Aga and breakfast bar. Finalising the design and planning permission took three years partly because of the pandemic but that gave me time to save up.’

Daisy wanted a traditional country feel but with feminine touches. ‘Devol’s beautiful green-black farmhouse-look cabinetry maximised the space and I added the pink china cupboard marble tops and pretty lighting to soften the room’ she says.

‘I moved out for six weeks during the building work which cost £100000. Everything went smoothly apart from the resin floor which turned out too beige. The colour just wasn’t right but we mixed some grey paint into the final coat of sealant which luckily solved the problem.

The kitchen fitting cost around £5000 and took about five days. It’s transformed the whole flow in the house and it’s such a pleasure to cook or just spend time in there especially now we can entertain again.’

Daisy’s top tip when planning any kitchen idea: ‘Check check and check again! I really believed I’d thought of everything until I realised too late that I’d forgotten to include storage under the breakfast bar. It would have been so useful but unfortunately it’s a wasted space’ she says.

'The island-breakfast bar combo was a really important feature for me as I love having friends here while I’m cooking. I searched high and low for comfy affordable upholstered bar stools' says Daisy.

'Sometimes we’ll light candles and have dinner together at the breakfast bar too. It’s the next best thing to going out to a restaurant' she says.

'I wanted somewhere for cookbooks plants a few photos and some pretty accessories to make things feel homely. The brass brackets tie in with the taps cabinet handles and electrical sockets too' Daisy enthuses.

'I really thought the layout through' says Daisy. 'My bin and dishwasher are hidden on either side of the sink and all the foodstuffs are in a lovely big pantry unit at the far end opposite the fridge-freezer.'

Thoughtful layout

'The new glass roof and doors have transformed the room. There’s a bit of an industrial feel to them - the grey frames tie in with the exposed brick resin floor and steel support beam' Daisy continues.

Underfloor heating frees up wall space and works well with a resin floor.

The marble work surface is extended to form a seamless kitchen splashback idea.

'The boiling water tap is amazing – instant hot water for drinks and cooking and no kettle cluttering up my work top! I wanted a big butler’s sink and the fluted front makes this one a bit prettier' Daisy comments.

Colour contrasts

Dramatically dark shades on the central island contrast beautifully with echoes of soft blush for added depth and a contemporary nudge.

'I was very tempted to have a completely pink kitchen so the pink china cabinet is a nice way to bring in femininity and that element of colour without totally committing' says Daisy. Cost-effective brick slips give an authentic character look.

It was a moment of happiness for ‘The Gypsy King’ when his younger brother Tommy Fury won his fight earlier on the undercard. But now it seems like he could be a bit upset due to the fact his best friend Isaac Lowe lost his bout against Nick Ball.

The featherweight bout between Nick Ball and Isaac Lowe impressed the boxing fans. Nick Ball defeated Lowe in the 6th round via TKO which was unexpected from Fury’s best friend.

The match was full of bloodshed and a continuous landing of punches by both the boxers. Sadly the officials abstained Lowe from continuing any further.

Moreover Lowe’s corner threw in the towel as well.

On the other hand it was a moment of happiness for the 25-year-old Ball as he fetched the WBC silver featherweight belt along with his career’s 15th win.

It would be a disappointment for Isaac Lowe as this could have been a great time to achieve a title giving a memorable farewell to his wingman Tyson Fury.

Tyson Fury and Isaac Lowe: The partners in crime

‘The Gypsy King’ shares a good bond with his best friend Isaac Lowe. Likewise he has always got Lowe’s back when he needs it.

The boxing fans have seen Fury present at the matches of Lowe. Moreover ‘The Gypsy King’ has cheered Lowe and motivated him to bag more achievements in his career.

Apart from boxing both the friends have a good time with each other in their personal life. There are moments when they are spotted relaxing together.

Well it must be a mixed feeling for Tyson Fury as his younger brother Tommy Fury won his fight but his best mate couldn’t keep up the expectations.

The night before his team had lost by seven points at home to a middling Charlotte Hornets squad and the Bucks’ new coach Jason Kidd was angry. Milwaukee who were hovering around .500 were slated to have the holiday off to spend with family but Kidd changed those plans and decided his roster should practice – as punishment. The players had to cancel flights and alert their family of the change – something of course they did not want to do. During the Christmas Eve practice Sanders went full-on. He didn’t lollygag but peeved he also didn’t back away from engaging his coach in confrontation. Afterwards while he was the last one left in the locker room his body started to break down.

“I was cramping from my ears to my toes” Sanders tells the Guardian. “Full body cramps.”

It was the second time that this stress reaction had happened to him during his young career and it forced Sanders to quickly seek medical treatment. Sanders was hospitalized that Christmas Eve and Christmas. He never returned to the Bucks practice facility again despite having signed a four-year $44m contract extension the year before. “I physically and mentally could not get myself back there” he says. “Nothing could get me in the car to go there. I had such a block.” The 6ft 11in center who’d averaged nearly a double-double and almost three blocks per game a few seasons before was now the one stifled. “I didn’t touch a basketball for the next two years. Not a shot not a dribble.”

Sanders was born on 21 November 1988 in Fort Pierce Florida and grew up “in the trenches”. There were gangs seemingly on every street in his neighborhood. His parents split when he was a kid and both suffered from untreated mental health issues. “They had all this trauma” Sanders says “all this pain. They were predisposed to a lot of violence [while] not understanding the power of therapy the power of meditation.”

As a kid Sanders loved to draw. It was his “getaway.” He wanted to illustrate comics and work for Disney. He had a deep interest in the ocean too won a grant to study oceanography and got to ride in submarines. He was tall but didn’t have any particular interest in basketball. But it was a basketball that would save him.

“Because I lived in the projects” Sanders says “automatically where you live there are places you can’t go [due to gang conflicts].” He found that if he rode his bike from his home to his grandmother’s or cousin’s house while carrying a basketball he was left alone. Gangs even brutal ones tend to respect the kids who can use the game to get out of the neighborhood.

“I had a ball everywhere I went” he says. “It was my pass. Like ‘Oh he’s going to play basketball he’s just going to the court. If I didn’t have that ball I would’ve constantly been getting checked. I would probably have had to attach myself to a gang to protect myself. But I didn’t even play.”

It wasn’t until high school that he began to really take to the game. He was already 6ft 6in by the time he was in the 10th grade but he was raw: In his first game he scored on his own basket. But he started watching the pros more. His idol was Tracy McGrady who played for the nearby Orlando Magic. Sanders wore arm bands like him modeled his game after McGrady’s. He soon managed double-digit blocks. Later during his 11th and 12th grades his team was dominant in the region. And as a senior he started playing AAU traveling as far as Las Vegas for games. It was the people he met then that he bonded and later enrolled with at VCU.

Sanders’ college team was a force. During his three years there his squad won 75 games and only lost 27. After his junior year he decided to turn pro and he was selected by Milwaukee with the 15th overall pick. Had he stayed in college he would have played for the VCU team that made the Final Four under coach Shaka Smart. Still he was excited for the NBA. “You shoot a million jump shots and you want to get paid” he says. But in the end the NBA wasn’t what he’d hoped it would be. “It was a blessing but it was also a lot” he says. “I come from nothing and then you become the one that has everything. People who are supposed to guide you become your dependents. And you’re too young for that.”

Sanders lacked a support system in the league and his personal life. “You get fed to the sharks in a lot of ways” he says. “You can find yourself in a very vulnerable position … It can feel like a setup it can feel like a trap. I felt so alone. It was so hard to even express what I was going through. At the time in 2012 no one said they had anxiety or depression – maybe Delonte West but everyone was outcasting him.”

During his second year in the NBA Sanders smoked a joint for the first time passed to him by teammates. The drug helped like medicine. But league drug testing led to suspensions rehabs and ostracization. (Today the NBA doesn’t test for weed.)

“Do I gravitate to some pills and other drugs or do I do alcohol?” he wondered then about substances that wouldn’t be detected. Not only that but his need to be creative was no longer thriving. He felt stymied. “I was yearning for support yearning to be heard. But there was nothing in the manuscript for what I was going through at that time.” Sanders became one of the first players to talk about mental health – though now thanks to others such as DeMar DeRozan and Kevin Love it’s a much more accepted topic. However when you’re the first to do something you’re often judged harshly for it. “There was no way I was the first one [to have mental health issues]” he says. “But I was the first one to speak up.”

Today Sanders is glad he did. Not just vocally but by publicly stepping away from the game. That choice led to conversations people are having now. “I have three sons that could be in the NBA one day” he says. “To have their mental health be respected – sometimes you got to be the one to step out on a cliff. But it’s worth it.” It wasn’t that he didn’t love the game it was that he didn’t have what he needed while participating in it. “My body and my mind are elite” he says. “But my surroundings and my environment just wasn’t.”

When he decided to walk he had two kids and he knew that if he wasn’t in the right state of mind he couldn’t ensure they would be either. Later he went to another rehab facility. This time it wasn’t one selected by the NBA for marijuana – though even in those he made close relationships with patients who were there for additions to heroin and other narcotics. This one was designed around therapy and emotional wellbeing. That was the last facility he’s been to since.

After two years away from the NBA Sanders sought a comeback. He worked out for a few teams and landed a contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016-17 alongside LeBron James and Kyrie Irving. But he still had a rehab stint he’d have to undertake for the league if he was to stay on and the team at the time had its own internal turmoil he says. He lasted only a handful of games before he was waived. Leaving the NBA for good despite still being in his prime in his 20s brought a great deal of criticism. But Sanders doesn’t stress about those comments. His philosophy is that if someone isn’t going to be there at your funeral why care about what they say? “One minute you’re larger than life” he says. “And the next [in their eyes] you’re lower than dirt.”

Still at his peak Sanders who is a member of and continues to work with the NBA Retired Players Association was regarded my many as one of the best defensive players in the league. He was stopping his heroes in the paint players he’d idolized. “I was their nightmare” he says. “I was like ‘I can really play this game. This game is really meant for me!’”

It took a lot to walk away from that. But today though things aren’t always “perfect” Sanders maintains gratitude. He also retains his love of creativity: he has a production company and a publishing company. He’s writing a memoir kids’ books a movie script he runs camps produces music has a foundation and a cannabis line and he even spends summers playing in the Big3. Sanders also keeps relationships with players who deal with their own mental health issues.

“Why I go so hard” Sanders says “is because this has to be a success story. I got to show kids that I made the right choice. That there is a way – more for us to do. That we can be successful without succumbing. All the power’s in the present.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cmVwdWJsaWMuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMTgxMzQxL3dlc2xleWFuLXByZXNpZGVudC1ub3QtY2FsbGluZy1wb2xpY2Utc3R1ZGVudC1nYXphLWVuY2FtcG1lbnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why I'm Not Calling the Police on My Students' Encampment,"The encampment now grown to roughly 50 tents may be fostering a sense of community among protesters but it hasn’t been kumbaya for everyone. Several Jewish students were outraged by the messages about genocide and freeing Palestine. Did this mean freeing the region from Jews? The expressions “Globalize the Intifada” “Glory to the Martyrs” and “Terror is justified as long as Palestine is occupied” indicated toleration if not support of Hamas an organization that justifies raping women and killing babies as long as you call them Jewish settlers. A few students showed up with an Israeli flag and were shamed on social media. Their counterprotest didn’t result in productive conversation alas. But it didn’t spill into violence either and my team did its best to make sure that was the case.

I’ve checked in with many Jewish students individually and sat down with a group to talk about their fears—and their complaints about faculty bias. Amazingly to them and to me a few professors took votes in their classes to decide whether they should hold class in the encampment. Minority rights? Not something these faculty seemed concerned with at least not until the provost reminded them that they could not force any student to support a cause with which the professor happened to agree. Of course faculty are free to support any cause they like but whatever political acumen they believe themselves to possess they are not free to impose this on their students. The Jewish students opposed to the protesters seemed glad to be able to talk openly about their concerns. I emphasized to them that I could not protect them from opposing views but that I could protect their safety and capacity to pursue their education.

There was some graffiti vandalism after the encampment settled in and we let people know that if that continued the university would have to step in. Fortunately that didn’t continue and so far almost all the protesters seem eager to find a constructive path: to make their arguments about divestment and about boycotts. They know that I have long been on record opposing these arguments but I will try to listen to them with an open mind. Ultimately it is the Board of Trustees that will decide about investment policy. Myself I am eager to find ways of supporting Gazan relief efforts and of doing whatever we can to promote a sustainable peace in the region that would acknowledge the rights of all parties. I’d like to think students know that.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUva2luZ2RvbS1vZi10aGUtcGxhbmV0LW9mLXRoZS1hcGVzLWJveC1vZmZpY2Utb3BlbmluZy1wcm9qZWN0aW9uLTEyMzU5MDc3NzUv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9raW5nZG9tLW9mLXRoZS1wbGFuZXQtb2YtdGhlLWFwZXMtYm94LW9mZmljZS1vcGVuaW5nLXByb2plY3Rpb24tMTIzNTkwNzc3NS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes’ Looks To Evolve Summer With $130M+ Global Opening – Box Office Preview,"The first Planet of the Apes movie under the Disney regime after absorbing Fox hits theaters this weekend with Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes poised to do $50M+ domestic and $130M WW.

After the dull opening of Universal’s Fall Guy Jesus God Saint Mary and Joseph let’s hope those projections stay steady. Apes plans to pull in the under 35 guy demo in a way that Fall Guy did not. Presales stateside of around $3.1M in line with what was the 3-day of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning ($54.6M) indicate a $50M-plus debut. That start in U.S./Canada isn’t far from the $56.2M opening of Matt Reeves’ 2017 movie War of the Planet of the Apes and that would be considered solid. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ has the advantage that it’s opening at a time with less competition than War of the Planet of the Apes. This sequel which takes 300 years after the events of War of the Planet of the Apes is directed by Maze Runner filmmaker Wes Ball. No Rotten Tomatoes reviews yet.

The last three Planet of the Apes movies at 20th Century Fox the latter two directed by Reeves all received A- CinemaScore’s. The Tim Burton directed Mark Wahlberg starring 2001 version landed a B- grade.

The $165M production is booked at 3700-plus theaters boosted by a two-week Imax run and PLFs. The PG-13 movie has advance screenings in Imax and PLFs Wednesday at 7PM and on Thursday starting 3PM.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is rolling out in 100% of its offshore footprint this week beginning Wednesday in France Italy Germany and Korea. Majors joining on Thursday include the UK Brazil Australia and Mexico. China Spain and Japan follow on Friday.

Current projections for the frame are at $80M+ internationally. Broken out that’s $70M from overseas excluding China. That market is increasingly hard to call and is also coming out of a very prosperous five-day May Day holiday stretch which saw three local films excel. What happens with Kingdom will depend on how those hold up — note also that Saturday is a working day. China at this point should be $10M+.

Looking at comps and at today’s exchange rates 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes bowed to $62M internationally ($8M was from China). In 2014 Dawn of the Planet of the Apes did $127M ($37M in China) and 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes came in at a $130M launch ($56M from China).

The other advantage to those movies were that they had 3D whereas the Ball version does not.

Overall the latest rendition of the franchise tends to perform best in a mix of the mature European majors Mexico Brazil Australia and Korea. While we do expect Kingdom to land several No. 1 openings it is likely in some cases to be topped by the continued play of a strong local title (think Korea for example).

Overseas promotion included a launch event at the BFI IMAX in London on April 25 with Ball Freya Allan Owen Teague and Kevin Durand in attendance. Andy Serkis who memorably played Caesar in the first three films of the recent franchise was also out lending his support to this one.

The recent trilogy of Planet of the Apes movies from 2011-2017 grossed $1.68 billion at the global box office. The first movie based on Pierre Boulle’s novel launched in 1968 and grossed over $32M stateside unadjusted for inflation. Several sequels were spawned in the 1970s. Burton’s reboot only made $362M-plus at the global box office and did not trigger any sequels. All in The Planet of the Apes franchise has minted over $2.1 billion worldwide.

Briarcliff Entertainment has Not Another Church Movie in 1100 theaters this weekend stateside. Pic stars Jamie Foxx as God Mickey Rourke as the devil and Kevin Daniels. Written and directed by Johnny Mack the comedy satire bills itself as “This is not a Tyler Perry Movie.” Expect single digits for the film.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVzaW5kdXN0cnkuYml6L2FjdGl2aXNpb24tdG8tcGF5LTIzNG0tZm9yLXBhdGVudC1pbmZyaW5nZW1lbnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Activision to pay $23.4m for patent infringement,"A jury has ruled that Activision Blizzard will pay tech incubator Acceleration Bay $23.4 million for patent infringement.

As reported by Law.com the May 3 ruling comes after the incubator began its legal action back in 2015.

The case filed in the US District Court for the District of Delaware claims that patents for networking and broadcasting were used in Activision's multiplayer title.

The publisher owes Acceleration Bay $18 million in copyright infringement for World of Warcraft and $5.4 million for two Call of Duty titles.

Jurors were asked two questions to reach a verdict among them was ""Did Acceleration Bay prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Activision's products as identified below infringe one or more claims of the following asserted patents?""

In response to the question the jury was then asked after verdict to ""reasonably compensate Acceleration Bay for Activision's infringement of Acceleration Bay's asserted patents.""

While the case against Activision Blizzard has been decided in favor of the tech incubator it has also filed similar patent infringement suits against EA Take-Two and Amazon Web Services.

In response to the ruling Activision Blizzard said ""While we are disappointed we believe there is a strong basis for appeal. We have never used the patented technologies at issue in our games.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhhd2FpaW5ld3Nub3cuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDcvbWFuLXdoby1yZWNlaXZlZC0xMjVtLXNldHRsZW1lbnQtaHBkLWFycmVzdGVkLWd1bi1jcmltZXMv0gFxaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGF3YWlpbmV3c25vdy5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNy9tYW4td2hvLXJlY2VpdmVkLTEyNW0tc2V0dGxlbWVudC1ocGQtYXJyZXN0ZWQtZ3VuLWNyaW1lcy8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man who received $12.5M settlement from HPD arrested for gun crimes,"HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - A 38-year-old man getting paid $12.5 million to settle a lawsuit with HPD has been arrested for gun crimes according to Honolulu police.

Officers booked Jonaven Perkins-Sinapati Saturday afternoon for allegedly firing a gun out of a moving vehicle in Kaneohe.

Officials say no one was hurt.

Perkins-Sinapati is the same man who was driving a sedan that was being chased by police officers in Makaha in 2021.

That pursuit led to a crash leaving him in a coma for weeks and five others seriously injured.

Perkins-Sinapati filed one of three civil lawsuits blaming HPD for the wreck.

In February the city council approved the settlement.

At last check Perkins-Sinapati has not yet been charged for the latest gun offenses. Meanwhile his attorney cast suspicion on his arrest.

The criminal trial for the four HPD officers accused in the case is scheduled to start in June. All have pleaded not guilty and are on restricted duty.

One-third of all new jobs worldwide forecast to be within travel and tourism sector: WTTC



By Lee Hae-rin



MANILA Philippines ― The travel and tourism sector is expected to create nearly 126 million new jobs within the next decade and bring the industry's global GDP back to pre-pandemic levels by 2023 according to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC).



The forecast was announced by the WTTC President and CEO Julia Simpson in her opening speech of the 21st Global Summit at Marriott Hotel in Newport City Manila Thursday.



""Over the next decade travel and tourism will create 126 million new jobs worldwide. In fact one in three of every new job created will be related to our sector"" Simpson said.



Looking to this year and the next WTTC forecast a bright future with both GDP and employment set to reach pre-pandemic levels by next year.



""The recovery in 2021 was slower than expected due in part to the impact of the Omicron variant but mainly due to an uncoordinated approach by governments who rejected the advice from the World Health Organization (WHO) which maintained that closing borders would not stop the spread of the virus but would only serve to damage economies and livelihoods"" Simpson said.



The sector's contribution to global GDP nearly halved due to the COVID-19 pandemic dropping from 2019's 10.3 percent ($9.6 trillion) to 5.3 percent ($4.8 trillion) in 2020.



However the WTTC 2022 Economic Impact Research (EIR) report forecasts the travel industry's GDP to drive ahead by an annual average of 5.8 percent over the next 10 years higher than the global economy's 2.7 percent growth estimated for the same period.



The WTTC predicts that the hard-hit travel and tourism industry will not only come back to life but also foster employment growth by 3.5 percent in 2022 nearing 2019's 10 percent and thereby taking up 9.1 percent of the global job market the report says.



Referring to itself as the world's most influential event in the industry this year's WTTC Global Summit was held under the theme of ""Rediscovering Travel"" from April 20 to 22 in Manila.



The venue was lively and packed with over 1200 delegates and stakeholders from more than 50 countries including 20 ministerial delegations and over 200 international media professionals joined the event in person surpassing the initial estimate of 600. Over 30000 registered online for virtual attendance a WTTC official confirmed.



At this year's summit WTTC's set of criteria for hotels ""Hotel Sustainability Basics"" was launched to provide minimum sustainability requirements and guidelines for hotels to meet certain sustainability requirements and improve their environmental impact.



The summit held panel talks on the following topics: seeking the tourism sector's sustainability in protecting the environment and local life and culture as well as accomplishing diversity equality and inclusion in the workforce.



Keynote speakers included: former United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon; 20-year-old Indonesian-Dutch environmental activist Melati Wijsen who launched a grassroots campaign to reduce plastic waste on Bali; American film producer Lawrence Bender a political and environmentalist activist as well as producer of Al Gore's documentary about climate change ""An Inconvenient Truth;"" and British adventurer Bear Grylls.



WTTC President and CEO Simpson argued in her farewell address Friday that the summit in Manila showed that ""nothing beats"" face-to-face interaction.



""We still have a lot of work to bring down post-pandemic barriers open economies and harmonize health data for seamless travel. But the future looks bright and the next decade is there for the taking"" Simpson said.



According to the Philippines' Secretary of the Department of Tourism Bernadette Romulo-Puyat Friday the country successfully hosted the summit with zero cases of COVID-19.



The next summit will take place in Riyadh the capital of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from Nov. 29 to Dec. 2 of this year.

Booking Lufthansa's first class is the ""holy grail"" of Star Alliance award tickets. Historically we've advised using Avianca LifeMiles to book long-haul first class flights on Lufthansa but today we're exploring a lesser-known way to book Lufthansa's first class.

With Aegean's Miles+Bonus you can book a one-way Lufthansa first class flight from the United States to South Africa for 75000 miles. And while these miles are hard to earn in the U.S. it's not impossible. Let's take a closer look.

Why it's special

Flying first class to Europe for 75000 miles is already a lucrative price point. When you can fly on to South Africa after connecting through Frankfurt (FRA) for no extra miles you've got a steal of a deal.

While the downside is that you'll run into around $1000 in taxes and fees using Aegean miles these flights routinely sell for over $9000 one-way. So even after applying the taxes and fees to the award rates you're getting over 10 cents per dollar on your Aegean miles for this award.

The same exact seat when using other airline currencies would cost:

How to book this award

Step 1: Enroll in Aegean's Miles+Bonus program

First sign up for Aegean's Miles+Bonus program. I was given 1000 award miles and 1000 tier points upon enrollment.

(Screenshot via aegeanair.com)

Step 2: Check availability and book

One caveat is that you can only book Lufthansa's first class Star Alliance award bookings 30 days prior to departure. Additionally award tickets in Lufthansa's first class cabin are far and few between. Still you can search for an award ticket here.

I found award space between Dulles International Airport (IAD) and Johannesburg O.R. Tambo International Airport (JNB). Unfortunately since Lufthansa flights from the U.S. arrive in Frankfurt in the morning and flights to South Africa don't leave until the evening there's a long layover in Frankfurt on most eastbound flights.

Once you find award space follow the on-screen prompts to finalize your booking

In the midst of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine China's largest credit card brand Unionpay has become the latest financial services network to suspend its negotiations with the Russian banks after payment giants Visa and Mastercard closed down their services in the country fearing the devasting sanctions.

As per media reports the payment processor is reportedly worried about being the target of sanctions from the U.S. and other countries if it works with sanctioned Russian banks.



These sanctions might include being barred from doing business with an American individual or company or importing goods to or exporting goods from the U.S.



Effectively the sanctions could sever UnionPay from the global financial system--which is a lot more lucrative than Russia's domestic scene.

Launched in 2002 Unionpay is a state-led financial services network operated by China's central bank the People's Bank of China and is the world's second-largest card brand with a 32 per cent market share according to 2020 data from the Nilson Report.

On Wednesday Russian newspaper RBC reported that UnionPay the Chinese state-led financial services network had suspended negotiations with Russian banks on issuing new bank cards for their customers now unable to make purchases outside Russia as a result of Visa's and Mastercard's withdrawal. (Russians could still use the cards to make domestic purchases owing to Russia's local Mir payment system.)

The G7 leaders have already agreed on a ban on all new investments in key sectors of the Russian economy.

When Russia's invasion of Ukraine prompted payments giants Visa and Mastercard to suspend services in the country Moscow expected it could lean on the Chinese alternative UnionPay to plug the holes torn out of its domestic banking system. However the plan now appears to have fallen flat as UnionPay has reportedly decided not to expand its presence in the country.

Both the Bank of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China two of China's largest lending banks have also stopped offering clients finance options for purchases of Russian commodities reports Bloomberg.

And Huawei Technologies--one of the few remaining suppliers of 5G technology in Russia after Nokia and Ericsson pulled out of the country in February--has suspended new orders of network equipment for Russian customers notes Russian outlet Izvestia.

UnionPay's hesitance to enter the Russian market is the latest example of large Chinese companies growing wary of doing business in Russia despite the fact that China has not officially joined Western leaders in piling sanctions on Russia.

Officially China has refused to join Western sanctions on Russia deeming them counterproductive to the peace process. Chinese officials have also blamed the U.S. and Western organizations like NATO for escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine US media reported.

Furthermore ""China doesn't want to give ""western countries any excuses for sanctions bans or boycotts"" Bruce Pang head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance Securities told Fortune last month.

China in recent times has advised its companies to adopt a ""cautious"" approach towards deals with Russia as the country appears to be succumbing to the Western powers who have imposed severe sanctions on Russia.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9maW5hbmNlL2NyZWRpdC1jYXJkcy93aGF0LWNyZWRpdC1jYXJkcy1kb2VzLWNvc3Rjby1hY2NlcHQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Which credit cards does Costco accept? | ZDNET,"'ZDNET Recommends': What exactly does it mean?

Boland Dames had a bye on the weekend.

At Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria the home side combined determined defence – especially in the first half of their clash against the visitors from the Eastern Cape – and clinical finishing to make a huge statement at the start of the 2022 season.

The hosts scored a try in each half both by wing Lynn Subke and kept out the Border side with some solid defending. Subke's first try was converted by Springbok Women’s flyhalf Libbie Janse van Rensburg to give the home side a 7-0 lead.

Subke’s second half effort was another fine piece of finishing and that proved decisive. Having had a sustained time on attack the home side finally moved the ball to the wing who managed to break through a number of despairing cover defenders to score in the corner.

Border will lament some handling errors while on attack and their inability to break down the Blue Bulls’ defence by varying their play will also need to be fixed if they hope to be successful. They also suffered some injuries which did not help their momentum at all.

In Nelson Mandela Bay’s Wolfson Stadium the EP Queens started strong against the newly-promoted Gauteng side but credit to the Mastercard Golden Lions Women as they managed to stay in the fight for large portions of the first half.

Byrhandre Dolf kicked an early penalty goal but also missed two in the opening quarter as EP dominated but the visitors took an unexpected lead halfway through the half as left-wing Maria Tshiremba set off on a blistering run to score under the poles.

Springbok prop Sanelisiwe Charlie soon restored the lead for the Queens when she crashed over from short distance to edge her side ahead 8-5.

The home side started strong in the second half two and wing Onesimo Mlamla was worked over following sustained pressure by the EP pack. A number of pick and drives committed the Golden Lions defence and Mlamla found some space to work with and score for a 13-5 lead.

The visitors came back strongly and enjoyed their best spell of the match and after being held up over the line Tshiremba again raced from out wide to score in the corner (13-10). Fullback Raylene Noubos then eased the nerves with a try in the corner after a couple of lineout mauls had the Joburg side in trouble.

A well-drilled DHL Western Province side started strongly in Durban and it was no surprise to see flyhalf Kirsten Conrad slotting the first penalty goal in the opening minutes. The Cape side enjoyed massive territorial advantage and when the women from KwaZulu-Natal were penalised for a ruck offense the flyhalf took a quick tap to score for an 8-0 lead.

That seemed to shock the Cell C Sharks Women into action and they managed good field position and after a number of good set phases left wing Bongekile Langazane was worked over the left-hand corner.

The Cape side started the second half with only a three-point advantage but continue to build on that lead as the match progressed. Springbok Women’s prop Babalwa Latsha was rewarded with two tries in a storming game. Latsha scored soon after the home side’s centre Zinhle Ndawonde was given a yellow card and the Capetonian pack drove strongly for a 13-5 lead.

DHL WP centre Chumisa Quma was red carded soon after for a high tackle but that did not break the Capetonians’ momentum and Latsha scored a converted try for WP to ease them into the win.

PORTLAND Ore. — A group of Portland Timbers and Thorns fans is calling on the clubs' management to take accountability for the handling of domestic violence and sexual misconduct allegations over the past few months.

During the 40th minute of Saturday night's game between the Timbers and Real Salt Lake F.C. at Providence Park some fans in the stadium held a demonstration raising signs that said ""you knew"" and ""sell the team.""

The demonstrators were part of a newly formed group called Soccer City Accountability Now (SCAN) which has been calling on Timbers and Thorns fans to join them in their call to action.

""Over the last six months there's been a series of scandals around the club that revolved around domestic violence and sexual assault by players and coaches towards players and players family members"" said Megan Rabone with SCAN.

The scandals include an investigation into former Thorns coach Paul Riley after he was accused of sexual harassment and sexually coercing his players which came to light last fall.

Another black eye is the team's handling of domestic violence allegations against former midfielder Andy Polo. An investigation by Major League Soccer cleared the team of wrongdoing but the MLS fined the Timbers $25000 for missteps in reporting the allegations.

""We really just want an acknowledgement that you did know these things were going on and you've made a decision and those decisions were harmful and that can't just go away with an apology PR piece"" Rabone said.

As far as what accountability looks like for Timbers fans Rabone said there are varied opinions.

""If you talk to 15 different fans around the stadium you're going to get 15 different answers"" she said. ""Personally I would like see the team sold. I would settle for Gavin Wilkinson and Mike Golub being fired.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmZvYmFlLmNvbS9lbi8yMDIyLzA0LzIzL3VudXN1YWwtcHJvdGVzdC1vZi10aGUtcHNnLXVsdHJhcy10aGV5LWxlZnQtdGhlLWNvdXJ0LWluLXRoZS1taWRkbGUtb2YtdGhlLW1hdGNoLWRlc3BpdGUtd2lubmluZy10aGUtdGl0bGUtaW4tbGlndWUtMS_SAbABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5mb2JhZS5jb20vZW4vMjAyMi8wNC8yMy91bnVzdWFsLXByb3Rlc3Qtb2YtdGhlLXBzZy11bHRyYXMtdGhleS1sZWZ0LXRoZS1jb3VydC1pbi10aGUtbWlkZGxlLW9mLXRoZS1tYXRjaC1kZXNwaXRlLXdpbm5pbmctdGhlLXRpdGxlLWluLWxpZ3VlLTEvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1wLXR5cGU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Unusual protest of the PSG Ultras: they left the court in the middle of the match despite winning the title in Ligue 1,"Soccer Football - Ligue 1 - Paris St Germain v RC Lens - Parc des Princes Paris France - April 23 2022 Paris St Germain fans with flares outside the stadium during the match REUTERS/Benoit Tessier

* The Ultras left the court before the end of the match in protest

They had promised in the week and fulfilled: a group of Paris Saint-Germain fans left the court in the middle of the match against Lens despite the team winning 1-0 with a spectacular goal from Lionel Messi and was securing the crown in Ligue 1.

The event took place shortly before the 75 minutes of play when expectations were already focused on the grandstand that usually houses the Ultras of the Parisian cast in the Parisian Park. Through a statement on their official social media profiles fans had warned that they were going to leave the court before the end of the match against Lens on the 34th date of the French tournament.

Although the cast of Mauricio Pochettino had everything given to raise the tenth Ligue 1 in its history four dates before the end of the championship supporters felt that the season did not live up to expectations after being left out in the Champions League round of 16 but not being able to fight in the Champions League Cup either. France (they were eliminated by Nice in the round of 16) and lose the French Super Cup against Lille.

“In the next PSG-Lens match our club could be crowned French champions for the tenth time in its history. In this event we invite all Parisian fans to come and celebrate the title with us outside the stadium against Virage Auteuil from the 75th minute onwards if the score is favorable to us. We will leave the rostrum to meet in front of Virage Auteuil to celebrate the end of a season in which only fans were up to the task” he announced in the statement.

At 75 minutes they complied and a group left the stadium seats. To top it off Corentin Jean scored the tie for Lens when regular time was up and put PSG's coronation at risk.

Finally with the 1-1 draw the French capital team won the tenth Ligue 1 in its history to beat Olympique Marseille and match what was done by Saint-Étienne. It should be noted that after celebrating in 1986 and 1994 PSG won eight of its ten titles from 2013 onwards.

the change of coaches to Spaniard Jorge Duenas did not have the effect Slovakia had hoped for. Under Duenas Slovakia lost all four qualifiers

this was Hungary’s second consecutive win in this group against Slovakia who have only been part of the Women's EHF EURO twice (1994 and 2014)

pulling ahead easily from 4:4 to 11:6 was the initial key for the hosts. At the break the gap was already a decisive seven goals. In the end 12 different players were on the scoreboard for Hungary

Hungary's margin did not fall below five goals in the second half but it was mostly seven or eight

one key for Hungary was the outstanding performance of goalkeeper Melinda Szikora who made 14 saves at a 48 per cent rate Now THAT'S a buzzer-beater! 🇭🇺🔥⏲️ #playwithheart @MKSZhandball pic.twitter.com/boPHjA2600 — EHF EURO (@EHFEURO) April 24 2022

Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDYzMDQ2Ni1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtc2VuYXRlLWJvYi1jYXNleS1kYXZpZC1tY2Nvcm1pY2sv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80NjMwNDY2LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zZW5hdGUtYm9iLWNhc2V5LWRhdmlkLW1jY29ybWljay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casey leads GOP rival in Pennsylvania Senate race: Poll,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4630466-pennsylvania-senate-bob-casey-david-mccormick/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDYzMDQ2Ni1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtc2VuYXRlLWJvYi1jYXNleS1kYXZpZC1tY2Nvcm1pY2sv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80NjMwNDY2LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zZW5hdGUtYm9iLWNhc2V5LWRhdmlkLW1jY29ybWljay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTkvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvZGF2ZS1tY2Nvcm1pY2stZmFybS1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This G.O.P. Senate Candidate Says He Grew Up on a Family Farm. Not Exactly.,"David McCormick’s origin story goes something like this: He grew up in rural Pennsylvania southwest of Scranton. He baled hay trimmed Christmas trees and otherwise worked on his family’s farm. And from those humble beginnings he rose to achieve the American dream.

“I spent most of my life in Pennsylvania growing up in Bloomsburg on my family’s farm” Mr. McCormick now a Republican candidate for Senate told Pittsburgh Quarterly in 2022.

“I’ve truly lived the American dream” he wrote in a fund-raising appeal in October. “My life’s journey — from growing up on a farm in Bloomsburg to graduating from West Point and serving in the 82nd Airborne Division growing a business in Pittsburgh and serving at the highest levels of government — reflects that.”

“I grew up on a family farm from the time I was a kid” he said at the Pennsylvania farm show in January.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RydW1wLWJpZGVuLW1jY29ybWljay1jYXNleS1zZW5hdGUtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXByaW1hcnktMTI0ODRlNjVhNjhmNDM2NGZlYzUxZWM1ZDQ2MGU1MzjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casey and McCormick to face each other as nominees in Pennsylvania's high-stakes US Senate contest,"HARRISBURG Pa. (AP) — Democratic Sen. Bob Casey and Republican challenger David McCormick will face each other in Pennsylvania’s high-stakes U.S. Senate contest this fall as Tuesday’s primary election put the men on track for a race that is expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars and help decide control of the Senate next year.

Casey and McCormick won their respective party primary contests after they were uncontested and now enter what is likely to be a grueling expensive and hard-fought 2024 general election campaign that culminates in the Nov. 5 vote.

Casey seeking his fourth term is perhaps Pennsylvania’s best-known politician and a stalwart of the presidential swing state’s Democratic Party — the son of a former two-term governor and Pennsylvania’s longest-ever serving Democrat in the Senate.

McCormick is a two-time Senate challenger a former hedge fund CEO and a Pennsylvania native who spent $14 million of his own money only to lose narrowly to celebrity heart surgeon Dr. Mehmet Oz in 2022’s seven-way GOP primary. Oz then lost to Democratic Sen. John Fetterman in a pivotal Senate contest.

This time around McCormick has consolidated the party around his candidacy and is backed by a super PAC that’s already reported raising more than $20 million much of it from securities-trading billionaires.

What to know about the 2024 Election

The Associated Press is the most trusted source of information on election night with a history of accuracy dating to 1848. Read the latest: Follow AP’s complete coverage of this year’s election.

McCormick’s candidacy is shaping up as the strongest challenge to Casey in his three reelection bids. McCormick has worked to shore up support in the GOP base and on Tuesday night hammered his message at his election night gathering in Pittsburgh that Casey is a do-nothing senator.

“We’re now turning to the general election and here’s the truth: Pennsylvania deserves better than Bob Casey You deserve better” McCormick said. “Bob Casey’s defining achievement in his political life 30 years in political office has been to be the son of Bob Casey Sr. That is what defines his political career.”

Casey in Washington on Tuesday to cast votes in favor of $95 billion in war aid to Ukraine Israel and Taiwan said on social media that “there are 196 days until the general election and we’re going to win.” Meanwhile the state Democratic Party unveiled a minute-long digital ad slamming McCormick as a “millionaire hedge fund executive who is lying to Pennsylvanians.”

The Senate candidates will share a ticket with candidates for president in a state that is critical to whether Democrats can maintain control of the White House and the Senate.

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump won their party nominations easily after all major rivals dropped out. Both men made campaign trips to swing-state Pennsylvania in recent days and voters can expect to see plenty of them their TV ads and their surrogates campaigning over the next six months in a state that swung from Trump in 2016 to Biden in 2020.

Of note however could be the number of “ uncommitted ” write-in votes cast in the Democratic primary to protest Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war.

In the Senate contest Democrats have attacked McCormick’s opposition to abortion rights his frequent trips to Connecticut’s ritzy “Gold Coast ” where he keeps a family home and the focus on investing in China during his dozen years as an executive at the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates including as CEO.

Casey has been a key player for Democrats trying to reframe the election-year narrative about the economy by attacking “greedflation” — a blunt term for corporations that jack up prices and rip off shoppers to maximize profits — as fast-rising prices over the past three years have opened a big soft spot in 2024 for Democrats. Indications that the U.S. economy avoided a recession amid efforts to manage inflation have yet to translate into voter enthusiasm for Biden.

McCormick meanwhile has accused Casey of rubber-stamping harmful immigration economic energy and national security policies of Biden and made a bid for Jewish voters by traveling to the Israel-Gaza border and arguing that Biden hasn’t backed Israel strongly enough in the Israel-Hamas war.

Casey is one of Biden’s strongest allies in Congress. McCormick and Trump have endorsed each other but are an awkward duo atop the GOP’s ticket after Trump savaged McCormick in 2022’s primary in a successful bid to lift Oz to his primary win.

Democrats currently hold a Senate majority by the narrowest of margins but face a difficult 2024 Senate map that requires them to defend incumbents in the red states of Montana and Ohio and fight for open seats with new candidates in Michigan and West Virginia.

A Casey loss could guarantee Republican control of the Senate.

Elsewhere on the ballot Tuesday Pennsylvanians decided nominees for an open attorney general’s office and two other statewide offices — treasurer and auditor general — plus all 17 of the state’s U.S. House seats.

For attorney general Republicans nominated Dave Sunday York County’s district attorney in a two-way race while Democrats nominated former state Auditor General Eugene DePasquale of Pittsburgh in a five-person primary field.

Democrats also nominated Erin McClelland a two-time congressional candidate in suburban Pittsburgh who has helped run various human services organizations to challenge Republican state Treasurer Stacy Garrity and they nominated state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta of Philadelphia to challenge Republican state Auditor General Tim DeFoor. McClelland prevailed despite being heavily outspent by her party-endorsed rival.

For Congress 44 candidates were on ballots including all 17 incumbents. All three incumbents facing primary challengers — Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick in suburban Philadelphia and Democratic Reps. Dwight Evans in Philadelphia and Summer Lee in a Pittsburgh-based district — won their races.

Lee’s primary against challenger Bhavini Patel has shaped up as an early test of whether Israel’s war with Gaza poses political threats to progressive Democrats in Congress who have criticized how it has been handled.

Republicans nominated state Rep. Ryan Mackenzie in a three-way race to challenge Democratic Rep. Susan Wild whose Allentown-based district is closely politically divided while Democrats nominated former TV news personality Janelle Stelson from among six candidates to challenge Republican Rep. Scott Perry in a Republican-leaning district in southern Pennsylvania.

Perry has become a national figure for heading up the ultra-right House Freedom Caucus during a speakership battle and his efforts to help Trump stay in power after losing the 2020 presidential election.

""Bring back _____"" the chain posted on Thursday prompting fans to fill in the blank with their most-missed items. And fans quickly took the bait with the Tweet racking up tens of thousands of likes retweets and responses in a short period of time.

bring back _____ — McDonald's (@McDonalds) April 21 2022

Taking a peek at the comment section you'll find all kinds of things the public is hungry to see back on the menu—from the recently departed to vintage McDonald's throwbacks.

But why this litmus test now? Is the chain actually planning on bringing back a discontinued fan favorite?

The strategy wouldn't be a new one for Mickey D's. The chain has recently been on a resurrection roll bringing back popular menu items like the Szechuan sauce and the Spicy Chicken McNuggets—and having the two overlap for the first time in history. Indeed McDonald's seems rather amenable to honoring customer demands right now.

While fans have cast many suggestions on this topic—from Batman Forever–embossed mugs to 29-cent hamburgers—some items have overwhelmingly dominated the Twitter thread. And if McDonald's is listening here are some of the items that may be brought back next.

Snack Wraps

As an overwhelming winner in the number of mentions Snack Wraps are sorely missed. While it's hard to describe just why a Snack Wrap is so good it's clear that the world is in love with breaded chicken in a flour tortilla. (A little cheese and ranch? Yes please.)

In fact last year McDonald's had to dispel a rumor that circulated on TikTok which hinted that the Snack Wrap would soon have a resurrection.

Launched in 2006 the Snack Wrap targeted those who were opting for health-conscious fast-casual chains. For ten years customers enjoyed various iterations of Snack Wraps until their sudden disappearance in 2016 which was attributed to the simplification of the chain's operations. While the hidden lure of the Snack Wrap may never be unwrapped customers just want it back on the menu—now.

The BTS Meal

Related: 8 Worst Fast-Food Burgers to Stay Away From Right Now

The BTS Meal took the world by storm in 2021—and quickly became the most successful meal collaboration in McDonald's history. Devotees of the meal consisted of both BTS fans and fans of the two exclusive sauces—the Cajun and the Sweet Chili—that came with it. Otherwise the meal included a pretty standard combo of 10-piece Chicken McNuggets medium fries and a Coke.

To support the promotion McDonald's introduced a limited-edition line of merchandise and ran a television commercial among other things. The meal was so popular when it debuted that McDonald's visits were up by 12% in the United States during the first seven days of the promotion.

It's no surprise that the BTS meal has been on the comeback wishlist for fans. Not only did the sauces receive favorable reviews but the BTS Army wants an encore.

McPizza

The McPizza is a surprising blast from the past but according to Twitter fans would welcome it back with open arms. But the pizza actually did not perform well when it was introduced in 1989.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

When it originally debuted the McPizza had many issues preventing its success. The item wasn't logistically feasible as it was only available after 4 p.m. was made to order so it required a long wait time and generally didn't fit the theme of the menu.

While the McPizza seems to be a relic of a bygone era there is still one place a fan can enjoy its cheesy slice. Epic McD the world's largest entertainment McDonald's in Orlando Fla. still sells the McPizza 24-hours a day.

For the rest of America however there may be a glimmer of hope in this reply from McDonald's to a customer comment.

All Day Breakfast

There are plenty of McDonald's fans that can't seem to get up early enough to catch the chain's breakfast it appears. Besides asking for discontinued items some fans just wanted certain menu items to be released from arbitrary time restrictions.

During the pandemic McDonald's decided to limit its all-day breakfast hours to morning hours only. While there have been reports of some locations sticking to All Day Breakfast despite the rollback enough Mcdonald's discontinued the practice to warrant customers getting upset.

Sources told us last year that many locations were meeting supply and demand with breakfast. Where it was most popular it was served late or all day. Where it wasn't it wasn't. This was mainly due to the fact that breakfast just takes a little longer to cook than lunch which could make a difference during peak hours. As of last year McDonald's corporate has been working with franchise owners to decide on All Day Breakfast on a case-by-case basis.

Whether McDonald's will make any final decisions about whether every customer should have the right to eat a McMuffin at 3 p.m. remains to be seen.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gzMmNoaWNhZ28uY29tL25ld3MvamFzbHluLWFkYW1zLW11cmRlci1kZW1vbmQtZ291ZHktYWNjdXNlZC1vZi1raWxsaW5nLWdpcmwtYXQtbWNkb25hbGRzLWRyaXZlLXRocnUtaW4tY291cnQtbW9uZGF50gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDMyY2hpY2Fnby5jb20vbmV3cy9qYXNseW4tYWRhbXMtbXVyZGVyLWRlbW9uZC1nb3VkeS1hY2N1c2VkLW9mLWtpbGxpbmctZ2lybC1hdC1tY2RvbmFsZHMtZHJpdmUtdGhydS1pbi1jb3VydC1tb25kYXkuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jaslyn Adams murder: Demond Goudy accused of killing girl at McDonald's drive-thru in court Monday,"article

Demond Goudy – one of the three men charged with the murder of Jaslyn Adams 7 at a McDonald's drive-thru in Chicago – is scheduled to be in court on Monday.

The girl was with her father in the car at the McDonald's at Roosevelt and Kedzie on Chicago's West Side in April 2021 when they were both shot. Jaslyn was rushed to the hospital by Chicago police but did not survive.

One of the shooters was using a ""Draco"" AK-47-style assault weapon with a ""banana clip"" prosecutors said. The car was riddled with bullet holes through the back window and trunk.

The other defendants in the case are Marion Lewis and Devontay Anderson.

From 2010 to 2019 opioid overdoses claimed the lives of more than 23700 Ohioans with countless others having had their lives torn apart by opioid addiction in other ways.

It’s not clear when the money will start to be distributed. Details are still forming day-to-day on how the money will be handled as the state and each region develops their committees and boards.

The state has been carved up into 19 regions.

There’s also a state board selecting projects that are submitted for approval.

The settlement which is scheduled to be paid over 18 years also calls for a continuous annual flow of settlement money meaning that the distributors can pay extra in a given year but that additional money will come off the back end so that there is no disruption of payments.

OneOhio the state’s plan to jointly approach settlement negotiations and litigation with the drug manufacturers and distributors of opioids has been incorporated into the settlement with 85% of the settlement money targeted for local distribution:

55% goes to a foundation created to disburse the money and fund programs that benefit Ohioans affected by opioids and/or prevent addiction.

30% is earmarked for community recovery programs at the local level.

15% goes to the state of Ohio.

In addition to the monetary settlement Cardinal McKesson and AmerisourceBergen must also make significant internal changes to help prevent a similar crisis such as give an independent clearing house their aggregated data on where the drugs are going and how often.

OneOhio regions

Ohio was carved into 19 regions which will each recommend what gets local funding from the opioid settlement. Counties in Southwest Ohio are part of three of those regions.

THE STORY SO FAR: After the newest clothing line from a white-run fashion company results in massive backlash from the African-American community Paper Boi is approached about taking part in a press conference in order to help them look good and get their groove back. Darius accompanies Sharon the white and female head of hospitality to a Nigerian restaurant called Eko Chops due to his hunger for some jollof rice. After weeks of separation Earn is reunited with Van who has apparently been exploring Europe and going shopping while doing so.

WHAT’S GOOD ABOUT THIS EPISODE?: “Get this girl a cigarette she’s freezing. Come on!” The shot revealing what Marcello’s Central Park-inspired clothing line actually looks like and the fact that it actually has “Central Park 5” printed on the clothing. Earn and Paper Boi’s brief reference to the rumors about Tommy Hilfiger being racist towards Black people followed by Paper Boi’s comment that Marcello looks like Drop Dead Fred. Darius’ description of jollof rice: “It’s as if your taste buds are being scammed by a Nigerian prince at a Burna concert.” Paper Boi finding out that he won’t be paid for this and immediately letting Marcello know what it will cost for him to play along and do what’s being asked of him. Earn: “You’re not worried about what the streets will think about you doing this?” Paper Boi: “Man f-ck the streets man! I’ve shot niggas!” The two of them conversing about whether or not Earn would or wouldn’t take advantage of a situation like this and then reminding themselves of what white people do to Black people who do everything possible to change the game by uplifting their community (“They kill them.”) Darius: “Who told you that [jollof rice was Ghanaian]? Was it a Ghanaian?” Khalil (a.k.a. the Atlanta version of DeRay Mckesson who actually got mad at War of the Planet of the Apes because he thought that one of the apes was based on him due to his tendency to wear a vest when he really wasn’t based on DeRay at all) introducing himself to Paper Boi: “So is this your first time apologizing for white people? It’s the best the dinners [at these press conferences] are amazing. I haven’t paid for a meal in 73 police shootings.”

The French reporter asking if racism will be over after the apology at the press conference and the responses that follow from both Paper Boi and Khalil. The look on Paper Boi’s face and his increasing exasperation when he hears the social justice activists/influencers he’s sitting down with explain what they want to do in terms of helping other Black people. (“I wish for ten tickets to A Raisin In The Sun for my charity and Julia Roberts better be in it not an understudy like last time. Oh and tickets to the Black Panther 2 premiere.”) Paper Boi confronting DeMarco (a.k.a. the Atlanta version of Shaun King who really really really should not be trusted with your money your attention and definitely not your money and a lot of you really should be listening to the Black women who have spent years telling you this sh-t) as to whether he is even Black and every other Black person at the table turning into this meme right here. (“Yeah it don’t sound right. It don’t sound right when he says it. Does he say ‘nigga’ a lot?”) Earn convincing the concierge that he and Van deserve a free hotel room after being harassed and racially profiled by an angry white woman in their lobby. (Van: “Are you staying here?” Earn: “I am now.”) The growing anger and disappointment on Darius’ face when he realizes that Eko Chops has been closed down and that Sharon is responsible for making that happen so that she and her husband could operate their own Nigerian food truck called Naija Bowl where they make jollof rice with raisins and cheesy jollof rice and is card-only when accepting payment. Paper Boi being pissed the f-ck off when he realizes that Marcello and company took all of his ideas and simply “All Lives Matter-ed that sh-t” by taking the Reinvest In Your Hood campaign and turning it into the complete opposite of what Paper Boi wanted.

ANY CAMEOS FROM THE CAST OF COMMUNITY?: One would think that Chevy Chase could’ve and should’ve appeared in this episode about white people who think they’re doing great things in the name of business when in reality they’re indulging in problematic behavior towards Black people that does far more harm than good but no. There are no Community cast members to be found here.

HOW MANY F-BOMBS WERE THERE IN THIS EPISODE?: Several and of course most of them are courtesy of Paper Boi who isn’t happy at all when he sees what the Reinvest In Your Hood campaign looks like and especially not when he’s told by Khalil that the American Red Cross is also involved and doing their part to help Black people in need. (“Nigga I know what the f-ck the Red Cross is! They’re the worst one! Them niggas ain’t never gonna see that f-cking money now!”)

ANY CAMEOS FROM THE CAST OF SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY?: No. Still no cameo appearances by Phoebe Waller-Bridge which really shouldn’t be expected anyway despite Glover’s insistence that the two of them are still friends.

ON A SCALE OF 1 TO “WHAT THE HELL DID I JUST WATCH?” HOW WEIRD AND TERRIFYING WAS THIS EPISODE?: This episode of Atlanta isn’t nearly as weird or terrifying as previous episodes but Darius’ storyline can and probably will make you want to flip several tables when you see how it ends.

ANY TIME-TRAVELING ALIENS IN THIS EPISODE?: I really do look forward to NBC airing another cheesy sci-fi show for Dustin to watch and recap so he’ll stop asking this question. Because no there are no aliens in this episode.

WHERE’S VANESSA DURING THIS EPISODE?: When Earn has finished meeting up with a friend in a hotel and then asks the concierge where he can find the nearest Apple Store he sees Van walk in with shopping bags in hand and who is still doing her thing without (seemingly) a care in the world. Earn then confronts her for being missing for weeks and not telling him or anyone else where she’s been all this time. But in the middle of their conversation Van is loudly confronted by an angry white woman who accuses Van of stealing a wig from a nearby department store and tries to physically restrain her Miya Ponsetto-style in order to make a citizen’s arrest. Instead she’s ordered to leave by the concierge and offers both Earn and Van a room for them to stay in free of charge.

DIDN’T VAN TELL DARIUS EARLIER THIS SEASON THAT SHE ALREADY HAS A BOYFRIEND?: Yes she did say that.

AND YET……?: And yet it didn’t stop her from hooking up with Earn (who worries about everything according to her) and then being gone once again by the time he wakes up in the morning.

TO SUM IT ALL UP: There have been some complaints on social media from viewers who feel that this season of Atlanta is focusing too much on white people and that it needs to wrap up this “Earn and friends handling their business in Europe” storyline and go back to actually taking place in Atlanta. This is understandable and sounds very much like the complaints that were made about the second season of The Wire and how the show started by focusing on a largely Black cast of characters only to end up focusing on a whole bunch of white people and becoming worse as a result. (Of course whenever I’m reminded that those complaints about Season 2 of The Wire still exist I turn into Maddie from Euphoria and can only respond with “Bitch you better be joking!”) And considering that this season of Atlanta so far has been just as funny and incisive as ever my response is the same to any naysayers about this series as well. “White Fashion” did an even better job of hammering home some of the themes its earlier episodes have tackled so far: White allies who only make things worse with their performative activism and who usually don’t notice or care when they do white people making unfortunate and easily avoidable mistakes when they are the only ones in the room where it happens and the only ones making the decisions and Black people being reminded that 1) All skinfolk ain’t kinfolk 2) Sometimes you have to be as just as sneaky and manipulative as white people when it comes to getting what you need/want/deserve (and which all goes back to Paper Boi’s “Niggas do not give a f-ck about us” speech to Earn at the end of Season 2) and 3) Black people gatekeeping the things and customs and places that we hold near and dear to us (in other words telling anyone who isn’t Black to stay the f-ck out of Black people’s business) is becoming more and more of a necessity. Because white people can and will take those things for themselves under the belief that they deserve those things and they can do them just as well as Black people can if not better. And also because gentrification is a hell of a drug. I’m both excited and terrified to find out what Atlanta will do next to continue dealing with these themes and how many more fans they’ll probably piss off as a result.

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

Vyjuvek is a topical gene therapy for dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa an inherited disorder causes painful blisters and persistent wounds.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

Here's how,"Every pharmaceutical company is constantly searching for its next blockbuster — the billion-dollar drug that dominates a market brings in hordes of customers and deposits hefty profits in drugmakers’ bank accounts. But with every blockbuster too comes its expiration date.

Pharmaceutical giants including Merck Bristol Myers Squibb and AbbVie are set to lose key patents on some of their most lucrative drugs this decade. As the clock counts down to the end of that exclusivity more affordable generic and biosimilar alternatives are waiting to enter the market — taking a portion of the giants’ blockbuster business driving prescription prices down and giving consumers potentially better options.

With competition closing in these pharmaceutical companies are bracing for impact. But they’re also prepping their own playbooks healthcare analysts and industry academics say — and looking ahead to both survive business shake-ups and stymy their competitors.

What is a blockbuster drug?

A blockbuster drug is one that generates at least $1 billion in annual revenue — although in more recent years their potential for profits have climbed far higher. Best-selling drugs like AbbVie’s Humira for one have reached annual sales of more $20 billion annually.

“It’s very hard to try to replace that” said Matt Phipps a biotech analyst at investment bank William Blair. “The reason these companies became as big as they are is because they found that one drug that really worked and could drive growth to where they are now.”

Many of these blockbusters are known as small-molecule drugs which make up 90% of all medications sold. Typically when a small-molecule drug — which has a low molecular weight and is typically taken orally — loses it patent it can can also lose up 80% of its sales in one year according to Phipps.

But the upcoming sweep of patent expirations is also set to impact biologic therapies — a class of drugs developed from living materials such as blood proteins plants and microorganisms. These drugs are usually administered through an IV or an injection. Because they’re more complicated to replicate the pace of their diminishing sales is different than that of small-molecule drugs.

In the case of Humira — a biologic used to treat arthritis and other autoimmune conditions — the medication began facing competition from biosimilar alternatives last year. In 2023 sales of Humira fell fell 32% to $14 billion. More recently Humira sales continued to fall 9% to $2.3 billion in the three months ending March 31.

Now pharma giants are taking steps now to prepare for similar revenue losses when their patents start to expire in the next few years. But Big Pharma also has a plan in place — and a well-run playbook for delaying or offsetting impending generic competition.

The first play: File more patents

“Even six months of a $10 billion drug is worth a hell of a lot more than the first six months of a new therapy that’s launching” Phipps said. “Step one is always try to maximize what you have.”

Because drugs are patented years before they get regulatory approval and hit the market pharmaceutical companies try to extend their exclusivity rights as much as possible. Drug companies do this by filing not only patents on their medications but also on the manufacturing process and even how a drug is administered. All those patents add up — and can delay generic versions and biosimilars from entering the market.

But recently this strategy has come under increasing regulatory scrutiny. “I don’t know if we’ll see quite as much of that [in the future] as we had in the past 10 years” Phipps said. In April the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for the second time challenged what it called “junk” patents or improper patent listings in the Food and Drug Administration’s Orange Book — the official list of FDA-approved drugs.

Melissa Wasserman a professor at the University of Texas Austin who researches drug patent law said this is positive development. “Those patents that are listed in the Orange Book can have a blocking effect” Wasserman said. “You as a generic can’t come on until you basically deal with every patent that’s listed in the Orange Book for that drug.”

Another patenting strategy the companies deploy: Combine drugs then patent those new formulations. In one case Bristol Myers Squibb is losing several key patents in 2028 including its best-selling Opdivo. In 2023 the melanoma-fighting medication alone accounted for 20% of the company’s $45 billion in annual revenue.

In 2022 the company launched Opdualag a combination of Opdivo with the antibody relatlimab-rmbw after the combined drug was found to have increased efficacy for treating melanoma. It was “purely a patent extension technique” Phipps said although the combined medication does make it a bit easier to administer to patients. But sales of Opdualag skyrocketed 72% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2024 reaching $206 million.

The second play: Offset losses with newer drugs

“Eventually all your patents run out and generic competition enters” said Mike Perrone a biotech specialist at healthcare management consulting firm Baird. What pharmaceutical companies turn to next he added involves relying on their internal pipelines.

After exhausting their options with patents pharmaceutical companies increase investment in their new and upcoming drugs to offset declining sales. But the timing has to be right given it takes a while for a new drug to reach blockbuster-status revenue.

AbbVie the maker of the world’s once best-selling drug Humira is a good example of this being pulled off properly. When the pharma giant lost exclusive rights to Humira last year sales of the drug fell 32%. But by preparing and launching new potential blockbusters a few years before the patent’s expiration the company has been able to offset Humira’s losses.

AbbVie’s Skyrizi a treatment for plaque psoriasis launched in 2019 saw its sales rise 48% year over year to $2 billion in the first quarter of 2024. Sales of Rinqov a treatment for moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis that also debuted in 2019 soared 59% to $1.1 billion.

Meanwhile Merck the maker of Keytruda — which took the title of the world’s best-selling drug from Humira last year with $25 billion in sales — is now deploying a similar strategy. The U.S. FDA first approved Keytruda in 2014 to treat melanoma. Since then it’s received approval to treat several types of cancers including lung cancer and carcinoma. In the first quarter of 2024 Keytruda accounted for nearly 44% of Merck’s $15.8 billion in total sales.

With Merck’s patent set to expire in 2028 it’s perhaps no coincidence that this year the company is launching Winrevair a drug for adults who have high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs. About 1% of the global population has the condition.

One more play: Snap up smaller companies and outsource

In one last strategic move pharmaceutical companies also acquire smaller biotech startups to absorb their drug pipelines. In effect the move allows them to outsource drug research and development — reducing their own financial risk as blockbuster revenue streams dry up.

“[T]he strategy over the past few years had been to buy things that had already been approved and were on the market so you don’t take any risk” Baird’s Perrone said. But companies have become more aggressive as of late he added — and have started to acquire startups based just on clinical trial results.

Take for example Bristol-Myers Squibb which is set to lose patents for three medications this decade: Eliquis Revlimid and Opdivo. Collectively these drugs accounted for 62% of the company’s total first-quarter sales of $11.9 billion this year. Perhaps it’s no surprise that in April during the company’s quarterly earnings report BMS also touted several of its recent acquisitions: Karuna Therapeutics RayzeBio Mirati Therapeutics and an exclusive license agreement with SystImmune.

In another case Merck — facing the expiration of Keytruda’s patent in four years — highlighted last month how it’s expanding its pipeline and portfolio of drugs with the acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics.

Ultimately pharmaceutical giants have had a long time to prepare their plays for expiring blockbusters. “This has always been part of the ecosystem in the biotech world” Phipps said. “You never have a true long-term outlook for something. You always have to be innovating.” In other words it’s business as usual.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9tZXJjay1maXJzdC1xdWFydGVyLTIwMjQtZWFybmluZ3MtMTAyNzM4NTA3Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck First Quarter 2024 Earnings: Beats Expectations,"Merck (NYSE:MRK) First Quarter 2024 Results

META,Meta Platforms,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzQvMjMvMjMwMzY5NzYvZXUtZGlnaXRhbC1zZXJ2aWNlcy1hY3QtZmluYWxpemVkLWFsZ29yaXRobXMtdGFyZ2V0ZWQtYWR2ZXJ0aXNpbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google Meta and others will have to explain their algorithms under new EU legislation,"The EU has agreed on another ambitious piece of legislation to police the online world.

Early Saturday morning after hours of negotiations the bloc agreed on the broad terms of the Digital Services Act or DSA which will force tech companies to take greater responsibility for content that appears on their platforms. New obligations include removing illegal content and goods more quickly explaining to users and researchers how their algorithms work and taking stricter action on the spread of misinformation. Companies face fines of up to 6 percent of their annual turnover for noncompliance.

“The DSA will upgrade the ground-rules for all online services in the EU” said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in a statement. “It gives practical effect to the principle that what is illegal offline should be illegal online. The greater the size the greater the responsibilities of online platforms.”

“What is illegal offline should be illegal online”

Margrethe Vestager the European Commissioner for Competition who has spearheaded much of the bloc’s tech regulation said the act would “ensure that platforms are held accountable for the risks their services can pose to society and citizens.”

The DSA shouldn’t be confused with the DMA or Digital Markets Act which was agreed upon in March. Both acts affect the tech world but the DMA focuses on creating a level playing field between businesses while the DSA deals with how companies police content on their platforms. The DSA will therefore likely have a more immediate impact on internet users.

Although the legislation only applies to EU citizens the effect of these laws will certainly be felt in other parts of the world too. Global tech companies may decide it is more cost-effective to implement a single strategy to police content and take the EU’s comparatively stringent regulations as their benchmark. Lawmakers in the US keen to rein in Big Tech with their own regulations have already begun looking to the EU’s rules for inspiration.

The final text of the DSA has yet to be released but the European Parliament and European Commission have detailed a number of obligations it will contain:

Targeted advertising based on an individual’s religion sexual orientation or ethnicity is banned. Minors cannot be subject to targeted advertising either.

“Dark patterns” — confusing or deceptive user interfaces designed to steer users into making certain choices — will be prohibited. The EU says that as a rule canceling subscriptions should be as easy as signing up for them.

Large online platforms like Facebook will have to make the working of their recommender algorithms (used for sorting content on the News Feed or suggesting TV shows on Netflix) transparent to users. Users should also be offered a recommender system “not based on profiling.” In the case of Instagram for example this would mean a chronological feed (as it introduced recently).

Hosting services and online platforms will have to explain clearly why they have removed illegal content as well as give users the ability to appeal such takedowns. The DSA itself does not define what content is illegal though and leaves this up to individual countries.

The largest online platforms will have to provide key data to researchers to “provide more insight into how online risks evolve.”

Online marketplaces must keep basic information about traders on their platform to track down individuals selling illegal goods or services.

Large platforms will also have to introduce new strategies for dealing with misinformation during crises (a provision inspired by the recent invasion of Ukraine).

The DSA will like the DMA distinguish between tech companies of different sizes placing greater obligations on bigger companies. The largest firms — those with at least 45 million users in the EU like Meta and Google — will face the most scrutiny. These tech companies have lobbied hard to water down the requirements in the DSA particularly those concerning targeted advertising and handing over data to outside researchers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL25ld3MvcG9saXRpY3MvYW1hem9uLWdvb2dsZS1tZXRhLWFtb25nLXRhcmdldHMtb2YtZXUtbGF3LW9uLWRpc2luZm9ybWF0aW9uLWhhcm1mdWwtY29udGVudC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Google Meta Among Targets of EU Law on Disinformation Harmful Content,"Lawmakers in the European Union reached an agreement Saturday on the basic points of major legislation designed to curb negative impacts from social media sites and other digital platforms.

The Digital Services Act would among other things compel services including Facebook Google Twitter and others to crack down on the spread of disinformation on their platforms and to reveal how their algorithms recommend content to users. The DSA would also prohibit certain kinds of ads on the platforms such as targeted ads aimed at children or tailored to people's ethnicity or sexual orientation.

""With the DSA we help create a safe and accountable online environment"" European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. ""Platforms should be transparent about their content moderation decisions prevent dangerous disinformation from going viral and avoid unsafe products being offered on market places. With today's agreement we ensure that platforms are held accountable for the risks their services can pose to society and citizens.""

The DSA is one of two pillars of a major tech-regulation overhaul first unveiled in draft form by the EU in December 2020. The other pillar the Digital Markets Act received preliminary approval last month and is designed to address issues such as anticompetitive behavior. Both acts still await a final vote but major changes aren't expected. The EU has also passed the General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR which is designed to give people more control over the collection and sharing of their personal information.

With today's agreement we ensure that platforms are held accountable for the risks their services can pose to society and citizens. European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager

Europe has long taken the lead in efforts to rein in big tech and both the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act could influence efforts by governments worldwide to address problems around major technology platforms. The US so far hasn't passed any comprehensive laws to tackle such issues.

Under the DSA platforms that reach more than 10% of the EU's population would be subject to independent audits of the steps they're taking to prevent their systems from being abused according to a rundown posted by the European Commission. Other steps the law would take include compelling online marketplaces to help identify sellers of illegal goods and setting up ways for users to flag illegal goods services or content and for platforms to work with ""trusted flaggers.""

Companies that break the law could face fines of billions of dollars as well as possible damage to the reputation of their brands.

Major tech companies said they support the EU's goals but that specifics of the legislation are key.

""As the law is finalized and implemented the details will matter"" a Google spokesperson said in a statement. ""We look forward to working with policymakers to get the remaining technical details right to ensure the law works for everyone."" In addition to its massive search engine Google owns top video site YouTube.

Twitter said it looks forward to reviewing the DSA in detail and working with the EU. ""We support smart forward thinking regulation that balances the need to tackle online harm with protecting the Open Internet -- while also understanding that a one-size-fits all approach fails to consider the diversity of our online environment"" a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement.

TikTok said it's also awaiting details on the legislation. The company supports the EU's ""aim to harmonise the approach to online content issues"" and welcomes the DSA's ""focus on transparency as a means to show accountability"" a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement.

Amazon pointed to comments made this past June by James Waterworth its EU public policy director. Waterworth said Amazon supports the DSA ""introducing regulated obligations to ensure that services act against illegal content."" But such obligations ""need to be carefully balanced to provide certainty while allowing flexibility.""

Facebook didn't respond to a request for comment.

Credit: JUSTIN TALLIS/AFP via Getty Images

The European Union is working on more Big Tech regulations that could affect users in the U.S. and elsewhere.

On Saturday the EU announced that its Parliament and member states agreed to a broad new set of laws collectively called the Digital Services Act or DSA. Once passed big tech companies like Google and Meta would be forced to reveal how their algorithms work change their approaches to targeted advertising and more. The EU will have a final vote on the DSA once the language is finalized with the law taking place either 15 months after the vote or at the start of 2024 whichever comes later.

The list of provisions in the DSA is long and encompasses a lot of things about how Big Tech companies operate but some of the highlights include:

Mashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech space and science stories? Sign up for Mashable's weekly Light Speed newsletter. Loading... Sign Me Up By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy Thanks for signing up!

Forced transparency about how content algorithms like Facebook’s newsfeed work

The ability for users to appeal content moderation decisions like posts being removed

Unspecified ""mechanisms"" for big platforms like Google to adapt during public security or health crises

No more targeted advertising based on sexuality religion or ethnicity and no more ads targeted at minors

Obviously all of those would have big effects on those of us who use the internet daily. Plenty of folks would certainly love a peek behind Facebook’s algorithm curtain for example. And the ability to appeal your posts being removed if they didn’t actually break any laws or terms of service rules would be nice too.

It’s been a busy spring for the EU’s tech legislation groups. Just last month another tentative agreement was reached on a bill that would no longer allow companies like Apple to give preferential treatment to their own apps on their devices. In other words your iPhone would no longer assume you want to use Safari; and iMessage Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp would be able to talk to each other.

Finally while the DSA is a European law Big Tech companies might be inclined to just adopt the rules worldwide to save time and energy on creating different rule sets for different regions. A bunch of provisions from the huge General Data Protection Regulation law in 2018 made their way stateside for example. That said regional carve-outs aren’t unheard of either; SiriusXM gives Californians (and only Californians) a way to manage their personal data because a state law requires it.

Let’s hope tech companies take the lazier route and just apply the same rules everywhere if the DSA passes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd29ybGRjcnVuY2guY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLWZpbmFuY2UvcnVzc2lhbi1zb2NpYWwtbWVkaWEtdmtvbnRha3Rl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Instagram Nyet!

EFE/EPA/Caroline Brehman

Saul Canelo Alvarez is currently the top representative of Mexican boxing. At the age of 31 he became the unified champion of the supermedians and is considered the best pound for pound; however his career up the ring would come to an end.

On the eve of facing Dmitry Bivol Canelo spoke about the date of his retirement. And although he is not very close he was aware that this will happen at some point in his sports career. In a brief interview with the portal TMZ he revealed the time he has left to box and continue to reap wins before saying goodbye to the sport of fists and gloves.

Although he does not constantly think about retirement he stated that he hopes to stay up the ring for at least six more years because he admitted that the day he hangs up his gloves he will miss him completely as explained by the boxer from Tapatio:

Because of the age at which most of the fighters retire he was questioned about the subject but Álvarez made it clear that it is not something he has in mind immediately because he admitted his affection for the sport that has given him fame and success. For this reason he would aim to reap more exploits and leave a historical legacy for Mexican sport especially for professional boxing as he said:

“I love boxing I love challenges I love that adrenaline; I need to achieve everything to be in the history books of boxing that's why I'm here and I love what I do.”

Along the same lines of building a legacy before saying goodbye to the ring he added that everything he does for the sport and for his legacy: “When do you see the best boxer go up and down in a weight class and beat all the champions? I think no one and I try to do the best I can for boxing for myself and for my legacy” he said.

The demand for VIP service for the NFL draft can be summed up thusly: Are there enough fly-top tables?

These are big dining tables that connect to create even bigger tables fitting up to 30 guests for large parties. These tables are designed for the influx of dignitaries arriving in Las Vegas for the league’s draft spectacular. They often book more than two dozen guests at a single fly-top table then let the party roll.

Tao Group Hospitality co-CEO Jason Strauss is accustomed to hosting massive crowds on select Vegas weekends. But from turntables to VIP tables the NFL has super-sized the challenges.

“Now we might be running out of fly-top tables and I am having serious conversations about these tables” says Strauss who oversees the Strip’s largest nightlife and daylife company. “In 16 years in this business I have never had that concern.”

The Las Vegas NFL draft is expected to draw at least 600000 fans which is how many people attended the 2019 event in Nashville the last pre-COVID NFL draft celebration. Vegas was originally set to host in 2020. The vast majority of those tourists simply want to be near the festival-style events at NFL Draft Experience the concerts at NFL Draft Theater at Caesars Forum behind Linq Promenade or at the NFL Red Carpet Stage at Bellagio.

But there is a massive VIP crowd too and those folks have needs.

“We are seeing an outpouring of major big-group business in our restaurants and coming in to see our DJs and performers on draft weekend” Strauss says. “So we have draft picks coming in with their agents their groups celebrating where they have been picked. You have corporate sponsors like Nike Under Armor Verizon — every NFL sponsor will be in Las Vegas.”

The NFL draft is like a major title fight but bigger Strauss says. The event falls in line with the recently announced Las Vegas Grand Prix Formula One event set for Las Vegas next year the Super Bowl arriving in 2024 and the arrival of the Golden Knights and Raiders over the past five years.

“When you look at what Las Vegas has already achieved with our hospitality entertainment retail and culinary offerings this is just another stamp for the city” Strauss says.” We’ve been the entertainment capital of the world in so many ways but now we are the sports capital of the world too.”

Sports Illustrated’s draft party is set for Tao’s Hakkasan Nightclub at MGM Grand on Thursday and the magazine is also taking up VIP cabanas at Tao Beach Dayclub on Thursday and Friday. Super agent Rich Paul known for such regal NBA clients as LeBron James Ben Simmons Anthony Davis John Wall and Draymond Green (and also famous as Adele’s boyfriend) has booked Tao Nightclub on Thursday for his Klutch Sports Group party. Paul is expected to have several clients in the NFL Draft though it is not known whether he will actually be in town.

Tao Group’s nightclubs are open on Thursday and through the weekend in late-April a rarity during a typically sluggish month with Easter and the Coachella music festival diluting the crowd. Hakkasan hosts Illenium on Thursday Tyga on Friday and Lil Jon on Saturday. Eric D-Lux (Thursday) Martin Garrix w/ Justin Mylo (Friday) and Steve Aoki (Saturday) are at Omnia. Alesso and Flo Rida are at Tao Beach Club on April 29-May 1 respectively. All of those headliners are expecting packed crowds because of the draft.

Zouk Nightclub and Ayu Dayclub at Resorts World Las Vegas should swell with business too. G-Eazy (Thursday) Tiësto (Friday) and Zedd (Saturday) are the Zouk Nightclub headliners. At Ayu Jonas Blue (Friday) and Louis the Child (Saturday) and Breathe Carolina (Sunday) are lined up to meet demand.

Zouk Vice President of Nightlife Ronn Nicolli says “This is the result of Las Vegas is being recognized as a true sports city.”

Nicolli is originally from Ohio. He has friends who attended the NFL draft in Cleveland which hosted last year’s events.

“When I talk to people who are coming out to the draft — friends customers — there’s this excitement for it being in Las Vegas” Nicolli says. “There is nothing that can replicate the feeling of coming out to Las Vegas and really identifying that there is a sports culture that has now been established here.”

Nicolli is prepping for draft picks and their parties to take over the dayclub and nightclub at Resorts World.

“We are going to have a lot of young guys entering the league and they’re also coming to Vegas” Nicolli says. “This a huge day for them. They are looking to come to Zouk or do dinner that night and we have to take it very seriously. This is a very special moment in their lives. I’m excited we’re getting these calls. There is so much energy about this event for that reason to have these star athletes here for that celebration.”

Nicolli moved to Las Vegas 20 years ago. Far different sports scene in those days.

“I remember that there was a disconnection between the city and sports back then” Nicolli says. “We had had a minor-league hockey team (the Wranglers) maybe an arena football team (Gladiators) at the time. But trying to be present at the level of the NFL just felt like a disconnection. But now obviously with the Raiders here and the Golden Knights opening the door we just have a different feeling.”

Dustin Drai the vice president of marketing and entertainment for Drai’s Nightclub at the Cromwell says he has prepped for the NFL draft the same way he books Memorial Day Weekend Labor Day Weekend or New Year’s Eve.

“We’ve been planning for this weekend for a long time obviously for the 2020 draft and we have known for a long time this is going to be one of the biggest weekends of the year” says Drai the son of Drai’s founder and nightlife pioneer Victor Drai. “We have a huge lineup. We’re really going heavy with our A-list talent on that weekend and it is because of the draft.”

Lil Baby is headlining Thursday Rick Ross on Friday the controversial rap star DaBaby on Saturday and Tory Lanez on Sunday at Drai’s Nightclub. Patrick Cornett (Friday) Ross (Saturday) and DaBaby (Sunday) hold court at Drai’s Beach Club.

A longtime Vegas nightlife exec Drai says “People are really looking at Las Vegas as the entertainment capital of the world in more ways than they have in the past. It was a lot of concerts clubs a lot of shows and residencies that people came in for. Now that we have major sports leagues and teams calling Vegas home we are expressing all entertainment including sports. I think it’s very cool.”

Wynn Nightlife hosts David Guetta on Thursday at XS nightclub. Saturday he’s at Encore Beach Club. Marshmello headlines XS on Saturday. The star DJ is among the headliners in the NFL Draft Concert Series at Linq Promenade/Caesars Forum.

Wynn Nightlife is hooking into the draft a night before the first round. On Wednesday Encore Beach Club at Night hosts its “Hype at Night Draft Edition” event. Wynn mainstay Dillon Francis is the headliner. The experience overtakes Encore Beach Club laid out with illuminating football-themed décor.

And on the topic of illuminating Rob Gronkowski is bringing his Gronk Beach Las Vegas to Encore Beach Club on Friday. XS Nightclub and EBC resident headliners The Chainsmokers are the featured performers.

A four-time Super Bowl champ Gronk is also a champion of the pool party.

“You’re going to have thousands and thousands of people flooding the streets in Las Vegas just to check out the draft” Gronkowski said in a Zoom chat this month. “It’s probably going to be one of the biggest drafts ever because it’s in Vegas and who doesn’t want to go to Vegas?”

As a result a flurry of new airlines appeared in the US from the 1980s onward and some of them were particularly unusual. Let's take a look.

Pet Airways

Founded in 2009 in Delray Beach Florida Pet Airways was an airline exclusively dedicated to pets such as cats and dogs — or pawsengers as they called them. They flew without their owners in the main cabin of specially adapted aircraft in which the seats had been replaced with carriers.

Each aircraft could carry about 50 pets with ""Pet Attendants"" checking on them every 15 minutes. Before taking off the animals were given a pre-flight walk and a bathroom break in specially designed airport lounges.

The idea was that concerned pet owners would rather go to the length of flying their pets through a dedicated airline rather than having them on board their own flight in the cargo hold a practice the Pet Airways website described as ""dangerous"" citing extreme temperature variations and lack of proper lighting.

The airline operated for about two years serving a dozen US cities including New York LA Denver Chicago and Atlanta. Fares started at $150 and could go as high as $1200 depending on the size of the animal.

In 2012 the airline ran into financial trouble and started cancelling flights before ceasing operations completely the following year after having ferried about 9000 pets.

However its website is still active and a message states ""Flights to Commence Post Covid Hopefully Mid-2022"" suggesting there might be a second life on the horizon for the pet airline.

Hooters Air

In 2002 Robert Brooks chairman of the restaurant chain Hooters acquired Pace Airlines a charter carrier with a fleet of eight aircraft mostly Boeing 737s. The next year he turned it into Hooters Air an airline designed after the restaurant chain.

Its distinction was other than the bright orange livery design featuring a googly-eyed owl that two so-called ""Hooters girls"" were on board mingling with passengers and hosting trivia games with gadget prizes — wearing the same tank-top-and-orange-shorts ""uniform"" popularised by the restaurants.

They did not serve food or handle on board duties however as these were carried out by three FAA certified flight attendants.

The airline was based in Myrtle Beach South Carolina a vacation hotspot known for its golf courses and seaside resorts which had lost direct airline traffic in the general restructuring of commercial aviation following 9/11.

Due to its budget pricing and direct connections to cities such as Atlanta Newark and Baltimore Hooters Air attracted passengers of all kinds — mostly golfers and tourists but families as well.

However it was never successful enough to make money and ceased operations in early 2006 due to the rise in fuel prices following hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

The Lord's Airline

Strictly no alcohol on board Bibles and Torahs instead of in-flight magazines only religious movies on show and a quarter of the fares devoted to finance missionary work: these were the unique features of The Lord's Airline founded by New Jersey businessman Ari Marshall in 1985 when he purchased an old DC-8 that was meant to be the airline's lone aircraft.

The plan was to have three weekly flights from Miami to Ben Gurion Airport in Israel offering a direct route to Jerusalem about 30 miles away.

At the time religious pilgrims looking to reach the Holy Land had to catch a connecting flight to New York. ""The Russians have their airline. The British have one. So does Playboy. So why shouldn't the Lord have an airline all his own?"" Marshall said in 1986 according to The Associated Press.

By 1987 however the airline had failed to qualify for an FAA license because of unfinished modifications and maintenance works on the aircraft. Investors became nervous and removed Marshall installing a new board of directors to move things along.

The new chairman Theodore Lyszczasz did not see eye to eye with Marshall and the two started bickering in the press.

Eventually Lyszczasz and his brother showed up at Marshall's house demanding corporate records which resulted according to newspaper reports in a scuffle and Marshall suing them for trespassing. They were acquitted but the Lord's Airline eventually perished and the aircraft ended up being scrapped.

Smokers Express & SmintAir

The FAA banned smoking on all domestic flights in the US in 1990 but William Walts and George Richardson two entrepreneurs from Florida's Brevard County weren't happy about it. In early 1993 they decided to circumvent the rule by establishing an airline based on a private club. It required a $25 membership fee and was only open to people over 21.

The airline was meant to be based at the Space Coast Regional airport in Titusville Florida and the plan was to offer steaks and burgers on board with a side of free cigarettes.

Almost a year after it was announced however the airline still had no license nor a plane and although the founders reportedly claimed to have raked in over 5000 memberships regulators denied Smokers Express a license to operate making it disappear in a puff of smoke without ever taking off.

In 2006 the idea was revamped by German entrepreneur Alexander Schoppmann who declared the intention to start Smoker's International Airways or SmintAir for short.

Schoppmann who smoked 30 cigarettes a day wanted to launch a daily service between Tokyo and Dusseldorf his hometown home to a large number of Japanese expats and the European offices of hundreds of Japanese companies.

Both countries still had significant numbers of smokers at the time. However SmintAir suffered the same fate as Smokers Express: it failed to raise the capital required to start operations and never took to the air.

MGM Grand Air

Inaugurated in 1987 MGM Grand Air was a first-class only superluxury airline that initially covered a single route — LAX to JFK — using Boeing 727 and Douglas DC-8 aircraft in lavish configurations: the rule was to no flight could have more than 33 passengers although the planes could carry 100 or more in standard setups.

The airline promised no queues no check-ins and no waiting for luggage — porters whisked bags onto the plane and returned them at the destination — and even offered an optional door-to-door limousine service. Special lounges at both airports offered luxury amenities and a concierge service.

On board there were five flight attendants and a stand up bar as well as private compartments for meetings. A full meal service with fine wine and champagne was always available and the restroom had golden faucets and monogrammed soap. All of this was offered at just more than the cost as a first class ticket on other airlines.

Initially popular with celebrities and the very wealthy MGM Grand Air eventually opened more routes but was struggling to fill up all of the 33 seats on its planes.

Operations slowed down in the 1990s as private jets became more widespread and in 1995 the airline was sold and changed its name to Champion Air offering chartered flights to sports teams and government agencies. It eventually shut down completely in 2008.

No not the gesture some of you are probably imagining at this moment.

Giving new and potentially gruesome meaning to common phrases like “I lost my wallet” it’s really a step toward the next-next normal when we’ll part ways with devices altogether approaching a future singularity when we cause transactions to occur by sheer will.

Teenagers would argue this is already working fine without technical assistance. It’s called “incessant whining” — a powerful force that venture firms want someone to productize ASAP.

For now it’s about implants. The BBC reported in April on a fellow walking around London getting things with a wave of his hand and that hand was clutching neither wand nor gun. Rather it’s been equipped with a microchip made by FinTech Walletmor that’s implanted under the skin and when synced with an eWallet app can handle an actual payment.

Weighing under a gram and about the size of a grain of rice the chip needs no power source relying on near-field communications (NFC) the Purewrist wearable and the iCard digital wallet.

Before anyone gets worked up ask yourself this: “Does my pet have a RFID chip?” If the answer is yes then you’re already using a variation of this tech.

If your pet doesn’t have a chip consider getting one lest you end up missing one valuable pet.

Besides we’ve been toying with this idea for years although not in subdermal form factors.

Bio Means Business

Amazon One introduced in 2020 and known colloquially as “palm pay” is a biometric scan that recognizes your palm print and lets you pay by passing your hand over an optical point-of-sale (POS) terminal.

On Wednesday (April 20) it was widely reported that Amazon One is being added to retail locations in Austin Texas bringing total U.S. stores with “palm pay” into the 100 range.

If it scales Amazon is the company to make it happen. Still a big “if” though.

Biometrics are getting put through their legal paces with governments worldwide asking questions about all that identity data and how it might be misused or abused.

Maybe ask Elon Musk the guy who founded the company PayPal is founded on as well as some other well-known ventures (Tesla SpaceX) and could soon possibly own Twitter.

A few years back Musk sank $100 million into a startup called Neuralink.

According to the Neuralink site it’s designing “the first neural implant that will let you control a computer or mobile device anywhere you go. Micron-scale threads are inserted into areas of the brain that control movement. Each thread contains many electrodes and connects them to an implant the Link.”

We’ve heard rumors of engineers working out bugs and glitches like people simply scrolling past social media ads for luxury SUVs — and waking up to find one in their driveway delivered.

They’ll figure it out. It’s Elon.

You-as-a-Payment (YaaP)

Anyway Musk is hardly alone in his quest for mind control over devices vehicles and money. While we’re at it not everyone cares for the terminology springing up around the idea.

Biometrics innovators have been hammering away at this for years like the Big Tech folks behind that thumbprint scan and facial recognition on your phone. They like precise language.

In March PopID CEO John Miller told PYMNTS “We don’t use the [term] ‘facial recognition’ to describe our platform. We use ‘face verification.’ Recognition refers to technologies that are actively surveying people watching people. Our technology requires you to first enroll in the platform. You opt in on your phone and say ‘I want to have the ability to pay with my face.’”

This is effectively the digital transformation of what very attractive people have been doing for millennia — pay by face. They’re so stunning that just looking at them is its own reward. There are ways to monetize this effect but that’s another story for another time.

Which brings us back to London’s chip man. In fact Walletmor says it’s sold about 500 of the implants so you could be standing next to one of these eWallet cyborgs without knowing it.

Incidentally Walletmor’s site says “inserting an implant takes as short as 15 minutes and the procedure itself is minimally invasive and painless — it requires a minimal incision with the use of a local anesthetic.”

You can even have a body piercer do it. In fact the more you learn the cooler it sounds.

“The implant can be used to pay for a drink on the beach in Rio a coffee in New York a haircut in Paris — or at your local grocery store” Walletmor CEO Wojtek Paprota told the BBC. “It can be used wherever contactless payments are accepted.”

That’s more like it. Where do we sign? Seems like we should just be able to nod but whatever.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vc2NpdGVjaGRhaWx5LmNvbS9hdG9taWMtbGF5ZXItZXRjaGluZy1jb3VsZC1sZWFkLXRvLWV2ZXItbW9yZS1wb3dlcmZ1bC1taWNyb2NoaXBzLWFuZC1zdXBlcmNvbXB1dGVycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Atomic Layer Etching Could Lead to Ever-More Powerful Microchips and Supercomputers,"

Over the course of almost 60 years the information age has given the world the internet smart phones and lightning-fast computers. This has been made possible by about doubling the number of transistors that can be packed onto a computer chip every two years resulting in billions of atomic-scale transistors that can fit on a fingernail-sized device. Even individual atoms may be observed and counted within such “atomic scale” lengths.

Physical limit

With this doubling reaching its physical limit the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) has joined industry efforts to prolong the process and find new techniques to make ever-more powerful efficient and cost-effective chips. In the first PPPL research conducted under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with Lam Research Corp. a global producer of chip-making equipment laboratory scientists properly predicted a fundamental phase in atomic-scale chip production through the use of modeling.

“This would be one little piece in the whole process” said David Graves associate laboratory director for low-temperature plasma surface interactions a professor in the Princeton Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering and co-author of a paper that outlines the findings in the Journal of Vacuum Science & Technology B. Insights gained through modeling he said “can lead to all sorts of good things and that’s why this effort at the Lab has got some promise.”

While the shrinkage can’t go on much longer “it hasn’t completely reached an end” he said. “Industry has been successful to date in using mainly empirical methods to develop innovative new processes but a deeper fundamental understanding will speed this process. Fundamental studies take time and require expertise industry does not always have” he said. “This creates a strong incentive for laboratories to take on the work.”

The PPPL scientists modeled what is called “atomic layer etching” (ALE) an increasingly critical fabrication step that aims to remove single atomic layers from a surface at a time. This process can be used to etch complex three-dimensional structures with critical dimensions that are thousands of times thinner than a human hair into a film on a silicon wafer.

Basic agreement

“The simulations basically agreed with experiments as a first step and could lead to improved understanding of the use of ALE for atomic-scale etching” said Joseph Vella a post-doctoral fellow at PPPL and lead author of the journal paper. Improved understanding will enable PPPL to investigate such things as the extent of surface damage and the degree of roughness developed during ALE he said “and this all starts with building our fundamental understanding of atomic layer etching.”

The model simulated the sequential use of chlorine gas and argon plasma ions to control the silicon etch process on an atomic scale. Plasma or ionized gas is a mixture consisting of free electrons positively charged ions and neutral molecules. The plasma used in semiconductor device processing is near room temperature in contrast to the ultra-hot plasma used in fusion experiments.

“A surprise empirical finding from Lam Research was that the ALE process became particularly effective when the ion energies were quite a bit higher than the ones we started with” Graves said. “So that will be our next step in the simulations — to see if we can understand what’s happening when the ion energy is much higher and why it’s so good.”

Going forward “the semiconductor industry as a whole is contemplating a major expansion in the materials and the types of devices to be used and this expansion will also have to be processed with atomic scale precision” he said. “The U.S. goal is to lead the world in using science to tackle important industrial problems” he said “and our work is part of that.”

Once solely used in PCs and mobile phones semiconductors are now vital in cars kitchen appliances TVs smart speakers thermostats smart light bulbs and even some dog collars.

Microchip manufacturers are unable to meet the ever-growing demand – accelerated by families buying more computers and gadgets during lockdown – as it takes two years and billions of pounds to build each factory.

Severe shortages have hit production at multinational firms from car giants such as Tesla and Ford to appliance firms such as Bosch and Hotpoint and video games console makers Sony and Microsoft

Severe shortages have hit production at multinational firms from car giants such as Tesla and Ford to appliance firms such as Bosch and Hotpoint and video games console makers Sony and Microsoft.

Hardest hit are car makers which can end up with vehicles worth £100000 or more stuck in factories because they cannot get hold of basic chips that two years ago cost just £1.

They are now having to resort to buying washing machines and cannibalising them for semiconductors rather than wait six months with such expensive goods stuck in a factory.

Modern washing machines can contain several chips which allow the operation of touchscreen displays wi-fi connection load weight sensors and fault detectors.

Stuart Miles founder of technology website Pocket-lint said: ‘It is good old scavenger tactics. In this case a company needs a part that is vital for its finished product say a car and they have to get creative getting it.

‘You can imagine the beleaguered procurement team whose struggles to get a sensor are holding up products worth tens of thousands.

‘They probably had a Eureka moment but rather than being in the bath as Archimedes was they were likely putting the dirty laundry in the washing machine tapping away at its TV-style display to pick which cycle to use.

‘They rushed breathlessly into the next board meeting and proclaimed “I have solved it. We are going to buy 10000 washing machines and we can take the sensors out of them. What are we going to do with the leftover appliances? Let’s worry about that tomorrow”.’

The desperate tactics emerged last week when Dutch company ASML which sells chip-making machines to firms such as Intel and Samsung reported its first quarter earnings.

Peter Wennink the firm’s boss told investors a major company had informed him it had resorted to buying washing machines and tearing out the chips inside them. He did not name the firm but it is thought to be linked to the automotive industry.

‘The demand we are currently seeing comes from so many places in the industry’ Mr Wennink said pointing to the growth of the so-called Internet of Things where increasing numbers of products are connected to each other.

‘It’s so widespread. We have significantly underestimated the width of the demand. That I don’t think is going to go away’ he added. At present there is a year-long wait for ASML’s machines that print circuits on to semiconductors. It has a near-monopoly of some of the more complex devices.

Chip shortages have particularly hit new car deliveries with sales down on 2019 figures despite higher demand. Cars use 15 per cent of all chips made with each vehicle needing around 3000.

When the pandemic started vehicle-makers cancelled chip orders as demand plummeted. Other gadget makers snapped up the spare production space for laptops tablets TVs and smart appliances. Vehicle makers are now struggling. Chip shortages are expected to continue into next year or even 2024 with the market expected to double in value to £779 billion by 2030 according to analysts.

Manufacturers are gearing up to meet demand.

Intel last month said it is investing £28 billion in research and factories in Europe. TSMC – the Taiwanese firm that has become the world’s biggest chipmaker by supplying firms such as Apple Nvidia AMD and Qualcomm – is investing $100 billion £78 billion over the next three years while rival manufacturer Samsung is going further investing £150 billion.

RUTH SUNDERLAND: Proof global shortages are turning the economy upside down

By Ruth Sunderland for the Mail on Sunday

When the bosses of big industrial conglomerates are reduced to scavenging like Steptoe & Son to get their hands on vital components it’s obvious something has gone badly wrong in the global economy.

The very idea that global captains of industry are ordering subordinates to dismantle domestic appliances for their semi-conductor chips shows we are in the realms of Alice In Wonderland.

We had better get used to it though. The old pre-pandemic pre-Ukraine war world when the global supply chains that power modern economies whirred away seamlessly can no longer be taken for granted.

Microchips are a particular problem because they are at the core of all the essential machinery of our lives from cars to smartphones to fridges. And it is not easy just to ramp up production. They may be tiny but their fabrication is an elaborate process involving more than 3000 steps.

(As an aside the current supply crisis does make one question the wisdom of the UK Government which has failed so far to intervene in the sale of a Welsh microchip factory to China and which previously permitted our national champion Arm to be sold to Japanese investors in 2016.)

Unfortunately the supply bottlenecks go far beyond semi-conductors. They have even hit the other variety of chip – prices are going up due to a shortage of sunflower oil much of which comes from Ukraine. As for the fish that would have been served alongside it turns out we were importing loads from Russia.

Most people don’t devote much thought to the intricacies of supply chains. Until recently they haven’t needed to: stuff simply appeared when we wanted it. But the economic model underpinning such luxuriant availability may be vanishing before our eyes.

A combination of factors including Covid-19 Vladimir Putin’s vile aggression a rise in economic nationalism and climate change is playing havoc with the supply of vital goods and foodstuffs.

The question at this stage is whether it is a temporary setback or early rumblings in a seismic change to the global economic order.

For the past three decades the dominant assumption has been that the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Gorbachev reforms heralded a permanent triumph for capitalism and liberal democracy. But history has followed a different course – one that has torpedoed the just-in-time global supply chains that underpin our lifestyles. These cheap fast and efficient supply lines are only feasible in a world with open borders where goods can be transported without wrecking the planet.

Faced with war Covid-19 and global warming it falls apart. Even Brexit whether you voted Leave or Remain is a challenge to globalisation as is the rise of Marine Le Pen in France. Politicians are likely to continue to be devilled by supply chain dilemmas in the coming years. To mention just one rare earth minerals such as lithium are crucial in the fight against climate change as they are used in electric car batteries. So it is extremely problematic that one of the world’s biggest deposits worth an estimated $1 trillion is in Afghanistan under the control of the Taliban.

Future historians may look on the shortages and cost of living crisis we are suffering now as an ominous sign of difficult times ahead.",,,,,,

Samsung Electronics Co. is losing its hegemony in the global semiconductor market as a sustained leadership vacuum has kept the world’s top memory chipmaker from deciding on key future investment plans. Its Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee the key decision-maker of the South Korean tech giant’s long-term strategy has been on parole since August 2021 after serving 18 months of his 30-month prison term for a bribery and embezzlement conviction. But Lee’s parole instead of a pardon means he will be unable to return to Samsung management until the second half of 2027 given the country’s law governing special economic crimes.Some domestic business lobby groups reportedly plan to ask President-elect Yoon Seok-yeol to pardon Lee the de facto leader of the nation’s top conglomerate Samsung Group for the sake of the local semiconductor industry.“Large-scale issues such as chip investments and M&As need to be decided on by someone who is in charge of corporate management” said Lee Chang-han vice chairman of the Korea Semiconductor Industry Association. “Samsung’s decision-making power has weakened due to the absence of Vice Chairman Lee the top decision-maker.”Samsung’s lack of long-term strategy is expected to pose a risk to the entire South Korean semiconductor sector amid intensifying competition in the global market industry sources said.The concerns dampened Samsung’s share price. The stock of the country’s largest company by market capitalization lost ground falling to as low as 66100 won ($53.2) earlier this month the weakest since November 2020 despite record sales in the first quarter. Samsung’s semiconductor investment is also lagging its competitors' spending. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) the world’s top foundry maker announced it planned to spend $44 billion on capital expenditures this year alone. Intel Corp. decided to pour $20 billion each into factories in Arizona and Ohio as well as earmarking 80 billion euros ($86.6 billion) for investment into Europe to boost chip capacity there over the next decade.Meanwhile Samsung aims to invest $17.1 billion in the chip business by 2030.“Investors are concerned over Samsung’s uncertain future due to the lack of leadership” said an analyst at a brokerage house in Seoul.Samsung is feared to follow the decline of Japan’s semiconductor sector as the South Korean electronics behemoth has yet to unveil long-term visions and strategies domestic industry sources said.Until the 1970s the global semiconductor industry was dominated by the US with Intel’s invention of DRAM in 1971. Japanese players took the throne in the 1980s with high-performance DRAMs required by mainframe computers for corporate servers.Samsung aimed at the market of small and cheap products in the 1990s when personal computer makers became the main customers for DRAMs with the growing use of PCs. To cut costs Samsung reportedly took a bold move of using European equipment that had been less competitive than Japanese machines. Such strategies allowed Samsung to beat its Japanese rivals.Takashi Yunogami a former semiconductor engineer at Hitachi Ltd. said Japanese chipmakers collapsed and surrendered market dominance to South Korean makers as they were excessively concerned with top technology and quality failing to cope with the rapid changes in global trends.Morris Chang the founder of TSMC paid close attention to the late Samsung Group Chairman Lee Kun-hee with his success of Samsung Electronics’ semiconductor business.Samsung had Lee Kun-hee the current vice chairman’s father but Japanese rivals such as Hitachi Toshiba Corp. and NEC Corp. did not have such a leader Chang a legendary figure in the global semiconductor industry said in an interview with Taiwan’s Wealth Magazine in February.But the current sustained leadership vacuum has ramped up risks for Samsung when competitors are boosting their muscle in the global market.Samsung is far behind TSMC in the foundry market where product prices have jumped on the world’s semiconductor shortage. TSMC dominated the global foundry market with a 52.1% market share in the fourth quarter of last year while Samsung accounted for just 18.3% about a third of TSMC’s share according to market tracker TrendForce. The Taiwan company is reportedly able to produce 3-nanometer chips ahead of Samsung.In the US chipmaker Micron Technology Inc. last year started commercial production of 176-layer NAND for the first time in the world.Samsung has unveiled few major investment plans except for the one to build a $17 billion chipmaking plant in Taylor Texas announced in November of last year. The company’s CEO reportedly has authority for spending of about 1 trillion won while presidents are known to be able to approve investments of only 300 billion-400 billion won. That means Vice Chairman Lee is the only person in the company able to make decisions about chip plant investments in the billions of dollars.“It is hard for a professional manager to make decisions on a large-scale investment as they cannot help focusing on short-term performance” said a local semiconductor industry source.Lee’s parole term ends on July 29 2022 but he will still be restricted from employment given the law governing special economic crimes.“Without a pardon there will be no way to avoid the employment restriction” said another industry source.Lee is also facing difficulties in seeking acquisitions of other companies a shortcut to securing future growth engines under parole. Few global companies are willing to sign a deal with a leader if there are legal risks.Governments around the world became stricter on mergers and acquisitions in the semiconductor industry amid the cut-throat hegemony competition. Germany disapproved of Taiwanese GlobalWafer Co.’s planned $5 billion takeover of German chip supplier Siltronic AG. US-based Nvidia Corp.’s attempt to acquire British chip designer Arm Ltd failed due to the opposition of countries such as the UK and China.Samsung may disappear into history or lose major status globally without securing future growth engines in the near term company officials feared. In 2011 global management consulting firm McKinsey said the average life expectancy of companies listed on the Standard and Poor’s 500 had shortened to 18 years in 2011 from 90 years in 1935 expecting 75% of the 500 companies on that list to disappear by 2027.Shin-Young Park at nyusos@hankyung.com Jongwoo Cheon edited this article.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Nightingale Properties led by Elie Schwartz and Simon Singer is offering the SoHo building it has leased entirely to the tech behemoth founded by Bill Gates.

Bids on the property which features 63000 square feet of office space atop 18000 square feet of vacant retail space at 300 Lafayette Street are expected to come in at $200 million — or about $2444 a square foot according to a report by the website Green Street. A Newmark team led by Brett Siegel and Evan Layne is handling the sale.

Microsoft signed a long-term lease on the building’s office space in 2019 — one that has 13 years remaining according to the website. Design by CookFox Architects the seven-story office tower on the south side of Houston Street features floor-to-ceiling windows on every floor and more than 10000 square feet of outdoor terraces and greenspace.

The vacant retail space has 8500 square feet at street level with a 40-foot ceiling and an additional 10000 square feet below grade. Access to the Broadway-Lafayette Street subway station is located right outside the doors.

Marketing for the column-free building stresses its green attributes such as its energy-efficient lighting windows and boilers. The building also features 11000 square feet of landscaped terraces on floors three to six a collaborative workspace on the second floor and a sixth-floor event space.

Nightingale partnered with Wafra Capital Partners to buy the leasehold interest for $125 million back in 2017 while the building was under construction according to a report in the New York Post. That deal brokered for Related Companies and LargaVista by Newmark closed in 2019.

The building was originally developed by Related Companies and LargaVista under a long-term ground lease on land owned by LargaVista on top of the site of the former BP gas station. That land has fixed payments scheduled for the next 47 years by which time much (if not all) of today’s technology will surely be outdated.

The state of the art protocol that is widely used today is mDNS while the protocols NetBIOS and LLMNR are not widely used anymore.

In Aligning on mDNS: ramping down NetBIOS name resolution and LLMNR Microsoft informs Windows system administrators that it plans to disable the old protocols in future versions of Windows to improve device security and decrease the load on the networks they use.

Microsoft is aware that there are still scenarios and ""real-world deployments"" in which these protocols are used but the company is convinced that disabling the protocols by default is the right direction to take.

The company has not started the process of disabling LLMNR by default yet but it has started the process for NetBIOS.

The NetBIOS protocol is already turned off by default on cellular devices according to Microsoft. In the latest Windows Developer and Beta Insider builds NetBIOS is in learning mode. Learning mode means that NetBIOS is used as a fallback if mDNS and LLMNR queries fail.

The change may lead to connectivity issues in some cases. Administrators may modify a Group Policy or a Registry value to change the behavior of the protocol.

Note: the Group Policy Editor is only available on Professional and Enterprise editions of Windows. Home edition administrators may modify the behavior in the Registry.

Changing NetBIOS in the Group Policy Editor

Use the keyboard shortcut Windows-R to open the Run box on the system. Type gpedit.msc and hit Enter; this should load the Group Policy Editor. Navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Network > DNS Client. Double-click on the Configure NetBIOS policy. Set the policy to Enabled. Use the menu that is provided ""Configure NetBIOS options"" to switch to one of the supported options: Allow NetBIOS name resolution -- Enables full NetBIOS support.

Disable NetBIOS name resolution -- Turns off NetBIOS support on the device.

Disable NetBIOS name resolution on public networks -- Keeps NetBIOS enabled on private networks but disables it on public networks.

NetBIOS learning mode -- NetBIOS is only used as a fallback if mDNS and LLMNR queries fail. Select OK to save the new policy setting.

Changing NetBIOS in the Windows Registry

The same options are also available in the Windows Registry.

Use the keyboard shortcut Windows-R to open the run box. Type regedit.exe and hit the Enter-key. Navigate to Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Dnscache\Parameters in the Registry Editor. Right-click on Parameters and select New > Dword (32-bit) Value. Name the value EnableNetbios. Double-click on the new Dword and set it to one of the following values: 0 -- Disabled.

1 -- Allowed.

2 -- Disabled on public networks.

3 -- Learning Mode. Close the Registry Editor after you have made the change.

Closing Words

LLMNR has not been touched yet but Microsoft plans to make similar changes to this protocol in future builds and versions of the Windows operating system.

One of the biggest challenges is the ability to access and share increasingly large volumes of data from remote locations quickly and securely and then analyze the data to inform real-time decision-making.

To help meet these demanding requirements Microsoft SES and Nokia have successfully demonstrated secure access to the Azure cloud platform over private 5G and SATCOM networks enabling the use of cloud services anytime and anywhere including remote and austere environments.

Through the integration of SATCOM 5G and cloud computing the demonstration established a reference architecture to deliver remote access to enterprise systems remote access to data as well as the ability to conduct analysis simultaneously in the field and in the hyper-scale cloud. For this demonstration military vehicle data was streamed over private 5G viewed and analyzed in the field and then delivered in real-time to an enterprise maintenance system in Azure over SATCOM.

Nokia established a secure private 5G network using the Nokia Digital Automation Cloud solution. This streamlined plug-and-play connectivity provides rapid access to ultra-low latency high-capacity networking.

During the demonstration users accessed an SAP maintenance environment hosted in Microsoft Azure using laptops connected to the private 5G network. This proof of concept shows the ability for Defense personnel in the field to access and update an enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution without waiting to return to a primary facility or base. Data from vehicles can also be accessed and analyzed in the field with results synced to the ERP platform.

Through real-time ERP updates in the field logisticians and commanders located at headquarter sites can make decisions based on the most up-to-date tactical data on vehicle fleets.

Both raw and processed data can be sent from vehicles in the field to enterprise systems over SATCOM when the operational situation allows increasing commanders’ awareness of deployed assets. Improved access to data also opens opportunities for automation and optimization of back-end processes such as predictive maintenance stock management fleet management and operational budget forecasting.

For the demonstration SES – an Azure Orbital Ground Station as a Service partner – showcased the potential for high-volume data transfers by accessing its O3b satellite constellation via transportable terminal antennas. Orbiting at approximately 8000 km. above Earth’s surface in MEO the O3b system delivers low latency high-performance connectivity. SES’s upcoming second-generation MEO system – O3b mPOWER – represents a step change in capabilities for satellite-based networking.

The system can provision throughputs up to multiple gigabits per second per service providing resilient cloud and edge connectivity. In this demonstration download and upload speeds reached 348 Mbps and 67 Mbps respectively. With O3b mPOWER the bandwidth can be scaled from 100 Mbps to a Gigabit depending on the requirements of the mission.

Azure services can be used to display live position and analytical data on a dashboard in the field. During the demonstration the Microsoft Azure Stack Edge Mini R – an ultra-portable rugged edge computing device – was used for computing and analysis onsite enabling advanced cloud analytics and visualization in connected and disconnected environments.

Azure Stack Edge Mini R physical device – An ultra portable rugged compute and storage device supplied by Microsoft. The device has an onboard battery and weighs less than 7 lbs.

Using 5G and SATCOM connectivity data analysis can also take place in the Azure hyper-scale cloud compute platform. For instance predictive maintenance analysis could be used to automatically send alerts and notifications and feed relevant data to ERP maintenance modules which would enable maintenance orders to be scheduled stock inventory to be checked and personnel requirements to be automated.

By unlocking the power of SATCOM 5G and cloud computing Defense organizations can remain connected in remote locations share data quickly and securely to enhance strategic awareness and perform deep analysis of data to improve decision-making.

The reference architecture established by this Defence demonstration is readily transferred to other sectors where remote connectivity and data analysis is required including agriculture healthcare mining and resources transport and logistics.

Additionally several of Microsoft's first-party apps are web apps such as Clipchamp and the Teams Chat experience that's built into Windows 11. While web-powered components are growing in popularity especially at Microsoft they have critics. Many point to high RAM usage and slow performance as reasons that Microsoft should stick with native apps instead.

In this week's poll we want to know if you're happy with the direction Microsoft has taken in this regard. The poll was inspired by a discussion sparked on Twitter earlier this month when our executive editor mentioned web apps.

Ok enjoy widgets taking 300mb of ram chat integrated into the os that should be blazing fast and light taking a ridicolous amount of resources and time to run compared to whatsapp beta for example or photos app editor using 700mb of ram and I could go on and on...

Web apps provide several benefits such as unified development across platforms. They also have drawbacks such as higher RAM usage. Some such as Twitter feel native and perform smoothly. Twitter updates its web app frequently which means that Windows users don't have to wait for a platform-specific update to get new features.

On the other side of the coin there are programs like Microsoft Whiteboard. When Microsoft converted Whiteboard to a web app performance got significantly worse. Microsoft Whiteboard has a 2.8-star rating in the Microsoft Store and several reviews mention poor performance.

In our testing the pen latency on the web app version of Whiteboard is noticeably worse than the previous version. The new Whiteboard drew so much negative feedback that Microsoft announced that it would revert to the previous version.

What do you think of web apps and web-based components in Windows 11? Let us know in this week's poll and in the comments below."

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration//File Photo

Since its appearance last November 2021 the Ómicron coronavirus variant has become the predominant one at the contagion level and has not stopped spreading around the world becoming the protagonist of the incredible increase in COVID-19 cases.

Thanks to its evolution it has the ability to escape the effectiveness of current vaccines or even the antibodies generated by a previous infection which show rapid dissipation. However there is one way to deal with Ómicron today and that is with a booster dose.

Meanwhile scientists around the world are developing the second generation of vaccines to deal with the most contagious variants. Thus the Moderna laboratory now announced that its new version of the COVID-19 vaccine still under study is generating a greater immune response against recent variants of the coronavirus compared to the approved product currently offered according to preliminary data.

In particular the variant-adapted vaccine increases the neutralizing antibodies against Omicron by 2.2 times compared to the standard vaccine. The US company has indicated in a statement that the version under study called mRNA-1273211 has generated a superior immune response against the Beta Delta and Ómicron variants one month after administration in a booster dose of 50 micrograms.

The immunization offered by this 50 microgram version tested on 300 patients continued “for six months after administration against the Beta and Omicron variants” and had adverse effects similar to those of the approved product. “We are satisfied with this data for our first bivalent reinforcement candidate mRNA.1273211. We believe that these results validate our bivalent strategy which we announced and started in February 2021. The results indicate that mRNA-1273211 at doses of 50 µg induced higher antibody responses than the 50 µg boost of mRNA-1273 even though no additional variants of concern were included in the booster vaccine” said Moderna Executive Director Stéphane Bancel.

The emergence of new mutated versions of the virus that causes covid-19 over the past year such as the Delta and Ómicron variants create a potential requirement for different technologies to provide a stronger immune system response.

“We have some data that your immune system's response to natural infection but also to vaccination decreases over time” says Andrew Ustianowski clinical leader of the Covid Vaccine Research Programme at the UK National Institute for Health Research. “We can see antibody responses and to some extent T cell responses decreasing over time. Therefore one of the hopes of second-generation vaccines is that they can provide us with protection for a longer period than these first vaccines” he added.

Release for September

Moderna like other manufacturers of vaccines against COVID-19 has been developing serums that include mutations present in the new variants but for now it is betting on another product as a candidate for the booster doses that it will soon offer in the northern hemisphere. Moderna's preferred solution is mRNA-1273214 a prototype that is in an advanced stage of study and combines the serum of the original vaccine with another specific one against the Ómicron variant. It contains 32 mutations and is “the main candidate for the autumn boreal reinforcement of 2022″ according to Bancel.

As reported by the company in the statement they expect to obtain more results on mRNA-1273214 in the second quarter of this year in order to decide on the reinforcement of autumn 2022 in the northern hemisphere. The company's goal is to obtain a bivalent booster that maintains high levels of neutralizing antibodies while improving the amplitude of immunity to variants.

“Moderna is developing booster updates to address the ongoing evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus including monovalent and bivalent vaccines targeting multiple variants of concern. The company's main focus has been on bivalent boosting to maintain high titers of neutralizing antibodies while improving the breadth of immunity to variants. The initial results of a phase 2/3 study to evaluate an updated bivalent booster incorporating more Omicron specific mutations (mRN-1273214) are expected in the second quarter of this year” the statement concluded.

AFP-Yonhap





Indonesia the world's top palm oil producer announced plans to ban exports of the most widely used vegetable oil on Friday in a shock move that could further inflame surging global food inflation.







The halting of shipments of the cooking oil and its raw material widely used in products ranging from cakes to cosmetics could raise costs for packaged food producers globally and force governments to choose between using vegetable oils in food or for biofuel. Indonesia counts for more than half of global palm oil supply.







In a video broadcast Indonesia's President Joko Widodo said he wanted to ensure the availability of food products at home after global food inflation soared to a record high following Russia's invasion of major crop producer Ukraine.







""I will monitor and evaluate the implementation of this policy so availability of cooking oil in the domestic market becomes abundant and affordable"" he said.







The announcement will hurt consumers in top buyer India and globally said Atul Chaturvedi president of trade body the Solvent Extractors Association of India (SEA).







""This move is rather unfortunate and totally unexpected"" he said.







Alternative vegetable oil prices spiked in response to the measure which will take effect on April 28. Soybean oil the second most used vegetable oil rose 4.5% to a record high of 83.21 cents per pound on the Chicago Board of Trade.







Global prices of crude palm oil which Indonesia uses for cooking oil have surged to historic highs this year amid rising demand and weak output from top producers Indonesia and Malaysia plus a move by Indonesia to restrict palm oil exports in January that was lifted in March.







Household product and food companies including Procter







Gamble Co Nestle SA and Unilever PLC are large purchasers of palm oil. Oreo cookie maker Mondelez International accounts for 0.5% of palm oil consumption globally according to its website.







Other countries have experimented with crop protectionism to try to keep domestic prices down. Argentina the world's top exporter of processed soy briefly halted new overseas sales of soy oil and meal in mid-March before hiking the export tax rate on those products to 33% from 31%.







The U.S. Department of Agriculture urged international cooperation during the war in Ukraine rather than export bans.







Global edible oil markets have been roiled this year by Russia's invasion of Ukraine a move Russia calls a ""special operation"" to demilitarize its neighbor which cut off shipments of sunflower oil from the region.







The Black Sea accounts for 76% of world sunoil exports and commercial shipping from the region has been severely affected since Russian forces entered Ukraine in February.







Large supplies of alternatives including soy and rapeseed oil are not readily available either after droughts hurt the most recent crops in Argentina Brazil and Canada.







New facilities for processing soy and canola oil are expected to open in the United States and Canada respectively in coming years as demand for plant-based biofuels grows but ramping up production in the near term will be difficult.







Industry group the Clean Fuels Alliance America said the move could hurt biofuel producers even though U.S. biodiesel and renewable diesel producers don't use palm oil as supplies of all oils are tight.











""Sky would be the limit for edible oil prices now. Buyers were banking on palm oil after sunoil supplies fell because of the Ukraine war"" a Mumbai-based dealer at a global trading firm said.







""Now they (buyers) don't have any option as soyoil supplies are also limited.""







Malaysian producers say the world's No. 2 palm oil exporter which is facing a production shortfall due to a pandemic-induced labor shortage is unlikely to be able to plug the gap.







Indonesia has since 2018 stopped the issuance of new permits for palm oil plantations often blamed for deforestation and destroying habitats of endangered animals such as orangutans.







Palm oil industry association GAPKI said it would adhere to the policy but had reservations.







""If this policy has any negative impact on the sustainability of the palm oil sector we would ask the government to re-evaluate the policy"" it said in a statement.







In Indonesia the retail price of cooking oil averages 26436 rupiah ($1.84) per liter up more than 40% so far this year. In some provinces across the country the prices have nearly doubled in the past month alone according to a price monitoring page.







Demonstrations by students have taken place in several cities across Indonesia in recent days over high cooking oil prices.







Indonesia's government has set a cap of 14000 rupiah per liter for bulk cooking oil but Trade Ministry data showed that it was sold at more than 18000 rupiah this month.







A government investigation is underway into alleged corruption involving sought-after export permits. ($1 = 14356.0000 rupiah) (Reuters)

A six-year-old boy has died after reportedly drinking a glass of Monster Energy drink.

The tragic incident took place when the youngster was visiting his grandma's house in Matamoros north-eastern Mexico on 16th April.

According to reports young Francisco Cervantes saw a glass on the table filled with Monster Energy - an energy drink - and drank it quickly to quench his thirst.

He immediately began to experience discomfort and was taken by his relatives to the local Alfredo Pumarejo Hospital.

After admission he was diagnosed with intoxication and later brain death.

He spent six days hospitalised in a coma as his mother Jessica initially refused to allow him to be disconnected from his artificial life support machine.

The bereaved mum was later quoted as saying: ""I thank all those who came to offer us their support.

""Unfortunately my son couldn't take it anymore. Right now we're going to see about the funeral expenses to give him his Christian burial.""

Various health professionals and services including the NHS advise that young children should not consume energy drinks which are often high in caffeine and sugar.

It was not reported if young Francisco had any known pre-existing health conditions.

As reported in a 2019 study the US Food and Drug Administration said there had been 34 deaths attributed into energy drinks thus warranting investigation into their safety.

The study titled 'Impact of High Volume Energy Drink Consumption on Electrocardiographic and Blood Pressure Parameters: A Randomized Trial' reported that ""[e]nergy drink consumption has been associated with cardiac arrest myocardial infarction spontaneous coronary dissection and coronary vasospasm"".

The news comes after the similarly tragic death of a four-week-old baby who was found with more than four times the legal alcohol limit an adult would be allowed when driving a car in his system.

Police arrested Marquis Simon Colvin 25 and Sydnei Moran Dunn 24 who are accused of killing their four-week-old infant with alcohol poisoning in Paulding County in the US state of Georgia.

The four-week old infant was brought to the hospital by its parents and was unresponsive.

The youngster's mum Sydnei Moran Dunn stated that she had consumed a large quantity of alcohol the day before and that the child must have gotten alcohol poisoning from her while she was breast-feeding.

However Dunn then indicated that the child's father put alcohol in the baby's bottle with doctors saying the child had a quantity of alcohol in its system that was well over four times the legal limit for an adult.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3MuY28udWsvbmV3cy93b3JsZC8xNjAwMjAwL21leGljby1uZXdzLWJveS1kaWVzLWRyaW5rLW1vbnN0ZXItZW5lcmd5LWdyYW5kbW90aGVycy1ob3VzZS1tdW3SAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHByZXNzLmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvd29ybGQvMTYwMDIwMC9tZXhpY28tbmV3cy1ib3ktZGllcy1kcmluay1tb25zdGVyLWVuZXJneS1ncmFuZG1vdGhlcnMtaG91c2UtbXVtL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boy6 dies after ‘drinking Monster energy drink' left in grandmother’s house,"Mexico: At least 49 killed after trailer crash in Chiapas

Sources familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal that Twitter is taking another look at the deal and may be closer to negotiating given how quickly Musk was able to secure financing.

Still any final deal is far from conclusive. Both sides were expected to meet Sunday to discuss the situation in more detail.

Musk announced an offer last week to buy the social media platform for $54.20 per share but did not say how he would finance the acquisition.

Musk said Thursday in documents filed with U.S. securities regulators that the money would come from Morgan Stanley and other banks some of it secured by his huge stake in the electric carmaker.

ELON MUSK CONFIRMS HE TURNED DOWN BILL GATES ON CLIMATE CHANGE COLLABORATION OVER SHORTING TESLA

Twitter has enacted an anti-takeover measure known as a poison pill that could make a takeover attempt prohibitively expensive.

The company said in a statement Thursday that it received Musk's updated proposal and ""new information on potential financing"" and said its board is ""committed to conducting a careful comprehensive and deliberate review.""

Musk who owns about 9% of Twitter shares indicated that he's exploring what's known as a tender offer in which he would try to get other shareholders to pledge their stock to him at a certain price on a certain date bypassing the board. If enough shareholders agree Musk could use that as leverage to get the board to drop its ""poison pill"" defense against his offer of $54.20 per share.

But Musk hasn't decided yet whether to do that.

The poison pill could significantly raise the costs of a takeover. If someone acquires a 15% stake in the company it would trigger a huge payout to shareholders that could bankrupt Twitter.

ELON MUSK'S INFLATION DURATION WARNING

Other banks involved in Musk's financing include Barclays Bank of America Societe Generale Mizuho Bank BNP Paribas and MUFG. Morgan Stanley is one of Twitter's biggest shareholders behind Vanguard Group and Musk.

Musk's documents say that $13 billion in financing came from Morgan Stanley and the other banks. As much as $12.5 billion would be loans secured by Musk's Tesla stock and he also committed $21 billion in direct or indirect equity although he didn't disclose the source of those funds. The filing says that the equity commitment could be reduced by contributions from others or additional debt taken on.

Aerospace and defense powerhouse SpaceX famously launches rockets into orbit then turns them around and lands its flight-proven rockets back on Earth. In the annals of space travel it's the only private company that's ever managed to accomplish this feat.

Or rather SpaceX has been unique up until now.

Introducing Rocket Lab -- and its amazing rocket-catching helicopters

Earlier this month SpaceX small-scale imitator Rocket Lab (RKLB -2.22%) -- which builds small rockets that carry only a fraction of the payload of a SpaceX Falcon 9 and currently throws away each rocket after use -- announced that it's going to try and follow in SpaceX's footsteps by attempting to reuse a rocket for the very first time.

Before this month is out (Rocket Lab hasn't set an exact date yet) the company plans to launch its 26th Electron mission into orbit from its Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand. First the rocket in question named There and Back Again will deliver its payload of 34 tiny satellites into orbit. That accomplished the rocket itself will parachute back to Earth and Rocket Lab will attempt to snag the parachute with a helicopter then gently deposit the rocket stage back on Earth.

This isn't a trick SpaceX could manage because its rockets are so big. It's also a trick SpaceX doesn't need to manage because it's gotten so good at landing rockets on retrojets. But for Rocket Lab this really is the only viable means of reusing rockets because Electron is too small to carry enough fuel to both (a) deliver payloads to orbit and then (b) power retrojets to land on its own.

Be that as it may if Rocket Lab succeeds in this audacious enterprise it will join SpaceX among the ranks of space companies flying reusable rockets.

Cue applause from Wall Street

Space investor Morgan Stanley applauded the plan in a note released earlier this month doubling down on its ""overweight"" rating on Rocket Lab stock and reiterating its $17 price target on Rocket Lab stock. If Rocket Lab hits that target it will deliver an instant two-bagger of today's $8 stock price for new investors.

As the analyst explained if Rocket Lab can become the second company to master rocket reusability this will ""further widen the moat between itself and [its small rocket-launch] competitors"" such as Astra and Virgin Orbit for example. But Morgan Stanley also hinted at a second big reason why reusability would be good news for Rocket Lab.

More rocket launches please

Historically one of Rocket Lab's biggest problems has been building rockets fast enough to keep up with demand for small satellite launches. When the company first floated the idea of using helicopters to rescue and reuse spent rocket stages back in 2019 CEO Peter Beck said this would be a ""fantastic"" way to double the number of rockets Rocket Lab can launch in a year without spending any more money on building more rockets.

Indeed in musing about how this month's There and Back Again mission could change the outlook for Rocket Lab Morgan Stanley suggested that if Rocket Lab can increase the cadence of its rocket launches past 35 per year by 2026 this would create ""upside risk"" to its $17 price target. I.e. it could mean Rocket Lab stock is worth even more than $17 per share.

Mind you this is a very big ""if."" In 2020 Rocket Lab only launched seven rockets into orbit -- and in 2021 that number went down not up to just six launches. Even if Rocket Lab succeeds with There and Back Again and manages to reuse its rockets once or twice that still leaves a huge gap between here and 35 launches per year.

Baby steps to total reusability

That being said Electron rockets aren't the only arrows in Rocket Lab's quiver. Last year the company announced it is forging ahead with its next project and will build an even bigger Neutron rocket that can land on its own retrojets like a SpaceX Falcon 9. Morgan Stanley predicts Neutron could be 70% to 80% reusable like a Falcon 9 and cites Neutron as yet another factor that could help Rocket Lab outgrow its $17 target price.

Granted by the time Neutron is flying in 2024 Rocket Lab will already be nine years behind SpaceX in reusable rocket technology. (SpaceX landed its first rocketship way back in 2015). But if Rocket Lab can keep ahead of everybody else who is not named SpaceX simply being ""No. 2"" in this space race may be enough to turn this growth stock into a success story for space investors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL3N0b2Nrcy9uZXdzL3NvbWUtYnJva2VyYWdlcy1jdXQtaGNsLXRlY2gtdGFyZ2V0LXByaWNlL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkxMDE5NDU0LmNtc9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL3N0b2Nrcy9uZXdzL3NvbWUtYnJva2VyYWdlcy1jdXQtaGNsLXRlY2gtdGFyZ2V0LXByaWNlL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85MTAxOTQ1NC5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Some brokerages cut HCL Tech target price,"

In early April Elon Musk took a bite out of Twitter coming away with 9.2% of the company and plans to exercise his influence over the company through its board. After he backed out of his planned board seat Musk teed up an even more outrageous plan: He’d buy the company outright and take it private. Absolutely everyone freaked out about this and had an opinion and some of those opinions cast doubt on the seriousness of the famously unserious tech mogul’s grand plans.

Musk’s $43 billion offer valued Twitter for less than it was trading for a year ago begging the question: Is this guy for real? We still don’t really know — Musk is mercurial and notoriously prone to big dumb stunts — but apparently he’s cobbling together the cash with some help from Morgan Stanley and Bank of America.

Musk is the world’s richest man but he’s also relatively cash poor for a mega-billionaire so making his play on Twitter would require him to cash out shares held at Tesla and SpaceX the two companies he’s ostensibly running while whipping us all into a frenzy over his totally unnecessary ambitions to buy Twitter and reshape it in his image. Meanwhile Twitter is working to fend of Musk’s advances with a poison pill defense which would let existing shareholders buy more stock at low low prices effectively diluting the company’s shares and pushing the price of his bid up.

As of April 25th Twitter has accepted Musk’s $44 billion acquisition offer. Here’s a timeline of how the Twitter acquisition unfolded from start to finish.

A timeline of the Elon Musk-Twitter saga

Before Musk even placed a bid for Twitter SEC regulators said they have authority to subpoena the Tesla CEO about his tweets and even urged a federal judge not to let the executive get away with tweeting with abandon.

Shortly after U.S. regulators urged a judge to monitor Musk’s tweets the Tesla and SpaceX CEO expressed he was giving serious thought to build the “next Twitter.”

Twitter published a note confirming that the SpaceX and Tesla entrepreneur has taken a 9.2% share of the company working out to around $2.9 billion based on Friday’s (March 4th) share price.

Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal announced that Elon Musk was appointed to Twitter’s board in a series of tweets:

I’m excited to share that we’re appointing @elonmusk to our board! Through conversations with Elon in recent weeks it became clear to us that he would bring great value to our Board. — Parag Agrawal (@paraga) April 5 2022

Later that same week Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal announced he would not be joining the social media firm’s board. The disclosure from Agrawal follows a series of unusual tweets from Elon Musk over the same weekend in which he wondered aloud to his over 80 million followers if Twitter was dying citing low frequency of tweets from some of the most popular personalities on the social network.

A Twitter shareholder sued Musk in a federal securities class action lawsuit because Musk failed to disclose his 5% stake in Twitter when he was required to do so. The delay allowed Musk to buy more shares of Twitter at a lower price and cheat sellers of Twitter stock out of increased profits the plaintiff claims.

The billionaire said he is willing to pay $54.20 per share to buy 100% of the company. It would be an all-cash offer that values the social network at $43.4 billion. He filed the offer with the SEC and tweeted it out hours before he was interviewed on TED.

I made an offer https://t.co/VvreuPMeLu — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 14 2022

The controversial CEO of Tesla and SpaceX was already preparing to speak at the TED2022 conference for a conversation that was in such high demand that TED made the livestream available to the public.

Twitter’s board of directors announced in a press release that the company is adopting a limited-duration shareholder rights plan — a “poison pill” in merger and acquisition lingo. While the company doesn’t name Elon Musk directly Twitter is clearly trying to prevent the billionaire from buying the social network.

To summarize: Musk intends to borrow around $13 billion in various fashions; borrow $12.5 billion against his own equity holdings; and pay around $21 billion from his own holdings. It’s a somewhat complicated collection of funding sources but Musk’s bid is hardly small so the path to collecting the needed cash in one pile is understandably convoluted.

Twitter’s board met on Sunday to discuss Musk’s offer and the NYT reports that they then entered into negotiations with Musk early on Monday morning to hammer out additional details including the timeline for close and what if any financial protections Twitter would enjoy were any potential deal to go south post-announcement. Both reports stress that the deal is not yet final and could still fall apart.

Twitter has announced that it has accepted Musk’s offer to acquire the publicly traded company at $54.20/share valuing the social media platform at $44 billion. Moments after the news broke that Twitter trading was halted the company issued a press release confirming that it was accepting Musk’s offer to take the social network private.

Elon Musk will have to pay Twitter a $1 billion termination fee if he doesn’t go through with his $44 billion acquisition of the social network announced on Monday per a new SEC filing. The filing which details the terms of the agreement indicates Twitter would have to pay the same fee under specific circumstances.

Twitter locked down its source code to prevent unauthorized changes sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. The reports say that this change was made to prevent employees from “going rogue” and sabotaging the platform after Elon Musk’s $44 billion purchase of the company. Currently a vice president must approve any changes.

Enterprise Reporter Ron Miller outlines possible outcomes from the deal while acknowledging we truly don’t know what could happen next. He writes:

In the worst case Musk could make Twitter his own personal social playground. In the best he will work to improve some of the longstanding problems that have plagued the platform for years. In a statement on the deal Musk said that he wants to “make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features making the algorithms open source to increase trust defeating the spam bots and authenticating all humans.”

Audio from Twitter’s company wide call about its drastic change from being a publicly traded company to a billionaire-owned private entity was leaked on April 27 by the controversial conservative group Project Veritas on YouTube. The days following the news of the Twitter acquisition had researchers questioning what the deal will mean for Twitter research data. Then ahead of Twitter’s presentation to media ad buyers during the 2022 NewFronts in early May of this year Twitter acknowledged in a new SEC filing that its core advertising business could now be at risk as a result of the Elon Musk takeover in addition to employee hiring and retention efforts and other factors.

Twitter GM of Consumer Keyvon Beykpour announced on May 12 he will be leaving the company after seven years. Beykpour said in a tweet he was asked to leave by current CEO Parag Agrawal who wants to take the team in another direction. Bruce Falck Twitter’s revenue product lead is also departing Twitter confirmed to TechCrunch.

Elon Musk tweeted on May 13 that his $43 billion bid to buy the company is “on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users”. He later followed up with a second tweet — in which he writes that he is “still committed to the acquisition”.

Twitter is full of bots this much we know. But how full and what kinds of bots? With estimates ranging from Twitter’s own “under 5 percent” to independent researchers suggesting 20% or more it’s clearly a tricky number to nail down as the company’s CEO Parag Agrawal explained in a thread on May 16. Prospective buyer Elon Musk responded with a poo emoji. This begged the question does Elon Musk really even want to buy Twitter?

In a new lawsuit Twitter shareholders are suing Elon Musk alleging that he manipulated the price of the company’s stock for his own benefit in the course of agreeing to buy the company.

Twitter’s board wants the $44 billion Elon Musk takeover completed which is why it’s asking its shareholders to approve the deal according to a regulatory filing. This comes after Twitter agrees to hand over internal data to soothe Musk’s bot fears and Musk tells Twitter employees he wants to be involved in product after his first company-wide Twitter call.

After hinting heavily that he no longer wanted the company in tweets attacking Twitter over its bot calculations and an ominous story in The Washington Post reflecting his thinking Musk’s legal team is taking steps to terminate his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter. However Twitter is not having it. The company issued a brief formal statement regarding Musk’s merger termination attempt which relies on the prodigious breeder‘s assertion that Twitter misled him about the extent of its bot problem when he entered into the deal.

Twitter followed through on its promise to force Elon Musk to buy the company suing the SpaceX and Tesla CEO in a Delaware court on July 12. On July 19 a judge ruled that Twitter can expedite its trail against Elon Musk.

In a filing on July 18 Twitter argued that the company is harmed each day that its dispute with Musk continues so the case needs to be tried as soon as possible. The company also stated that Musk’s proposed schedule slating the trial for February was “calculated to complicate and obfuscate.”

MOS,Mosaic Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDQvMjQvYXJ0cy9kYW5jZS9yZXZpZXctcGFtLXRhbm93aXR6LW5ldy15b3JrLWNpdHktYmFsbGV0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: At City Ballet Bending the Form's Rituals and Codes (Published 2022),"“I would rather fail at something interesting than do something boring.”

That quote from an interview with Pam Tanowitz in Dance Magazine last year came to mind during the premiere on Friday of “Law of Mosaics” her third work for New York City Ballet. Set to a string score of the same name by the contemporary American composer Ted Hearne this odd convention-bending ballet is a lot of things; boring is not one of them.

Not long ago it was a big deal to see even one Tanowitz work on the David H. Koch Theater stage. Her first City Ballet commission in 2019 arrived in the wake of multiple rejections from the company’s in-house choreographic institute. And with her downtown roots and firm interest in deconstructing the classical she remains something of an outsider. But City Ballet is letting audiences get to know her. Showing us two sides of Tanowitz Friday’s program under the heading “Visionary Voices” also included the company premiere of her poignant “Gustave le Gray No. 1” — a 2019 dance created for members of Miami City Ballet and Dance Theater of Harlem — alongside recent additions to the repertory by Jamar Roberts and Justin Peck.

“Law of Mosaics” begins jarringly with three dancers momentarily still and silhouetted activated into busy motion by the emphatic first note of the score. The opening section of the music (conducted here by Hearne) is titled “Excerpts from the middle of something” and that’s how the dancing feels: like part of a story that’s been unfolding before we arrived presented without introduction. We just have to catch up.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb2xkY29hc3RidWxsZXRpbi5jb20uYXUvcHJvcGVydHkvZ29sZC1jb2FzdC1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC1tb3NhaWMtcHJvcGVydHktZ3JvdXAtdW52ZWlscy1uZXctYnJvYWRiZWFjaC10b3dlci9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzQxYjJjZTVjYjVhNDgzN2FmYjkxZjNhZWY1ZTA2OTQx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gold Coast development: Mosaic Property Group unveils new Broadbeach tower,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/property/gold-coast-development-mosaic-property-group-unveils-new-broadbeach-tower/news-story/41b2ce5cb5a4837afb91f3aef5e06941 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb2xkY29hc3RidWxsZXRpbi5jb20uYXUvcHJvcGVydHkvZ29sZC1jb2FzdC1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC1tb3NhaWMtcHJvcGVydHktZ3JvdXAtdW52ZWlscy1uZXctYnJvYWRiZWFjaC10b3dlci9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzQxYjJjZTVjYjVhNDgzN2FmYjkxZjNhZWY1ZTA2OTQx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Since the year began the broad-based S&P 500 and widely followed Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped into official correction territory (down at least 10%) while the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite briefly fell into a bear market.

There's no question that big declines in the indexes can be unnerving. But it's important to recognize that stock market corrections rarely last long. What's more every crash and correction throughout history has proven to be an ideal buying opportunity for patient investors. Buying high-quality stocks during pullbacks and allowing your investment thesis to play out over time is a moneymaking strategy.

With that being said the recent market correction has made three supercharged growth stocks particularly attractive. If you were to invest $250000 into these companies they have all the tools needed to make you a millionaire by 2030.

Teladoc Health

The first supercharged growth stock that should handsomely reward patient investors by the turn of the decade is telehealth giant Teladoc Health (NYSE: TDOC).

Teladoc is one of dozens of high-growth companies that benefited immensely during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic but has been pummeled over valuation and growth concerns ever since. It's also paid a price (literally and figuratively) for its acquisition of Livongo Health in late 2020 which resulted in wider-than-expected losses in 2020 and 2021.

In spite of these near-term challenges nothing suggests that Teladoc's focus has strayed or that its competitive advantages have waned one bit. For example the company's sales grew by an annual average of 74% between 2013 and 2019 (prior to the pandemic). In the wake of the pandemic sales growth should continue to top 20% on an annual basis.

What Teladoc's sales growth demonstrates is that we're witnessing a shift in how personalized care is administered. Even though virtual visits aren't feasible for every appointment Teladoc's platform is giving patients and physicians a powerful tool to improve overall outcomes. Virtual visits are more convenient for patients and they allow physicians to easily keep tabs on patients with chronic illnesses. The end result should be less money out of health insurers' pockets (so they're going to promote telemedicine visits).

Although the Livongo acquisition was in hindsight grossly overpriced the deal nonetheless gives Teladoc the opportunity to cross-sell its solutions and cater to chronically ill people who'd benefit most from its personalized care services. Additionally the one-time costs associated with this deal won't be adversely affecting Teladoc's bottom line in 2022 and beyond.

Following close to an 80% retracement shares of Teladoc can now be purchased for about five times last year's sales. But if Teladoc continues to grow by 20% annually it'll be generating closer to $10.5 billion in sales by 2030. That would give it a price-to-sales ratio of 1. In other words if Teladoc simply maintains its existing price-to-sales multiple investors should have no problem turning $250000 into $1 million.

Jushi Holdings

Another supercharged growth stock with all the tools and intangibles needed to quadruple investors' money over the next eight years is marijuana stock Jushi Holdings (OTC: JUSHF).

Few industries have been more universally disliked by the investing community over the past year than U.S. pot stocks. The expectation with a Democrat-led Congress and Joe Biden in the Oval Office was that federal legalization or at the very least cannabis banking reforms would become a reality. Thus far these expectations haven't come to fruition and investors clearly aren't happy about it.

However federal legalization isn't a necessity for large-scale multi-state operators (MSOs) like Jushi to thrive. With approximately three-quarters of all U.S. states legalizing weed in some capacity there's more than enough organic opportunity for these companies to grow quickly and generate profits.

Jushi is a relatively small player among the best-known MSOs. As of earlier this month it had 29 operating dispensaries in a half-dozen states with plans to broaden its portfolio to about 40 operating dispensaries by the end of 2022.

What makes this company so unique is its focus on limited-license markets such as Virginia Illinois Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Limited-license states purposely cap how many retail licenses are issued in total as well as to single businesses. It's a way of ensuring that small players like Jushi have a fair chance to build up their brand(s) and garner a loyal following without being steamrolled by an MSO with deeper pockets.

Interestingly though Jushi hasn't been afraid to pull the trigger on acquisitions. It closed the buyout of NuLeaf just two weeks ago which'll bolster its vertically integrated presence in Nevada. It also bought its way into the highly lucrative California pot market last year.

But perhaps the best thing about Jushi is management aligning their wallets with those of their shareholders. Approximately $45 million of the first $250 million in capital raised came from insiders and executives. We've also witnessed CEO Jim Cacioppo buying shares of the company on the open market. When execs have skin in the game good things often happen.

Sea Limited

A third supercharged growth stock that can turn a $250000 initial investment into a cool million by 2030 is Singapore-based Sea Limited (NYSE: SE).

Like Teladoc Sea has been crushed in recent months. A forecast calling for slower growth in 2022 hasn't sat well with investors who have come to expect jaw-dropping revenue growth from the company. Sea also noted that it could take until 2025 before two of its key segments can ""substantially self-fund their long-term growth."" That's a bit longer than some optimists were counting on.

While near-term losses aren't ideal Sea's three operating segments are growing like wildfire and paint a picture of a future mega-cap company.

For the moment Sea's gaming division known as Garena is the only one generating positive earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). What makes Garena so intriguing is that 11.8% of the company's 654 million quarterly active users (QAUs) were paying to play. The pay-to-play conversion ratio for mobile gaming is typically in the low single digits. As long as Sea can maintain this level of engagement mobile gaming should be a financial bright spot.

The second key segment is its SeaMoney financial service products. Since the emerging markets Sea targets in Southeastern Asia and South America can lack access to basic banking services the company's digital wallet solutions can fill a big role in democratizing finance for burgeoning middle classes in these regions. SeaMoney tallied nearly 46 million QAUs to end 2021.

But the segment that has investors most excited is e-commerce platform Shopee. In all of 2018 Shopee saw $10 billion in gross merchandise value (GMV) traverse its platform. In just the fourth quarter of 2021 Sea recognized $18.2 billion in GMV via Shopee. Online ordering demand is soaring in Southeastern Asia and Brazil which should help Sea scale its e-commerce operations over time and reduce its losses.

Patient investors could witness Sea Limited doubling its sales a couple of times over the next eight years.

He subsequently refinanced to a loan with a rate of just 1.05%.

Most people won't be able to get a loan rate that's anywhere near that low. But Zuckerberg's wealth coupled with the type of mortgage he took out made it possible for him to get such an affordable rate.

Although the typical borrower can't get a 1% rate they do have the option to take out the same type of loan that the Facebook founder qualified for. And like Zuckerberg the typical borrower can usually get a lower rate by choosing this kind of loan.

Unfortunately while it may have made sense for Zuckerberg to opt to borrow using this particular mortgage type most people should steer clear.

This is the type of loan Mark Zuckerberg took out

One of the big reasons why Zuckerberg was able to get such a low rate on his loan is because his mortgage is an adjustable-rate mortgage. That means his initial low rate is only guaranteed for a certain limited time period.

After an initial introductory period the rate on his loan will no longer be locked in at 1.05%. Instead it is tied to a financial index. The particular loan he took out was tied to the LIBOR which stands for the London Interbank Offered Rate. The LIBOR was a widely-used index that many mortgage lenders tied loans to although it is being phased out now.

It's a bad idea for most borrowers to opt for an ARM

Adjustable-rate mortgages often come with low introductory rates -- albeit not as low as the rate Zuckerberg was offered. They do this to entice customers to opt for an adjustable mortgage rather than a fixed-rate loan.

However the problem is they also come with a lot of uncertainty. Since it's impossible to predict how interest rates will change over time consumers who take out adjustable-rate mortgages will not know upfront how large their mortgage payments could become or how much their total loan costs will be over time.

For the Facebook founder this isn't a big issue. Zuckerberg's mortgage isn't going to become unaffordable for him no matter how high rates rise since he has a fortune. And he's unlikely to face a situation where he can't refinance his adjustable-rate mortgage due to a decline in his income or a reduction in his credit score.

For the typical person though there's a very real risk that the payments on an ARM could rise enough that they become a serious financial burden. This could create a risk of foreclosure. And those who take out ARMs with a plan to refinance before their rate begins adjusting could find themselves facing circumstances that make it impossible for them to qualify for a new loan when they need it.

For all of these reasons most borrowers should choose fixed-rate loans that provide consistent guaranteed monthly payments and just say no to the adjustable-rate mortgage that Zuckerberg opted to take out.

The Ascent's Best Mortgage Lender of 2022

Mortgage rates are on the rise — and fast. But they’re still relatively low by historical standards. So if you want to take advantage of rates before they climb too high you’ll want to find a lender who can help you secure the best rate possible.

That is where Better Mortgage comes in.

You can get pre-approved in as little as 3 minutes with no hard credit check and lock your rate at any time. Another plus? They don’t charge origination or lender fees (which can be as high as 2% of the loan amount for some lenders).

Indeed in 2019 the home improvement industry was estimated to be worth $650 billion. Now it is projected to generate $900 billion in sales annually. So primarily because of the effects of the pandemic the market grew by $250 billion.

Home Depot (NYSE: HD) is capturing a meaningful share of this massive and growing market. Let's take a closer look at how it's succeeding in doing so.

Home Depot is the largest home improvement retailer in the world

Interestingly Home Depot's total sales for its fiscal 2021 which ended on Jan. 30 were $151 billion. That was 14.4% higher than the year before. Several macroeconomic factors fueled consumer spending on home improvement. Fiscal stimulus payments to households rising home values and limited inventories of homes for sale spurred homeowners to improve their living spaces.

If you take the $150 billion sales figure and divide it by the $900 billion market size Home Depot's market share is an estimated 17%. Home Depot is the world's largest home improvement retailer and boasts the most significant market share. Lowe's Companies (NYSE: LOW) its formidable rival achieved sales of $96 billion in fiscal 2021. A substantial sum to be sure but considerably behind Home Depot.

What's more Home Depot has set a new target of reaching $200 billion in sales. Of course that may take some years to achieve but it highlights that management sees growth opportunities ahead. For fiscal 2022 Home Depot forecasts its revenue will remain relatively flat as economies reopen and folks spend less time at home. Home Depot has grown revenue at a compound annual rate of 7.9% in the last decade. The long-run growth rate is likely to be closer to that of the previous decade rather than what has happened since the outbreak.

The market likes a winner

Home Depot's superior market share leads to a superior operating profit margin. The company has outperformed Lowe's its biggest competitor in this metric over the last decade. That's evidence that the home improvement industry has economies of scale. In other words profit margins grow with sales. One reason could be that Home Depot pays lower prices for inventory because it buys in bigger batch sizes.

Unsurprisingly Home Depot's stock is trading more expensively than Lowe's due to the better market share and operating profit margin. Regardless of how the home improvement market evolves as the world progresses against COVID-19 Home Depot is likely to perform better than Lowe's until the latter can improve operating performance.

When Cisco and NetApp’s converged infrastructure storage platform FlexPod launched in 2010 commercial cloud computing was still in its infancy. Now over a decade has passed and the enterprise storage paradigm has shifted dramatically as companies embrace the hybrid cloud. In face of this new reality the developers of FlexPod have announced an upcoming refresh of the platform one that better postures the solution for hybrid cloud environments with a new suite of tools.

Dubbed XCS the updated product ties together Cisco’s Intersight Platform with NetApp’s ONTAP software granting users full-stack visibility end-to-end automation and native integration with three major cloud service providers.

See below to learn all about what does FlexPod XCS offer in relation to its prior version and the converged infrastructure storage market:

FlexPod and the converged infrastructure market

Data centers built under the traditional three-tier model consist of servers storage devices and networking switches. Often this group of hardware is built by different manufacturers and many resources have been expended to ensure compatibility and functionality between the layers. Converged infrastructure such as FlexPod was developed in response to this by establishing best practices and pre-validating all the hardware to be used in a data center.

Platforms like FlexPod also often deliver their converged solutions with a converged system adviser giving administrators the ability to monitor and control the broader system quickly and efficiently. FlexPod also ships with UCS-Director which can pre-provision applications automate services and allocate CPUs and memory as needed.

In the case of FlexPod the hardware is made by Cisco and it’s bundled with NetApp software. The integrated hardware and software coupled with the streamlined support channels from limited vendors has made converged infrastructure a more modern solution to the challenges that arose within the traditional model. Other converged infrastructure solutions include Dell PowerEdge VRTX HPE Converged and Oracle Supercluster.

By contrast hyperconverged infrastructures unify all elements of a data center into a single appliance. While this carries furter benefits toward simplifying network and storage management with potential reductions in cost hyperconverged infrastructures often pose challenges to scalability.

FlexPod XCS features

Some of the new tools that help FlexPod XCS span on-premises workloads into the cloud include:

Cisco Intersight Platform: A cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform that monitors and controls the underlying FlexPod components whether they be on the edge the cloud or in-house managed through a single pane. The software unites Cisco and NetApp storage as well as Kubernetes containerization management through a single dashboard.

Cloud integrations: The converged infrastructure platform features native integration with the three preeminent cloud service providers: AWS Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. This integration extends the single-dashboard visibility of the broader storage environment bridging on-premises servers and the cloud. FlexPod XCS includes health status alarms monitoring of storage capacity and network usage and compliance checking and enforcement.

As-a-service model: FlexPod XCS introduces the service model lowering startup costs to use the platform. Pricing is scalable with customer usage and needs.

Automation: Cisco’s Cloud Orchestrator optimizes workloads automates tasks enforces policies and enables users to self-serve. It is designed to be low/no code. Automation services are configured out of the box servicing day zero configuration workflows and beyond.

Hybrid cloud readiness: Designed to manage cloud backups disaster recovery and fulfill burst needs for processing and capacity.

Containerization: Using NetApp’s CSI Trident FlexPod XCS manages Kubernetes containers with community-developed standardized APIs. Kubernetes deployment is further managed with Cisco’s Intersight Kubernetes Service (IKS). Cloud-native applications can be deployed either locally or in the cloud.

NetApp ONTAP: FlexPod XCS comes with NetApp’s ONTAP data management software designed for file and block workloads.

Existing FlexPod features: While XCS branches FlexPod into the hybrid cloud it still retains the core converged infrastructure features of its previous iteration uniting the three tiers of server components under one management tool with pre-validated hardware.

Case study

Mantra Group

Although FlexPod XCS is in limited debut with full availability expected later this year the FlexPod platform has enjoyed widespread market adoption. One such client is the Australia- and New Zealand-based high-profile hotel chain Mantra Group. With over 11000 rooms for rent across 117 properties Mantra is one of Australia’s largest hotel operators. The company experienced rapid growth and expected more on the horizon as it targeted Asia-Pacific developments. Back ending its operations is a central reservation system one that is accessed by nearly all its employees and many of its customers. While the previous system was performing well Mantra knew it required future proofing to avoid performance loss as the chain grew.

The company adopted several components in securing a more responsive broader IT infrastructure including all-flash storage units from NetApp Cisco unified computing system servers and network switches and NetApp’s Data ONTAP OS much of which was deployed in a FlexPod environment. The resulting solution “could double the number of properties [Mantra] manages over the next three years” while maintaining a high level of performance according to Manta’s IT general manager.

Use case

Data center for AI

Cisco and NetApp offer configurations of FlexPod for different use cases including a setup optimized for the high computing and storage demands of artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML). These high-performance computations require complex integrations of hardware and software components that can make deployment scaling and maintenance operations burdensome under traditional data center models. FlexPod’s Data center for AI solution is optimized for these types of workloads with high-performance Cisco servers NVIDIA GPUs 3 TB of memory and support for up to 24 hard disk drives (HDDs) or solid-state drives (SSDs). FlexPod has deployed these solutions in the financial industry to thwart fraud in the health care industry to process medical image screening and in media and entertainment to produce virtual reality (VR) environments. The data center also stands ready to collaborate across cloud platforms.

Differentiator

FlexPid XCS is a converged infrastructure platform integrated with AWS Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. As most enterprises are already hosting their hybrid cloud platforms with these providers the integrations could stand to simplify deployment and management of hybrid cloud platforms and give FlexPod users better service and support.

User reviews

The presently-available version of FlexPod is PeerSpot’s No. 2 converged infrastructure tool with a customer rating of 4.2 out of 5 stars. Users praise the unified full-stack solution its scalability and its high availability.

Pricing

Pricing for XCS is yet to be determined but XCS will be available for purchase later this summer and available with a pay-as-you-go model.

Conclusions

FlexPod already enjoys adoption from thousands of enterprise clients across the world. We’ll be following how its next iteration empowers IT with more intelligent insights serves data storage and supports web application deployment in multicloud environments later this year when the updated converged infrastructure solution hits the market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYW5hcnJhdGl2ZS5jb20vaW5kaWEtbmV3cy9pbmRpYS1wb3N0LWlzc3Vlcy13YXJuaW5nLW92ZXItZmFrZS1tZXNzYWdlcy1pbi1pdHMtbmFtZS1hc2tpbmctcGVvcGxlLWZvci1iYW5rLWRldGFpbHMtdG8tc2VuZC1nb3Z0LW1vbmV5LTM1MDE5Lmh0bWzSAaMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kaWFuYXJyYXRpdmUuY29tL2luZGlhLW5ld3MvaW5kaWEtcG9zdC1pc3N1ZXMtd2FybmluZy1vdmVyLWZha2UtbWVzc2FnZXMtaW4taXRzLW5hbWUtYXNraW5nLXBlb3BsZS1mb3ItYmFuay1kZXRhaWxzLXRvLXNlbmQtZ292dC1tb25leS0zNTAxOS5odG1sL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India Post issues warning over fake messages in its name asking people for bank details to send Govt money,"India Post has issued a warning against fake messages being issued in its name by fraudsters claiming government subsidies and prizes are being issued to people and asking individuals for bank account numbers and OTPs.

We may make money when you click on links to our partners. Learn More.

For the better part of a decade Hitachi Vantara has been providing network-attached storage (NAS) systems to enterprise markets.

Their NAS products are built for high performance and scalability using object-based storage and a proprietary architecture designed to boost CPU-demanding tasks.

See below to learn all about where the Hitachi Vantara NAS Platform stands in the NAS market:

The NAS market

With many attractive NAS products on the market today Hitachi Vantara stands out as one of the largest NAS providers. Some of its most significant competitors include HPE with its 3PAR StoreServ NAS IBM with its FlashSystem solution Dell EMC’s PowerScale and NetApp’s FAS Series.

Some industry analysts project the NAS market to grow at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 20% over the next five years. At this time more than 80% of mid-market and enterprise organizations use NAS devices to complement their broader storage platforms. Their popularity is driven by their purpose-built efficient designs that push performance at a sensible cost.

Features

Scalability is at the heart of Hitachi Vantara’s NAS platform. Virtual capacity is unlimited though there is a 1PB cap on individual file sizes.

The filesystem is designed to span across multiple namespaces and across public and private clouds. In addition the platform has a multitenancy capacity of up to 64 Hitachi Enterprise Virtual Servers for NAS which operate across multiple security domains.

From a hardware perspective Hitachi NAS nodes are powered by Intel Xeon quad-core CPUs 64GB RAM and non-volatile DIMM (NVDIMM) to provide data resilience in the event of a power outage. The devices also carry multiple field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) to facilitate and parallelize data transfers support encryption services manage system space and support system backups.

At the software level Hitachi NAS uses a next-generation small file IO cutting down capacity requirements for data storage by 28% over its previous iteration and providing other optimizations to cut down on write operations. Data can be managed using hard or soft quotas on users groups and volumes so administrators can provision capacity and tasks.

The platform also has a cluster namespace feature which produces a single directory that can span across numerous storage units.

The platform is designed to offload unused data into archival cloud storage supporting AWS Azure and IBM’s cloud services and of course Hitachi’s own cloud platform.

Disk usage is optimized using a tiered file system (TFS). TFS separates metadata and user data putting metadata on a storage tier geared toward higher performance and placing user data on a lower tier or in cloud backup if it is rarely accessed. These cloud files are linked across volumes maintaining their accessibility while still appearing within the one-folder architecture of a traditional NAS appliance.

Data maintains a high availability with an automated synchronous disaster recovery feature. Deduplication is similarly automated and made transparent to the end user. Hitachi Vantara claims users can expect the automated deduplication can “achieve up to 90% capacity savings.”

Configuration and deployment are also automated as is data self-healing. Snapshots can be made based on a variety of options including single file or whole directory clones or file system snapshots that are hidden read-only and designed to integrate with Microsoft’s Volume Shadow Copy Service recovery tool.

Benefits

The flexible scalability of a NAS gateway with easy cloud integrations makes Hitachi’s NAS platform a solid solution for any growing enterprise with expanding data storage needs. Further the system can be complemented with a Hitachi Virtual Storage Platform all-flash array providing the speed and performance of flash drives at the back end.

Use case

A Belgian research organization the Space Pole studies weather and climate and how it is impacted by stellar activity. Their data is shared all over the world and the organization produces a lot of it.

The organization is made up of three different research institutions and in order to advance their mission they recognized the need to consolidate how they manage and serve data.

The Space Pole engaged with a dozen storage hardware vendors to develop a solution. Ultimately they sided with two Hitachi NAS Platform 4080 systems back-ended by two Hitachi Virtual Storage Platform G400 models with a collective capacity of 8PB.

The system supports asynchronous disaster recovery a useful feature for the multi-campus organization. But ultimately what swayed the team toward Hitachi Vantara was the simplicity of their solution.

“We received a lot of very different proposals and the Hitachi Vantara offering stood out” said Fabienne Leclère a project manager at the Space Pole. “What initially attracted us to the Hitachi solution was how clear and straightforward it is; there was no unnecessary complexity.”

The Space Pole reports that the new storage solution reduced their direct storage costs by 50% while doubling overall performance thanks to the parallelization of disk usage. The company was also pleased with Hitachi’s preventative maintenance replacing disks often before they reached a critical failure.

Differentiators

Hitachi’s NAS products operate in a gateway configuration. While client devices interact with gateway devices the same way they do legacy NAS appliances gateways can seamlessly distribute storage across multiple drives while still providing a single folder interface. New drives can be introduced into NAS gateways without disruption to the existing file system providing theoretically infinite scalability.

In practice Hitachi NAS gateways can scale up to 80 NAS nodes supporting up to 4 trillion objects namespace with an aggregate 384GBps of throughput. The company claims to be the only major vendor of gateway NAS devices today.

User reviews

Reviewers on Gartner Peer Insights give Hitachi Vantara’s NAS gateway a collective 4.2 out of 5 star rating. Customers praised the hardware reliability and the responsiveness of Hitacha Vantara’s customer service. In addition the platform was received well for its high performance.

Although some customers wanted a greater degree of administrative options offered from the GUI as opposed to interfacing via the command line.

Pricing

Hitachi Vantara provides several purchase or lease options through their EverFlex service even offering a pay-per-use consumption model similar to typical cloud storage pricing schemes.

They also have an interactive Value Selector tool to help customers evaluate their storage-as-a-service needs. Due to the broad range of possible configurations with a NAS gateway it’s important to carefully evaluate your storage needs before pricing out a solution.

Conclusion

For a company seeking the scalability and versatility of a NAS gateway platform there are few options out there that match Hitachi Vantara’s NAS Platform. Historically NAS gateways carry added complexity to setup and administration but many customers praise Hitachi Vantara for providing an easy-to-use product and a reasonable price.",,,,,,
NFLX,Netflix,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tZWRpYS8yMDIyL2Fwci8yMy9ob3VzZS1vZi1jYXJkcy13aHktdGhlLXdvcmxkLWlzLWZhbGxpbmctb3V0LW9mLWxvdmUtd2l0aC1uZXRmbGl40gFuaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL21lZGlhLzIwMjIvYXByLzIzL2hvdXNlLW9mLWNhcmRzLXdoeS10aGUtd29ybGQtaXMtZmFsbGluZy1vdXQtb2YtbG92ZS13aXRoLW5ldGZsaXg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,House of cards? Why the world is falling out of love with Netflix,"An era comes to be defined by its major innovations and sometimes just a simple company name does the trick: the Ford Motor Company more than a century ago or Virgin in the 1980s. They are the business ideas that sum up a moment of progress. Of course somewhat less prophetically there were also the shorter-lived promises offered by DeLorean or Myspace.

Until last week all of us were enjoying “the Netflix boom” mainly because of what the streaming giant represented rather than for what it actually was. Netflix stood for easy access to culture for family sharing and for turning our backs on the shallow commerce of ad breaks. And it quickly became rather an emotional consumer relationship especially during the dark lockdowns imposed during the pandemic. In isolation the homebound took solace in The Crown Stranger Things Bridgerton Money Heist Lupin Call My Agent! or Squid Game. In fact for 10 years now in the UK these box-set shows have fed a national conversation that occasionally also intersected with the chatter around the rest of the world.

So when Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings admitted last week that 200000 subscribers had walked away in the first quarter of the year with more likely to follow fans of the service were forced to reassess. As a result of the losses the company’s share price dropped more than 35% last Wednesday sliding nearly 8% further the next day. Then billionaire investor Bill Ackman decided to sell his Netflix shares despite incurring a vast loss because things were suddenly looking so scary.

For many inside the industry the alarm call from Netflix was the sign they had been waiting for that after a vertiginous climb “peak subscription” had finally been reached. After all hadn’t music lovers already noticed how complicated their love affair with Spotify had become? The freedom to enjoy their favourite tunes was it turned out actually a threat to the livelihoods of the musicians that made them.

Among those who claim to have seen the writing on the wall well before the Netflix announcement are two Swedish entrepreneurs who are banking on a return to a simpler deal. Måns Ulvestam and Karl Rosander the founders of Acast the podcast platform have now created a new ebook and audiobook platform called Sesamy – for which customers will only pay what they want when they want it on any device. The Swedes believe the public has seen through the premise of a subscription. In their view it is not just belt-tightening that has caused Netflix members to leave the fold.

“We are seeing the end of the something now that began with the paywall” said Ulvestam. “It is not sustainable because it does not work for customers or for creatives any more.”

Like the gyms that rely on users forgetting about their monthly membership payments the subscription model according to Sesamy’s creators verges on being a deception. “We think all these content subscriptions with their ‘easy on-boarding’ and very tricky cancellation are almost a fraud” said Rosander.

But surely Netflix a place where so many British viewers still go to enjoy their evenings cannot be facing disaster? After all even a show with bad reviews such as Anatomy of a Scandal is drawing a lot of viewers while this weekend the new teen drama Heartstopper has been greeted with critical bouquets and hailed by some as the most important British TV show since It’s a Sin.

Much of the rush to weep over Netflix’s imaginary open grave has been partly motivated by the way the success of the company which had attracted new subscribers steadily for more than a decade has been held up as an example to public service broadcasters such as Channel 4 and the BBC. When the culture secretary Nadine Dorries said earlier this month that she wanted Channel 4 to be free to compete with Netflix many programme-makers were quick to point out that the global streamer she so admired had had great difficulty establishing a viable business model.

And Netflix itself has never liked this rivalry. The company line is that Britain’s public service channels are its “creative partners”. To substantiate this it points to investment in hundreds of hours of content including popular shows such as The Serpent Giri/Haji and Dracula. A show such as The End of the F**king World first seen exclusively on Channel 4 and then shown by Netflix reaped renewed popularity when it returned to C4 for a second series.

For those other Netflix sceptics the cinephiles news of the drop in subscriptions bore the sweet scent of revenge. Film fans are still smarting at the way the streamer challenged the financial balance of cinema’s theatrical distribution model. Once Netflix started to make its own feature-length products the Cannes film festival tried to take a stand against it by banning films that had not been given a release in French cinemas. Organisers warned of an existential threat to the big-screen experience.

But now Netflix has become a prominent part of the film ecology with The Irishman seducing director Martin Scorsese into the streaming world and both The Power of the Dog and Don’t Look Up winning Oscar nominations last month.

Like many a good film hero Netflix had more humble origins. Long before it dominated the entertainment scene it was an unassuming DVD delivery service just as Virgin started out as a record label and Amazon once only wanted to sell books. But in 2012 the same year it launched in Britain Netflix began to produce its own content including the compelling Washington political drama House of Cards. Ten years on the company has 221.64 million subscribers in more than 190 countries.

Any documentary about Netflix’s fortunes however could not yet chart a dramatic downward path. For a start a chunk of its financial instability can be put down to the shutting down of its Russian service following the invasion of Ukraine and to the fact that most of those in the west who want to join Netflix already have.

British Netflix subscription levels are holding up comparatively well yet every form of media service is having to think quickly about what subscription overload will mean. And this pondering has become more urgent with the news that the Competition and Markets Authority in Britain is now set to make “subscription traps” illegal.

So perhaps this is all a category error? That’s what some analysts argue anyway. We have wrongly assumed that Netflix is a tech innovator simply because its extraordinary expansion prompted many media empires to copy it including Disney Warner Brothers NBC and Paramount to say nothing of Amazon and Apple. But Netflix is not really founded on tech: it is just an entertainment provider that became a production studio – and that is always a very precarious business. As the screenwriter William Goldman famously put it in showbiz “nobody knows anything”. It simply is not possible for hit to follow hit even if you spend $55bn on television shows and movies as Netflix did between 2018 and 2021.

In reaction to the subscriptions slump Hastings and his team have suggested they will be holding back on their spending opening their minds to running adverts “in a year or two” and pushing harder on quality by somehow “taking it up a notch”. (These three key strategies of course are also shared by many of the old-style content providers.)

One Twitter wit Jake Menez (@Jake Menez) met the news that Netflix was now considering launching a cheaper service supported by adverts with the line: “That’s pretty neat. I’d probably give it a snappy name like ‘television’ or maybe ‘cable.’”

For the average household the company’s change in attitude to the cosy sharing of passwords will come as a bigger shock. Six years ago Hastings said “we love people sharing Netflix”. Now with an estimated 100 million people using each other’s accounts the chief executive is not so relaxed.

The truth is that neither consumer markets nor quality entertainment are endlessly expandable. If we all want a supply of good films and television we have to ensure that it is priced fairly and that the artists are being paid well. Otherwise as Rosander drily points out TV culture is in danger of reverting to a Renaissance situation where only the wealthy can afford the good stuff: “That is why all the paintings back then were of the duke’s wife.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvbmV0ZmxpeC1zaGVkcy1zdWJzY3JpYmVycy1hbmQtMTcwYm4taW4tbWFya2V0LXZhbHVlLzIxODA4ODQ30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netflix sheds subscribers—and $170bn in market value,"I N JANUARY NETFLIX warned investors that it expected to add only 2.5m subscribers in the quarter ahead causing a sell-off that knocked nearly 30% off its share price. On April 19th the video-streamer admitted that the reality was worse: Netflix lost 200000 customers in the period its first net drop in more than a decade. The firm expects to lose another 2m between April and June. By April 20th it was worth 35% less than the day before—and 63% less than at the start of the year wiping out nearly $170bn in market value and making it the worst-performing stock in the S & P 500 index.

Subscribers in America drifted away after price rises that made Netflix the dearest big streaming service at $15.49 a month. Another 700000 accounts were lost when Netflix pulled out of Russia. Even in Latin America where it had been growing fast it shed members. And although it gained 1.1m new ones in Asia that is fewer than in the same period last year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9ob21lLWFuZC1vZmZpY2UvaG9tZS1lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2ktaGF2ZS04LXN0cmVhbWluZy1zZXJ2aWNlcy1uZXRmbGl4LWlzbnQtdGhlLXdvcnN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I have 8 streaming services. Netflix isn't the worst,"Struggling. Pained. Greedy. Image: Getty Images

Have you ever rolled over a movie on Netflix and seen it encapsulated in just three relatively empty words?

I thought I'd do the same to describe the horror movie that was the company's last week.

Ominous. Psychological. Drama.

Netflix admitted it had lost 200000 subscribers in the first quarter. It confessed it might try to squeeze money out of sneaky password-sharers. And with a bowed head it conceded it may introduce an ad-filled tier.

Scary. Disaster. Emotional.

Many might think this begins the demise of streaming. Some might discover irony in the idea that more traditional channels like HBO NBC and CBS were disrupting Netflix by steaming toward streaming themselves.

Naturally there have been suggestions that there's nothing to watch on Netflix anymore.

Which in my own case certainly isn't true. Why this week my wife and I have been enchanted by the entertaining vacuum that is the new Netflix series Anatomy of a Scandal.

Yet the story emerging from Netflix has made me consider the whole world of streaming and invited me to thoughts that can be summed up in three words.

Concerned. Subjective. Judgy.

What am I spending my money on? I subscribe to Netflix Amazon Prime HBO Max Apple TV+ ESPN+ Paramount Plus Hulu and Peacock. At least those are the ones I remember.

Sometimes only a credit card bill reminds me of all the streaming services that have slipped into my spending patterns.

Can we then drift through them all concerned and apply three-word descriptions for each? Can we conclude that one is the absolute worst? (Clue: We can.)

Amazon Prime: Best. Simplest. Priciest.



This is the one my wife and I watch the most.

You roll over a TV series or movie and instantly get some sort of brief encapsulation. We almost always find something we'd like to try.

But Amazon Prime does that sneaky thing of offering you its own fare and then slipping in shows you want to watch that cost you extra because they belong to some other more minor streaming channel.

Walter Presents for example. Or BritBox Acorn and PBS Masterpiece. It all costs more but it lures you into believing Amazon Prime itself has so many wonderful offerings that you'll never get around to watching them all.

Which perversely creates an odd loyalty.

HBO Max: Alright. Entertaining. Annoying.

I've had my issues with HBO Max. They were mainly Comcast's fault. On HBO Max we've sometimes found things we've really enjoyed. Like The Flight Attendant. (Oh come on. You loved it too.) Hacks was wonderful too.

But try finding something new to watch and Max is no help. You can't roll over anything to get a description. It gives you two choices: play it or add it to your list. How can I when I have no idea what it is?

By the by last week HBO Max executives admitted they knew the app was flawed when they launched it. Why thank you.

Also: Best streaming devices: Your top media player options

Apple TV+. OK. Rarely. Expensive.

There's Ted Lasso of course. I had to sign up to watch that. Two friends are in the show and I like football of the soccer kind. Beyond that I confess I haven't watched anything. That's how many of the streaming services make money. You forget you've signed up. If a streaming service doesn't become a regular habit it becomes an expensive frippery.

In essence then what am I doing? What am I paying for? I mean to watch The Morning Show and Severance then other streamers get in the way. The shame is mine for continuing to pay.

But now Apple TV Plus has Friday Night Baseball because sports is what makes for more regular viewing right? Talking of which.

Peacock: English. Football. Vital.

There's no other reason to watch Peacock. As far as I know. It has the English Premier League so I have to have it. It's likely tried to sell me on other shows via email. I've likely completely ignored them.

The same is true for ESPN+ replacing English with Spanish.

Paramount Plus: European. Football. Necessary.



Paramount Plus followed the Peacock strategy. It signed up European football. I'm sorry I mean saacker. Therefore one has to have it. Live sports make money. Every network knows this. Does Paramount Plus have other shows? Do I care?

Netflix: Consistent. Good. Insensitive.



Despite America's foremost intellectual Elon Musk claiming that the ""woke mind virus"" has taken it over Netflix really isn't so bad. Over the last 12 months it's brought us some of the very best things we've watched all year. Dix Pour Cent for example. And the startlingly brilliant Sexify.

But we had to dig these out for ourselves. If there's one surprising thing -- to me at least -- it's that Netflix is incapable of actually recommending anything we want to watch.

Mind you; it's an enthusiastic email sender. It wants to know whether we're enjoying a series part of the way through. It wants us to finish watching something we started and really didn't like. And it emails us about completely uninteresting shows that we would never ever watch.

But is it the worst? Oh definitely not. This brings me to the um winner.

Also: Best Netflix alternatives: Binge-watch elsewhere

Hulu. Why. Oh. Why.

Before you snort too loudly please remember that this review had a deeply personal base: Concerned. Subjective. Judgy.

I've always wanted to give Hulu the benefit of my many doubts. We signed on to watch Normal People a series about miserable Irish teens having sex -- only because I'd read the book. We returned to watch Only Murders In The Building only because an actor friend insisted we see it.

After that nothing. This should have been grounds for divorce.

But what's made me scowl at Hulu are the emails. It's not the fact that Hulu sends them. It's one regular email that pains me.

The subject line: ""Plan To Stream This Weekend? Start Here.""

I'm open and accepting. Please Hulu tell me what you have for me. I open the email. Hulu informs me it has Comedy Drama Unscripted and Crime. That's it.

Please. Go. Away.

It's then down to me to click one of those and begin the usual fruitless search. So Hulu has gone on Pause Subscription and been sent to the corner. But at least Hulu offers a pause. Netflix for example doesn't.

My anti-Hulu actions aren't just abject subjectivity. They're a symptom of a wider issue.

Too many of these streaming services just don't have enough content that might interest us. They know they'll have to keep raising their prices. They know as Netflix has seen that when they do people wonder: ""Hmm. What am I really getting from these services?""

And then customers realize that exactly as with the cable cord they cut in an act of revolutionary zeal they're paying for what they don't watch not for what they do.

Netflix's troubles are just the beginning. Please prepare for the future.

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

Netflix is the industry standard when it comes to personalization and capturing an audience's attention. For years it has captivated viewers and kept them glued to their devices delivering hour after hour of content by collecting large amounts of user data and creating personalized journeys to provide relevant content. We've grown accustomed to and expect this level of customization and responsiveness in our consumer lives. But what about in the B2B buying and selling landscape?

Today's B2B customers demand a new level of customization and digital savviness. As the demand for personalized buying experiences grows businesses are looking for ways to meet buyers where they are. They're looking to the king of personalization for answers.

Continuously gather data and measure performance

The first lesson Netflix teaches is that more data is always better. Netflix's model couldn't exist without extensive viewer data including everything from basic demographic information to how long viewers scroll the main page. Why do they need this much information? Because the more information you have the more questions you can answer.

Netflix doesn't just sit on their data either. They use it to inform every possible decision from predicting what viewers want to watch next to even informing their content creation. The success rate for Netflix's original content is 93% meaning recording-breaking successes like Stranger Things and Bridgerton were predicted to succeed before even hitting the screen.

Netflix is also constantly looking for new and better ways to measure audience and success. Before 2019 Netflix counted 70% completion of an episode or movie as a view its main metric for engagement. In December of 2019 it changed a view to any watch time two minutes or longer reasoning that this measurement would account for unique eyes on a piece of content. Then in October of 2021 the metric changed again moving away from the number of views to minutes watched.

Now let's examine the importance of data and measurement from a B2B marketing and sales perspective. To be impactful marketing and sales teams should collect as much data as possible including web traffic email marketing stats and past purchasing data. This data will help build comprehensive and complete customer profiles which are critical to understanding and reaching prospects.

Personalization is paramount

Netflix built its brand on personalization. Each of its 216 million users has a unique homepage experience catered to their personal tastes. They are so good at personalized recommendations that they generate 80% of their viewer activity.

A crucial part of Netflix's personalization experience is that they understand different people can like the same content for different reasons. For example some people like superhero movies some people like looking at Chris Hemsworth and both groups watch The Avengers. You can see this practice at work when you look at show art and trailers for Netflix's original content.

For their first big original content piece House of Cards Netflix cut 10 different trailers each playing to a different kind of audience. They take the same approach with their show artwork displaying a different image depending on your content preferences. If a user likes a specific actor they are more likely to see a title card with their image whereas a user who likes action may see a still of an explosion instead.

From a B2B standpoint personalization is equally critical. Buying personas are very similar to viewing profiles each with its own unique pain points and reasons for purchasing. Companies often underestimate the effort of and how much they need personalization tactics to meet customers where they are today – but it's critical.

Personalization should be used to align marketing across personas and customer journey stages. Perhaps more important in the COVID-19 environment personalization ensures messages cut through all the other noise consumers are bombarded with. Consumers including B2B decision-makers spend more time on social media and email than ever before so deep personalization is the key to meeting customers where they're at with impactful and engaging experiences.

Tactically organizations can customize content with unique landing pages or email headers to position core messaging around different perspectives or try concierge selling. Using collected data and buyer personas equip sales with several pieces of content that would be considered relevant to the customer then present these options once sales is introduced into the buying cycle. Organizations can foster trust through a digitally-assisted sales approach that customizes all interactions and builds off previous conversations.

Content bingeing and its place in B2B

Netflix has a habit of keeping viewers on their screens for hours what we now call binge-watching. They grew this practice by capitalizing on the audience's desire to want more of a show immediately after consuming it a concept not offered by cable services at the time. By doing this they were able to maximize mindshare and keep their viewers coming back for more.

Through features like auto-play the next episode in a series immediately cues up after the first allowing users to keep going without navigating through the menu. When a series or film finishes Netflix is there with another personalized recommendation. They even generate entire categories based on previous watches pulling shows with similar themes actors or genres.

Content bingeing also serves a specific role in the B2B landscape by meeting buyers' expectations and making recommendations on what to read next. Armed with an abundance of content B2B marketers can maximize mindshare and build trust with prospects looking to learn and research. There are a few ways to use this concept to your advantage in a business setting.

First create multiple customer journeys and recommendation paths based on different buyer personas. By leaning on data and keeping personalization top of mind you can take advantage of a prospect's undivided attention to keep them engaged longer. When one piece of content ends put the suggestion for another related piece at its end.

Then use CTAs as content-bingeing gateways. A compelling call to action should not be the end of a content piece but the opening to a content bingeing journey that keeps prospects engaged enticed and carries them deeper into the sales funnel. Providing a piece of personal information is an explicit signal of interest. Once a prospect has submitted data hit them with another content recommendation. Software or website plug-ins can help create automated content recommendations as well.

Getting to know and deeply understanding customers has always been part of a successful business but we are now doing it on a massive scale. By collecting user data and distilling it down into comprehensive user profiles you can leverage your existing products and services to create a journey that speaks to their unique needs. By applying these personalization practices that Netflix executes so well organizations can see stronger more qualified leads and ultimately drive revenue in a digital-first era.

Fans are in shock after Greg Norman announced he is making a comeback to professional golf.

The Aussie legend revealed his intentions in an exclusive interview with The Daily Telegraph sending shockwaves around the world as social media went into meltdown.

You can read the full interview with Norman on The Daily Telegraph

The 67-year-old has not played professionally for 12 years but the two-time British Open champion has told News Corp Australia he is serious about making a return in time for the July tournament in a one-off final farewell appearance.

He says he is particularly drawn to play the event which is celebrating its 150th Open at the iconic St Andrews course.

Aussie golfing commentator Luke Elvy was blown away when the news was revealed by News Corp Australia on Saturday morning.

“This will get the news cycle pumping” he wrote on Twitter.

“Most will use it to bag Greg given the LIV Golf venture but he’s earned his spot in the field having won two Claret Jugs. Who wouldn’t want to play in the 150th Open at the home of golf.”

However his dream of making a comeback in less than three months remains murky as a result of British Open regulations.

The former world No. 1 has put the Royal and Ancient Golf Club which oversees the event in a difficult position.

Norman no longer qualifies for immediate entry into the event as a past champion because the guaranteed entry cuts off for past champions at the age of 60.

He will have to earn his way through qualifying or hope for a wildcard entry.

The event has previously bent the rules for former champions with Tom Watson added to the field at the age of 65.

A wildcard would be an extraordinary development as a result of Norman’s mission to establish a rebel golf league.

The Aussie golfing legend is spearheading the Saudi-backed LIV Golf Invitational Series that has threatened to shake the sport to its core.

The tour announced last year the PIF — the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund — had committed more than $AUD260 million for Norman to play with.

However reports in February claimed the Super Golf League — and the LIV Golf Investments firm running it — has a war chest of nearly $2.9 billion to steal the world’s best players and establish its own tour as a legitimate body in golf.

It’s why the golfing world’s immediate reaction was one of scepticism about his chances of playing the Open.

Aussie golf journalist Ben Everill speculated Norman may be making a power move by going public with his plans. He responded to a tweet by writing: “Greg maybe looking to have a public forum to debate”.

Golf Digest reporter Evin Priest wrote on Twitter: “Greg Norman has revealed to Julian Linden he wants to dust off the Cobras and play The Open at St Andrews. It would be an incredible story but there is one MASSIVE roadblock”.

Sport Illustrated golf reporter Bob Harig wrote on Twitter: “Love to see how anyone thinks he will get in the field”.

PGA Tour journalist James Corrigan wrote: “Erm unless Greg qualifies then no. Former champs invited until they’re 60. Greg is 67”.

Canadian golf reporter Rick Young wrote on Twitter he believes the Open may have a hard time saying no to Norman.

Norman’s rebel league has been a disaster so far with the world’s best players snubbing his rich offers.

Rory McIlroy said the new tour was “dead in the water”.

The series’ first event begins in London from June 9.

Norman’s rebel eight-tournament series boasts a prize money pool of approximately $350 million — and that’s what counts Norman says.

The world’s best golfers have snubbed Norman but the former World No. 1 is confident they will change their mind when they get a look at the prize money being tossed around.

“Quite honestly it doesn’t matter who plays we’re going to put the event on” Norman told the UK Telegraph.

“There’s a ($5.8 million) first prize. I hope a kid who’s 350th in the world wins. It’ll change his life his family’s life.

“And then a few of our events will go by and the top players will see someone winning ($8.06 million) ($10.76 million) and say ‘enough is enough I know I can beat these guys week in week out with my hands tied behind my back’.”

He says discussions with other big-name golfers are ongoing.

Norman conceded the tour may start with a “modest” amount of players but would grow when others saw the concept.

“None of us should stand for these egregious acts of bullying by the PGA Tour” Norman wrote according to golfchannel.com.

“We encourage you to request the PGA Tour provide you with these threats in writing and written opinions of its outside counsel that these bans are legal and enforceable.

“It would not surprise us if the Tour is unwilling to do so.”

He said the SGL hopes to co-exist with the PGA Tour.

They could not believe their luck when they saw a post on an online marketplace seeking a house in the Sunshine Coast hinterland suburb of Landsborough.

“We ended up reaching out to him and he came out and put an offer in” Ms Steele said.

“It was exactly what we were looking for.”

When they bought in the electorate of Fisher four years ago the couple never expected house prices to rise as much as nearly 60 per cent in that time.

“It’s ridiculous” Ms Steele said.

“There was a lot more to choose from back then and less competition.”

They purchased the Landsborough property for $425000 in 2019 and have just sold it for nearly double that three years on.

But they have managed to buy back in to the same market just a suburb away in the Glass House Mountains where they secured a four-bedroom house for $1 million on nearly 1400 sqm — plenty of room for their 11-month-old daughter Lily to grow and enjoy.

Ray White Beerwah agent Alex Garden who negotiated the sale of the property said the entry level price for a house in the area had jumped from around $500000 in 2019 to $800000 today.

Mr Garden said most buyers looking in the area were mums and dads with two kids looking for “room to kick a soccer ball” or retirees wanting a property with room for a shed.

“Besides having some of the best schools on the Sunny Coast we’ve also got quite a friendly community” he said.

“You walk down the street and everyone smiles and says G’day. It’s out of the way you get peace and privacy and the zoo is just down the road.”"

He will have to earn his way through qualifying or hope for a wildcard entry.

The event has previously bent the rules for former champions with Tom Watson added to the field at the age of 65.

A wildcard would be an extraordinary development as a result of Norman’s mission to establish a rebel golf league.

The Aussie golfing legend is spearheading the Saudi-backed LIV Golf Invitational Series that has threatened to shake the sport to its core.

The tour announced last year the PIF — the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund — had committed more than $AUD260 million for Norman to play with.

However reports in February claimed the Super Golf League — and the LIV Golf Investments firm running it — has a war chest of nearly $2.9 billion to steal the world’s best players and establish its own tour as a legitimate body in golf.

It’s why the golfing world’s immediate reaction was one of scepticism about his chances of playing the Open.

Aussie golf journalist Ben Everill speculated Norman may be making a power move by going public with his plans. He responded to a tweet by writing: “Greg maybe looking to have a public forum to debate”.

Golf Digest reporter Evin Priest wrote on Twitter: “Greg Norman has revealed to Julian Linden he wants to dust off the Cobras and play The Open at St Andrews. It would be an incredible story but there is one MASSIVE roadblock”.

Sport Illustrated golf reporter Bob Harig wrote on Twitter: “Love to see how anyone thinks he will get in the field”.

PGA Tour journalist James Corrigan wrote: “Erm unless Greg qualifies then no. Former champs invited until they’re 60. Greg is 67”.

Canadian golf reporter Rick Young wrote on Twitter he believes the Open may have a hard time saying no to Norman.

Norman’s rebel league has been a disaster so far with the world’s best players snubbing his rich offers.

Rory McIlroy said the new tour was “dead in the water”.

The series’ first event begins in London from June 9.

Norman’s rebel eight-tournament series boasts a prize money pool of approximately $350 million — and that’s what counts Norman says.

The world’s best golfers have snubbed Norman but the former World No. 1 is confident they will change their mind when they get a look at the prize money being tossed around.

“Quite honestly it doesn’t matter who plays we’re going to put the event on” Norman told the UK Telegraph.

“There’s a ($5.8 million) first prize. I hope a kid who’s 350th in the world wins. It’ll change his life his family’s life.

“And then a few of our events will go by and the top players will see someone winning ($8.06 million) ($10.76 million) and say ‘enough is enough I know I can beat these guys week in week out with my hands tied behind my back’.”

He says discussions with other big-name golfers are ongoing.

Norman conceded the tour may start with a “modest” amount of players but would grow when others saw the concept.

“None of us should stand for these egregious acts of bullying by the PGA Tour” Norman wrote according to golfchannel.com.

“We encourage you to request the PGA Tour provide you with these threats in writing and written opinions of its outside counsel that these bans are legal and enforceable.

“It would not surprise us if the Tour is unwilling to do so.”

He said the SGL hopes to co-exist with the PGA Tour.

They could not believe their luck when they saw a post on an online marketplace seeking a house in the Sunshine Coast hinterland suburb of Landsborough.

“We ended up reaching out to him and he came out and put an offer in” Ms Steele said.

“It was exactly what we were looking for.”

When they bought in the electorate of Fisher four years ago the couple never expected house prices to rise as much as nearly 60 per cent in that time.

“It’s ridiculous” Ms Steele said.

“There was a lot more to choose from back then and less competition.”

They purchased the Landsborough property for $425000 in 2019 and have just sold it for nearly double that three years on.

But they have managed to buy back in to the same market just a suburb away in the Glass House Mountains where they secured a four-bedroom house for $1 million on nearly 1400 sqm — plenty of room for their 11-month-old daughter Lily to grow and enjoy.

Ray White Beerwah agent Alex Garden who negotiated the sale of the property said the entry level price for a house in the area had jumped from around $500000 in 2019 to $800000 today.

Mr Garden said most buyers looking in the area were mums and dads with two kids looking for “room to kick a soccer ball” or retirees wanting a property with room for a shed.

“Besides having some of the best schools on the Sunny Coast we’ve also got quite a friendly community” he said.

“You walk down the street and everyone smiles and says G’day. It’s out of the way you get peace and privacy and the zoo is just down the road.”"

It’s what the money says.,"My favorite scene in the movie adaptation of Michael Lewis’ “Moneyball” occurred during 2003 in the darkened Oakland A’s locker room where Billy Beane the team’s general manager reluctantly slid a folded piece of paper across a table to his math genius assistant Peter Brand.

Unfolding the paper Brand stared at the number written telling Beane after a pause the offer from the Boston Red Sox would make Beane the highest-paid general manager in sports.

“So?” So what? Beane replies somewhat annoyed.

“You’re not doing it for the money” Brand says. “You’re doing it for what the money says.”

Before the credits roll we learn that Beane turned down an offer of $12.5 million a year to run a Red Sox team that would win a World Series a year later in 2004.

What you may be rightfully wondering does that have to do with electric infrastructure and the future of supply chains?

Maybe nothing. But stay with me here.

DOE doles out infrastructure dough

The Michael Lewis bestseller Moneyball was made into a 2011 movie starring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill. It is a true story of Oakland A’s general manager and current executive vice president Billy Beane a speaker at the FreightWaves Future of Supply Chain event May 9-10 in Northwest Arkansas.

For just a couple hundred thousand dollars more than Red Sox owner John Henry offered Beane the Department of Energy is granting two major auto suppliers and one university a total of $12.7 million to develop fast-charging infrastructure for electric vehicles.





If commercial electric vehicles — especially heavy-duty trucks — are going to be viable they need to be able to charge quickly. Otherwise they could become a future supply chain obstacle. Ready access to low-cost fast-charging infrastructure is essential for fleet electrification and broader EV adoption. Scaling current charging technology is pricey.

I missed the specifics of these grants late last year. And I wondered why BorgWarner Inc. just got around to announcing its $4.09 million award on April 14. Eaton Corp which picked up $4.9 million in the “Fiscal Year 2021 Low Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Vehicle Technologies Research Development Demonstration and Deployment” program issued its release four months ago.

North Carolina State University received $3.9 million. In total the DOE gave out more than $68 million across eight infrastructure-related areas including $5 million to Achates Power whose opposed-piston 2-stroke hybrid commercial vehicle system was featured in Truck Tech on Friday.

What the money says (and buys)

BorgWarner (NYSE: BWA) is leading a team on a36-month project to design and develop a cost-effective advanced direct current fast charger (DCFC).

It is coordinating with U.S.-based suppliers and research partners including Michigan State University eTransEnergy Cityfi the State of Michigan and the construction firm Barton Malow. Component supplier support is coming from Wolfspeed Inc.

The goal is to develop the next-generation DCFC system for 20-30% lower cost than current systems. BorgWarner’s flexible and adaptable single-stage power conversion and power module architecture will allow up to five vehicles to share 150 to 350 kilowatts of juice in 25kW modules. Five other EVs can be plugged in and ready to be charged.

Initially the charger won’t help trucks much since they need more power because of the size of their battery packs. But BorgWarner is confident it can get there.

Solid state transformer

Eaton (NYSE: ETN) is developing a compact and turnkey solution for DC fast-charging infrastructure. It is expected to reduce costs by 65% through improvements in power conversion grid interconnection technology charger integration and modularity and installation time.





A solid-state Eaton transformer design and modular chargers packaged on a compact skid will speed installation and reduce the amount of equipment and space needed both of which should reduce cost. It will connect directly to a utility’s medium-voltage distribution system eliminating the need for additional power conversion devices.

Eaton is leading the project. Partners include the National Renewable Energy Lab N.C. State the University of Pittsburgh ITC Holdings and Calstart the national nonprofit focus on clean transportation.

Eaton NCSU and Pitt are collaborating on the technical development of the solid-state transformer. NREL will validate the technology. ITC Holdings will provide a demonstration site for fleet charging and CALSTART will independently validate costs and performance.

One more coincidence

Oh and one more coincidence. Beane who remains with the A’s as executive vice president nearly two decades after the Moneyball story was told in Lewis’ 2003 bestseller will speak at the FreightWaves Future of Supply Chain event in Northwest Arkansas on May 9-10.

Nike and Rtfkt’s first digital sneakers are here. On Friday the digital fashion and 3D creation studio which Nike acquired in December revealed a collection of co-branded digital sneakers on Discord and Twitter. The shoes called Nike Cryptokicks are modelled after the Nike Dunk sneaker and mark the brand’s long-awaited entrance into digital clothing.

The sneakers are available to people who own Rtfkt’s Mnlth a mysterious digital box NFT that was airdropped for free to anyone who owned a Clone-X in February. (Clone-X is the PFP project that Rtfkt created with artist Takashi Murakami in November.) People could elect to sell their Mnlth NFTs or keep them. Now those who held onto it have been rewarded: they can burn their current Mnlths in exchange for a Mnlth that holds a Cryptokick.

The company will offer eight Rtfkt-made evolutionary “skins” to start which let people customise the sneakers with various looks and designs similar to a video-game skill tree although the evolution mode isn't yet activated says co-founder Benoit Pagotto who worked in luxury fashion before founding Rtfkt. Rtfkt plans to open the ability for creators and partners to create skins. At launch one of the skins was created by Murakami.

Read More With Rtfkt acquisition Nike invests in the metaverse Nike has bought the two-year-old “Supreme of digital fashion” for an undisclosed sum. The move brings the brand further into the metaverse.

The sneaker community has enthusiastically embraced digital fashion and become a leader in trends including PFPs Discord communities and digital collectibles. Fittingly Adidas and Nike have been in competition to keep communities curious and intrigued about the metaverse. The same week that Nike acquired Rtfkt Adidas unveiled its hotly anticipated “Into the Metaverse” NFTs in collaboration with Web3 influencers Gmoney and the Bored Ape Yacht Club. Similar to Rtfkt Adidas’s strategy hinges on the promise of ongoing future perks including access to both digital and physical products and events. To that end Adidas has begun developing digital real estate on The Sandbox and Nike has an ongoing world on Roblox where people can play to earn digital goods.

Nike acquired two-year-old Rtfkt for an undisclosed sum in December bringing on a small team and large NFT fan-group. Nike called out the platform’s “next-generation collectibles that merge culture and gaming” and Nike Inc. president and CEO John Donahoe said it allows the company to serve creators at the “intersection of sport creativity gaming and culture”.

Trademarks filed by Nike for Cryptokicks earlier this week offered clues about its future roadmap: it filed for downloadable computer software for use as a cryptocurrency wallet; services for a marketplace for digital currency assets; services that provide a digital currency or token for an online community; electronic bulletin board services; blogs in crypto-collectibles; online scavenger hunts; and technology that enables members to receive crypto assets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzQvbmlrZS1ydGZrdC1uZnQtdmlydHVhbC1zbmVha2VyLW5ld3MtaW5mb9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike Cryptokick x RTFKT NFT Release Information,"Earlier this year virtual fashion start-up RTFKT dropped a mysterious NFT titled “MNLTH” a metallic cube that was decorated with its logo alongside Nike’s iconic Swoosh. Since then owners of said NFT have been on a journey completing “quests” posed by RTFKT in a bid to discover the cube’s contents.

Now though after almost three months of waiting it has been revealed that each cube in fact contains a pair of virtual sneakers dubbed Nike Cryptokicks which are based on the epochal Nike Dunk silhouette and will be customizable with eight RTFKT-made skins.

RTFKT — which was acquired by Nike in late 2021 — was founded in January 2020 and has worked on collaborations with the likes of Jeff Staple and Lexus as well as Takashi Murakami whose Clone X NFT remains one of the most successful to-date.

Cryptokicks is expected to be the first of many digital launches from Nike and RTFKT with rumors already circulating of more releases in the pipeline as early as next month. For now you can find out more about Nike Cryptokicks in the video above but keep your eyes peeled for more drops in the near future.

Editor’s Notes: The rumors are true: Yoon Ahn plans to AMBUSH her next Nike collaboration where she tackles the brand's timeless Air Adjust Force sneaker in AMBUSH fashion (duh).

The AMBUSH x Nike Air Adjust Force sneaker seemingly follows the vibe of the collaboration's Nike Dunk High rollout — which included Megan Thee Stallion-approved apparel and four Dunk drops — with ""LOTS coming"" for the upcoming release per Ahn herself.

Since her first teasers in November 2021 Ahn has previewed two AMBUSH x Nike Air Adjust Force colorways including a black/white and most recently white/black combo.

It's important to note that Ahn will be bringing back the Nike Air Adjust Force more than 25 years since its 1996 release.

So there's been lots of buzz between sneaker-enthused historians who can't wait to cop the classic 90's basketball shoe celebrated amongst college players for its hoopage appeal powered by its team-colored FitWrap straps.

Ahn does a solid job of preserving the Air Adjust Force's heritage design while bringing it to today's speed via AMBUSH revamps.

The AMBUSH x Nike Air Adjust Force touts a slightly slimmer — but still chunky nonetheless — physique as compared to its OG counterpart.

It's also worthy to point out the collaborative sneaker falls in line with Nike's Move To Zero efforts carrying a Nike Grind sole comprised of recycled materials.

Oh I can't forget the straps! Of course AMBUSH keeps the models' Swoosh-stamped interchangeable straps which can be worn with your kicks or ditched altgother. You could mix-match straps on the AMBUSH's Nike Air Adjust Force colorways — you know for the style daredevils out there.

Then AMBUSH's bold logo graces the heel while the Nike Swoosh pops up three times on the upper and tongue rounding off the collaborative team effort.

I'm going to say it: Yoon Ahn has done it again with her upcoming AMBUSH x Nike Air Adjust Force — and they're not even out yet. But with this many teasers circulating I suspect we won't be waiting much longer for an official release date.

Amazon workers from other facilities are standing at the front door of the warehouse talking to workers at all hours of the day while workers inside the facility focus on conversations on the shop floor and in the breakrooms. There is momentum from the JFK8 victory but fighting for a union will always be an uphill battle when taking on a mega corporation like Amazon and a multi-billionaire like Jeff Bezos.

It’s essential to apply the lessons from JFK8 organizing around clear demands building a democratic worker-led committee and clearly naming a boss like Jeff Bezos as the enemy. However applying these lessons at LDJ5 a different facility with different workplace conditions workplace issues and with less time to prepare poses unique challenges for the struggle at LDJ5. On top of this Amazon has learned its own lessons from their defeat at JFK8 and is rolling out more sophisticated union busting tactics to try to undermine ALU’s efforts.

Socialist Alternative in New York has been out front helping get out the vote at LDJ5 and here’s some of the outrageous union busting lies we’ve heard Amazon tell.

Now Hiring: $2000/day To Bust Unions at Amazon

Amazon claims the union is an outside “third party” even though a union is nothing more than the workers themselves. However this has not stopped Amazon from paying professional union busting consultants over $2000 a day to dress up as concerned coworkers. They walk around the facility as awkwardly as live-action versions of the Steve Buscemi meme approaching people saying “how do you do fellow workers?” Their job is to introduce doubt and suspicion about the union on the shop floor.

It’s not surprising that Amazon is prepared to pay third party union-busting consultants more than they’re willing to pay their own workers however it’s still important to expose them at every turn. ALU has done an excellent job doing this passing out “wanted” leaflets emblazoned with the faces of the union-busters to every worker at the facility. Being honest with workers that the company uses dirty tricks to oppose the union and being willing to polarize around the union-busting agents themselves helps workers see through the anti-union propaganda and builds their confidence to confront these union busters on the shop floor.

“Do your own research first” – A Tried And True Right-Wing Trope

While Amazon is still overtly attacking the union – suggesting the union will cause you to lose benefits and even that the union can fire you – they’re also relying on vague suggestions that the union is shady and encouraging workers to do their own research before voting yes. Of course workers should do their own research but as we all know getting access to the truth online isn’t straightforward. A simple google search of “are unions good” can dredge up all sorts of anti-union articles. If Amazon truly supported workers doing “independent research” they wouldn’t intimidate workers from talking to each other and chase away union-members who show up to answer questions about their experience with the benefits of unions.

Amazon borrowed this “independent research” tactic from the right wing who regularly use it to cast doubt over all sorts of issues where there is really no debate like very real dangers of COVID-19 and the existential threat of climate change. Unions are not always perfect but there is no debate about whether or not unions have hurt the working class as a whole. Unions have been under attack for decades; have conditions improved for working class people? In fact corporate wealth and billionaire profits have increased and in direct proportion with the decline of unions over the last few decades.

“Think about your co-workers” – Manipulative Tactics

Like all union-busting corporations Amazon is hosting regular closed-door meetings where they lie to mislead and intimidate workers into voting against their own self interests. These “captive audience” meetings at the workplace where the union can’t defend itself are inherently unfair but effective. This is why ending captive audience meetings was one of the most important aspects of the PRO Act before it was abandoned by the Democratic Party which is funded by corporate cash and uses the same consulting firms Amazon uses to bust unions.

At JFK8 pro-union workers confronted management’s lies in these meetings showing a concrete example of the power that comes with a union before the union had even been won. Not surprisingly the moment these anti-union meetings took on the character of genuine democratic discussions Amazon stopped inviting pro-union workers to attend them.

These meetings are happening every shift at LDJ5 but Amazon is changing up its approach to them. First Amazon cultivates unfounded fears about the union among workers whose lives are already in a precarious state (because of Amazon). Amazon claims certain benefits will be taken away that workers will lose healthcare or people will be fired by the union! Once workers are understandably scared Amazon encourages these workers to speak at the captive audience meeting which makes it much harder for pro-workers to intervene. We’ve heard reports of workers standing in front of the captive audience meetings crying about how a union would directly harm them and their families.

Amazon is on a constant mission to drive down wages de-skill the work cut benefits and hazard pay and generally keep workers in a precarious situation and in a constant state of desperation and fear. It’s disgustingly cynical that these same bosses are excited to amplify these fears in order to protect their profits by keeping the union out.

“Wait to see the JFK8 contract”

Another union-busting strategy Amazon is using at LDJ5 is misleading workers to vote “no” until they see the results of the contract struggle at JFK8. Of course every logistics worker in the country will be eagerly watching the results of the contract fight but it would be a massive mistake to simply sit on the sidelines and see how things play out.

A strong contract at JFK8 is the best way to set up a strong contract at LDJ5. This is why LDJ5 workers need to vote “yes” and then link up the two struggles and expand the movement to other facilities. We need the maximum unity of workers across all facilities who need to see their fate as tied up with one another. It’s already clear Amazon will pull out all the stops to keep the union out and if they are allowed to focus all its union-busting resources on one facility they will have the advantage.

Other unions need to jump into the fight as quickly as possible but it’s essential that they apply the essential lessons of the JFK8 victory. First and foremost union drives need to be built around crystal clear demands that come from the workers themselves – like a $30/hour starting wage at Amazon. Second the JFK8 campaign involved meticulous and relentless shop-floor organizing. Third ALU made clear from the outset that the fight for a union would put them in direct conflict with Amazon. ALU did not shy away from calling out the extravagant wealth of Jeff Bezos and Amazon.

Unionize Amazon Everywhere

ALU’s breakthrough victory at JFK8 has opened up the possibility to unionize Amazon one of the fastest growing and most profitable corporations on the planet. Amazon employs over a million people and owns enough warehouse space to cover half of Manhattan. Sitting on top of it all is Jeff Bezos the world’s richest billionaire who recently launched himself into space just for fun while millions died during the pandemic.

The only way Amazon can keep out the union is to intimidate manipulate confuse and lie. They prefer paying third party union-busting consultants thousands of dollars a day than paying their workers a $30/hr minimum wage. They would rather maintain a burnout 150% turnover rate than end the grueling Time Off Task system provide reasonable breaks or end mandatory overtime.

The union is nothing more than the organized expression of what Amazon workers want to change about their workplace and it’s only as strong as the workers themselves. ALU has enshrined this into its own constitution mandating that all elected officers including the president only make the average wage of an Amazon worker. The union’s interests are the workers’ interests.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM21lbXBoaXMuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRpbmcvd2F0Y2gtY2hhaXItZmxpZXMtZnJvbS1waWNrdXAtaW50by13aW5kc2hpZWxkLW9mLXZlcm1vbnQtc3RhdGUtdHJvb3Blci9hcnRpY2xlXzYyNWVlNjA5LTRmZmItNTk1YS1iNzhmLTc3NjQwMDJkODJlZi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch: Chair flies from pickup into windshield of Vermont state trooper,"Memphis TN (38111)

The expansion adds 120000 square feet to the prior 135000-square-foot facility near McQueen and Elliot roads. Roughly 850 people now work at the factory and hundreds more will join them over an unspecified timetable.

“We have manufactured and delivered over 100 spacecraft for NASA science programs commercial communications and national-security missions since we opened this facility in 2004” said Cyrus Dhalla vice president and general manager of the company's tactical space systems division. ""This new expansion will help us meet the increasing demand from these customers.”

Satellites for NASA NOAA

Programs currently in production at the Gilbert facility include earth-observation satellites for NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Some of those satellites track agricultural use and forest expanses while others measure glaciers and sea ice said Mike Witt a Northrop Grumman vice president of sustainability noting that the Gilbert-factory expansion announcement was made on Earth Day. He and others didn't discuss water use at the site.

The factory also will be home to integration and testing of the Habitation and Logistics Outpost. HALO is the first module of NASA’s Lunar Gateway that will serve as a space station orbiting the moon providing support for long-term human exploration of the moon and deep space.

The Gilbert campus conducts satellite design engineering manufacturing testing and program management with spacecraft manufacturing done under one roof.

Major government contractor

Virginia-based Northrop Grumman with roughly 90000 overall employees has operations in space aeronautics defense and cyberspace. The corporation earned a profit of $7 billion in 2021 on $35.7 billion in revenue 85% of which was generated by the federal government.

Dhalla called the Gilbert facility one of the most advanced satellite-manufacturing plants in the world. Northrop Grumman also has Arizona facilities in Chandler Tempe and Sierra Vista.

Northrop Grumman is laying off 120 workers in Lake Charles the company confirms.

Northrop Grumman spokesman Jared Krull said the company notified the employees Tuesday that May 5 will be their last day.

The layoffs are a result of the U.S. Air Force’s decision to retire the Joint STARS fleet he said.

”That was a pretty big chunk of the work we did here” Krull said.

Joint STARS aircraft are used by the military in surveillance of moving targets on the ground but the fleet is expected to be retired in the mid 2020’s and will not be replaced according to Military.com. The military is working to move to new surveillance systems.

The fleet will be in service through 2024 Krull said.

When asked what the retirement of the Joint STARS fleet means for the company’s future Krull said that while “It’s never a good thing to lose people because of lost business or work” Northrop Grumman still has a lot of long-term contracts.

Included in those is a new contract to work on the Navy E-6B Mercury program.

Meanwhile Northrop Grumman in Lake Charles currently has 524 employees Krull said.

Some of the affected employees have been placed into new positions or moved if possible he said. The company held an internal job fair where employees were able to interview for open positions at other Northrop Grumman facilities that did not have to make reductions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9pcmlkaXVtLWFuZC1nZW5lcmFsLWR5bmFtaWNzLXN1Ym1pdC1qb2ludC1iaWQtZm9yLXNwYWNlLWRldmVsb3BtZW50LWFnZW5jeS1jb250cmFjdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Iridium and General Dynamics submit joint bid for Space Development Agency contract,"WASHINGTON – Communications satellite operator Iridium and General Dynamics Mission Systems submitted a joint bid to operate and manage the Space Development Agency’s low Earth orbit constellation.

A spokesman for Iridium confirmed the two companies teamed up on a proposal in response to an SDA request earlier this year. The agency in January issued a request for proposals for the “ground operations and integration segment” of a $1.8 billion constellation known as Transport Layer Tranche 1.

Iridium’s CEO Matt Desch during an earnings call April 19 told analysts that the company was pursuing the SDA contract but did not discuss the teaming arrangement.

SDA has ordered 126 satellites from Lockheed Martin Northrop Grumman and York Space Systems. Each company is responsible for providing 42 satellites and operating them but SDA will select a separate contractor to manage the entire enterprise including the ground stations data links and user equipment.

“Iridium and General Dynamics Mission Systems have partnered and submitted an innovative proposal in response to SDA’s RFP for development of their proliferated LEO constellation’s system integration ground systems facilities ground stations and management of day-to-day operations of their network” Iridium said in a statement to SpaceNews.

The company operates a constellation of 75 communications satellites in low Earth orbit and provides satcom services to the U.S. government and commercial customers. General Dynamics Mission Systems develops and integrates satcom antennas and ground systems.

SDA’s technical director Frank Turner described the ground systems integration of Tranche 1 as a complex challenge. “What we need is a team of folks who can take a look at the missions at what we need to operate from a ground perspective and how to build the constellation mission and network management to make it all work together” he said last month at an industry conference.

The Transport Layer a mesh network intended to move data in space via optical links will have two operations centers at government facilities in Grand Forks Air Force Base North Dakota; and Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville Alabama. It will have multiple ground entry points external locations and terrestrial backhaul communications.

“The ability of this contractor to work with and manage inputs and actions from multiple other performers will be critical to successfully field and operate Tranche 1” SDA said. The agency is reviewing bids and expects to select a contractor in the coming months.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvYXN0cm9uYXV0LXNwYWNlLWJhcmJpZS1oaXN0b3J50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch Barbie float with NASA astronauts in space,"In February two Barbie dolls went to outer space for the first time.

Barbie has come a long long way since her days of lamenting that ""Math class is tough.""

She's a calculus savant now that she's added astrophysicist to her career list. And she's just taken one really small step for dollkind. Two Barbies blasted off on a Northrop Grumman Cygnus spaceflight from Wallops Island Virginia on Feb. 19. Now they're residents of the International Space Station marking the first time in Barbie history that the doll has literally traveled to outer space.

That may come as a surprise to rabid collectors who know Barbie has had ""astronaut"" on her résumé since 1965 — four years before Neil Armstrong landed on the moon. Wearing a mod Mercury-inspired silver spacesuit and even sporting a bubble-cut hairdo reminiscent of a helmet ""Miss Astronaut"" beat NASA in the representation-in-space race giving girls an early role model in aviation and aeronautics.

But it took another 57 years for Barbie to do more than merely look the part.

""The idea of sending Barbie to the International Space Station has been one we’ve thrown around for awhile"" Lisa McKnight who heads the Barbie brand for Mattel told Mashable.

The timing of the space voyage coincides with the company's newest astronaut-related Barbie products the Space Discovery line at Target McKnight said.

Crew members took the 11.5-inch dolls out of the cargo ship shortly after it docked at the station over 200 miles above Earth. Under project Dreamstar the astronauts took photos and videos of two Barbies — one Black and one white — at various ISS facilities. The digital media are being used for a Barbie YouTube series to promote science technology engineering and math (STEM) careers.

During a video the Barbies are seen in the microgravity environment free-floating in Russian Sokol-like spacesuits the windowed cupola framing Earth and starry views behind them.

Technically this isn't the first time a Barbie has experienced zero-gravity. Last year a special edition Barbie sculpted to look like European Space Agency astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti rode a zero-G parabolic airplane flight. At first Mattel didn't manufacture the doll for the general public but the toymaker eventually put it into mass production. Partial proceeds from its sales go to a Women in Aerospace Europe fund.

Cristoforetti is expected to return to the space station any day now on a SpaceX Crew Dragon flight.

“I'm very happy that Barbie dolls nowadays reflect not only the body shape of real women but also the full range of their professional achievements"" she said in a statement through ESA last year. ""I hope this will help girls and boys to imagine their future without being constrained by artificial limits that have no place in our time.”

The new Barbie vlog also features NASA astronauts Kayla Barron and Raja Chari who give a tour of the space station's veggie garden -80 degree freezer and robot nicknamed Astrobee.

""Close your eyes take a deep breath and imagine you are in space"" a Barbie voice actor says. ""What would that be like to have your arms and your hair just weightless? To have objects just floating and moving slowly and quietly past you?""

Though space tourists these days have been known to pay upwards of $55 million for a chance to reach low-Earth orbit Barbie's ride was considerably cheaper. Mattel wasn't charged for the flight photo shoot and crew time said Patrick O'Neill a spokesman for the ISS National Laboratory.

Mattel responded to an ISS National Lab Education Research Announcement in 2021 soliciting ideas for space-themed digital programming for K-12 students. The toy company didn't request any grants for the opportunity. Barbie's journey fits with the lab’s mission to — among other things — “inspire the next generation of researchers and explorers” O'Neill said.

""Launch and crew costs are not passed along to research teams and are assumed by the American taxpayer"" he wrote in an email.

Since coming aboard Barbie hasn't conducted any experiments or become a space station mascot meandering through its modules. (We asked.) The dolls are already back in storage and will return to Earth later this summer according to NASA.

When they return they'll go on display at the National Air and Space Museum's Udvar Hazy Center in Virginia where her predecessor Miss Astronaut has lived ever since Mattel donated one to the collection in 1995.

Over five-plus decades Barbie has had a unique relationship with space. Though she's traveled to many places around the world and worn a lot of hats — literally and figuratively — space is a theme the doll keeps revisiting. McKnight credits that to the vision of Ruth Handler Barbie's creator who wanted the doll to reflect culture and womanhood at a time when most other doll options on store shelves related to babies and cooking.

""People were fascinated with space travel as it was a huge part of the cultural conversation throughout the '50s and '60s"" McKnight said. ""Barbie was there to inspire girls that they can be anything as early as the 60s during a time when it was uncommon for girls to pursue a career in STEM.""

""Barbie was there to inspire girls that they can be anything as early as the 60s during a time when it was uncommon for girls to pursue a career in STEM.""

The company rattles off about 10 examples of space-related Barbies sold over the years including Barbie Space Scientist in 1998 and 2017. But a quick eBay and Amazon search shows much more like Barbie Space Camp NASA Crew Barbie and 25th anniversary Astronaut Barbie.

Sometimes the product is designed to deliver realism as with the Katherine Johnson doll a rendering of the famous NASA human computer created shortly after the movie Hidden Figures told her story. The same was true for the likeness of Sally Ride the first U.S. woman in space who died of pancreatic cancer in 2012. The company said it consulted with NASA and Ride's partner Tam O’Shaughnessy to outfit the doll in a Challenger-inspired flight suit.

Other times Barbie's looks have been less than flight-ready. Case in point: a space-themed Barbie from 1985 fashioned with a metallic fuchsia bodysuit and puffed sleeves to rival Princess Di's wedding dress.

""Our designers are often inspired by official gear and clothing then add touches that will resonate with kids such as pops of pink or out-of-this-world boots"" McKnight said. ""The 1986 Barbie Astronaut was rooted more in fantasy.""

Today the Barbie brand is still trying to stay ahead of the competition in the space race. In 2013 the doll beat all nations on a quest to the Red Planet when it made Mars Explorer Barbie. With any luck NASA will get there in the late 2030s.

Of course it's one thing for her to dress for the Martian job she wants. But when can we expect her to go interplanetary?

""Barbie’s career path in space exploration continues to grow out of this world"" McKnight said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9uYXRpb25hbC1zZWN1cml0eS8zMjcyMzMzLXdoeS1pdHMtc21hcnQtdG8tc2xhc2gtdGhlLXVzLWRlZmVuc2UtYnVkZ2V0L9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9uYXRpb25hbC1zZWN1cml0eS8zMjcyMzMzLXdoeS1pdHMtc21hcnQtdG8tc2xhc2gtdGhlLXVzLWRlZmVuc2UtYnVkZ2V0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why it’s smart to slash the US defense budget,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/3272333-why-its-smart-to-slash-the-us-defense-budget/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9uYXRpb25hbC1zZWN1cml0eS8zMjcyMzMzLXdoeS1pdHMtc21hcnQtdG8tc2xhc2gtdGhlLXVzLWRlZmVuc2UtYnVkZ2V0L9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9uYXRpb25hbC1zZWN1cml0eS8zMjcyMzMzLXdoeS1pdHMtc21hcnQtdG8tc2xhc2gtdGhlLXVzLWRlZmVuc2UtYnVkZ2V0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Witnessing how each agent manages their personal and professional duties while retaining a high social profile and dealing with difficult clients is rather fascinating…. Furthermore the show has a decent dose of romance and drama which results in an entertaining hour of television.

Chelsea Lazkani a real estate salesperson who recently joined the Oppenheim group was introduced in Season 5 of “Selling Sunset.” Because Chelsea is a relatively new face on reality television viewers are eager to learn more about her. Because of this we decided to look into Chelsea’s and Jeff Lazkani’s net worth in order to find out what they are currently worth.

How Do They Earn Money?

Chelsea Lazkani grew up in Northwest London and graduated from the University of Buckingham with a degree in Business Economics in 2013. She is currently working as a freelance writer.

She decided to continue her education and enrolled in the University of Dundee in Scotland where she received her bachelor’s degree in International Oil and Gas Management in 2015. Applied LNG hired Chelsea in June 2016 as a Business Strategist after she worked as a Solar Analyst and Assistant to the Director of Operations at NRG Clean Power. Chelsea has over 10 years of experience in the energy industry.

Chelsea on the other hand quickly discovered that her genuine love was in the sector of real estate. Rodeo Realty Inc. in Encino Los Angeles was the first company she worked for as a Real Estate Agent after graduating from high school in July 2017. Chelsea spent nearly three years working at her first real estate office in New York City.

In 2021 she made the decision to join the Oppenheimer family of companies. Chelsea explained her decision to leave her previous agency and enter reality television in an interview with People saying “I viewed this as an opportunity to truly open doors in an industry that has lacked diversity and where minorities are underappreciated.”

Chelsea went on to say that she wanted to give back to the community while also advancing the careers of black women in the premium real estate industry. Chelsea Lazkani tied the knot with Jeff Lazkani in August 2017. With the birth of their children Maddox Ali Lavon and Melia Man the couple has become the proud parents of two amazing children. Furthermore Jeff has achieved considerable success in his work life. Jeff began working at Icon Media Direct in 2005 following the completion of his Bachelor of Business Administration degree from the University of San Diego in the same year.

Despite the fact that Jeff entered the organisation as a Traffic Coordinator he quickly rose through the ranks and is now the Managing Partner of the company. With Jeff in a high-ranking job and Chelsea working in the fields of real estate and reality television the couple has managed to amass quite a comfortable lifestyle for themselves.

Chelsea and Jeff Lazkani’s Net Worth

Jeff’s illustrious career history as well as the position he presently occupies lead us to believe that he has an estimated total net worth of approximately $100000.

Chelsea on the other hand has been creating a name for herself in the Los Angeles real estate scene as a well-liked real estate agent. Given her successful job in the Oppenheim group as well as the additional income from her appearance on ‘Selling Sunset’ it appears that Chelsea has a net worth of approximately $500000 bringing their combined net worth to almost $600000.

While there has been great progress with iGPUs on-package with CPUs the dGPU is still preferred in many applications. Today we are going to take a look at the Lenovo ThinkStation P340 Tiny. The P340 Tiny is designed to be Lenovo’s 1L workstation offering making it a bit more exciting than our average Project TinyMiniMicro mode. This unit has something unique beyond the GPU and it may not be the best thing.

As part of this project we have video versions as well. Here is the video for this unit:

This article will have a bit more since there are some facts and concepts easier to convey using text rather than video. You can also see the full video series using this YouTube playlist. Our suggestion is to open the video in its own YouTube tab window or app and play it in the background to listen along.

Project TinyMiniMicro Background

In Project TinyMiniMicro we are purchasing a large number of these devices from different sources. While a standard STH review is of a new product these TMM nodes occasionally have specs that differ from what one would expect. We have now looked at dozens of these units reviewing the majority of DDR4-equipped 1L PCs from Lenovo HP and Dell. This series is certainly fun.

For around $850 we received a node with an Intel Core i7-10700T CPU an 16GB SODIMM for RAM and a 512GB NVMe SSD. Our unit came with the NVIDIA Quadro P620 which is a lower-end PCIe GPU but massive in the 1L PC space. We even got an embedded Windows 10 Pro license which would have cost us around $140 alone. Ours shipped with the default Lenovo added bloatware but a fresh Windows 10 Pro install fixes this. We also upgraded this unit to Windows 11 Pro.

We also got WiFi 6 in the unit to round out networking. Clearly though the big feature is the GPU. One of the goals with purchasing a Core i7-10700T is that the CPU is two generations newer than the P330 Tiny’s i7-8700T. Even two generations newer of a CPU still means that we have the same NVIDIA Quadro P620 GPU. This is also a small upgrade over the P320 Tiny’s Quadro P600 we reviewed and that was another generation earlier.

Before we get too far in this we should mention that this is both a nice system but it is not currently our recommendation for many of our users asking about GPUs. The Quadro P620 is for using NVIDIA’s validated drivers with software and for extra display outputs. The HP EliteDesk 805 G8 has a NVIDIA GTX 1660Ti 6GB. We have not reviewed that unit yet (but more on it tomorrow.) That unit is going to be a better option for those who ask “can I game?” or “what about AI?”

We are going to go into the hardware overview then into the key specs. We are then going to talk a bit about performance and power consumption before getting to our lessons learned from these units and our final words.

Lenovo ThinkStation P340 Tiny Hardware Overview

The chassis itself is a fairly standard design for the older ThinkCentre Tiny series. It measures 179 x 183 x 37mm (7.0 x 7.2 x 1.5in) which means it is around 1L like the other systems in this series.

The front has a combo headset jack and two USB ports. The Type-A port is a USB 3.2 Gen2 10Gbps port while the USB-C is a Gen1 5Gbps port.

What is also new is the faceplate. This is an updated design from Lenovo in this generation. Here is the P330 Tiny from our prior review.

On the rear of the unit a DisplayPort and a HDMI port standard in Lenovo’s line. In our unit the dual optional slot that we found on other Tiny units is instead replaced by four Mini DisplayPort outputs that are driven by the NVIDIA Quadro P620 (2GB) GPU. Lenovo also has options to replace this panel with either a NVIDIA Quadro P1000 (4GB) or a T1000 6GB GPU.

We also have four USB 3 Type-A ports. Some systems of this era used USB 2 ports so this is a nice upgrade. Two of the ports are USB 3.2 Gen1 ports while the other two are Gen2 ports. Lenovo does a good job of actually labeling its 10Gbps ports. Not all vendors do that. There is also an Intel i219-LM 1GbE port and the WiFi antenna.

Something that we wanted to quickly note is that there is a big difference with this generation in terms of venting that goes beyond the faceplate. The top now has a vent that extends across. In the P320 Tiny we did not get a vent on top so that unit could still be stacked. With the P330 Tiny there was a smaller vent less than half this size.

This is for a machine with essentially the same GPU and a 35W TDP Core i7. The not so subtle secret is that the 35W TDP CPUs can use a lot more power in newer generations and so cooling needs are higher.

Opening the system is done via a single screw. Lenovo’s design unlike HP’s for example does not retain the screw on the chassis. The layout is more similar to the Lenovo ThinkCentre M90q Tiny with perhaps the biggest difference being due to the GPU.

The CPU here is a 10th-generation Intel Core processor. Specifically we have the Intel Core i7-10700T. We looked at the two previous generations also with the Core i7 parts so we wanted to keep things relatively similar.

We have what is more of a standard NVIDIA Quadro P620 2GB card. You can compare what we have here to our NVIDIA Quadro P620 Low Profile Low Power Graphics Card Review. The major difference is that we have a custom rear I/O bracket. Still this is not the more custom heat pipe we saw in other older Lenovo GPU systems.

Underneath the GPU these came with optional 802.11ac WiFi + Bluetooth combo cards from Intel or Realtek or a WiFi 6 (AX201) card from Intel. If you want WiFi we always suggest getting pre-installed in these nodes.

Lenovo’s design we really like. Once the top cover is off one can remove the bottom cover by simply sliding the cover off. Underneath we find the memory and NVMe storage expansion.

Our unit came with a single 16GB DDR4 SODIMM. We always suggest getting a second DIMM for dual-channel memory bandwidth benefits. Lenovo has supported configurations for up to 2x 32GB for 64GB.

For NVMe storage there are dual M.2 drive slots. Also the M.2 retention mechanism is a blue tool-less design we have seen Lenovo use for generations. After servicing a few dozen of these nodes having everything tool-less is a major design win for us. This is a big difference between Lenovo’s high-end Intel units and its AMD units. Lenovo positions AMD systems as lower-end like the Lenovo ThinkCentre M75q Tiny Gen2 so those systems only get a single M.2 slot.

Before closing the section we just wanted to note that this unit supports vPro so long as it is configured to have the feature.

There are a number of configuration options in this system that we do not have. Lenovo specifically makes this unit highly configurable since it is its higher-end Tiny.

Next we are going to look at the performance and power consumption before getting to our final words.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vbnZpZGlhLXVzaW5nLWFpLW1ha2UtZmFzdGVyLWJldHRlci1ncHVzLWhvdy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Nvidia Is Using AI To Make Even Faster And Better GPUs,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vbnZpZGlhLXVzaW5nLWFpLW1ha2UtZmFzdGVyLWJldHRlci1ncHVzLWhvdy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBob3Jvbml4LmNvbS9uZXdzL1VidW50dS0yMi4wNC1OVklESUEtWE9yZy1CYWNr0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Changes Default For NVIDIA Driver Back To Using X.Org Rather Than Wayland,"Show Your Support: This site is primarily supported by advertisements.

While back in March Ubuntu 22.04 ""Jammy Jellyfish"" changed the default behavior for NVIDIA's driver to use Wayland inline with Intel and Radeon graphics having used the GNOME Wayland session rather than X.Org for the past few releases this change was reverted at the last-minute. With a launch-day SRU Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is defaulting to using the GNOME X.Org session rather than Wayland when running the proprietary NVIDIA driver.The past year Ubuntu has defaulted to the Wayland session when using the Intel Radeon and other Mesa drivers for the GNOME desktop. It's been working out there while the default for Ubuntu 21.04/21.10 with NVIDIA's driver has been to stick with the X.Org session. That was planned to change with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS now that the NVIDIA proprietary driver supports GBM and when using the latest releases their Wayland support is generally in great shape. Thus last month when the change was made for the NVIDIA driver to default to Wayland it was a sign of the good times for Wayland...

But this week prior to Ubuntu 22.04 being released NVIDIA requested to Ubuntu/Canonical that they change their default to X.Org on NVIDIA-only systems.So Ubuntu's GNOME Display Manager (GDM) package was updated so that NVIDIA-only systems are back to using the GNOME X.Org session by default. The exception though is for hybrid graphics systems where there is a mix of NVIDIA and Intel/AMD GPUs Wayland will be the default in those cases for having a better experience than X.Org. But at least the GDM log-in screen option will remain for allowing NVIDIA Linux users to opt-in to using the Wayland session if so desired.



A last-minute (launch day!) change so NVIDIA-only systems with the proprietary driver now default back to using the X.Org session rather than Wayland.

That GDM package was just uploaded on Thursday and not part of the Ubuntu 22.04 LTS release image but rather an initial update. So by default NVIDIA on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is back to using the X.Org session but at least there is the easy log-in time option if you do want to enjoy the NVIDIA Wayland experience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9udmlkaWEtYWQxMDItYWRhLWdwdS1mb3ItZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtNDAtc2VyaWVzLW1pZ2h0LW5vdC1mZWF0dXJlLXBjaWUtZ2VuNS1zdXBwb3J00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"NVIDIA AD102 ""Ada"" GPU for GeForce RTX 40 series might not feature PCIe Gen5 support","Please note that this post is tagged as a rumor .

NVIDIA AD102 without PCIe Gen5 support?

Kopite7Kimi a reliable leaker covering NVIDIA hardware confirmed today that the next-generation AD102 GPU does not have PCIe Gen5 interface.

For now it’s just a rumor but if this was true then GeForce RTX 40 series would not be a bottleneck for next-gen desktop systems. The AD102 GPU would simply not support any faster interface. Right now only Intel Alder Lake supports PCI Express 5.0 but around the same time NVIDIA is expected to introduce Ada GPU series AMD is also preparing its Ryzen 7000 “Raphael” platform which more than likely already has Gen5 support.

The “Ada Lovelace” architecture which is set to launch by the end of this year was rumored to feature PCIe Gen5 interface support mainly because it already has the Intel ATX 3.0/PCIe Gen5 spec 16-pin connector unlocking up to 600W of power per cable.

PCIe Gen4 — kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) April 24 2022

The rumor about lack of Gen5 support are especially surprising considering that back in March this year NVIDIA introduced Hopper architecture which was the first GPU architecture to officially support PCIe Gen5. This is how NVIDIA described the new standard for its data-center H100 accelerator:

PCIe Gen 5 provides 128 GB/sec total bandwidth (64 GB/sec in each direction) compared to 64 GB/sec total bandwidth (32GB/sec in each direction) in Gen 4 PCIe. PCIe Gen 5 enables H100 to interface with the highest performing x86 CPUs and SmartNICs or data processing units (DPUs).

Furthermore Kopite mentioned that the structure of the single-precision (FP32) core configuration might not be as simple as Ampere’s. One should not rule out that the CUDA core count will not change again with the new generation of GeForce RTX series. A matrix of different integer and floating-point FP32 units might increase the number of cores compute power or introduce a new core type altogether. It is simply too early to tell.

NVIDIA usually keeps GPU architecture details under a closed lid even until the very last moment. In fact when GA102 GPU launched many board partners had no clue that FP32 core count was to double. We were still finding wrong core count in official data sheets and product descriptions for many days after launch.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 'AD102 GPU' Graphics Cards To Retain PCIe Gen 4.0 Compliancy

NVIDIA will be launching its GeForce RTX 40 series graphics cards based on the brand new Ada Lovelace GPU architecture later this year. The specifications and specific configurations for the graphics card lineup have already been leaked but the design of the card themselves is a more interesting aspect.

PCIe Gen4 — kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) April 24 2022

So far we know that the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 series graphics cards will adopt the new ATX 3.0 compliant 12PVHPWR 16-pin connector which allows for up to 600W of power draw through a new PCIe Gen 5 power connector interface. This power connector has already been featured on the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti graphics card and currently allows for up to 450W of power draw through a triple 8-pin adapter. But there's another aspect to allow the full PCIe Gen 5.0 compliance and that's the interface connector itself.

Currently modern graphics cards communicate to the CPU through the PCIe Gen 4.0 protocol. The PCIe Gen 4.0 protocol allows for 64 GB/s of total and 32 GB/s of bi-directional bandwidth. But the latest platforms from Intel and AMD support the brand new PCIe Gen 5.0 interface protocol. This new standard allows for up to 128 GB/s of total and 64 GB/s of bi-directional bandwidth. This will essentially double the bandwidth but it looks like upcoming graphics cards or at least the high-end GeForce RTX 40 graphics cards based on the AD102 GPU won't feature PCIe Gen 5.0 interface just yet.

Based on a tweet from Kopite7kimi the upcoming GeForce RTX 40 lineup will retain the PCIe Gen 4.0 protocol which is a bold move by NVIDIA for not hopping on the next-gen standard even though they are doing so in the HPC segment where their Hopper GPU will be amongst the first to utilize the new protocol. Now it makes sense that the HPC lineup features it because servers require a lot of bandwidth and the Gen 5.0 protocol will help those environments. As for consumers the PCIe Gen 5.0 interface is just too much bandwidth and current GPUs are yet to fully stature the PCIe Gen 4.0 interface.

Now having PCIe Gen 4.0 bodes well for the entry-level lineup which doesn't need to worry about bottlenecks if they are equipped with lower lanes as was the case with the Radeon RX 6500 and RX 6400 series which when switching over to Gen 3 standard end up with less than required graphics bandwidth leading to poor performance versus as PCIe Gen 4.0 compliant standard. If the high-end lineup isn't starving the Gen 4.0 standard then the low-end lineup is far from hitting the max threshold. So far we can't say for sure if NVIDIA will truly retain PCIe Gen 4.0 on its upcoming RTX 40 series cards but that could change as marketing does like having the PCIe Gen 5.0 logo for the new cards.

Aside from the PCIe Gen 5.0 and PCIe Gen 4.0 support NVIDIA is also seemingly going to make major changes to the way its CUDA cores are arranged within the Ada Lovelace architecture. The GPUs for the GeForce RTX 40 series will not just be a simple CUDA core bump from Ampere but could include a range of new mixed-precision cores that aren't detailed yet. The lineup is still a few months away from introduction so a lot could change but we will make sure to keep you updated.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is on track to invest more than $33 billion in the space of 18 months.

This year the famed investor's company has plowed about $7 billion into Occidental Petroleum stock in 11 days and snapped up $4 billion of HP shares. Buffett also struck a deal to acquire Alleghany for $11.6 billion in under two weeks.

James Shanahan a senior equity analyst at Edward Jones expects a couple more deals to materialize over the next year. Berkshire is likely to spend about $4 billion to raise its ownership of Pilot Flying J to 80% in early 2023 he told Insider.

Moreover Buffett's company may soon buy the 8% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy owned by the family of Walter Scott Jr. a Berkshire director until his death last September. That would raise its ownership to over 99% Shanahan said.

If Berkshire shells out $33 billion that would exceed the $30 billion it piled into stocks in 2020 and dwarf the $8 billion it invested in equities last year (ignoring stock sales in both years).

It would also surpass the $25 billion it spent on share buybacks in 2020 and the $27 billion it plowed into repurchases last year.

Regardless Berkshire might still struggle to put a dent in its cash pile. The company generates about $33 billion of free cash flow every five quarters Shanahan told Insider.

""There is a good chance that Berkshire is still holding $150 billion in cash by mid-2023 unless there are additional investments"" he said.

Berkshire shares have climbed 14% this year bucking the S&P 500's 8% decline over the same period. Shanahan downgraded the stock to a ""hold"" rating this week asserting its current price already reflects the likelihood it outperforms its financial-services peers this year its recent strong earnings and its flurry of purchases.

The conglomerate owns scores of businesses including Geico See's Candies and the Burlington Northern Railway. It also holds multibillion-dollar stakes in Apple Coca-Cola Kraft Heinz and other public companies.

Buffett whose nickname is the ""Sage of Omaha"" is expected to field questions for several hours at Berkshire's yearly shareholder gathering in his hometown next week. The centibillionaire investor recently touted the event as a ""very very important meeting.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

NORFOLK Va. – So much went right for the Old Dominion baseball team Sunday. The Monarchs played sparkling defense and pounded four home runs with Matt Coutney hitting two to become ODU's all-time single-season leader.



But Monarch pitchers also walked 12 batters and Florida Atlantic took advantage to avoid a weekend sweep by holding off the Monarchs 5-4 at Bud Metheny Ballpark.



ODU (28-10 10-8 C-USA) won games Friday and Saturday to claim its second series in a row.



Coutney is surely the hottest hitter in the country. In the last 14 games he has hit 14 home runs driven in 28 runs scored 25 more all while hitting .528.



The Monarchs' next game is a huge one. ODU hosts Virginia Tuesday night at Harbor Park in the annual Commonwealth Classic. The Cavaliers are ranked eighth nationally by Baseball America.



ODU upset U.Va. two weeks ago in Charlottesville 9-2 to get a measure of revenge against the team that knocked the Monarchs out of an NCAA Regional final last season. The Cavaliers undoubtedly will be looking for some payback on Tuesday.



In spite of the loss it was a memorable game for the Monarchs. Coutney tied the record for home runs set by Ron Walker in 1997 with his 20th homer in the first inning. He then broke the record with another solo shot in the eighth.



Breaking the record was extra special for Coutney because his father Frank Coutney was in the stands. Frank is the retired administrator for Wetaskiwin County about 30 minutes south of Edmonton Alberta in western Canada.



""It's always special when you break a record"" Coutney said. ""But it's so nice that my dad happened to be here. He hasn't been here very often.""



Coach Chris Finwood felt like this was a game the Monarchs let get away but was happy for his star first baseman.



Left fielder Andy Garriola has already broken the career record for home runs and has 18 this season.



""It's been fun watching both of them"" Finwood said. ""But Matt's really been on a hot streak.



""He's such a good kid. It was really neat for his dad to be able to be here for him to break that record with him here. They're a great family and a wonderful young man.""



Click here to read a feature story on Matt Coutney



FAU got just one home run a three-run shot from Dylan Goldstein in the top of the fifth but it was enough to give the Owls the lead for good. Both baserunners who scored reached base on a walk.



""You're not going to win when you walk 12 guys"" Finwood said. ""That's been our issue. We're 28-10 and I'll bet that seven of our 10 losses are because we just walked too many guys.



""It's not acceptable at this level. We're just got to be better.""



FAU got two runs in the first off of Sam Armstrong who got off to a shaky start but then settled down. He walked three runners and gave up two hits and two runs but with the bases loaded forced Shane Magrann to hit into a double play.



ODU knotted the score 2-2 minutes later as Robbie Petracci and Coutney both homered.



FAU loaded the bases in the third with two outs but again Armstrong pitched his way out of trouble. He struck out second baseman Steven Loden then forced Magrann to ground out to ODU second baseman Kyle Edwards.



Carter Trice ODU's third long ball threat led off the top of the third with a solo shot that cleared left field with 20 or so yards to spare. A sophomore from Richmond Trice has 15 home runs.



ODU stayed in the game thanks only because of some outstanding plays in the field.



Thomas Wheeler made a one-handed grab against the 395-foot sign in center field in the fourth. In the seventh Edwards made a diving stop on a hard-hit ball and the Monarchs turned a double play with the bases loaded that saved a run.



Edwards a 5-foot-10 freshman from Cox High School in Virginia Beach got off to a slow start this season but since adjusting to the game has been a defensive stalwart for ODU.



""I'm so proud of Kyle"" Finwood said. ""He's been saving runs for us on defense almost every day.""



The bases were loaded again in the top of the eighth with no outs and again outstanding defense kept the game close.



Third baseman Kenny Levari scooped up a bouncing ground ball and made a difficult off-balance throw that got Loden out at home. Pitcher Brad Dobzanski then gloved a one-hopper and threw Magrann out at home for the second out.



Gabriel Rincones then flied out to center field to end the inning.



FAU then loaded the bases again with one out in the top of the ninth but Magrann flied out to ODU shortstop Tommy Bell who fired the ball to third to cut down Nolan Schanuel as he returned to the bag.



However ODU mustered little offense against closer Robert Wegielnik who mixed breaking balls with his 94 mile per hour fastball to strike out five Monarchs and limit ODU to two hits including Coutney's home run.



ODU hosts LA Tech next weekend and then ventures to Southern Miss the following weekend in two critical C-USA series. LA Tech is ranked 42nd and Southern Miss 10th in the RPI and beating both teams would surely move ODU up the ladder from 75th.



""I told our guys you've got to win every series if we even want to be in the mix for an at-large possibility"" he said. ""If not we've got to find a way to get in the Conference USA Tournament and then win it.""

On Saturday April 23 Kenny Chesney made his long-awaited return to the stage with the official launch of his Here And Now Tour 2022 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Florida.

The show which was completely sold out marked Chesney’s first full show since May of 2019 and to say fans were excited to see him back on stage would be an understatement. The capacity crowd many of which have held onto their tickets for over 930+ days roared at the sight of Chesney who entered the stage at 9 PM singing “Beer In Mexico” and didn’t stop for just over two hours.

Ahead of the show the East Tennessee native teased a 26-song set list with a few surprises and he more than delivered. The eight-time Entertainer of the Year invited fans to “Live Those Songs” again with a career-spanning performance that included “Summertime” “We Do” “No Shoes No Shirt No Problems” “Get Along” “Knowing You” among many others.

The show also featured support from Dan + Shay Old Dominion and Carly Pearce.

With 40 dates left on the books Chesney’s Here And Now Tour is sure to be the hottest ticket of the summer.

And while there’s plenty you can pay for the privilege (and worth every dollar) many are fortunately free.

We’ve scoped out 11 of the best free things to see and do in the Old Dominion from the Northern Virginia suburbs to the Appalachian Mountains to the sun-drenched Eastern Shore and beyond. Wild horses giant airplanes a buzzy beach boardwalk and threatened piping plovers are all part of the fun.

See wild horses on Assateague Island

Wild horses roam the wind-swept 37-mile-long barrier isle of Assateague the southern portion of which belongs to Virginia (northern is Maryland). Some say they’re descendants of horses that swam ashore after their 17th-century Spanish galleons sank offshore — though more likely they come from horses that 17th-century colonists released on the island to escape a mainland fence tax. Either way these short stout horses sometimes called ponies for their small stature munch salt marsh plants along the beaches and wander through the coastal woods marshes and dunes. Every July for the past 90-plus years “saltwater cowboys” round up the foals to swim across the channel to neighboring Chincoteague always a fun event to watch.

But there’s much more to see and do on Assateague including miles of untrammeled hiking and biking trails crabbing fishing swimming shell hunting watching migratory birds (including the glorious snow geese and threatened piping plover) and simply lying on the sandy beach. Note that there’s a fee to drive into Assateague National Wildlife Refuge but walkers and bikers enter for free. Campsites cost $30 a night.

Embrace nature at the Great Dismal Swamp

Stories of Blackbeard and other marauding pirates swirl in the primeval mists of the Great Dismal Swamp. This nearly 113000-acre refuge on the Virginia–North Carolina border near Norfolk is centered on a remarkably shallow cypress-fringed lake — at 3100 acres it’s only 6ft deep.

Enslaved people hid out here en route to freedom earning it the designation as an Underground Railroad Network to Freedom site. George Washington visited too scheming up plans to drain it for agriculture — he failed though he helped build a 22-mile canal linking the Chesapeake with Albemarle Sound dug mostly by enslaved laborers. Opened in 1805 the Dismal Swamp Canal remains the nation’s oldest continually operated artificial canal.

But the best reason to come to this gigantic swamp forest today is because it’s a nature lover’s paradise with hiking and biking trails an accessible boardwalk and kayaking fishing and camping. Bobcats black bear otters and more than 220 varieties of birds thrive.

And while there also are snakes mosquitoes — and yes alligators — that might be considered ""dismal"" its name is a tad overkill. Indeed the “great” comes from the swamp’s once vast size (over 1 million acres at one point in time) and the “dismal” likely refers to the early English settlers’ word meaning “swamp” or “morass.”

Be wowed by giant aircraft at the Steven F Udvar-Hazy Center

What do you do when your aircraft and spacecraft are too large to fit in the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum? Put them in the annex in Chantilly near Washington Dulles International Airport of course. At the massive Steven F Udvar-Hazy Center comprising two hangars airplanes and spacecraft hang on the ceiling rise from the floor and scatter about right and left. You can check out the Space Shuttle Discovery considered the workhorse of the shuttle fleet; the B-29 Enola Gay which dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima at the end of World War II; the Mobile Quarantine Facility a converted Airstream trailer that temporarily housed Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins after their successful mission to the Moon; and much much more. There’s also an IMAX theater (for a price) and an observation tower with 360-degree views to watch planes land and take off from Dulles. Note that while the museum is free there is a charge for parking (it’s free after 4pm).

Bike the Virginia Creeper Trail

Bopping down Whitetop Mountain in southwestern Virginia in the heart of Jefferson National Forest the 34.3-mile Virginia Creeper Trail opens up some of the state’s most breathtaking landscapes. You’ll zip through forests meadows and highlands across 47 bridges and trestles spanning gurgling mountain brooks. A former rail-trail named after the steam engine that crept up the mountainside into the Iron Mountains it’s perfect for easy biking and hiking (it’s mostly downhill) with plenty of fishing and birdwatching along the way.

The cute town of Damascus is a good place to stop for lunch while Abingdon a few miles off the trail’s end has B&Bs (and the elegant Martha Washington Inn) restaurants and a visitor center. Abingdon is also home to the Barter Theatre a professional theater showcasing more than 25 productions a year. While not free the theater is named after the Depression-era practice of bartering for admission (they called it trading ham for Hamlet).

Shuttle services can take you and your bike to the top of Whitetop for a price; bike rentals are available too.

Other fabulous (and free) biking trails in Virginia include the 45-mile Washington and Old Dominion (W&OD) Trail following an old railroad line from Arlington’s suburban-scape to Loudoun County’s rolling countryside; the 18-mile Mount Vernon Trail from Arlington to Mount Vernon meandering along the Potomac; and the James River Heritage Trail along the James River in Richmond.

There's no fee to walk the historic streets of Colonial Williamsburg © Bill Chizek / Getty Images

Relive prerevolutionary history at Colonial Williamsburg

Much of the nation’s most important prerevolutionary history unfolded in Williamsburg when it served as the capital of the Colony and Commonwealth of Virginia between 1699 and 1780. The historic area has been meticulously re-created with brick buildings costumed reenactors and special events bringing the stories to life. You have to buy a ticket to enjoy some activities including participating in tours and entering many of the historic buildings — but there’s no fee just to stroll the streets and take in the bygone ambiance peeking into shops and asking interpreters questions.

And not all the sights charge admission. Bruton Parish Church in the heart of town for example provides a free spot for quiet reflection as it has for 300 years. Williamsburg Botanical Garden bursts into bloom through the seasons — a perfect place to picnic. There’s also a robust schedule of free arts fairs and music festivals. In summer free concerts play throughout Colonial Williamsburg including the Summer Breeze Concert Series near Merchants Square.

Pay your respects at Arlington National Cemetery

Somber and serene Arlington National Cemetery honors more than 400000 soldiers who have served in every American war from the Revolution to present-day conflicts as well as many prominent Americans — including Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg General John Pershing and heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis.

A shuttle tour stops at various sites or you can walk (warning: it’s hilly!). Don’t miss the changing of the guard at the Tomb of the Unknowns and the eternal flame at JFK’s gravesite (where he’s buried alongside his wife Jacqueline his brothers Robert and Edward and two children). All presidents are eligible to be buried at Arlington but to date only two are here: JFK and William Howard Taft.

Rising on a knoll is Arlington House the mansion Robert E. Lee left when he joined the Confederacy (the Union used the grounds as a burial site to ensure the Lees would never return). It’s been meticulously reinterpreted to detail the stories of enslaved individuals who helped build the residence and who worked here.

A trail wanders north to the imposing Iwo Jima Memorial (more formally called the US Marine Corps War Memorial) passing by a priceless view of DC with the Lincoln Memorial Washington Monument and US Capitol neatly lined up (a popular place among locals — and professional photographers — for 4th of July fireworks-watching).

Take a slow drive on the Blue Ridge Parkway

At a max speed of 45mph the sinewy two-lane Blue Ridge Parkway forces you to slow down to the pace of another time. Not that you need any enticement. Wandering atop the misty southern Appalachians the scenic byway opens up stunning mountain-and-valley views splashy waterfalls and wildlife-filled forests with hiking camping and picnicking along the way.

Built in the 1930s for scenic driving the parkway actually runs for 465 miles between Shenandoah National Park at Rocky Gap Virginia in the north and Great Smoky Mountains National Park at Cherokee North Carolina in the south — the Virginia portion is about 200 miles. Must-stops include historic Mabry Mill at milepost 176 perhaps the planet’s most scenic lakeside mill; the neon-lit Roanoke Star atop Mill Mountain in Roanoke just off milepost 120 (a really fun hike); and the Peaks of Otter overlooking a mirrorlike lake at milepost 85.6.

Another don’t-miss scenic drive is the 25-mile George Washington Memorial Parkway between McLean and Mount Vernon offering magnificent views of DC’s national monuments looming above the shimmery Potomac along with a year-round parade of blooming flowers and trees.

Revisit the Civil War at Richmond National Battlefield Park

Virginia emerged as a crossroads of North–South conflict during the Civil War with Richmond the capital of the Confederacy. Richmond National Battlefield Park incorporates 13 separate sites in the Richmond area where determined warfare took place in the 1860s in the Union’s attempt to capture the capital city. Wrap your head around it all at Tredegar Iron Works the park’s main visitor center and museum in downtown Richmond. There are more than 500 artifacts in two galleries and you can pick up maps and other materials to discover nearby battlefields along an 80-mile driving route including Cold Harbor and Gaines’ Mill.

The ironworks itself date from 1837 going on to make Richmond a hub of iron manufacturing. The factory provided artillery and ammunition that supported the South and after the Civil War helped rebuild the ruined South. It made munitions for both World Wars before closing down in the mid-20th century.

Note that the visitor center is free but it costs $3 to park in the center’s parking lot. It’s free next door at the Belle Island lot.

Virginia contains several other major Civil War battlefields which are free to enter including Petersburg; Fredericksburg & Spotsylvania; and Manassas. The Civil War ended at Appomattox Court House.

Hike sections of the Appalachian Trail

One of the nation’s most fabled hiking trails the 2200-mile Appalachian Trail (aka the AT) skitters atop the Appalachians between Georgia and Maine. It passes 544 miles through Virginia more miles than any other state. A hundred miles wind through Shenandoah National Park including hikes to Compton Creek and Fort Windham Rocks — though if you don’t want to walk from the park entrance you must pay to drive into the park. Fortunately free options are just as spectacular especially in Mount Rogers National Recreation Area and the Washington and Jefferson National Forests filled with shadowy forests surging waterfalls deep gorges and billowy rhododendron in late spring.

You can’t go wrong with the 5.6-mile Angels Rest Overlook hike near the town of Pearisburg offering stunning views over the New River Valley; the 3.6-mile trek in the Priest Wilderness sprinkled with bucolic springs and streams; and the 4-mile Wilburn Ridge hike in Grayson Highlands featuring misty peaks and wild horses.

Wander Old Town Alexandria

Roaming Old Town’s cobbled streets edged with historic row houses shaded by gnarled oak trees you wouldn’t be surprised to come across onetime frequenter George Washington himself. He lived just down the road at Mount Vernon after all and spent much time in town. Founded in 1749 by Scottish merchants Alexandria thrived as a busy seaport for centuries explaining the wealth of beautiful buildings here. To this day more than 200 structures survive from Washington’s time — kept up thanks to a serious historic preservation program.

You can visit Christ Church for free and sit in the same pew where Washington once worshiped. You have to pay to visit both Carlyle House an 18th-century Georgian manor and Gadsby’s Tavern Museum where five early US presidents dined though it’s interesting just to stand outside and take it all in. Outside the tavern peer down into the ice well which once provided the tavern with a ready supply of ice to make day’s latest dessert craze: ice cream.

King Street is the main road bisecting Old Town filled with trendy restaurants and boutiques. The King Street Trolley which runs up and down the street from the Metro is free. Whatever you do be sure to find yourself at the foot of King Street along the Potomac River. Behind the Torpedo Factory — an actual former factory that produced torpedoes today housing 82 artist studios — musicians and jugglers often entertain along the Potomac waterfront. Paths edge the river offering more scenic places to stroll.

About a mile south of here you can visit the Contrabands and Freedom Cemetery honoring 1800 people of African descent who were buried here during and following the Civil War. Nearby you’ll find the South Boundary Stone the nation’s first federal monument laid in 1791 by Benjamin Banneker as he helped set the boundaries for the new national capital of Washington DC. It’s beneath the sea wall near Jones Point Lighthouse — a gorgeous place on the river.

Virginia is graced with several other historic towns with the same prerevolutionary flavor including Fredericksburg; Yorktown; Staunton; and Winchester.

Sun-worship and hit the trails at Virginia Beach

The beach is always a good idea and Virginia Beach — the only city with a coastline on both the Atlantic and Chesapeake Bay — is the perfect beachy antidote with a multiple of free white-sand beaches each with its own pizzazz. For starters you have secluded sand-dune-backed Sandbridge Beach; family-friendly Chesapeake Bay Beach; and Croatan Beach a favorite of local surfers. Pack a picnic and a beach ball and make it a day.

But there are more free things to do here than just play in the sand. You can stroll the buzzy Virginia Beach Boardwalk with its free amusement park and free summer concerts at the 31st Street Stage. First Landing State Park named for the English settlers who landed here in 1607 before settling Jamestown has crabbing biking and picnicking along one of the state’s most gorgeous shorelines.

You can also hike along several trails including one through a bald cypress swamp and another through high dunes. And yes there’s a fabulous beach here too. Trails at Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge open up freshwater marshes and woodlands flitting with migrating birds. From here you can walk into secluded False Cape State Park perched on a narrow spit between Back Bay and the Atlantic Ocean that’s considered one of the East Coast’s last unspoiled places. Several hiking trails take in supreme coastal overlooks. Note that First Landing and Back Bay both charge a small parking fee but False Cape is free (no cars allowed; you have to walk or bike in via Back Bay).

All this said Virginia Beach isn’t the only beach game in town. With miles of shoreline along the Atlantic Ocean the Chesapeake and the Potomac other sunshiny escapes in Virginia include Colonial Beach along the Northern Neck; the Cape Charles beachfront on the Eastern Shore; and Norfolk’s Ocean View beaches.

Only if you have a lot of sugar. Seeing that our current lemon-heavy world situation is lacking the necessary amounts of sweetener to make a tasty beverage Audi has done the next best thing and made lemon flavored water rebranding it a ""Semiconductor Shortage Package."" The Drive picked up on forum posts in places like Audi World and Reddit about this strange item on some Monroneys at Audi dealerships. Someone at Audi got the idea that instead of simply including a line of text about certain features being unavailable on certain vehicles because of chip constraints the luxury automaker should bundle the missing features into the aforementioned package and then subtract the cost from the MSRP.

Example deductions are $350 off the price of a Q5 for lacking Audi side assist and rear traffic warning $1200 off MSRP off another Q5 for missing that previous feature as well as adaptive cruise control with traffic jam assist Audi active lane assist and Audi phone box and $1350 off an Audi A4 Allroad for the same four omissions.

Look it's a novel approach and we get it. It saves everyone the time and hassle of trying to figure out which vehicle will be missing which options; some other automakers have made that difficult to figure out. Furthermore no one needs to buy an Audi with the Semiconductor Shortage Package — these are part of dealer inventory sitting on showroom floors. In the Allroad example for instance the poster ordered an Allroad in January and was told it could take six months for delivery because of the lack of chips. The buyer saw a similar Allroad to the we they ordered on a dealer web site and was asking anyone if those features could be added later. So Audi isn't conning anyone into these cars the company is trying to keep cars flowing to dealers and perhaps trying to keep the messaging of any shortcomings on-brand. It's the kind of looking-glass howler we've seen before in plenty of other ways and in times of plenty. As a Reddit poster commented ""Oh god the idea of calling the absence of a feature a 'package' is hilarious. I can't believe Porsche wasn't already doing that.""

As for retroactive installation the answer to that is nein. The vehicle built without these features lives its life without these features. Happy shopping.

After graduating from Buet in 1977 Mohammed Enayetur Rahman went to Oregon State University in the United States of America to study Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

He then joined AMD the famous American multinational semiconductor company as a semiconductor chip designer. After leaving AMD Enayetur returned to Bangladesh and started Ulkasemi a semiconductor designing company in Dhaka with only four engineers in 2008.

At the time the market for semiconductors was around $248.5 billion according to Statista.

Enayetur could easily be described as the first mover: the pioneer in a market that has since grown to a staggering $600 billion in the decade-and-a-half since Enayetur started.

The engineer could also be described as highly intuitive. The semiconductor industry is now considered the most promising industry of the 21st century.

A semiconductor also known as microchip is used in all electronic devices from computers smartphones washing machines electric tea kettle to automobiles and warplane missile systems and has become part of modern life at all levels.

In the future with the rise of technological innovation it would be needed to manufacture almost all devices for human use.

While the market has so far been catered to by newcomers – Ulkasemi Neural Semiconductor Prime Silicon and Toton Electronics – in Bangladesh two new big players in ACI and Walton are also set to enter the market which is expected to hit the mammoth trillion-dollar mark by 2030.

According to McKinsey a global consultancy firm the global semiconductor market reached $600 billion in 2021 with growth of more than 20%.

Despite the bounties the industry has to offer the budget for the fiscal 2021-22 made no mention of the semiconductor industry nor were any policy support announced.

Enayetur Rahman said ""In the beginning it was very hard to make people understand that Bangladesh could produce chips. But now the industry is growing and it needs special attention.""

Enayetur whose company now employs 300 engineers and wants to hire 500 by 2024 urged the government to provide special incentives to the sector like the neighbouring India does.

Dr Farseem Mannan Mohammedy professor of electrical and electronic engineering at Bangladesh University of Engineering Technology (Buet) told The Business Standard ""Bangladesh earns about $5 million annually through designing semiconductor chips. But neighbouring India is earning $60 billion from this sector.""

India's envious standing is not by chance. Apart from the country's investment into setting up IT-based universities the Indian government also announced a $1000 crore fund to strengthen the semiconductor industry in December last year.

The industry has the potential to leave the current highest foreign currency earner garments industry in the dust.

""In Bangladesh less than one lakh people in the semiconductor sector would be able to earn more than what 40 lakh people do in the RMG sector"" Dr Farseem said.

""Intel employs 500 people from Bangladesh. This is brain drain. If we could establish an industry here then those people could return. But this technology-based industry can never be fully developed without the special attention of the government. Because this industry needs a lot of investment"" he added.

According to government officials initiatives are being undertaken.

Bikarna Kumar Ghosh managing director of the Bangladesh Hi-Tech Park Authority said ""The government has set up 10-12 IT villages silicon city electronic city IT incubators and ICT parks in the country including the Bangabandhu High-Tech Park and the Jashore Software Technology Park. These parks are providing plots on easy terms with tax holiday facilities to the investors.

""Recently Ulkasemi has taken land in Bangabandhu Hi-Tech Park. We are ready to help them.""

The rise of the 'conductors'

Didar Islam who worked in the Silicon Valley USA in the 1980s for more than a decade was the first person to invest in the semiconductor sector in Bangladesh some 15 years back with his company Power IC. Their initial plan was to build a fabrication facility.

However Didar's project faced various obstacles and he later started another company Solaric which is now working on solar power in the country.

Enayetur on the other hand enjoyed much more success with his Ulkasemi.

It started with its headquarter based in Silicon Valley USA. The company has been working on circuit design and layout since 2008. It has been involved in chip design and verification work since 2012.

Since its inception it has opened two more offices in Toronto Canada and in Bangalore India to meet increasing work orders.

In 2021 Ulkasemi became the design centre alliance partner of TMSC one of the leading semiconductor companies in the world. Only 20 companies in the world are affiliated with the design centre alliance of TMSC.

Ulkasemi has also announced a $25 million investment for semiconductor design service in Bangabandhu Hi-Tech Park.

Meanwhile Neural Semiconductor Limited is a sister concern of DBL Group which is one of the leading RMG companies in the country.

Neural Semiconductor began its journey in 2017. It initially hired 20 engineers but now has more than 100.

Officials of the company said that the number would be doubled within this year.

Shakhawat Hossain chief operating officer of Neural Semiconductor said ""We are currently working on the analogue design digital design digital verification physical and testing design. The company has been working for various companies in the United States Japan and Malaysia.

""In the initial stage it was a big challenge to attract engineers to this sector. But now the situation has changed. However there is still a shortage of high-value commercial software electronic design automation tools and experts.""

Mohammed Jabbar managing director of DBL Group said ""The government needs to take special initiatives to develop the semiconductor sector. Our universities need state-of-the-art laboratories along with a modern curriculum.""

Walton and ACI are coming

The country's electronics giant Walton started manufacturing computers and laptops in 2018. The company is also producing gaming computers. It started its journey producing mobile phones and home appliances.

Now the company is going to invest in the semiconductor sector soon. It has already secured a location in the Bangabandhu Hi-Tech Park an official of Walton said.

However as the company is listed on the stock exchange its officials did not want to give any official statement in this regard before a formal announcement.

Like Walton there is also information that ACI one of the leading industrial groups in the country is going to invest in the semiconductor sector too. The investment will be under ACI Electronics a subsidiary of ACI Group.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtlZGdsb2JhbC5jb20vc2Ftc3VuZy1ncm91cC9uZXdzVmlldy9rZWQyMDIyMDQyNDAwMDLSATFodHRwczovL2FtcC5rZWRnbG9iYWwuY29tL25ld3NBbXAva2VkMjAyMjA0MjQwMDAy?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jay Y. Lee absence raises risks for Samsung chip biz,"Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee arrives for trial at a Seoul court on March 31 2022

Samsung Electronics Co. is losing its hegemony in the global semiconductor market as a sustained leadership vacuum has kept the world’s top memory chipmaker from deciding on key future investment plans. Its Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee the key decision-maker of the South Korean tech giant’s long-term strategy has been on parole since August 2021 after serving 18 months of his 30-month prison term for a bribery and embezzlement conviction. But Lee’s parole instead of a pardon means he will be unable to return to Samsung management until the second half of 2027 given the country’s law governing special economic crimes.Some domestic business lobby groups reportedly plan to ask President-elect Yoon Seok-yeol to pardon Lee the de facto leader of the nation’s top conglomerate Samsung Group for the sake of the local semiconductor industry.“Large-scale issues such as chip investments and M&As need to be decided on by someone who is in charge of corporate management” said Lee Chang-han vice chairman of the Korea Semiconductor Industry Association. “Samsung’s decision-making power has weakened due to the absence of Vice Chairman Lee the top decision-maker.”Samsung’s lack of long-term strategy is expected to pose a risk to the entire South Korean semiconductor sector amid intensifying competition in the global market industry sources said.The concerns dampened Samsung’s share price. The stock of the country’s largest company by market capitalization lost ground falling to as low as 66100 won ($53.2) earlier this month the weakest since November 2020 despite record sales in the first quarter. Samsung’s semiconductor investment is also lagging its competitors' spending. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) the world’s top foundry maker announced it planned to spend $44 billion on capital expenditures this year alone. Intel Corp. decided to pour $20 billion each into factories in Arizona and Ohio as well as earmarking 80 billion euros ($86.6 billion) for investment into Europe to boost chip capacity there over the next decade.Meanwhile Samsung aims to invest $17.1 billion in the chip business by 2030.“Investors are concerned over Samsung’s uncertain future due to the lack of leadership” said an analyst at a brokerage house in Seoul.Samsung is feared to follow the decline of Japan’s semiconductor sector as the South Korean electronics behemoth has yet to unveil long-term visions and strategies domestic industry sources said.Until the 1970s the global semiconductor industry was dominated by the US with Intel’s invention of DRAM in 1971. Japanese players took the throne in the 1980s with high-performance DRAMs required by mainframe computers for corporate servers.Samsung aimed at the market of small and cheap products in the 1990s when personal computer makers became the main customers for DRAMs with the growing use of PCs. To cut costs Samsung reportedly took a bold move of using European equipment that had been less competitive than Japanese machines. Such strategies allowed Samsung to beat its Japanese rivals.Takashi Yunogami a former semiconductor engineer at Hitachi Ltd. said Japanese chipmakers collapsed and surrendered market dominance to South Korean makers as they were excessively concerned with top technology and quality failing to cope with the rapid changes in global trends.Morris Chang the founder of TSMC paid close attention to the late Samsung Group Chairman Lee Kun-hee with his success of Samsung Electronics’ semiconductor business.Samsung had Lee Kun-hee the current vice chairman’s father but Japanese rivals such as Hitachi Toshiba Corp. and NEC Corp. did not have such a leader Chang a legendary figure in the global semiconductor industry said in an interview with Taiwan’s Wealth Magazine in February.But the current sustained leadership vacuum has ramped up risks for Samsung when competitors are boosting their muscle in the global market.Samsung is far behind TSMC in the foundry market where product prices have jumped on the world’s semiconductor shortage. TSMC dominated the global foundry market with a 52.1% market share in the fourth quarter of last year while Samsung accounted for just 18.3% about a third of TSMC’s share according to market tracker TrendForce. The Taiwan company is reportedly able to produce 3-nanometer chips ahead of Samsung.In the US chipmaker Micron Technology Inc. last year started commercial production of 176-layer NAND for the first time in the world.Samsung has unveiled few major investment plans except for the one to build a $17 billion chipmaking plant in Taylor Texas announced in November of last year. The company’s CEO reportedly has authority for spending of about 1 trillion won while presidents are known to be able to approve investments of only 300 billion-400 billion won. That means Vice Chairman Lee is the only person in the company able to make decisions about chip plant investments in the billions of dollars.“It is hard for a professional manager to make decisions on a large-scale investment as they cannot help focusing on short-term performance” said a local semiconductor industry source.Lee’s parole term ends on July 29 2022 but he will still be restricted from employment given the law governing special economic crimes.“Without a pardon there will be no way to avoid the employment restriction” said another industry source.Lee is also facing difficulties in seeking acquisitions of other companies a shortcut to securing future growth engines under parole. Few global companies are willing to sign a deal with a leader if there are legal risks.Governments around the world became stricter on mergers and acquisitions in the semiconductor industry amid the cut-throat hegemony competition. Germany disapproved of Taiwanese GlobalWafer Co.’s planned $5 billion takeover of German chip supplier Siltronic AG. US-based Nvidia Corp.’s attempt to acquire British chip designer Arm Ltd failed due to the opposition of countries such as the UK and China.Samsung may disappear into history or lose major status globally without securing future growth engines in the near term company officials feared. In 2011 global management consulting firm McKinsey said the average life expectancy of companies listed on the Standard and Poor’s 500 had shortened to 18 years in 2011 from 90 years in 1935 expecting 75% of the 500 companies on that list to disappear by 2027.Shin-Young Park at nyusos@hankyung.com Jongwoo Cheon edited this article.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhaXBlaXRpbWVzLmNvbS9OZXdzL2Jpei9hcmNoaXZlcy8yMDIyLzA0LzIzLzIwMDM3NzcwNTPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Realtek posts record high quarterly profit,"Realtek posts record high quarterly profit

RESILIENT DEMAND: Soaring orders for Ethernet chips and additional foundry partners have offset logistical issues and slowing sales of consumer electronics

By Lisa Wang / Staff reporter





Networking chip supplier Realtek Semiconductor Corp (瑞昱半導體) yesterday posted a record high net profit for the first quarter of the year as exuberant demand for chips used in commercial PCs and Internet infrastructure offset slack demand for consumer electronics and chromebooks for students.

The Hsinchu-based chipmaker expects the uptrend to extend into this quarter despite COVID-19 lockdowns in China that have snarled logistics and halted factories’ operations.

“Overall demand looks very resilient in the short term. We are cautiously optimistic about the second quarter” Realtek spokesman Huang Yee-wei (黃依瑋) told an online investors’ conference.

The company is seeing strong growth momentum for its Ethernet chips and switch controllers this quarter as it benefits from network upgrades Huang said.

There are no signs indicating a slowdown he said.

The lockdowns in Shanghai have led to logistical issues and longer delivery times but the curbs have so far not depressed demand he added.

A growing number of companies are likely to join Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (台積電) and ASE Technology Holding Co (日月光投控) a chip testing and packaging services provider and reopen their Chinese operations after receiving approval from the Shanghai government Huang said.

The company is monitoring the situation in Ukraine China COVID-19 infections and high inflation worldwide which could weaken demand in the long term he said.

While scarcity of semiconductors remains a bottleneck Realtek has added more foundry partners but it does not expect to see a significant improvement in supply any time soon he added.

“Based on our current observations there is little change compared with what we saw three months ago. Chip shortages will not be resolved in the short term” Huang said. “We are still facing pressure from further price increases [by foundry partners] but the hikes should be less steep than last year.”

Realtek posted a net profit of NT$5.19 billion (US$177.4 million) for the first quarter of the year an increase of 69.8 percent from NT$3.06 billion in the same period last year.

On a quarterly basis net profit rose 12.6 percent from NT$4.61 billion.

Earnings per share climbed to NT$10.15 from NT$5.98 a year earlier and NT$9.02 a quarter earlier.

Gross margin rose to 52.2 percent from 44.8 percent in the first quarter last year but declined from 52.9 percent in the final quarter last year.

Revenue grew 27.5 percent year-on-year or 8.7 percent quarter-on-quarter to NT$29.76 billion an all-time high.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vc2NpdGVjaGRhaWx5LmNvbS9hdG9taWMtbGF5ZXItZXRjaGluZy1jb3VsZC1sZWFkLXRvLWV2ZXItbW9yZS1wb3dlcmZ1bC1taWNyb2NoaXBzLWFuZC1zdXBlcmNvbXB1dGVycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Atomic Layer Etching Could Lead to Ever-More Powerful Microchips and Supercomputers,"

Over the course of almost 60 years the information age has given the world the internet smart phones and lightning-fast computers. This has been made possible by about doubling the number of transistors that can be packed onto a computer chip every two years resulting in billions of atomic-scale transistors that can fit on a fingernail-sized device. Even individual atoms may be observed and counted within such “atomic scale” lengths.

Physical limit

With this doubling reaching its physical limit the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) has joined industry efforts to prolong the process and find new techniques to make ever-more powerful efficient and cost-effective chips. In the first PPPL research conducted under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with Lam Research Corp. a global producer of chip-making equipment laboratory scientists properly predicted a fundamental phase in atomic-scale chip production through the use of modeling.

“This would be one little piece in the whole process” said David Graves associate laboratory director for low-temperature plasma surface interactions a professor in the Princeton Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering and co-author of a paper that outlines the findings in the Journal of Vacuum Science & Technology B. Insights gained through modeling he said “can lead to all sorts of good things and that’s why this effort at the Lab has got some promise.”

While the shrinkage can’t go on much longer “it hasn’t completely reached an end” he said. “Industry has been successful to date in using mainly empirical methods to develop innovative new processes but a deeper fundamental understanding will speed this process. Fundamental studies take time and require expertise industry does not always have” he said. “This creates a strong incentive for laboratories to take on the work.”

The PPPL scientists modeled what is called “atomic layer etching” (ALE) an increasingly critical fabrication step that aims to remove single atomic layers from a surface at a time. This process can be used to etch complex three-dimensional structures with critical dimensions that are thousands of times thinner than a human hair into a film on a silicon wafer.

Basic agreement

“The simulations basically agreed with experiments as a first step and could lead to improved understanding of the use of ALE for atomic-scale etching” said Joseph Vella a post-doctoral fellow at PPPL and lead author of the journal paper. Improved understanding will enable PPPL to investigate such things as the extent of surface damage and the degree of roughness developed during ALE he said “and this all starts with building our fundamental understanding of atomic layer etching.”

The model simulated the sequential use of chlorine gas and argon plasma ions to control the silicon etch process on an atomic scale. Plasma or ionized gas is a mixture consisting of free electrons positively charged ions and neutral molecules. The plasma used in semiconductor device processing is near room temperature in contrast to the ultra-hot plasma used in fusion experiments.

“A surprise empirical finding from Lam Research was that the ALE process became particularly effective when the ion energies were quite a bit higher than the ones we started with” Graves said. “So that will be our next step in the simulations — to see if we can understand what’s happening when the ion energy is much higher and why it’s so good.”

Going forward “the semiconductor industry as a whole is contemplating a major expansion in the materials and the types of devices to be used and this expansion will also have to be processed with atomic scale precision” he said. “The U.S. goal is to lead the world in using science to tackle important industrial problems” he said “and our work is part of that.”

The company said the attack did not affect operations; however media reports claimed that hackers demanded $7.5 million from the oil producer.

In a regulatory filing Oil India said it has taken the necessary precautions.

Oil India isn’t alone. According to CyberPeace Foundation a civil society organization nearly 360000 attacks on Indian oil companies were detected by threat intelligence sensors deployed to analyze real-time cyberthreats between October 2021 and 12 April. Its study said 19342 threats were detected in February the least in this period. October had the highest number of attacks at 117000.

The study was part of CyberPeace Foundation’s eKawach programme for which it partnered with Autobot Infosec Pvt. Ltd and CyberPeace Center of Excellence (CCoE) to deploy the SCADA Critical Information Infrastructure threat intelligence sensors which are industrial control systems deployed on critical infrastructure.

A spokesperson for CyberPeace Foundation said “Deploying the simulated network will play a key role in collecting data on attack patterns different types of attack vectors for the different protocols and the recent malicious activities."" An attack vector is a method used by hackers to exploit vulnerabilities and infiltrate a system or network.

The study signals the growing number of cyberattacks on the critical infrastructure of companies in India. Such attacks have increased in the past year worldwide as well. Several US firms including Colonial Pipeline and JBS Foods were hit by ransomware attacks in 2021.

This month UK-based cybersecurity firm Recorded Future warned about a Chinese state-backed threat campaign targeting power companies in India. It had flagged similar attacks on power grids in the country in February.

“In recent months we observed likely network intrusions targeting at least seven Indian state load despatch centres (SLDCs) responsible for carrying out real-time operations for grid control and electricity dispatch within these respective states"" the security firm said in a blog post on 6 April. It added that SLDCs were located in north India and in proximity to the disputed Indo-China border in Ladakh.

Last year the firm said a Chinese state-backed hacker group called RedEcho had targeted power grids in India. “This latest set of intrusions however is composed of an almost entirely different set of victim organizations. In addition to the targeting of power grid assets we also identified the compromise of a national emergency response system and the Indian subsidiary of a multinational logistics firm by the same threat activity group"" the company said in its post.

Further CyberPeace Foundation also detected a significant increase in phishing and social engineering attacks on Indian organizations in the oil and refining industries. Such attacks are used to dupe users into sharing sensitive information like passwords and other access details. Hackers are even using WhatsApp to send phishing messages with malicious links in the name of Indian Oil Corp the firm said.

Though CyberPeace Foundation didn’t attribute the attacks directly to any ransomware group or state-sponsored attack the researchers pointed out that javascript code called hm.js was being executed from a Baidu subdomain hm.baidu.com suggesting the involvement of Chinese hacker groups.

“With the number of ransomware attacks continuing to skyrocket cybercriminals are expanding their targets by shifting focus towards critical infrastructure and evolving into deep-rooted software supply chain attack campaigns which can cause long-lasting devastation"" said Parag Khurana country manager of Barracuda Networks a cybersecurity firm.

A report this month from security firm Palo Alto Networks noted a 218% increase in ransomware attacks on Indian organizations in 2021. Barracuda Networks has also seen increased cyberattacks on critical infrastructure companies such as Oil India. Attacks on critical infrastructure in India accounted for 11% of all cyberattacks in 2021.

Khurana said attacks on critical infrastructure firms could cripple day-to-day operations cause chaos and result in financial losses from downtime ransom payments recovery costs and other unanticipated expenses.

Using cyberattacks to disrupt critical infrastructure started in 2010 when the US and Israel used the Stuxnet virus to target a nuclear facility in Natanz Iran to derail the country’s nuclear programme. The virus caused a malfunction in the uranium enrichment centrifuges which affected the plant’s nuclear enrichment efficiency.

Refinery to Create North America's Largest ...,"In a sweet SAF switcheroo huge news arrived from California-based World Energy a carbon-net-zero solutions provider that it secured the critical permits required to completely convert and increase output by 700 percent at its Southern California renewable fuels production facility the world’s first and North America’s only commercial-scale Sustainable Aviation Fuel production site. World Energy is teaming up with Air Products the world’s largest hydrogen producer and Honeywell an innovator in SAF technology to build the most technologically advanced production and distribution hub ever constructed – in a $2 billion project that will yield 340-million-gallons of annual capacity and collaboration to advance green hydrogen too.

In today’s Digest an exclusive Digest inside look at how World Energy is converting its Southern California refinery to create North America’s largest SAF hub the players the reactions including from the U.S. Department of Energy the Mayor and U.S. Congress why it’s such a huge deal what it all means and more.

The Transformation

Let’s start with the switch from a regular ole’ oil refinery to a leading advanced sustainable aviation fuel super duper hub. The former oil refinery site will never again refine fossil fuels. By 2050 the facility will produce fuels that will displace over 76 million metric tons of carbon dioxide the equivalent of 3.8 million carbon-net-zero flights from Los Angeles to New York. It will also significantly reduce the fine particulate emissions in the trucks trains and planes powered by World Energy’s fuels. Air Products and World Energy will collaborate on innovations to transition to green hydrogen inputs further reducing the carbon intensity of the fuels it produces.

Ok ok we hear some of you saying how can this be “North America’s only commercial-scale Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production site – what about Neste? SkyNRG? Alder Fuels?” When asked about this World Energy spokesperson told The Digest that World Energy has been producing SAF at a commercial scale since 2016 and “Neste makes SAF outside of the U.S. and SkyNRG and Alder are pre-commercial though we have supplied SkyNRG for years.”

The huge positive economic impact can’t be ignored either – The Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation (LAEDC) Institute for Applied Economics (IAE) conducted a multiregional economic impact analysis and estimates that between 2019 and 2024 World Energy’s ongoing operations and conversion will contribute $19.2 billion to the U.S. economy and generate more than 18000 jobs. Now we are talking!

Together along with more than 15 other leading firms the companies are collaborating to speed up and expand the decarbonization of aviation. Global air transport leaders and those heavily reliant on aviation are now entering into long-term agreements to secure access to the plant’s current and expanding supply to make carbon-net-zero aviation real.

That means real SAF into real airplanes and real soon.

The Tech

World Energy’s SAF is a paraffinic product that is refined through a process called Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA). This produces a SAF called HEFA-SPK. The HEFA process that World Energy uses refines renewable inputs including inedible agricultural fats and waste oils into SAF through a process that uses hydrogen (hydrogenation). According to World Energy the process of procuring feedstocks and making and distributing their fuels is completely ethical and sustainable from start to finish to create the best product possible for the air environment and society. You can check out their production process video here.

When will the 700% increase in output take affect?

“The Paramount facility will be online and in full production by 2025” World Energy told The Digest over the weekend. “By IATA’s target of 2050 World Energy’s fuels will have already displaced over 76 million metric tons of carbon dioxide the equivalent of 3.8 million carbon-net-zero full aircraft flights from Los Angeles to New York.”

Where will the fuel go?

We know World Energy already has deals with United Airlines but they are also “currently in discussions to finalize long-term contracts with a number of aviation companies including airlines cargo shippers FBOs and others. More information will follow as these contracts are finalized” World Energy spokesperson told The Digest over the weekend.

Reactions from the stakeholders

The Mayor: “World Energy’s transformation of its facility to producing 100 percent sustainable fuel is good for the planet and it’s good for our City” said Paramount Mayor Vilma Cuellar Stallings. “Locally the refinery will never again deal with petroleum products which of course will be healthy for our residents. We welcome this change.”

The Feds: James Spaeth Systems Development and Integration Program Manager U.S. Department of Energy said at the Earth Day celebration “To see this expansion is up to what is it 350 million gallons it’s the first real major building of SAF production in the U.S. and perhaps the largest in the world so the administration is just thrilled to be here to see this investment.”

The Leader: “Getting real about net-zero aviation is going to require the mobilization of expertise and resources far beyond anything that has come before” said Gene Gebolys CEO World Energy. “We are pulling together the very best companies in the world with the expertise experience commitment and focus to collaborate on pushing the frontier of what can be done to decarbonize aviation today while building a platform for what needs to be done to decarbonize flight entirely by 2050. This is an immense undertaking. But it must be done and it requires that we move with the speed coordination and determination befitting the problem we are working to tackle.”

Gerbolys also told The Digest “Between now and 2050 we will produce enough fuel to displace enough carbon to effectuate 3.8 million net zero flights between LA and New York. Airplanes are going to run on high density liquid fuels for the foreseeable future and what we need to do is get into that fuel tank with lower carbon fuels so our approach to making net carbon zero real is to take existing aircraft and make them fly in a much-less carbon intensive way. It’s fitting that we’re doing this on Earth Day. Earth day is all about taking action and today we’re announcing a two-billion-dollar investment in attacking the carbon emissions in aviation.”

Another World Energy leader Adam Klauber Vice President ESG and Sustainability told The Digest “This project is all about green-collar jobs – we’re going to create over 1000 jobs with a focus on local hiring. By 2025 World Energy supply will replace over 10% of LAX’s fuel supply and this will benefit local air quality because we’ll be swapping the conventional fossil-fuel that has high particulate matter with fuel that has very low particulate matter which is much better for breathing and the lungs of all the residents in the local community. So we’re going from 250 barrels of sustainable aviation fuel a day all the way to 25000 barrels of sustainable aviation fuel a day this will make California home to the largest advanced biofuel producer for sustainable aviation fuel anywhere.”

Hydrogen Head-Honcho: “This project is another pioneering moment in Air Products’ commitment to help support the energy transition. We are already building the world’s largest green hydrogen facility with our partners in Saudi Arabia and the world’s largest blue hydrogen facility in Louisiana. Now we are teaming up with World Energy to build North America’s largest SAF facility” said Seifi Ghasemi Air Products’ Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer. “We are very pleased to be working with World Energy enabling another U.S. megaproject that will provide measurable sustainability benefits and advance California’s decarbonization goals by producing a renewable fuel to meet the growing demands of the aviation industry.”

Hot Honeywell: “As one of the pioneers of the SAF market with Honeywell UOP Ecofining technology our long-term engagement with World Energy continues to help transform the industry and support the goal of a significantly reducing CO2 emissions” Bryan Glover President and CEO Honeywell UOP. “Our participation in this project will not only enable World Energy to build a technologically advanced SAF production and distribution hub it also helps accelerate the energy transition of the aviation industry.”

A bit of background

The world’s first and North America’s only commercial-scale SAF facility was launched in Paramount using Honeywell UOP’s Ecofining technology in 2013 with production commencing in 2016. World Energy and Honeywell have continued to collaborate and have strengthened this critical relationship with a technical development agreement to advance the next generation of carbon reduction technologies. This collaboration will further innovations integrating more efficient SAF production processes new process pathways using new sustainable feedstocks low-carbon hydrogen and carbon capture technologies.

The bottom line is this is huge news for SAF and the aviation industry in seeing a big impact on aviation sustainability – perfect timing for Earth Day weekend but just the beginning of seeing more real SAF in real planes real soon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbXluaW50ZW5kb25ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDQvMjQvc29uaWMtdGhlLWhlZGdlaG9nLTItbW92aWUtbmVhcnMtMzAwbS1nbG9iYWwtdGFraW5ncy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sonic the Hedgehog 2 movie nears $300M global takings,"There’s no let up with cinema goers wanting to watch the latest Sonic the Hedgehog movie as Sonic the Hedgehog 2 has nearly earned $300 million globally which will clearly satisfy both Paramount and SEGA.

Yes you got that right. We’re talking about the richest man in the world Elon Musk. He is a space fanatic and one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the world.

Elon dropped out of the prestigious Stanford University because of his unique set of beliefs. While his peers focused on their physics research Musk was busy learning about the internet as he believed it could change the world.

At the age of 12 Musk started learning computer programming which he believes to be his best gift to himself. He even managed to finish Isaac Asimov’s ‘Foundation Of A Child.’

Elon Musk’s attempt at creating a video game

At the age of ten most children learn to ride a bike swim and write efficiently. Elon on the other hand had different plans. With his complex understanding of programs he developed a video game called Blastar. The game was developed using a specific computer the Commodore Vic-20.

After two years he sold the code of Blastar to a computer magazine for $500. This is not something the parents of a twelve-year-old would expect. To date a few people believe he got his powers from his dad Errol Musk a South African engineer.

What makes Elon different is his way of looking at things. In various interviews the billionaire has said that he wants to solve problems rather than create new things. A great example of this would be SpaceX. Musk founded the company to make space travel more affordable and revolutionize the aerospace industry.

The American started his career with Zip2 alongside his brother and later founded X.com and PayPal. Later he moved on to take over Tesla one of the most innovative car companies in the world. A handful of other companies are registered under his name such as SolarCity Neuralink and Tesla Energy. He also owns a very bizarre company called ‘The Boring Company.’

Sisinty narrated the story of the electric vehicle company's early days and tweeted""Elon Musk was not the founder of Tesla. He acquired it"". It did not take long before the Tesla CEO decided to correct the narrative and provide some new insights on Tesla's early days in the process.

The tech billionaire recently reiterated a few points about Tesla's early days in a set of tweets following a post from Vaibhav Sisinty the CEO and founder of GrowthSchool reports Teslarati.

Sisinty posted a ""reminder"" that Musk was not the founder of Tesla but he simply acquired the company.

Elon Musk's reply

""Not even close to that. It was a shell corp with no employees no IP no designs no prototype literally nothing but a (business) plan to commercialize AC Propulsion's T-Zero car which was introduced to me by JB Straubel not Eberhard. Even (the) name 'Tesla Motors' was owned by others!"" Musk wrote on the microblogging platform.

Musk stated that if one were to follow the logic adopted in the narrative that paints Eberhard and Tarpenning as the founders of Tesla then he would be the only ""founder"" of PayPal since he started the company that eventually became the online payments giant.

According to the report during his TED 2022 appearance Musk stated that his worst business decision was probably the fact that he did not just start Tesla with JB Straubel. Musk stated that he did not invest in a company.

But that was many moons ago and times have changed for the better since. Thanks to the digital age money-making techniques have come a long way and getting free cash is now very much a possibility; you don't even have to go out of your way to make money.

""Free"" refers to a cash bonus or other rewards you get for signing up and using services and not money raining down from the heavens. These run the gamut from playing games  taking online surveys  or even just downloading a free app. Some of these services also throw in a few other perks like gift cards  cash back and a cash bonus. While these free-money apps will bring in extra cash and may look like they could generate hefty passive income the reality is that any payout will only be enough to cover a few minor expenses at most. These apps can't replace a solid side hustle or a full-time job.

One thing to be mindful of is what method to choose when you decide to cash out. Generally speaking Amazon gift cards offer better value for your SB than PayPal.

MyPoints

MyPoints will give you $10 just for signing up but on one condition: you'll have to spend at least $20 at one of its partners within 30 days of joining. The company doesn't just give you cash.

A young Steven Spielberg once worked with legendary actor Joan Crawford much earlier in his career. The director went on to work with a wide variety of big names but he worked with her before he was entirely comfortable behind the camera on bigger productions. Spielberg recalled a story where Crawford sold Pepsi-Cola to the movie crew to force them to belch.

Spielberg and Crawford worked together on the 1969 Night Gallery. It was a made-for-television anthology horror film with three supernatural tales. Rod Serling wrote and hosted the movie series from an art gallery setting as the curator.

The director worked on the second movie installment titled “Eyes.” The story follows a heartless and wealthy blind woman (Crawford) who desperately wants to see again. A gambler in need of money donates his eyes to her for a large sum of money. She blackmails a doctor to perform the surgery but she’s told that her vision will only last for 11 hours. However the seemingly perfect night takes twists and turns that become a nightmare.

Joan Crawford sold soda to the ‘Night Gallery’ crew to force them to belch

The Turner Classic Movies YouTube channel posted an interview with Spielberg at the 2022 TCM Classic Film Festival. The moderator asked him questions about his filmography and how his personal life connects to it but he made sure to ask about some of his older works as well.

The interview began with a question about what it was like for Spielberg to work with Crawford on Night Gallery. He also had an entertaining story to share about his experience working with her.

“She was not Mommie Dearest let’s put it that way” Spielberg said. “That was not my experience. She was kind and she was understanding and she forgave my acne and the Clearasil that attempted to cover it up.”

Spielberg continued: “She was elegant and she was selling Pepsi-Cola left and right. She brought huge huge ice chests with Mountain Dew and Pepsis. Every single day gave it to the crew and said ‘If you don’t belch after drinking it’s an insult.’ She was having a good time.”

The actor treated Steven Spielberg like he knew what he was doing

Steven Spielberg's professional directorial debut premiered 50 years ago this weekend when ""Eyes"" starring Joan Crawford and Barry Sullivan aired on NBC as part of Rod Serling's NIGHT GALLERY pilot.

The TCM moderator recalled a previous Spielberg interview where he said that he was grateful to Crawford. She treated the director with respect but he didn’t know what he was doing at the time.

“I did not know what I was doing half of the time because it was intimidating” Spielberg recalled. “I had never worked with a crew that size before. I’d been making 16mm movies with friends in college. I had made an unfinished 35mm film about a bicycle race and then I had done Amblin’ in 35 which got me my contract at Universal.”

Spielberg concluded: “But that was a crew of 15 people and I was surrounded by mostly men mostly men in 1968 in blazers with hats and ties. Gaffers the electricians the grips they wore ties and some of them had hats. It was a changing of the guard.”",,,,,,

Pfizer recalled one of its hypertension-treating drugs after it was found to have an increased presence of an impurity that can cause cancer.

Five lots of Accupril (Quinapril HCl) tablets have been recalled due to a presence of a nitrosamine above the acceptable daily intake level. Increased intake of nitrosamines can increase the risk of cancer over long periods of time.

Those currently taking the affected Accupril tablets are not at any immediate risk and Pfizer is not aware of reports of adverse events related to the recall.

The product lots were distributed nationwide to wholesalers and distributors in the United States and Puerto Rico from December 2019 to April 2022.

The included tablets in the recall all come in 90 count bottles with strengths of 10 mg 20 mg and 40 mg. You can see the exact NDC and lot numbers included here.

WASHINGTON — Pfizer is voluntarily recalling certain lots of another blood pressure medication after finding elevated levels of a potentially cancer-causing chemical.

According to a Friday announcement on the FDA's website Pfizer is recalling five batches of its Accupril blood pressure tablets after recent testing found nitrosamine levels above acceptable levels.

Nitrosamines are commonly found in food and water and everyone is exposed to them on some level. However the FDA says they may increase your risk of cancer if you're exposed to them above acceptable levels over long periods of time.

Accupril is intended to treat hypertension by lowering blood pressure. Pfizer said it is not aware of any adverse effects from the recalled lots and that there is no immediate risk to patients.

""Patients currently taking the products should consult with their doctor about alternative treatment options"" the company said.

Last month Pfizer recalled some batches of another blood pressure drug called Accuretic and generic versions also due to unhealthy nitrosamine levels.

The recalled batches were distributed nationwide to wholesalers and distributors in the U.S. and Puerto Rico from December 2019 to April 2022 Pfizer said. Expiration dates range from May 2022 to March 2023 and all of the tablets came in 90-count bottles.

McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

As a member of the Class of 2023 Blocker was a four-star recruit out of Little Rock (Ark.) Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

To keep up with the latest players on the move check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhcnRhbnN3aXJlLnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9saXN0cy9saXN0LW9mLXNjaG9vbHMtbXN1LXRyYW5zZmVyLXBnLWFqLWhvZ2dhcmQtaXMtcmVwb3J0ZWRseS1jb25zaWRlcmluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,List of schools MSU transfer PG AJ Hoggard is reportedly considering,"Former Michigan State point guard AJ Hoggard has reportedly cut the lists of schools he’s considering to only five programs.

Hoggard has started at point guard for the Spartans the past two seasons recording 10.7 points and 5.2 assists per game this past year. He however elected to enter the transfer portal following the season instead of coming back for a fifth year at Michigan State.

Sittenfeld's convictions for bribery and attempted extortion should stand.

Sittenfeld the former Democratic Cincinnati city councilman is now five months into a 16-month prison sentence. He has asked the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to throw out his convictions.

A three-judge panel made up of appointees of former President Donald Trump will hear the case: John Bush John Nalbandian and Eric Murphy.

Oral arguments are set to begin at 9 a.m.

Typical politics or campaign crime?

Sittenfeld's defense has remained consistent since he was indicted in 2020. He says his actions were typical of politics − he was raising money for future campaigns.

If his convictions are allowed to stand his attorneys say in documents filed in his appeal it would usher in ""a First Amendment Ice Age"" where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld's goals for higher office led him to accept $20000 in donations to his political action committee in exchange for his official support of a Downtown development project.

Accepting the money in exchange for an official act amounted to an illegal quid pro quo prosecutors said.

Former attorneys general under three Republican presidents the former head federal prosecutor for the southern half of Ohio and a collection of law professors with expertise in public corruption were among those who filed amicus briefs in support of Sittenfeld. The briefs argued that the convictions had criminalized typical political fundraising.

What's next for P.G. Sittenfeld case

A decision won't come for some time possibly after Sittenfeld completes his prison term. He sought a speedy review of case but that was rejected. The decision impacts Sittenfeld's future because a felony conviction prevents him from holding public office ever again."

Doing nothing is not an answer” Khan says.

“A cigarette is the only legal product on the market at the moment that if used as prescribed is likely to kill you. There is no other equivalent.

“A lot of people think smoking now is not an issue. But across the UK there are still seven million smokers and statistically two-thirds of them are likely to die because of it.”

He adds: “The latest estimates are that the cost [to the economy] is around £17bn a year. That's a mixture of the costs to the NHS for example about £2.5bn alone. Then there is the cost to productivity because people who smoke tend to have more time off work they tend to have more visits to hospital they need more medication.”

Whitehall insiders say Khan’s proposals and the Government policy will be a combination of ‘carrot’ and ‘stick’.

“The phrase that's been bandied about a bit internally - and obviously it won't exactly be like this - is one-in one-out. So there will be a tougher measure on smoking but we will look at a carrot to liberalise the means of exit” says a Government source.

They say a “vaping revolution” will likely culminate with e-cigarettes being made available on NHS prescriptions adding: “There's quite a lot of false information suggesting that vaping is actually more dangerous than it is.

“It's much safer than smoking a cigarette.. We want to be harnessing that as much as we can. As a country leading the way.”

Much to the chagrin of the anti-smoking lobby the world’s big four tobacco companies sense their chance.

Kingsley Wheaton marketing chief at BAT says the FTSE 100 company wants to “play a crucial role in encouraging adult smokers in the UK to switch to less risky alternatives”.

Options do not only include vaping. Nicky Small from JTI the company behind Benson & Hedges cigarettes says a “full range of smoking alternative products” must be made available to smokers including “newer innovative products such as nicotine pouches and heated tobacco”.

Verdeaux says: “It's not like you have a silver bullet [there is not] one category of product that is going to sort out the problem of smoking cigarettes.

Medical research suggests heated tobacco - heating rather than burning the product - may be more harmful than e-cigarettes but it is claimed to be more effective at getting smokers to quit - citing Japan where e-cigarettes are effectively banned as a major success story.

A study published last year in the British Medical Journal concluded: “HTP [heated tobacco products] have the same addictive potential as cigarettes; they should be regulated as a tobacco product with similar warning messages as cigarettes and their advertisement should not be allowed.”

An evidence review by Public Health England in 2018 found: “The limited evidence on environmental emissions from use of heated tobacco products suggests that harmful exposure from heated tobacco products is higher than from e-cigarettes but further evidence is needed to be able to compare products.”

Nevertheless Khan has not discounted heated tobacco or other alternatives such as oral nicotine pouches. But after “scouring the world” for ideas he appears on-message with the Government thinking that wider promotion of e-cigarettes will be a central plank of future policy.",,,,,,,,,,,,

BY THE NUMBERS

America’s hopes of medaling in the women’s 100 free at the Tokyo Olympics last year were thwarted when Simone Manuel the greatest U.S. women’s sprinter of this generation failed to make the final at 2021 Olympic trials. She later revealed that she had been suffering from overtraining syndrome for the majority of her season and just recently we found out that she wouldn’t be competing at U.S. trials this year.

With their best sprinter out of contention who does Team USA turn to now? Are they ever going to catch up to Australia who beat them by three seconds in the 4×100 free relay last summer?

To fill Manuel’s shoes is an incredibly difficult task. She’s the 2016 Olympic champion the 2017 and 2019 world champion and the American record holder in the 100 free (52.04). In fact she remains the only American woman to have medaled in this event at Worlds since Natalie Coughlin tied for silver in 2005.

Mallory Comerford (52.59) and Abbey Weitzeil (52.99) are two other American women aside from Manuel to have gone under 53 seconds in the event and Comeford hasn’t been near that mark for years. Considering that it’s going to take 51-highs or 52-lows to medal individually expect a long podium drought for the Americans if nobody else steps up.

But the lack of up-and-coming stars in this event isn’t exactly a problem for Team USA. In fact the large pool of talent in this field has made the question of who will be the top women’s 100 freestyler a heated topic of discussion to the point where we recently issued a poll to our readers asking who would win the event at U.S. trials.

In that poll Claire Curzan took the most votes at 26.6% followed by Kate Douglass at 23.6% Gretchen Walsh at 21.8% and Abbey Weitzeil at 18.8%. The majority of votes being almost evenly split being four different people just shows how wide open this event is going to be.

America has many sprinters who are in the 53-point range. And although a 53 is good enough to make the Worlds team it’s just a matter of who’s going to be the next one to make that leap from a 53 to a 52. And while we might not necessarily see a 52 at trials the 100 free race in Greensboro is an important set up for what’s to come this summer in Budapest.

Contenders for this event can be separated into two categories: those who have represented the USA in the 100 free and the 4×100 free relay at past Olympics or World Championships and young guns who seem to have an endless ceiling of possibilities.

THE RISING STARS

So let’s talk about Claire Curzan the fan-favorite according to our poll. The future Stanford swimmer has been impressing us race after race at recent TYR Pro Swim Series stops in Westmont and San Antonio and holds the top time in the country this year (53.68).

Last June Curzan finished 12th at Olympic trials with a time of 54.39 but was nearly a second faster a month before when she set her personal best of 53.55. In fact this was a trend across all of her events as she added from her entry time in 50 free and 100 fly as well.

With more experience tapering for major meets like trials it will be easier for Curzan to put last year behind her and get herself a spot on the worlds team in the 100 free this year.

Then there’s Gretchen Walsh. When she was a sophomore in high school she went a 53.75 en route to winning a gold medal at the 2019 World Junior Championships igniting the hope that she could be America’s next greatest sprinter. However that 53.75 still remains her best time even after three years and she was two seconds slower when she didn’t make it out of the heats at Olympic trials and finished 28th.

Since her disappointing trials meet Walsh made a shift in her training environment when she began racing for the University of Virginia collegiately. She’s improved in all of her events in yards this NCAA season including dropping nearly a second in the 100 free when she won the national title with a time of 46.05. In fact she told SwimSwam a few weeks before NCAAs that she experienced major improvements in her training after coming to UVA.

“I felt a certain way at junior worlds that I haven’t felt again since I got to UVA. I feel so good in the water my strokes feel so efficient…everything I’m doing feels correct.”

Walsh went a 56.00 at a UVA time trial this year which is a time that may seem pedestrian for her standards but don’t let that fool you. Based on her performances at NCAAs expect to see a reinvigorated Gretchen Walsh in Greensboro next week.

Training alongside Walsh at UVA is Kate Douglass another contender in this event. Ever since her phenomenal NCAA performance this March Douglass’s stock has risen a significant amount in long course. Although her best time is only a 54.14 from when she finished seventh at trials last year she’s exceeded our expectations so many times this year to the point where we have no idea what she will do next.

Our confidence in Douglass doesn’t just come from pure instinct. At the 2021 Short Course World Championships she was a key contributor to America’s gold medal winning 4×50 and 4×100 free relays. She led off the latter relay with a time of 52.39 and even out-split long course world record holder Sarah Sjostrom on the first 50 meters of her swim. In addition she clocked a 54.58 at the same UVA time trial that Walsh swam at a very good time for where she was at in training then.

The final major challenger in this event who can be considered a “rising star” is Stanford’s Torri Huske. In fact Huske has a faster best time than Curzan Walsh and Douglass a 53.46 from April 2021. However she had the same issue as Curzan of adding at Olympic trials and ended up finishing tenth.

We haven’t seen Huske swim this event at all this year as she only raced the 100 fly at the Pacific Open last week. However in yards this year she hit the milestone of breaking 47 for the first time and went a 46.82 leading off Stanford’s 400 free relay (she previously went 46.96 in the individual 100 free).

The 100 free being on the first day of the meet gives these young stars a fresh start to prove themselves in the race.

THE VETERANS

Even with the pool of rising young talent Abbey Weitzeil is still the woman to beat. She’s been representing the United States alongside Manuel for a very long time as she was on every USA 4×100 free relay since 2014 and competed in the individual 100 free at the 2016 and 2020 Olympics. Most recently she set a new best time of 52.99 in the semifinals of the Olympics (she was 53.23 in the finals to finish eighth) to become the third American woman to break 53 seconds. That time also puts her as the top seed on the psych sheet.

Weitzeil’s season best is a 54.01 from the Fran Crippen Invitational which ranks her second in the country this year behind Curzan.

Erika Brown is the fastest American to have never been under 53 (and the fourth-fastest American of all time) holding a best time of 53.42 from the Tokyo US Open. Brown finished second behind Weitzeil at the 2021 Olympic trials and then proceeded to finish 13th at the Olympics with a 53.58.

Although Brown may have been fast enough to finish second at trials last year expect the number of 53-mid swimmers to multiply this year making it hard for her to retain her spot.

Former Georgia training partners Natalie Hinds and Olivia Smoliga both swam in the in the 4×100 free relay at the Olympics last summer. Since then Hinds went back to her alma mater at Florida to train under Anthony Nesty while Smoliga joined Bob Bowman’s pro group at Arizona State.

Last year Hinds and Smoliga finished third and fourth in at Olympic trials respectively but tied for first in the semifinals with personal best times of 53.55. That time puts the two of them right up there with Curzan’s best time on the psych sheets. Although both of them are technically past their prime (Hinds is 28 and Smoliga is 27) their best times set just a year ago and their red-hot training groups say otherwise.

Another swimmer who changed training bases is Linnea Mack. The Team Elite swimmer has been training part-time in Switzerland this season and swam in a few ISL and World Cup meets. She finished eighth at trials last year with a 54.32 but has a personal best of 53.78 from last May.

Catie DeLoof and Allison Schmitt who represented Team USA in the prelims of the 4×100 free relay at the Olympics last summer are not listed on the psych sheets and will not be competing at U.S. trials this summer.

And where’s the second-fastest American woman in history in this conversation? Mallory Comerford who qualified for the individual 100 free at both 2017 and 2019 worlds finished 14th at 2021 Olympic trials with a 54.43. She hasn’t been 53-point since 2020 so it’s going to be difficult for her to keep up with everyone else if she’s not where she was in 2017 and 2019.

Dark Horse: Katharine Berkoff– The NC State swimmer is more of a favorite in the backstroke races but she had a major shift in focus to the sprints this college season which culminated in her finishing seventh and third in the 50 and 100 free at NCAAs respectively.

How Long Will the Giveaway Last?

According to a release from OEMC the giveaway at Chicago locations is expected to last about 4-5 hours and serve approximately 400 cars at each gas station.

Is This Part of Chicago's Proposed Free Gas Card Program?

Wilson's gas giveaway unrelated.

Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot last month a proposed ""Chicago Moves"" initiative which would will issue up to 50000 pre-loaded gas cards worth $150 each which will be distributed to residents through a lottery system Lightfoot said in a press conference.

The plan passed a committee meeting Wednesday and is one step closer to becoming reality. If given the go-ahead by the full City Council on April 27 Chicago residents next week can start applying for the cards.

Who is Willie Wilson?

Wilson a well-known businessman and philanthropist that has previously run for elected office in numerous elections jumped into the 2023 Chicago mayoral race on April 11 with a $5 million contribution to himself and a burst of goodwill generated by his gas giveaways.

It will be the third time Wilson has given away gas in recent weeks. He twice held gas giveaways in March including $1 million worth through about 50 stations in and around the city.

Three years ago Wilson won 13 of 18 Black wards finishing fourth overall with 10.6 percent of the vote. In the runoff Lori Lightfoot won all of those wards — and all 50 wards citywide —after Wilson endorsed her over County Board President Toni Preckwinkle.

With a burst of good will generated by his $1.2 million gas giveaways millionaire businessman Willie Wilson on Monday joined the race to send Mayor Lori Lightfoot into political retirement.

In its annual Summer Gas Outlook published on 14 April the UK’s National Grid plc a British multinational electricity and gas utility company noted that the UK will increase its gas exports over the next 6 months to help Europe fill its gas storage sites ahead of next winter.

European gas storage was at 27% at the end of this winter as compared to 30% the same time a year ago.

The UK has been a net importer of gas since 2005 covering 50% of demand with its own production from the North and Irish Seas plus associated petroleum gas from oil fields.

Norway supplies about 30% of UK imports via pipeline with LNG from Qatar the US and Russia accounting for a bit more than 15% according to the Outlook.

Any surplus gas in the system can then be exported to Europe via the BBL pipeline to the Netherlands (Bacton to Balgzand) or through the Interconnector pipeline to Belgium (Bacton to Zeebrugge.) The ability to regasify LNG from anywhere in the world and then deliver it to Europe by pipeline makes Britain an “energy bridge” that can wean Europe off Russian energy while longer-term solutions are put into place.

This summer UK gas exports to the EU could reach 5.1 Bcm far beyond the volumes of 2021 when exports totaled only 0.7 Bcm because cold summers had drawn down the UK’s gas reserves according to National Grid which noted that the increased exports are to be based on “commercial agreements” as opposed to intergovernmental agreements.

LNG is expected to play a major role in boosting EU gas supplies from new sources globally with more cargos directed in the near term to the UK’s three regasification terminals—Grain LNG (the UK’s largest) on the Thames Estuary Kent; and the South Hook and Dragon regasification terminals in Wales.

The UK is Europe’s second-largest LNG importer after Spain and given its subsea pipeline connections to the continent it is also a gas transit state to the EU.

So far the US has agreed to increase LNG exports to Europe by 15 Bcm and Qatar has promised not to redirect Europe-bound cargoes to Asia as is the practice when buyers in Asia offer higher premiums to sellers.

Fred Hutchison chief executive of the US trade group LNG Allies confirmed to Reuters that delegations from Latvia and Estonia as well as diplomats from Bulgaria Estonia France Germany Hungary Latvia and the UK toured the Golden Pass LNG export project in Sabine Pass Texas in early April and met in Houston with US shale gas producers.

Top executives from Chesapeake Energy Coterra Energy EOG Resources and EQT Corp. participated in the event which was intended to foster discussion of how US energy producers could assist Europe in replacing Russian imports of oil coal and LNG.

The meeting co-organized with the American Exploration and Production Council touched also on the topic of building new infrastructure in both Europe and in the US echoing testimony that Pioneer Natural Resources Chief Executive Scott Sheffield gave the same day when he told a congressional hearing that new LNG facilities are needed in the northeast according to Reuters and C-SPAN.

As for Europe Germany—which had staked its energy security largely on Russian pipeline gas—now expects to commission its first LNG regasification plant in 2026.In March Germany’s Economic Minister Robert Habeck was in Doha lining up a long-term supply contract with Qatar.

Meanwhile Algeria has agreed to increase gas exports to Italy through the Trans-Mediterranean Pipeline to Sicily via Tunisiaunder an agreement announced during Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi’s visit to Algiers for talks with Algerian president Abdelmadjid Tebboune.

Italy like the rest of the EU relies on Russia for about 40% of its energy imports. In 2021 the EU imported 155 Bcm of Russian gas which represented about 45% of EU gas imports nearly 40% of total gas consumption according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Freeman also discussed what made him fall in love with the job; the almost 50 years he’s spent in the industry; how he landed at QNB; and the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for his community bank.

Two-year-old Dave Freeman.

Where were you born and where did you grow up?

I was born the youngest of six kids in Columbus Ohio in 1956 and spent all my life there until I left in 1993.

What did your parents do?

My father did a lot of different things. He was a professor for some time at Denison College and Wittenberg University while he was working on his Ph.D. He did public relations work for a hospital and worked in various consulting positions.

After I was born he was the Finance Director for the City of Columbus with Mayor Westlake. After that he went to work for the State of Ohio for quite some time in different positions.

My mom stayed home with us kids. She had three years of college and later she decided to go back to finish her degree at Ohio State University. She taught elementary school in inner-city Columbus for many years. She really loved teaching and it became a huge part of her life.

What do you remember about growing up in Columbus?

We were in the city about two miles north of Ohio State’s campus in an area of the city called Clintonville. It was a nice neighborhood. Columbus had excellent public schools. As so many others say as long as I was home for dinner I was out and about for the entire day. We were out riding bikes and playing games. Growing up the best Christmas gift I ever received was a bicycle when I was eight!

Did you play any sports growing up?

Dave bringing the ball up-court in high school.

I played basketball football and baseball in the local rec league. Those were the only sports available back in those days. I was best at basketball and played center growing up before moving to small forward in high school. I didn’t have all the physical talent but I was a good player fundamentally.

Did you have any jobs growing up?

I subbed paper routes a few times for some of my friends. I also was part of a group of kids who cleaned the buildings at the Ohio State Fair. It’s a week-and-a-half in August and I worked from eighth grade through my high school years. We would start at 9:00 PM and work until 1:00 or 2:30 in the morning!

What lessons did you take away from those jobs that still stay with you today?

I learned that teamwork was the best way to get out of there as quickly as possible! We were paid a flat rate no matter how long it took so we tried to work together to make the work go faster. Our first year there we didn’t know what we were doing so we listened to those who had done the job before us and had the experience.

What kind of music were you listening to back then?

I was and I still am a big rock-and-roll fan. When I was four years old I started listening to my two older sisters’ records and could operate the record player. I’ve extended my taste to classical music as well. I am a huge Beatles fan. I’ll never forget being at the seventh-grade sock hop and the first slow dance I ever danced to was ‘Hey Jude’ by the Beatles. I was too shy to ask any girl to dance. So a girl walked across the gym floor and asked me! It’s a long song to dance to!

Where did you end up going to college?

Dave Freeman at 18 years old.

I was set to go to Ohio State in the honors program. At the time all high school graduates were accepted at any state university. I had an excellent GPA and did well on the ACT. Then my high school girlfriend and I decided to get married a year out of high school.

We got married and I needed to work so I ended up finishing my undergrad at Franklin University in Ohio a school built around individuals who work and go to school part-time. I was seven years undergrad at Franklin and then did a weekend program at Ohio State for my MBA before finishing at Stonier Graduate School of Banking.

When did you discover that you had a calling in banking?

It was in 1975. I was getting married in August and I worked in a few different places because it was a tough economy. I was working about 36-hours a week at JC Penney when my boss told me I would be cut back to four hours a week. I walked around downtown Columbus and applied to a few places including Dollar Savings Bank. My father knew the Dollar Savings Bank’s CEO who hired me as a teller. Almost 50 years later I’m still in the business.

What caused you to fall in love with banking?

As I was successful I moved up in the ranks through promotions and by the time I was 28 I had a decent-level position and expertise in the field. To do anything else I’d have to take a step back. The forward momentum is appealing.

Overall I’ve always enjoyed the work. I enjoy the customer contact. My favorite part of the job is meeting our business customers and hearing their stories of how they’ve become successful.

Looking back over your career Dave who were the people who saw promise in you?

I had been at Dollar Savings for a few years and I was looking to move forward to branch manager. Still the fact that I didn’t have my college degree allowed others to be promoted over me. I applied for a job and was hired at Cleveland Federal. My boss Bill Dixon guided me and helped me in terms of how I should present myself and always pushed me outside of my comfort zone.

A couple of years later that branch was sold to another Savings and Loan which grew from two to nine branches in a year. I was involved in the hiring training and setup of those branches. I found that I was very good at picking the best people for the job.

What do you think Bill saw in you?

He told me that one of the reasons he interviewed me was because my application was very neat. He also liked the fact that he and I went to the same high school and did well in school. He felt that I was a smart guy who needed some polishing and that I’d learn the rest on my own.

You mentioned you were good at finding the best people for the job. What qualities were you looking for?

I looked for people who already thought of a solution if they presented you with a problem. We mainly hired people with experience at other banks so they needed to know how to get things done. Once we had one of the new branches open we would take everything we learned and apply it to the next opening. By the time we opened the seventh branch we had a well-operated system. We had no infrastructure – no facilities group of folks helping us move things – we had to figure it out on our own. That was a tremendous learning experience for me and the rest of the team because there wasn’t anyone to call on; they just left us to figure it out.

Was there anyone else who saw promise in you?

Home Savings had gone through a transition where they wanted to be more of a bank and less of a savings and loan branch. Ed McKeon came in along with Bill McNamara and they taught me the commercial banking world and business lending instead of traditional consumer-oriented savings and loan business. They were both mentors to me and when things went south at Home State they helped me get a job at Huntington National Bank.

How did you end up at QNB?

I had a saga! I went to Huntingdon Bank then Chase had bought a few savings and loans in Ohio and I worked for them for seven years before they left Ohio.

I then went to PNC in Dayton before heading to Cincinnati and Pittsburgh. I liked working for PNC but the organization is very bureaucratic and political which was not my forte. I was sort of looking for a job in some respects but also busy with work and family. I was actually in the mix for a job that my then-boss was also looking at so he turned the recruiter on to me for a different position at another bank!

I ended up working for Fulton Bank as the Division President in York. That’s when I was able to really dive back into community banking. We were also involved in the Pennsylvania Bankers Association so I had great exposure there too. I always knew I wanted to run a community bank and an opportunity came in 2010 to run QNB and here I am.

What are the immediate challenges and opportunities you’re focused on at QNB?

We have an immediate challenge of trying to find people to fill entry-level jobs at the bank. Before the pandemic we’d have a handful of jobs available and now we are looking for 10 or more spots to fill.

A long-term challenge for any community bank is how do you stay relevant to our customers. What are we doing that will make someone say I’m going to bank with you over Chase or PNC? We think we have that part figured out. We grow the number of customers we serve every month. We have a strong growth in the business side of our bank which is a place we feel we can differentiate ourselves from the other guys.

It’s a bit cliché but we offer a customer service experience that the big banks cannot by listening to our customers making discretionary decisions and solving problems. We always try to do the right thing for our customers which gives us a good reputation in the community. We get many positive reviews and referrals from our customers.

How does QNB want to be known in the marketplace?

We want to be viewed as a trusted advisor to our customers. We want to be someone they can come to find out their financial needs look out for their best interest and sell them products that are appropriate for what they want to accomplish. We think that’s even more important on our lending and investment side. That’s where we believe we can make a difference in our person-to-person interactions rather than through a machine.

What do you do with all your free time Dave?

Dave with his wife and four children

Our four kids are grown so there’s more free time now. My wife and I like to play golf together. We do a decent amount of traveling together in the United States and I try to read as much as I can.

What is the best book that you read recently?

I read everything from mysteries to novels to sports books. I’ll read it all. I’m currently reading the second book by the same author. Her name is Candace Millard. Candice has written three books all of them non-fiction about historical figures. I read the first one on Winston Churchill in South Africa. Now I’m reading River of Doubt about Teddy Roosevelt in the Amazon. Her research is thorough and very impressive. It’s impressive when you can take non-fiction and make it read like a novel.

Dave what gives you hope in a world full of doom and gloom?

I’m an optimist so I’m always a glass-half-full person. I recently read that violence is at its lowest point in history despite all the doom and gloom. I believe that the arc of history in our country mainly is actually positive. We continue to have many areas that need improvement in this country and it is good to see that we are free to have conversations allowing all points of view. My hope is people are listening!

Finally David what’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever received?

My dad and mom were strong believers in learning and doing well academically. We kids used to joke that we could get away with a few things if we got good grades.

They believed that you had to be knowledgeable about the world to be successful in this world. You need to be knowledgeable about your work and everything around your work that could affect it.

That’s been important to me. I’ve tried to stay in tune with what’s happening in our local markets the banking industry and technology. If I don’t stay aware of that I will become obsolete. Whenever I think I’ve figured it all out it usually means trouble. I need to constantly be learning and paying attention.

On Monday Friedman Real Estate announced that the company has sold the Southgate Tower a 14-story office building at 16333 Trenton Road which at the time it closed was occupied by PNC Bank.

The Farmington Hills-based company said the sale will make way for a mixed-use development opportunity that will allow for mixes of residential retail office and hotel.

The purchaser Southgate Tower LLC is committed to a project that will require a massive interior abatement demolition and rebuild project. According to Friedman Real Estate upon total build-out there will be 201 multi-family units spreading across 14 stories offering views of Detroit’s skyline and the Detroit River.

The site consists of 12.8 acres leaving room for future development which currently is not planned.

“This acquisition represents enormous opportunities for the city of Southgate and we’re excited to find the perfect ways to utilize the space and enhance this part of the city” Alex Begin of Southgate Tower LLC said in a written statement.

Mayor Joseph Kuspa was pleased with the major development in his city but said it’s a bit premature to talk about specific details. He said the project is expected to take two-and-a-half years to complete once it officially begins.

“Southgate is very fortunate to have a developer purchase the property with the vision of turning the building into residential use” Kuspa said. “This use will be market rate and not subsidized housing.”

After the sale of the vacant building was shared on social media several people inquired about fencing that went up around the building just three days after the new owner closed the sale. Kuspa clarified that this is not demolition fencing. It’s there to help secure the property.

After recent visits to the property the mayor said it was apparent that intruders have broken in. He said the fencing should prevent vandals from spraying graffiti on the outside of the building as well as keep intruders from getting inside the building.

The building contains asbestos which will need to be removed before the development can proceed. According to Kuspa asbestos is part of the material used to mend the drywall. Since the interior of the building will be demolished gutting it would disturb the asbestos which is why it will have to be removed as opposed to encapsulated.

But Kuspa said the good news is that the building is structurally sound and from the outside the facade will give it a completely new appearance.

“This could be transformational for Downriver” he said.

The Southgate Tower is the tallest building Downriver.

It’s considered to be in a desirable location as it is surrounded by national retailers Meijer Lowe’s and Kroger; as well as restaurants financial institutions and residential properties. It’s about 20 minutes south of Detroit’s Central Business District.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vc2Fwb3J0YXJlcG9ydC5jb20vbGVhZGVyc2hpcC1hdGxhbnRhcy0yMDIzLWNsYXNzLXRvLWZlYXR1cmUtbGVhZGVycy1pbi1lZHVjYXRpb24vc2VjdGlvbnMvcmVwb3J0cy9tYXJpYV9zYXBvcnRhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Leadership Atlanta's 2023 class to feature leaders in education - SaportaReport,"By Maria Saporta

Recent moves by U.S. technology giants Meta Google and Amazon to significantly beef up their presence and staffing levels in Canada have cemented the country's status as a growing hub for technology talent.

While Canada's tech boom may be welcome news for those who dream of working for these tech giants it comes at a cost for local startups which suddenly have to compete with foreign Goliaths for the country's best and brightest.

""The more companies are being created and built the more pressure there is"" said Jeremy Shaki co-founder of Lighthouse Labs a Toronto-based technology education company that offers coding boot camps and other services for people looking to level up their careers.

Shaki says it's no secret why large foreign tech firms are eager to set up shop in Canada; beyond the access to new customers Canadian universities are cranking out skilled workers at a rapid clip — and they often come at a fraction of what they would cost in places like Silicon Valley.

In late March Meta (formerly known as Facebook) announced plans to hire up to 2500 people in Toronto and in other parts of Canada while Google says it's looking to triple its workforce here. Amazon wants to hire for some 600 tech jobs.

But in pure financial terms these companies have the resources to outbid everyone else when it comes to securing the right person and that can make things difficult for local firms trying to compete.

More than just money

Ron Spreeuwenberg faces that challenge every day. He's the CEO of HiMama a software company founded in Toronto in 2013. HiMama makes software solutions for the child-care industry and employs roughly 180 people more than half of whom have been hired in the past two years.

Now boasting 10000 customers the company has expanded its hiring pool well beyond their home base of Toronto with staff across Canada and the U.S.

Canada's days of being little more than a source of cheap coders are over says Spreeuwenberg.

""I think we had a period of time where we were lucky where we could find really great quality talent at lower compensation rates"" he said in an interview. ""But people have found out about us and it made it challenging.""

WATCH | How small startups compete with the big guns:

Fighting to keep Canada's tech talent Duration 0:50 Ron Spreeuwenberg CEO of Toronto-based software company HiMama says his business is booming but it is getting harder and harder to compete with U.S. giants setting up shop in Canada because of all the technology talent here.

The biggest thing Spreeuwenberg says he hears time and again from new hires is that they want the opportunity to grow and develop their skills. ""The No. 1 reason why people choose a company or a role is what the company does and the opportunity for them in terms of learning and development and the challenge"" he said.

That said he acknowledges money helps. ""We know we're competing against companies … who certainly can afford a lot more than us when it comes to compensation.""

Spreeuwenberg says a major selling feature for recruiting would-be hires to HiMama from outside Canada is the country itself as is the opportunity to work toward the company's goal of improving childhood development.

""Those are very important for us and things that a lot of our employees care deeply about"" he said.

Meta recently announced plans to hire up to 2500 more people in Canada as part of a plan to pivot toward what is called the metaverse. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)

That desire to do good work and help solve problems is a major theme at another Canadian startup Mysa based in St. John's. Founded as a Kickstarter project in 2016 the smart thermostat company has grown from just two employees at launch to more than 100 across Canada today serving more than 150000 customers.

Just as Shopify is synonymous with Ottawa and BlackBerry is to Waterloo the 800-pound gorilla of the technology sector on the East Coast is Verafin a St. John's-based cybersecurity firm that made headlines last year when it was bought by Nasdaq for nearly $3 billion.

While not a household name in the rest of Canada Verafin's successes have shone a light on the region's booming technology sector said Mysa co-founder Joshua Green.

That means he too is dealing with the same compensation conundrum other startups face: It's hard to compete with deep-pocketed big tech.

But just as HiMama appeals to people looking to live in Toronto he's able to make a similar pitch.

""That quality of living of being able to work for a technology company while also living in a place like Newfoundland and Labrador is appealing to not everyone but a growing number of people"" Green said.

""And the No. 1 reason why I think people want to join — our mission and the purpose of why we exist as a company — is to fight climate change.""

Investment money pouring in too

The HiMamas and Mysas of the world aren't just attracting the attention of tech giants like Google Meta and Microsoft when it comes to hiring; they're also attracting U.S. investment dollars.

HiMama recently secured $70 million in funding from Boston-based private equity firm Bain Capital — a sign of just how on the radar Canada's tech ecosystem has become.

""There's a lot of interest from investors outside of Canada in Canadian companies because of the talent and the quality of the startups"" said Craig Leonard a partner with venture capital fund Graphite Ventures.

""But also they are relatively less expensive at times than some of the companies who would be built in in some of the other ecosystems [like] say in the United States.""

According to a recent report from commercial real estate firm CBRE Toronto is the third-largest technology hub in North America. Ottawa and Vancouver also rank in the top dozen well ahead of places like Austin Texas Portland Ore. and Chicago.

Though it may be hard to believe there are more tech workers in Toronto than there are in Seattle which is home to Amazon and Microsoft.

Not that long ago lower salaries would have been a major selling point for a U.S. tech company looking to establish a beachhead in Canada. But the pandemic changed things some as the shift toward virtual offices allowed Canadian companies to attract talent from around the world.

""It also levelled up the salaries and the opportunity for Canadian talent to go and work for other companies"" said Leonard.

WATCH | Tech at its best is a 'flywheel' of talent this investor says:

Canada a 'flywheel' of tech talent Duration 0:36 Craig Leonard with investment firm Graphite Ventures says the right tech ecosystem for everyone is one where companies invest in their employees to create value for them but also end up creating the next generation of companies in the process.

For Dr. Alexandra Greenhill the CEO of Vancouver-based health-care-focused artificial intelligence firm Careteam Technologies Inc. a little healthy competition is good for everyone making companies of all sizes better while also spurring on the next generation of startups.

""If we do this right it could be a very positive thing for the country"" she said in an interview. ""But if we don't do this right it can be a disaster.""

Greenhill said she recently lost a handful of great people to Amazon after it set up shop in her backyard of Vancouver and were ""offering two to three times the salary that I offer my engineers.""

While she doesn't begrudge anyone for leaving she'd like to see large rivals invest a little more in training less experienced workers as opposed to simply hoovering up a local talent pool that's been painstakingly created over time.

""We can give them all kinds of perks and interesting things to do and whatnot but the pure dollars are just completely out of our league and drive all the prices up"" she said.

Though Greenhill admits it's a constant struggle she's optimistic about Canada's tech future because she can see what's possible when the right environment is created — one that encourages foreign companies to come in and participate in the ecosystem rather than just take from it.

Technology giants including Netflix Google Amazon and Facebook (now known as Meta) have been on a hiring spree in Canada of late. (Jason Alden/Bloomberg)

She's on the board of Canada's Digital Technology Supercluster a government-led initiative seeking to fast track Canada's status as a digital hub. Greenhill says the initiative combines the carrot of government cash to fund tech projects with the stick that strings come attached to that money.

Specifically foreign tech giants wishing to participate have to invest themselves and set up roots too.

With the backing of government the supercluster initiative plays something of a convener role Greenhill said holding big tech ""accountable for their commitments and inviting them to behave like good corporate citizens.""

And instead of seeing big tech as an adversary they can help to cross-pollinate the whole ecosystem. ""They set up accelerators they become mentors they create joint projects with the local companies"" she said.

""If you get that consistent investment … it creates a flywheel effect of anchor companies that then develop that talent"" he said. ""They start companies those companies exit that talent goes back into the pool as well as investment dollars.""

Without that collaboration and long-term commitment there will be no rising tide to raise all boats.

Realestate 88 East Perth Founding Director and Licensee Jasmyn Wright said body corporate fees encompassed a variety of services.

“These fees are made up of a number of things such as building insurance lift maintenance management fees cleaning of shared zones and maintenance of areas like the swimming pools and common facilities” she said.

“If you are the owner of a strata property it is your responsibility to pay these costs.”

Along with contributing to the maintenance and upkeep of facilities and services within the complex Mont Property Business Development Manager Nicholas Cole said body corporate fees comprised two other types of levies.

“There’s general purpose which is called a sinking fund levy” he said. “This is a portion of your fee that will go towards a pool of funds and builds up over time.

“It will be for things like repainting the property potentially replacing the carpets in common areas or upgrading the lighting.

“Another is a special purpose type of levy which is for a unique issue that may arise. For example there might be a large driveway and drainage might be an issue or there are blocked drains.

“It is a one-off unprecedented cost in which you would all contribute as a group to pay off.

“It’s usually something that’s uncalled for – an out-of-the-blue cost.”

Whether you were interested in purchasing within a large residential complex or a triplex block Ms Wright said it was important for potential owners to have a firm understanding of the amount you would be paying prior to moving in.

“The costs within a complex are broken down by unit entitlements and these are set at the beginning of the development” she said. “If you have a larger apartment your unit entitlement is more than a smaller apartment and if you are on a higher level you generally have a higher entitlement.

“People need to understand why they are paying these costs and once they are aware of what it covers they are generally happy.

“The cost compared to running a large home with a pool is certainly cheaper in an apartment and you do not have to do anything – just enjoy living there without having to call someone to mow the lawn or clean the pool or do it yourself.”

Mr Cole said body corporate fees were usually paid every three months with costs starting from about $500.

“For the most basic older-style complex it will be around this amount per quarter then it grows from there” he said adding that if you are considering purchasing an apartment as an investment property it is important to weigh up the costs.

“Pools lifts electric gates – these can all be expensive to maintain as an investment.

“Sometimes it might not be the best option.

“Before you purchase a property or during the offer stage you will be provided with the strata disclosures which will highlight the particulars of the strata and includes a copy of the most recent annual general meeting disclosing the strata’s financial position both current and future.

“You should take into account the types and number of amenities there are and pay careful attention to the future works required to maintain the complex as this may affect your yearly levy repayments.”",,,,,,,,,

If the glass breaks it is engineered to not break into dangerous sharp shards. By tuning the composition and structure of automobile glass manufacturers produce a rugged safety material that provides drivers and passengers with a clear view of their surroundings while controlling the cabin temperature and acoustics as well as the vehicle’s weight and energy efficiency. But this complex engineering makes the material challenging to recycle compared with other types of glass. Companies are finding ways to overcome these challenges and reduce the environmental impact of this multibillion-dollar industry.

Earlier this year Riley Leon made headlines when he survived a tornado that flung his pickup truck across a highway. His story highlights the safety engineering that goes into automotive glass.

On March 21 Leon was driving along US Route 290 in Elgin Texas when tornado winds topping 210 km/h knocked over his pickup truck spun it round and round and eventually uprighted it. Despite the violent thrashing that heavily damaged the truck and blew out some windows Leon received little more than minor scratches. That was in part because the windshield and rear window remained intact preventing him from being ejected from the vehicle or injured by a collapsing cabin frame. Those protective features are engineered into the truck’s safety glass.

Safety is one of several design needs of glass for automobiles. The glass has to be optically clear to provide drivers and passengers with an undistorted view of their surroundings but it also needs to selectively transmit light to help drivers see clearly without squinting and to keep the interior cool on hot sunny days. It needs to be strong to resist high-speed winds and impacts from small stones during highway driving. Windshields and sunroofs in particular must be structurally rugged to support the cabin frame and prevent the roof from buckling and harming passengers during rollovers. And if the glass does break the pieces should remain in the window frame or break into small rounded chunks not large jagged shards that can cut maim or kill the occupants. The glass also must be as light as possible to maximize fuel efficiency must control the acoustics for cabin comfort and should provide various tints and colors for aesthetics and privacy.

Tailoring glass to affordably provide all these functionalities requires striking the right balance among glass properties says Thibaut Heitz director of R&D at Paris-based Saint-Gobain Sekurit a multinational glass company. To achieve this custom combination of properties glass scientists and engineers fine-tune the material’s composition and further tailor its properties through tempering chemical strengthening laminating coating and other procedures.

As a result automotive glass manufacturing is complicated. It’s also growing. Worldwide manufacturers produced an average of roughly 90 million passenger cars and commercial vehicles per year in the past 10 years according to the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers. Industry watchers predict that number will grow steadily in the next decade. As it does the global automotive glass market will also grow almost doubling from approximately $15.5 billion in 2021 to $31.1 billion in 2028 according to Fortune Business Insights a market analysis firm. The size of the market is driving recyclers to create innovative ways to reclaim waste auto glass and turn it into valuable products thereby reducing this industry’s environmental footprint. The various manufacturing steps that tailor automotive glass and provide it with a unique combination of properties present special recycling challenges but ones that the industry is working to overcome.

Glass composition

Like glass used for making bottles jars and ordinary building windows the glass found in cars trucks and buses is known as soda-lime glass. It’s the most common type and accounts for roughly 90% of all manufactured glass. The material’s main ingredients include sand as an abundant source of silica sodium carbonate (soda ash) and calcium carbonate (limestone). To form glass manufacturers blend the raw ingredients and feed them to a furnace that heats the mixture above 1500 °C forming a molten material that is shaped into bottles or other products as it cools.

Not all soda-lime glass looks alike. Glassmakers generally customize the formulation to control the color which varies by application. Beer for example often comes in brown bottles to prevent unwanted photooxidation. For some homes and art displays designers may choose brilliant colorless glass made from highly purified starting materials.

For automotive applications the soda-lime glass ingredients may also include iron oxide a tinting agent that imparts a greenish color to the glass. The tint reduces light transmission into the cabin Heitz explains. This reduction makes it easier for the driver to see the road clearly in strong sunlight. The tint also helps keep the interior cool by blocking infrared (IR) wavelengths he says. A cooler cabin leads to less demand for air conditioning which reduces fuel consumption and lowers emissions of carbon dioxide in gas- and diesel-powered cars and extends driving range in electric vehicles.

Other inorganic compounds play a similar role in controlling light transmission but they impart other tint colors. Cobalt for example provides a neutral blue-gray tint. And glassmakers often use a combination of compounds containing iron manganese and selenium to produce what the industry calls privacy glass. In addition to cutting light and heat penetration and looking elegant this dark glass which is commonly found in rear windows of sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and many luxury cars offers back-seat occupants some privacy and deters theft by keeping the car’s contents out of sight.

Coating windshields and sunroofs with metal films is a highly effective but more complex way to control light and heat in the cabin says Eric Rogers of AGC (formerly Asahi Glass) a technical expert on the company’s intellectual property. In this procedure glassmakers often sputter deposit one or more nanometer-thin layers of silver separated by layers of metal oxides such as tin oxide or titanium dioxide. The thinness of the stacks allows this optically engineered structure to strongly reflect IR wavelengths thereby minimizing cabin heating without coloring the glass silver which would sacrifice visibility Rogers says.

Tempered glass for safety

Broken glass can be fatal especially during high-speed collisions when the glass can fly into the cabin or people can be thrown against a broken window. For that reason carmakers build automobiles with two types of safety glass. Side and rear windows are generally made from specially heat-treated or tempered glass. Windshields are universally made from laminated glass which has a glass-polymer sandwich structure.

Manufacturers prepare tempered glass which has been widely used in automobiles since the 1950s by heating the glass to more than 600 °C then quenching it quickly by blasting it for just a few seconds with high-pressure cold air says Michael Richardson a technical specialist in automotive glass at General Motors. The treatment makes the glass about four times as strong as ordinary annealed (slow-cooled) window glass. If it does break tempering leaves the glass prone to shattering into many small rounded pieces with relatively few sharp edges. These fragments are less likely to cut occupants than the large jagged shards that typically form when common window glass breaks.

The cold air rapidly cools molecules at the surface locking them in place in a state of high compression which strengthens the surface says Thomas Cleary an automobile glass expert at Corning. At the same time the molecules in the hot core are slower to cool and continue to vibrate freely until they do. “That leads to a density difference that sets up a tug-of-war between molecules in the core and at the surface” Cleary says. As a result of that internal tension when tempered glass breaks it rapidly explodes into tiny pieces releasing that pent-up energy.

Laminated windshields

Car safety has evolved a lot over the years. The earliest cars didn’t have windshields. Those began appearing around 1904 but they didn’t become standard equipment until more than a decade later.

The story of laminated glass for windshields dates back to 1903 when Edouard Benedictus a French artist and chemist made an unexpected observation while working in his lab. When Benedictus accidentally knocked a glass beaker to the floor he was surprised to see that the beaker broke but the pieces of glass remained together retaining the shape of the glassware. Benedictus had been working with a solution of nitrocellulose and the solution evaporated coating the glassware with a tough film that held the glass fragments in place.

At that time automobiles were growing in popularity and injuries caused by broken glass during car collisions were on the rise. Benedictus saw a way to protect motorists by making windshields from toughened polymer-coated glass that resisted shattering and stayed in the windshield frame if it did break. After a few years of development he patented a safety-glass laminate composed of two layers of plate glass that sandwiched a film of cellulose.

By 1920 a number of companies made laminated glass for windshields and other applications but early versions of this safety glass often discolored as the plastic interlayer film aged. Glass companies and carmakers found that polyvinyl butyral (PVB) resisted discoloring and within a decade several companies began using this material to laminate windshields. As a result of worldwide safety regulations implemented since the 1960s laminated windshields are now standard everywhere and although various materials have been used as interlayers PVB remains the most common one.

The basics of PVB chemistry were identified 100 years ago according to Travis Smith president of Eastman Chemical’s films division a major supplier of PVB for laminated glass. PVB remains the top choice for windshield interlayers because of its safety characteristics and optical clarity Smith says. In addition PVB can be tailored to control acoustics block solar heating and integrate displays and other electronic devices. And importantly it can be produced economically at an industrial scale he says.

To make laminated windshields manufacturers cut sheets of soda-lime glass roughly 2.5 mm thick and shape them in a furnace to fit a car’s curved windshield frame. Then they bond the glass and PVB film in a hot pressurized vessel known as an autoclave. The procedure causes the PVB to thoroughly wet the glass surface which leads to intimate mechanical contact between the layers says Alan K. Phillips Eastman’s R&D director for films. It also drives hydrogen bonding between the layers further strengthening the laminate he says. The result is a tightly bonded tough transparent material that resists shattering by flexing on impact.

Chemical strengthening also plays a role in making windshields tough. In 2017 Ford debuted a windshield made from a laminated hybrid of ordinary soda-lime glass on the car’s exterior and a thin piece of Corning’s Gorilla Glass a chemically strengthened aluminosilicate material on the interior. Corning’s Cleary explains that the strengthening in Gorilla Glass comes from ion-exchange chemistry that causes potassium ions to replace some of the sodium ions in a thin surface layer. Potassium’s large size relative to sodium leads to compressive forces that toughen the glass surface by raising roadblocks that prevent cracks from propagating.

Before introducing the hybrid windshields Ford and Corning ran various tests simulating impact with blunt and sharp stones on the glass. It took more than twice as much impact energy to form star cracks in the hybrids as it did in conventional windshields. And because the Gorilla Glass ply in 2017 was much thinner and lighter than other types of glass the windshield’s weight was cut by about 30% nearly 7 kg for some SUVs Cleary says. Since then the glass has become even thinner and lighter which reduces fuel consumption and emissions of greenhouse gases and extends driving range in electric vehicles.

Recycling challenges

Glass can be recycled repeatedly with no loss in the quality of containers windows and other products made from it. Most glass is recycled by crushing it to form cullet removing impurities and sorting by color and then blending the cullet with sand and other raw ingredients which are melted in the furnace to make new glass. Using cullet in this way reduces glass manufacturers’ need for raw materials. It also reduces the energy required to keep the furnace at temperatures high enough to generate molten glass which lowers greenhouse gas emissions and operating costs and keeps glass prices in check. Glass recyclers process tempered window glass in much the same way as container glass—crush clean sort and ship the furnace-ready cullet to manufacturers says Mark Nelson a vice president at Strategic Materials the largest cullet supplier in the US.

But the same features that make windshields tough and safe also make them difficult to recycle. By design the glass is tightly bonded to the rubbery sheet of PVB and adheres strongly even after the glass breaks Nelson says. So even though glass recyclers process many millions of metric tons of container glass annually they have traditionally recycled very few windshields. This is especially true in the US which lags far behind many countries when it comes to recycling container glass. Broken windshields often ended up in landfills.

Andela Products is a company that has developed one way to pry the materials apart. Cynthia Andela president and CEO of the company describes the method as based on a hammer-and-chisel-like approach. Equipment beats the windshield from both sides simultaneously—repeatedly and at high speed fracturing the glass and mechanically peeling it from the PVB. The stripping process yields millimeter-sized cullet and larger pieces of PVB.

Nearly all glassmakers use cullet to manufacture new products so the reclaimed windshield glass is readily recycled. What about the PVB? Shark Solutions based in Denmark is one of a handful of companies that processes broken windshields and recycles the film. The company which also operates in the US and Belgium purifies the PVB and converts it to pellets and water-based dispersions. Manufacturers use those materials to make carpet backing binders for paints adhesives fabric coatings and other industrial products.

“Interest in recycling windshields has really grown in the past few years” Andela says. People are focused on sustainability and reducing the volume of material sent to landfills. They see opportunities to recycle windshields into useful materials she says.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In Loving Memory ~

It is with very heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Michael (Mike) Robert Procter 79 of 150 Mile House BC on February 6 2024.

In North Vancouver BC Mike was the first of three children born to Mary and Peter Procter. Mike grew up in Williams Lake BC after the family moved there in 1951.

After graduating school he followed in his father's footsteps by becoming an Electrician. Working for his father's company Procter Electric he worked throughout the Cariboo-Chilcotin and Mike and his father were instrumental in creating novel systems to generate electricity at remote ranches and locations throughout the region.

He moved on to working in the industrial sector and became highly skilled in his trade. High in demand he worked in the construction of new sawmills and in various plants all throughout BC. Later he worked at several local sawmills and contracted throughout the area.

Over all those years Mike made many friendships that endured for the rest of his life.

He went on to marry Cheryl Midnight and they had two children Chris and Jody.

Mike had a penchant for fast cars nice trucks and fine guns. He enjoyed hunting fishing and classic car restoration. He traveled to horse shows throughout BC AB and briefly the US winning many trophies with their champion Arabian show horse Star-Sirza.

In the mid-80's Mike met his life partner Betty Johnson and in the 90's they settled in the 150 Mile area. Mike and 2 good friends purchased the 150 Mile Hotel a rich piece of history in the Cariboo. Together they revived it into the 150 Mile Roadhouse & Pub. For years the establishment was a notable and lively gathering place where many good times were had.

Mike was a hardworking generous man who was always willing to help his friends and family.

He had a great sense of humour he was always up to something and he was entertaining to be around. Throughout his life he was fortunate to have made many friends many acquaintances and to have many great stories to tell. Mike will be sorely missed by his family and friends.

Mike was predeceased by his parents Mary and Peter and his stepfather John Ailport.

He is survived by his life partner Betty brother Chris (Sherri) sister Andrea son Chris (Jenica) daughter Jody (Joey) stepson Bryan (Dawn) three nieces (Susie Mia and Alison) five grandchildren (Jayden Utah Talon Pyper and Keyfer) and many friends.

Mike wished for his ashes to be spread at his favorite mule deer hunting spot a beautiful area overlooking the Fraser River.

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Specifically plant-based organic and holistic foods that heal are red-hot. Shoppers are demanding high-quality ingredients that are ethically sourced and packed with vitamins and nutrients. Food entrepreneur Lauren Watkins explains how her company Etobicoke Ontario-based PuraVida Foods is stepping up to meet the expectations of grocery shoppers looking for nutritionally superior food.

Progressive Grocer: Lauren why did you decide to become a food entrepreneur?

Lauren Watkins: Well my background is actually in psychology but the job that I ended up getting right out of school was selling food selling ingredients. And I didn’t necessarily love sales initially but as the role grew and as I grew I realized that I was really passionate about selling high-quality ingredients that helped customers build better meals. I grew up in a household of medical professionals. Both of my parents worked at a hospital for sick children in Toronto and pretty much every night we would talk about health and the importance of not only eating nutritious food but also being proactive with healthy choices. So when I started working in the food industry I really opened my eyes to the quality of ingredients that manufacturers use.

PG: You started reading labels more carefully?

LW: Yes I started looking at ingredient decks nutrition fact panels and seeing what the food I was eating on a daily basis was made of. And a lot of the things that I thought were healthy were packed full of preservatives and things with really complicated names that I wouldn’t even try to pronounce. These were foods that I thought were healthy that were labeled as being healthy and good for me but were not. So that is really what sparked the idea of PuraVida.

PG: How did you come up with the name “PuraVida”?

LW: A lot of work went into designing the brand and I wanted it to be something that people really connected with. I am not only passionate about health but also passionate about our planet and being connected to the whole process. I love being outside which is kind of where the little leaf on the logo came from. We wanted our logo to speak to what we do and that we’re connected to the ingredients that we source. We’re connected to the vendors that we work with. And a lot goes into our packaging. We look at how we can differentiate ourselves with our formulations. We make many revisions to make sure that sodium levels carb levels and the ingredients that we use do something good for the body.

PG: What would you say is the most challenging part of what you’re doing now?

LW: Well the feedback that we get from our customers has been great. I would say retail’s very different from what I used to do before. I’m very used to someone reaching out to me and saying “I need 80000 pounds of black beans tomorrow” and I would quickly plug it in. But in retail people plan the freezer case months in advance. There’s a lot that goes into the buyer planning and obviously everyone wants to feel connected to what products they put on the shelf. So that’s very different from what I used to do before because it was very fast-paced.

PG: I know that part of your mission is to educate consumers on “the power of food.” What does that statement mean?

LW: Food can send different signals to our bodies and can tell us to make muscle and can tell us to feed our brains and can help us combat and prevent disease. But on the flip side of it food can also send negative signals to our bodies and can tell us to not repair or be as efficient with bodily functions [as] we would expect. And so those things can appear in different ways. We can feel sluggish we can be bloated we can lack the energy or the enthusiasm that we would normally have. And so it’s about helping people not necessarily drastically change their diets because that’s not sustainable in the long term but helping people eat more vegetables or try something new that’s maybe presented in a different way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN5Y2xlbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNC9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjItaS03MC1oYWxmLW1pbGUtYW1lcmljYW4tZmxhdC10cmFjay1yZXN1bHRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 I-70 Half-Mile American Flat Track Results,"Cycle News Staff | April 24 2022

Mees Edges Bauman in Spectacular Inaugural I-70 Half-Mile

Progressive American Flat Track superstar Jared Mees (No. 1 Indian Motorcycle/Progressive Insurance FTR750) added to his legend in a thrilling inaugural I-70 Half-Mile presented by Indian Motorcycle of Kansas City on Saturday evening in Odessa Missouri.

The Kansas City-area fans who waited 17 years plus one long day of largely inclement weather to see the world’s greatest motorcycle dirt track racers do battle were rewarded for their patience with an instant classic featuring the Mission SuperTwins presented by S&S Cycle class’ modern-day titans.

Briar Bauman (No. 3 Indian Motorcycle/Progressive Insurance FTR750) powered into the lead at the start followed closely by JD Beach (No. 95 Estenson Racing Yamaha MT-07 DT). Mees didn’t waste any time dispatching Beach to prevent Bauman from getting any thoughts of running away out front and then used that momentum to rail his way into the lead for good measure.

Bauman seemed happy enough to let Mees lead; he spent the bulk of the race sizing his rival up and trying out some lines in advance of the inevitable late-race confrontation.

And Bauman’s studies nearly paid off with a win. In the race’s final laps he attempted inside and outside maneuvers pulling up alongside Mees more than once. However his final shot was foiled as Mees expertly positioned a lapper between them in the race’s final corner providing Bauman no realistic path to steal away the victory at the flag.

As a result I-70 Motorsports Park stands as the 32nd venue conquered by Mees tying him with the iconic Chris Carr for most in premier-class history.

“What a day” Mees said. “Mother Nature actually played a good hand for the racetrack for us. Thankfully we got the racing in before the next storm came in. These races that are quick with just one round of qualifying and right into a Main Event are hectic. You’ve got to be on point from word go.

“What a hectic Main Event with Briar. I felt him breathing down my neck the entire time. A track like this makes for a lot of tiny little mistakes but everybody has their fair share of them and we stuck it out and got to the checkered flag first.”

Despite enjoying a quick start Beach was also ultimately overhauled by Brandon Robinson (No. 44 Mission Roof Systems Indian FTR750) and Dallas Daniels (No. 32 Estenson Racing Yamaha MT-07 DT) before ending his slide in fifth.

Once through Robinson teased the potential to turn the race into a three-way affair before finally settling into third to secure his first podium of the ‘22 season.

Daniels came home fourth which means the heralded rookie stands as the only rider other than two-time champion Bauman to have finished fourth or better in every race this season.

Bronson Bauman (No. 37 Latus Motors Racing Harley-Davidson XG750R) finished sixth followed by Mission Production Twins Challenge entry Jesse Janisch (No. 33 Vance & Hines Harley-Davidson XG750R). Together the two ensured that a pair of Harley-Davidson XG750Rs would finish inside the top seven alongside the three Indians and two Yamahas ahead of them.

The talented Davis Fisher (No. 67 Bob Lanphere’s BMC Racing Indian FTR750) Jarod Vanderkooi (No. 20 Mission Roof Systems Indian FTR750) and Brandon Price (No. 92 Briggsauto.com/Martin Trucking Indian FTR750) finished eighth ninth and tenth respectively underlining the depth of talent in the field this season.

Mission Production Twins presented by Vance & Hines

Jesse Janisch (No. 33 Vance & Hines Harley-Davidson XG750R) took his Texas frustrations out on the field in the form of outright dominance of the evening’s Mission Production Twins presented by Vance & Hines. The Vance & Hines pilot stormed to the front off the line and effectively removed all doubt within a matter of laps.

While Janisch established order at the front the remainder of the positions shook out behind him in a manner more akin to chaos.

Ben Lowe (No. 25 Helipower Racing/Mission Foods Harley-Davidson XG750R) who topped the opening practice by nearly a half-second was removed from podium contention early with a mechanical issue. In his absence the young and aggressive trio of Billy Ross (No. 109 Mission Foods/Roof Systems Kawasaki Ninja 650) Kolby Carlile (No. 36 KC36 Las Vegas Harley-Davidson XG750R) and Cole Zabala (No. 51 Memphis Shades/Corbin/Vinson Yamaha MT-07) threw haymakers at one another in their scrap for second.

Despite a smoking machine Ross made a late escape and appeared to have the runner-up position all locked up… That is until his ailing bike finally expired with less than a minute remaining on the clock. To add to the late-race drama Zabala and Carlile suffered massive crashes in quick succession with just over a lap left to be run.

That development forced an early end to the contest while remaking the podium rather significantly.

In the race’s early stages Janisch seemed primed to make huge strides in the standings following his 14th-place result in Fort Worth with title leaders Nick Armstrong (No. 60 Competitive Racing Frames/Lessley Brothers Yamaha MT-07) and Cory Texter (No. 1 G&G Racing/Yamaha Racing Yamaha MT-07) mired down at the tail-end of the top ten.

It didn’t turn out that way however as the two kept their heads down and quietly fought their way up the order. And by the time the red flag concluded their charge Armstrong and Texter found themselves in second and third respectively.

Texter only narrowly earned that spot on the box edging fourth-placed Jeremiah Duffy (No. 42 Sammy O Racing/Arai Helmets Kawasaki Ninja 650) by 0.087 seconds with fifth-placed Jordan Harris (No. 77 Roy Built/S&J Coal Mine Kawasaki Ninja 650) another 0.319 seconds back.

Parts Unlimited AFT Singles presented by KICKER

Minutes before Mees pulled off the same feat it was actually Kody Kopp (No. 12 Red Bull KTM Factory Racing 450 SX-FFE) who became the first repeat winner of the Progressive AFT season when he took the checkered flag in the Parts Unlimited AFT Singles presented by KICKER Main Event.

And as with Mees the achievement didn’t come easily. The race began precisely as the previous Parts Unlimited AFT Singles showdown ended – with Kopp draped all over Morgen Mischler (No. 13 American Honda/Progressive Insurance CRF450R) and searching for a way past and into the lead.

This time however he managed to pull it off. Kopp showed a wheel on the inside several times before the two finally circulated the D-shaped oval side-by-side. A bobble on Mischler’s part allowed Kopp to seal the overtake and provided the rising star a clear run to victory.

However Kopp’s decorated teammate Max Whale (No. 18 Red Bull KTM Factory Racing 450 SX-FFE) nearly had a say in that. The Aussie swallowed up Mischler after coming from well back and then tried to do the same to his young KTM stablemate simply running out of time as he continues to seek his first win of the year.

“I’m feeling really good” Kopp said. “Hats off to my entire Red Bull KTM team. We put a ton of work in this offseason and I think it’s showing to start the season. It was clean racing out there and I couldn’t be happier to pull off our second win.”

Mischler held on for third while Trevor Brunner (No. 21 Estenson Racing Yamaha YZ450F) and James Ott (No. 19 MediaHT/G&G Racing KTM 450 SX-F) completed the top five.

The I-70 Half-Mile will premiere on FS1 on Sunday May 1 at 10:00 a.m. ET/7:00 a.m. PT. including exclusive features cutting-edge aerial drone and onboard footage and expert commentary.

Let the family know you are thinking of them

Janet Deforge

Burlington - After a courageous battle with COPD and small cell lung cancer Janet passed away on Sunday April 3rd 2022. Jan was born on December 4th 1947 in Burlington. She graduated from Winooski High School in 1965. She worked at General Electric Vermont Photocopy Villanti & Sons Printers Inc and retired from Progressive Insurance.

Janet was predeceased by her parents Victor and Priscilla Deforge and her brother Richard Deforge Sr.

Jan is survived by her sisters Carol Redmond Gloria Deforge (Skip Ambrose) Anita Bessette (Alan) her nephew Jason Deforge and niece Jennifer Torres (George) a great niece Seraphina Torres and nephew Richard Deforge Jr (Greta) niece Laurie Deforge and special cousins Gary Patty and Christopher Clairmont.

Janet enjoyed family gatherings knitting and crocheting lounging around the pool and watching Hallmark movies. She was president of Union St. Jean-Baptiste for several years. Janet will be greatly missed by family and friends.

Jan's Funeral will be held on Saturday April 23rd at 11:00 am at St. Francis Xavier Church. There will be a gathering directly after the burial. In lieu of flowers donations can be made to St. Francis Xavier Church or the American Lung Association.

Arrangements are under the care of Champlain Cremation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdHJpYnVuZW9ubGluZW5nLmNvbS9vYmEtYWRleWVtaS13YXMtYS11bmlmaWVyLWEtcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUtYXdvbG93by1mYW1pbHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oba Adeyemi was a unifier a progressive — Awolowo family,"The family of the sage Chief Obafemi Awolowo has described the demise of the Alaafin of Oyo Oba Lamidi Adeyemi as sad describing him as a unifier and a progressive.

In a statement by Dr Olatokunbo Awolowo Dosumu on Saturday the family said the news came as a shock.

According to the statement: “The news of the Alaafin of Oyo Oba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi III joining his ancestors has come as a shock to us. He was a great Oba who brought respectability to the stool bequeathed to him by his fathers.

Oba Adeyemi used the entire 52 years he spent on the throne of Oyo building bridges of friendship across all divides. He was a unifier in words and in deed. He was a progressive and a philosopher king. He worked so hard to mould his ancient kingdom into a modern town and was always available to speak for the people when occasion demanded.

Everyone who ever interacted with him knew his worth as a great repository of history culture and tradition of his people. Oyo town has lost a father and a king; Yorubaland has lost a leader and Nigeria has lost a patriot and a nationalist.

We pray for the repose of his soul while we commiserate with his family the government and people of Oyo State on this monumental loss. God Almighty will look after all he left behind.

Investing for the long haul is a long-proven way to build wealth and patience is well-rewarded for those who pick well and let great companies take care of their businesses and their investors.

Heck if you had put $10000 in the S&P 500 say 20 years ago and let it run that stake would have returned a cool $58940 counting dividends and share price gain through that metric known as total return.

And if you'd rather choose individual equities you don't have to chase growth stocks with all their volatility. You can go slow and steady and just buy stocks in companies that do warehouses office buildings and shopping centers.

Here are three real estate investment trusts (REITs) that do just that and each has soundly beaten the S&P 500 over the past two decades while providing respectable dividend yields along the way.

Prologis the warehouse behemoth

Prologis (PLD 2.95%) is not just the biggest of industrial REITs; by market cap it's the largest of the more than 225 publicly traded REITs. Behind that current valuation of about $128 billion is a portfolio of nearly a billion square feet of critical warehouse and distribution space serving 5500 customers from about 4700 facilities in 19 countries.

While on a particularly hot streak like any other major owner of property in the very hot logistics space San Francisco-based Prologis also has a long record of rewarding shareholders providing a total return over the past 20 years of 1140% more than twice that of the S&P 500. It's raised its dividend for nine straight years too and is currently yielding about 1.83%.

Long-term demand for consumer e-commerce and business-to-business space doesn't appear to be abating and Prologis looks to keep growing its share continuing its internal expansion while reports circulate of possible acquisitions in Europe.

Alexandria Real Estate Equities does offices but not just any offices

Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE -0.13%) provides office and laboratory space to many of the biggest names in the biopharma business including the new Moderna headquarters near Boston.

This office REIT now has a market cap of about $33 billion has been around since the 1990s and concentrates its business in collaborative campus clusters in its hometown of San Diego and in and around San Francisco Seattle New York City North Carolina's Research Triangle and the Washington D.C. area.

Alexandria has been steadily growing for a long time and has seen increased momentum as demand grew for its current space -- and anything more it could develop -- during the pandemic. That can be expected to help the company continue a streak of 12 years of dividend increases that are rewarding shareholders with a current yield of about 2.29%.

Federal Realty Investment Trust is a Dividend King

Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT 0.95%) is a retail REIT a somewhat battered sector in which to find a Dividend King. That means it's one of about 30 members of the S&P 500 that have raised its dividend for 50 straight years.

For Federal Realty make that 54 years giving this Bethesda Maryland-based proprietor of high-quality retail-based properties the longest such record among all REITs.

The company currently has a portfolio of about 104 properties mostly in desirable areas in the Boston San Francisco Los Angeles and Washington D.C. markets. With a market cap of just shy of $10 billion this REIT is the smallest of the three here but its slow and steady performance through good times and bad stands it well for the future and currently pays shareholders a yield of about 3.50%.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The roadmap outlines plans to introduce operational risk standards by 2024 and tentatively crypto asset requirements and stored value facility standards by 2025. APRA also announced that it would be looking at “possible approaches to the prudential regulation of payment stablecoins among others”.

Need For Due Diligence and Risk Assessments

APRA which supervises Australian banking insurance and superannuation institutions stressed the need for due diligence and risk assessments in a letter from chairman Wayne Byres.

In the letter APRA specifies that regulated entities:

consider the principles and requirements of prudential standards when relying on a third party in conducting activities involving crypto assets; and

apply clear accountabilities and relevant reporting to the board on the key risks associated with new ventures.

Financial Watchdog Also Bares Its Teeth

Along with APRA’s prescription the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) – the country’s financial watchdog – released its own set of guidelines on preventing the criminal abuse of digital currencies.

This follows a statement released late last year by AUSTRAC in which it directed Australian banks to adopt better systems to deal with assessing risk rather than simply debanking customers. “Businesses vulnerable to exploitation should not automatically have their accounts closed simply to avoid managing risk” AUSTRAC said at the time.

And in July 2021 the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) set out a range of proposals relating to the inclusion of cryptos in exchange-traded products (ETPs) seeking market participants’ input to shape its position within the regulatory landscape.

Dorice Mwaka Mwakwekwe filed a liquidation petition on March 17 which was gazetted on Friday without giving details of her claim.

Xplico Insurance has been facing a tough operating environment and ran afoul of the regulator after the company failed to disclose its entire financials for the fourth quarter ended December 2021.

The firm has also seen a decline in business over the last year besides boardroom wrangles over ownership.

“Notice is given that a petition for the liquidation of the above-mentioned company by the High Court was on 17th March 2022 presented to the said court by Dorice Mwaka Mwakwekwe and the said petition is directed to be heard before the High Court sitting at Malindi on the 9th June 2022” the notice on Kenya Gazette reads.

“Any creditor or contributory of the said company desirous to support or oppose the making of an order on the said petition may appear at the time of hearing in person or by his advocate for that purpose and a copy of the petition will be furnished by the undersigned to any creditor or contributory of the said company.”

Xplico Insurance has seen a decline in business over the last year besides boardroom wrangles over ownership lasting nearly a decade.

In the third quarter public service vehicle owners ditched the company shrinking its market share in the category by almost two-thirds from 21.9 percent to 7.5 percent.

Biggest gainer

The biggest gainer of the slump at Xplico was Directline Insurance which rose to control 69.6 percent of the market by September.

By the fourth quarter Xplico had the most customer complaints at 26 indicating the firm's failure to settle customer claims on time.",,,,,,,,,

In an average day she is of course an administrator. But she is also a photographer tech support guru special events coordinator social media influencer logistics manager counselor furniture mover art curator and even resident elf or cupid depending on the holiday. In short Jaeger is a problem-solver and general spreader of happiness throughout the building.

“On this campus we have fun. We are positive. And we are kind” Jaeger said. “As long as we can laugh at ourselves we have had a good day.”

At the time she began working at PTC in December 2013 Jaeger had little higher education experience but came with a mighty will to make things work. She brought to campus 19 years of experience working at a long-term care facility as an activity director and later as staffing director. Taking on managing the Newberry Campus was daunting in the beginning.

One of her first challenges was keeping track of classroom workspace and auditorium reservations using a room grid of the building.

“It looks like a huge Tetris puzzle” she said. “It was a big stressor. I’m thankful that I never double-booked a room.”

As she settled into the job (there is no such thing as a “routine” day) Jaeger widened her scope to address the friendliness and warmth of the campus. She had seen a mural painted by local artist Robert Matheson for a city Juneteenth event and wanted to share it with students. PTC Maintenance Technician Brian Hare knew the artist so Jaeger asked him to make an inquiry. Next thing you know the mural is on display in the campus’s front lobby. But it nearly took a village to make it happen. The mural wouldn’t fit in a car or standard truck.

“We eventually had to rent a U-Haul to transport the mural because it is so big” noted the plucky logistics/transportation manager for a day.

Jaeger works hard to offer engaging activities for students such as a Black History Month trivia contest Valentine exchange traveling art shows and even a Free Little Library Box in front of the building. An especially inspired event was “Blind Date with a Book” in which forgotten library books that are rarely checked out were giftwrapped and presented on a table for people to borrow. Participants seemed to really enjoy it.

“I get all my ideas from Pinterest. I am not that creative” she said humbly. “I want the students to want to be here. I want them to have fun when they are here.”

Jaeger lives in Newberry with her husband Mike and daughters Kindel 14 and Mallorie 21. For Jaeger a conversation about family is not complete without mention of fur babies Holly a mixed-breed rescue dog and Bluebell a bluetick hound. Last November the family lost their beloved beagle Kiki and her loss remains palpable. The screen saver on her computer is a family photo with Kiki just before she passed away. She tears up at the memory.

“I am a sentimental fool” she said.

Her fondness for animals especially dogs is no secret to the veterinary technology faculty on campus. Jaeger has audited their classes many times and on her birthday they presented her with an honorary vet tech lab coat.

In her spare time Jaeger enjoys quilting and spending time with her active family. They participate in Crossfit together and her younger daughter even competes.

Jaeger is grateful for the outstanding people she works with and is quick to give credit when it’s due. She noted that Dean of Off-Campus Academic Affairs Lisa Toland and Academic Services Coordinator Ashley Boone are indispensable members of her winning team.

“There is no way one person can do this” she insisted. “You have got to have a good team.”

These days Jaeger is somewhat of a “campus whisperer” for whom no job is too small.

“If it needs to be done I will do it or learn how to do it. That is kind of what I stand on” she said. “I don’t have all the answers but I have no qualms about finding the people who do. We have a wonderful wealth of knowledge at PTC. It’s a wonderful family.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB0Y3B1bmphYmkuY28uaW4vZ29vZ2xlLWRvb2RsZS1jZWxlYnJhdGVzLW5hemloYS1zYWxpbS1hbGwteW91LW5lZWQtdG8ta25vdy1hYm91dC1pcmFxcy1jb250ZW1wb3JhcnktcGFpbnRlctIBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB0Y3B1bmphYmkuY28uaW4vYW1wL2dvb2dsZS1kb29kbGUtY2VsZWJyYXRlcy1uYXppaGEtc2FsaW0tYWxsLXlvdS1uZWVkLXRvLWtub3ctYWJvdXQtaXJhcXMtY29udGVtcG9yYXJ5LXBhaW50ZXI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google Doodle Celebrates Naziha Salim: All you need to know about Iraq's contemporary painter,"Google Doodle Celebrates Naziha Salim: All you need to know about Iraq's contemporary painter

Google Doodle Celebrates Naziha Salim: All you need to know about Iraq's contemporary painter

Google Doodle Celebrates Naziha Salim: On April 23 the Google Doodle paid tribute to Iraqi painter Naziha Salim who was a pioneer in the profession. She was known for her paintings that depicted rural life. Salim's painting style and dedication to the arts are honoured in today's doodle. Salim with a brush and her work which has long focused on rural Iraqi women are combined in the doodle.

Salim's work was featured in the Barjeel Art Foundation's collection of works by female artists which is situated in the United Arab Emirates. In the year 1927 Salim was born in Turkey. Artists were her parents. Jawad her younger brother is a well-known Iraqi sculptor.

Salim’s Early Life

Salim studied art and graduated with honours from the Baghdad Fine Arts Institute. She was one of the first women to be offered a scholarship to attend the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris as a reward of her hard work and dedication for art.

Salim refined her fresco and mural painting skills in Paris. She went on to spend many years after graduation studying art and culture in other parts of the world.

Why Goggle is celebrating Naziha Salim today?

Ms. Salim was featured in the Barjeel Art Foundation's famous collection of female artists on this day in 2020. Jalal Talabani Iraq's former president famously referred to her as ""the first Iraqi woman who anchored the pillars of Iraqi contemporary art.""

The artist who was also a lecturer and an author was recognised for portraying rural Iraqi ladies and peasant life in her paintings. Her work also concentrated on family especially her own and working women.

Ms. Salim with her brush is depicted on one side of the doodle while a variety of her artwork subjects is depicted on the other.

The directive from company president Genevieve Sigmund was to develop a facility that could capitalize on demographic shifts within the Bay Area where many residents have been leaving San Francisco in search of more affordable markets.

The resulting Storelocal facility at 10 Hegenberger Court is designed to do just that. Well-positioned along Interstate 880 and just minutes from the Oakland Coliseum and Oakland International Airport the four-story asset comprises 112000 rentable square feet in about 1100 units. But it didn’t come into existence without its share of challenges. Let’s take a closer look at the details including specific obstacles faced and how Platinum overcame them.

Site Selection

Of the parcels for sale in the area this site is just about perfect thanks to the heavily traveled Hegenberger Road a major east-west arterial that carries the bulk of traffic to and from the airport and has on and off ramps for the 880 Nimitz Freeway. The 1.87-acre parcel literally abuts the freeway with 294 lineal feet of frontage. It provides the best kind of visibility for self-storage plus very desirable traffic volume along nearby streets and freeways.

The site contained an old single-story industrial building that needed to be demolished but that isn’t unusual for an infill project in an established area. Once the offer for the property was accepted the design and development process was quickly underway.

Design Process

Platinum hired my architectural firm to handle the design and land-use entitlement process. As is often the case in large cities this development required a conditional-use permit and conformance with the California Environmental Quality Act to establish and allow self-storage as a use.

Initial design work began in January 2016. Various site studies were completed to evaluate site efficiency and eventually ownership approved a final design with a building footprint of 39133 square feet and four floors. Development calculations included lot coverage of 48.3% and a 1.91 floor-area ratio which is the building size in square feet divided by the site area. Given the somewhat irregular shape of the parcel the numbers were quite good and proved that the land-use efficiency would be financially viable.

Vehicle access would be from Hegenberger Road and a short distance along Hegenberger Court. The exterior that greets visitors is a large inviting glass façade with a 2000-square-foot office facing the street.

Standard self-storage materials were studied but the project proceeded with an unconventional II-A construction type necessary to achieve the four stories. Primary components include a concrete-block first floor and steel-tube post-and-beam construction on the upper three floors. Exterior finishes include a combination of smooth metal panels and stucco. To take advantage of so much visibility from the freeway the design also incorporates large upper-story windows that display colorful roll-up “show” doors. This is a popular design in self-storage today as it makes the purpose of the building clear.

The final design contains 1087 self-storage units ranging in size from 5-by-5 to 10-by-30 square feet. A neutral color scheme of light and dark grey was chosen to provide a complementary background to the colorful lime-green unit doors.

City Review Process

Oakland is a large city and the design-review process involved many sub-departments in addition to the standard planning department. Fire engineering and building reviews took several months to complete but the conditional-use permit was eventually approved by way of a public hearing in December 2016.

Large cities have may ordinances that affect building and in this case the standard battles regarding development fees took quite a while to straighten out. Self-storage projects tend to get hit hard with fee assessments due to their large building area even though their direct impact on city services such as water and power is low and they have low traffic generation and parking demand. Still this 154535-square-foot building triggered mitigation fees that added up to more than $1 million. This was in addition to the standard plan check and building-permit fees. Thankfully Platinum and its consultants were able to negotiate the amount down to a reasonable figure.

Once that was settled the building-permit process began. The first plan-check submission was made in July 2017; however the complex city process took several months longer than expected. The permit was eventually approved in August 2019.

During the plan-check process the project received bids from several qualified general contractors with experience in self-storage. Initial cost estimates were higher than expected which necessitated value engineering to reduce construction costs. This helped substantially. The project permits were obtained in October 2019 once the building- and grading-permit fees were paid.

Construction Phase

As soon as site grading began it was discovered that the soil had been contaminated by a previous industrial user. Exporting polluted soil and importing a clean replacement is difficult in enough but the fact that this site is in a densely developed area complicated matters further. There were also site-drainage issues connected to the wet winter weather common to Northern California. Both caused a slow start to construction.

On top of these delays the project faced restrictions stemming from COVID-19 as well as supply shortages for materials and labor. During the initial phases of the pandemic self-storage wasn’t considered “essential construction” by the state and the city’s building department stopped all inspection work causing a six-week delay. The general contractor invested a lot of time and effort to set up an in-house COVID-management expert who could help them meet the state’s requirements. This continued even after the construction restrictions were lifted.

Pandemic-related protocols at city hall greatly increased the time it took to review and approve construction items. For example approval of the subcontractor’s fire-sprinkler plans took 12 months delaying all work on that part of the project. Concurrently the fire department took 18 months to approve the fire-alarm system causing further interruptions. Shortages on labor and building materials hit the latter stages of construction.

Much of the work had to be done out of sequence as materials and labor became available. Ultimately the original construction timeline had to be extended from 18 months to more than two years. Despite all these challenges the general contractor and development team worked through them creatively. The project received its first occupancy permit in March allowing occupancy of the office and first floor. As of this writing delays in elevator deliveries and inspections were still being resolved with full occupancy expected shortly.

Outlook

As someone who’s been in the self-storage industry since 1983 I’ve never seen a project with greater construction-phase challenges. One of my favorite sayings is “All the easy ones have been done.” This probably isn’t entirely true but there’s no doubt that developing a well-located well-designed self-storage facility in a desirable area is worth the battle. The occupancy projections at this Storelocal site are very strong and the project will undoubtedly be very successful.

No injuries were reported and the cause of the blaze at the Public Storage self-storage facility at 3440 South Carrollton Ave. remains under investigation. But an NOFD official said firefighters arrived at 8:16 p.m. to find an open storage unit with a car burning inside.

Crews quickly saw the fire had already spread to adjacent storage units on both sides and above the unit housing the burning car. A second alarm was sounded at 8:32 p.m. as crews forced their way into other units using axes and heavy-duty circular saws.

As with the recent Feb. 16 three-alarm fire at a different self-storage facility in Algiers (video below) firefighters struggled to find room to work Saturday’s blaze as it spread through spaces in common walls and ceilings of storage units densely packed with vehicles furniture boxes and personal belongings.

NOFD spokesman Capt. Edwin Holmes said a third alarm was sounded at 9:50 p.m. as firefighters worked to suppress the “labor-intensive” fire. Southbound traffic on Carrollton Avenue was detoured for a time at the 3300 block to accommodate fire hoses and the 19 NOFD units brought to bear on the blaze.

The fire finally was deemed under control at 10:46 p.m. though personnel remained on the scene for several hours more mitigating the contents of each storage unit involved and using thermal-imaging camera to detect smoldering fires that lingered behind walls and ceilings.

Since then city staff have explored less expensive options and water storage alternatives to increase efficiency in water operations. At its April 14 meeting the Public Works Commission recommended the installation of reservoir management systems (RMS) at the city’s three largest reservoirs that would allow them to operate at higher levels with consistent water quality. Instead of a costly reservoir at the Cabrillo site staff recommended a $14.2 million project with a .3-million-gallon pump station forebay a move that would add redundant fire services to the hillside areas increase emergency water storage and make the city less dependent on the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. The City Council will provide further direction regarding how to best utilize and fund the Cabrillo Reservoir at its priority setting meeting on April 26.

“Every day we don’t proceed on adding storage is rolling the dice in my opinion” Public Works Commission Chair Charles Alpert said. “Whether it’s a fire whether it’s an earthquake whether it’s a terrorist situation who knows what the world brings to our door and I don’t think we have enough reservoir as is. I think the RMS system is good. I don’t think it’s the most we can do. And I think that’s what I think we should recommend to Council.”

The city owns a property on Monte Cielo Court that houses a small pump station serving the upper zones in Beverly Hills. According to staff the 15-year-old pump station has reached the end of its useful life and the proposed forebay option at Cabrillo would replace it. The new pump station would provide operational flexibility and facilitate greater water distribution capacity when moving water from lower zones to upper zones. While the Cabrillo Reservoir originally constructed in 1918 is not currently operational the city collects raw natural spring water formed there to help irrigate ornamental grass on the Sunset Boulevard medium.

Technically a forebay is not a reservoir. “That is just a section tank that feeds the pump station” Vince Damasse the city’s Water Resources Manager said. “The pump station has to take water from something from a volume of water and it’s just a suction to the pump station.” Part of the proposed project will have a dedicated transmission main that will go from Cabrillo to upper hillside zones providing fire flow. Due to the depth of the forebay the site work and construction costs associated with demolishing the reservoir and building the pump station is $8.2 million.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy52YWxkb3N0YWRhaWx5dGltZXMuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWxfbmV3cy9yaWNoYXJkcy1idXNpbmVzcy1hYm91dC10b3duL2FydGljbGVfMjgwNmRmZDQtOWUzMi01MTExLTg0YmQtMTQ5MjFjMTU3NzcxLmh0bWzSAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudmFsZG9zdGFkYWlseXRpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsX25ld3MvcmljaGFyZHMtYnVzaW5lc3MtYWJvdXQtdG93bi9hcnRpY2xlXzI4MDZkZmQ0LTllMzItNTExMS04NGJkLTE0OTIxYzE1Nzc3MS5hbXAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RICHARDS: Business About Town,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.valdostadailytimes.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/local_news/richards-business-about-town/article_2806dfd4-9e32-5111-84bd-14921c157771.html (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000019829F19AB0>, 'Connection to www.valdostadailytimes.com timed out.

NATCHEZ — Big changes are coming to the Natchez Mall including a long-term renewal by Belk of its lease.

Evan Smith asset manager for AZT Corporation said the mall’s owner Tabani Natchez Mall would be redeveloping the site into a more traditional outdoor shopping center.

Designs are being finalized now by Natchez architect Johnny Waycaster and work will begin as soon as the designs are complete. The re-envisioned shopping destination will have a new and updated look and feel Smith said.

“It is going to have a brand new façade. All of the tenants will be accessible from the parking lot” Smith said.

Belk has committed to a new eight-year lease agreement.

“Along with the façade improvement Belk will be getting a significant facelift at their entrances” he said.

Also Smith said mall officials are working to reopen the movie theater at the mall.

“We are in negotiations right now with a theater operator. Hopefully we can get something signed soon so that we can have a theater again in Natchez” he said.

The change in development also includes plans for self-storage facilities for some of what is now interior mall space. Those plans are not complete Smith said but the self-storage operation will not be visible from the front of the mall.

The Natchez Mall is about 40 years old and Tabani Natchez Mall L.P. has owned the mall for the last 20 years.

The renovation will be multi-phase endeavor Smith said. Phase One of the project which includes interior modifications to Belk and exterior modifications to the Belk storefront façade has begun.

“We are really excited to be able to re-envision the mall to serve customers for decades to come and give them an updated shopping experience” Smith said."

Design and display

You’d be hard-pressed to differentiate between the Pixel 5a and the Pixel 4a 5G at first glance. Both come with a punch hole tucked away at the top left corner. The design of the rear camera module and the cameras themselves are identical. You also get a rear-mounted capacitive fingerprint scanner and a headphone jack with the two affordable Pixels. See also: The best Google Pixel 5a cases you can get

The differences between them are barely noticeable. The Pixel 5a’s display is 0.1 inches bigger and the phone is a touch thicker than the 4a 5G because of its larger battery.

It's nearly impossible to differentiate between the two phones at first glance.

However one big difference is immediately evident as soon as you pick up the two phones. The Pixel 5a comes with a metal unibody build that’s more premium than the plastic body of its predecessor. It also keeps the soft-touch coating from the Pixel 5 that adds to the grip. The Pixel 5a is also noticeably heavier than the 4a 5G because of its metal build.

Jimmy Westenberg / Android Authority

The Google Pixel 5a is the first of the line to come with an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance. It’s not something you’ll easily find in this price range and is definitely a welcome addition.

The display and viewing experience are identical across the board. Both phones come with Full HD+ displays with a 60Hz refresh rate and Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The Pixel 5a’s screen is a little larger but not enough to make a significant difference. Both are solid OLED displays and even though a higher refresh rate would have been nice there’s not much else to complain about here.

Hardware and cameras

David Imel / Android Authority

The similarities continue in the hardware section. Both phones are powered by the capable Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G chipset backed by 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. With the same hardware and identical software experience there shouldn’t be a huge difference in performance. That said the Pixel 5a soundly beat the 4a 5G in our testing and matched the Pixel 5.

The battery is the only major upgrade in terms of hardware. Google packs a much larger 4680mAh battery into the Pixel 5a compared to the 3880mAh unit of the 4a 5G. In our review we were quite impressed with the Pixel 4a 5G’s six hours of screen-on time but the 5a has it soundly beat. Our very own Jimmy Westenberg managed to get more than eight hours of screen-on time with fairly heavy usage and ended most days with close to 60% of battery left.

Another hardware difference is in 5G support. The Google Pixel 5a will only work with sub-6GHz networks while you can get a version of the 4a 5G that supports mmWave networks. The limited scale of mmWave makes it hard to take seriously so this omission might not be a huge deal.

Moving on to the cameras we get identical hardware once again. Both phones come with a 12.2MP primary shooter and a 16MP ultra-wide lens along with an 8MP selfie camera. Nothing has really changed as far as the camera performance goes. You’ll get excellent photos with both and they are still among the best smartphone cameras around. The whole thing is getting a little dated though so it was exciting to see the camera upgrades that accompanied the Pixel 6 series.

Price and colors Google Pixel 5a: $449

$449 Google Pixel 4a 5G: $499 / €499 / £499 The Google Pixel 5a is another testament to Google’s commitment to relatively affordable pricing. Given the general similarities and extras like an IP rating it’s surprising to see that the Pixel 5a is $50 cheaper than the 4a 5G.

The 5a is available in Mostly Black which almost looks green in the right lighting. You get two options with the Pixel 4a 5G — Clearly White and Just Black. However the 4a 5G is hard to come by right now. It’s out of stock on the Google Store and Best Buy and only the Clearly White version is available on Amazon.

Google Pixel 5a Water resistance comes to the Pixel A-series Google's Pixel 5a offers a few quality-of-life upgrades over its previous devices that may make you want to join Team Pixel. It has a metal unibody design an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance and a battery that just won't quit. See price at Amazon Save $54.00

Google Pixel 4a 5G The Google Pixel 4a 5G is a value-oriented phone made for people who don’t want or need a flashy high-end phone. Like the Pixel 4a the 4a 5G model’s strong points are its cameras smooth software and rock-solid update policy. See price at Amazon Save $63.00

Google Pixel 5a vs Pixel 4a 5G: Which should you buy?

Jimmy Westenberg / Android Authority

If you already have the Pixel 4a 5G you don’t need to upgrade to the 5a. Yes it comes with a few useful extras but it’s basically the same phone at its core. You won’t see a huge difference in performance the camera performance is identical you get the same software experience and they even look the same. This is as iterative an update as it gets. So unless something like water resistance is an absolute must-have the 4a 5G is definitely good enough.

This is as iterative an update as it gets.

However if you’re undecided between the two the choice is obvious. While both phones are identical in terms of hardware the Pixel 5a comes with a more premium build dust and water resistance and a larger battery. It’s also cheaper. Availability might be an issue though. The 5a is only launching in the US and Japan while you can get the 4a 5G in a handful of European markets as well.

Is it worth upgrading from the Pixel 4a 5G to the Pixel 5a? 1242 votes Yes 25 % No 75 %

Most of these smartphones run on Qualcomm and MediaTek chipsets and because of a security vulnerability in an audio format over 67 percent of Android smartphones were at a big risk of security attack.

Even though the vulnerability was fixed with a patch last year millions of Android smartphone could have fallen prey to the problem putting them in danger.

All these details have been given by researchers at Check Point Research this week. Its researchers discovered the problem via the Apple Lossless Audio Codec or ALAC that Apple opened up to non-Apple devices to offer lossless music quality for streaming.

Folks at Check Point Research mentioned that using the vulnerability in ALAC files attackers could deliver a remote code execution (RCE) attack on the device. Such an attack is capable of letting the attacker access your smartphone’s camera and even infect any media file with a malware that can leave the gates open for further intrusion.

Check Point Research added that the smartphones powered by MediaTek and Qualcomm somehow ported the ALAC vulnerability into their audio decoders. Both these chipset makers have a 48.1 per cent and 47 per cent market share respectively which makes them the ideal target for the attackers.

The security issue was discovered by Slava Makkaveev along with Netanel Ben Simon who mentioned the threat was serious and easily allow the attackers to see everyone on the affected smartphone.

The smartphone has been through a lot of leaks and certifications and we now know plenty of details about the device. In the article we’ll do a roundup of all the details learned so far about the POCO F4 GT.

Design and Display

For starters the POCO F4 GT will be nothing but a rebranded version of the Redmi K50G a.k.a K50 Gaming that launched a few months back in the home market China. That said the specifications of the phone will be similar.

The Indian version of the POCO F4 GT carries the model number 21121210G. Since it will be a gaming phone it will feature some graphical patterns on the back. It will have a camera island that has an “X” shaped theme and the same will be seen on the entire back. The LED flash on the phone will be placed in an actual flash-like cutting. It will also come with shoulder trigger buttons on the right spine. Just like the K50G the F4 GT is expected to have a metallic frame and feature an AG Glass finish on the back.

The smartphone is expected to come with a 6.67-inch OLED display with Full-HD+ resolution. It will have a 120Hz refresh rate and a 480Hz touch sampling rate. The screen is expected to come with support for HDR10+ and have a DCI-P3 color gamut.

Cameras on the POCO F4 GT

The POCO F4 GT will come with a triple camera system at the back. The sensors will be placed onto the fancy camera island which as said above will have an “X” shaped theme to it.

The camera setup will go by a 64MP Sony IMX686 main sensor an 8MP ultra-wide lens with 120-degree FoV and lastly a 2MP macro unit. On the front it will have a 20MP Sony IMX596 sensor and is expected to come with Xiaomi’s AI beautification features and filters.

Hardware and Software

One of the major highlights of the POCO F4 GT will be the hardware. The smartphone was spotted on Geekbench recently and as you’d expect the device tapped the impressive 3555 number on multi-core and 1235 points on the single-core test. All thanks to the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC inside the phone.

The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 for those unaware is an octa-core chipset based on Qualcomm’s 4nm node. It has four cores clocked @1.79GHz three cores with a clock speed of @2.60Ghz and the last core clocked @3.00GHz.

The smartphone will come with 8GB/12GB of LPDDR5 RAM and 128GB/256GB of UFS 3.1 internal storage. It is also expected to come with dual second-generation stainless steel vapor chambers with a total area of 4860mm². Just like the K50G it is expected to have a graphene heat spreader. It will come with shoulder trigger buttons that will be helpful for gamers.

Fueling the system will be a 4700mAh battery with fast charging support. We can expect it to come with a 120W fast charging technology that will fully charge the phone in less than 17 minutes. Apart from this you can expect connectivity features like Wi-Fi 6E Bluetooth v5.2 and dual-SIM support with 5G connectivity. Lastly it will come with Android 12 OS out of the box with POCO skin above MIUI 13.

Pricing Colors and Availability

The POCO F4 GT’s pricing isn’t tipped yet but considering that it arrived at a starting price of CNY 3299 (roughly Rs. 38900/ $515) in China we can safely expect it to start above Rs. 40000/$525 in India.

The phone is expected to launch in Black Blue Silver and even in a Mercedes AMG-themed edition. However the chances of it coming in the Mercedes special edition in India are pretty thin. After the release it is expected to be on sale in the next few days.

Here customers were received at the door by perfumed shirtless young models with the physique of Greek gods – incarnations of the rich white athletic young men at the center of the US company’s then marketing strategy with which it built an empire of basic t-shirts and sweatshirts emblazoned with their logo.

How the brand got there and what happened next is revealed in the Netflix documentary White Hot: The Rise and Fall of Abercrombie & Fitch created and directed by Alison Klayman.

As Washington Post critic Robin Givhan tells the camera: “What Abercrombie did was create a middle ground between the sex being sold by Calvin Klein sold and the posh American style of Ralph Lauren.” Givhan is joined by former employees of the brand – its models and sales clerks – as well as journalists and activists who have closely followed its trajectory over the late 1990s and early 2000s when it emerged as a pop phenomenon advertised by half-naked Adonis types in print media and on billboards and of course inside the stores. With windows closed to the outside anyone drawn to the party lights and disco music inside was forced to enter to find out what was going on.

The architect of the A&F aesthetic was photographer Bruce Weber who had worked at the time for brands such as Calvin Klein. Guys hammering biceps hanging from a tree guys doing push-ups in unexpected places half-naked guys having a great time.

Anyone who was paying attention would see that there were a lot of gay men involved in defining that aesthetic says journalist Benoit Denizet-Lewis. “But it was done in a way that went unnoticed by the target audience the typical cool straight college guy.”

“Bruce Weber wasn’t the first to recreate these homoerotic pretty-boy scenes that date back to Ancient Greece” he says. “But that fashion and definition of masculinity caught on with gay guys in the late 90s.”

When asked what the brand was looking to sell the documentary’s interviewees inevitably say “class” helped by the company’s 1996 IPO that put it on Wall Street. In an early prototype of today’s hustle culture where the boundaries between work and life are barely discernible A&F built a giant campus in Ohio where workers trained in pilot models of the stores and meetings merged with regular parties and team outings.

The bubble burst when customers started to question what A&F was selling and how they were selling it. It turned out that not all their target audience in the US was exactly as they had profiled it that is Caucasian and affluent. Customers began to flag the racist nature of some of the slogans on those basic t-shirts and it became clear that many of the brand’s potential consumers were members of racialized communities. The matter came to a head after the release of an A&F advertising campaign for a t-shirt bearing the slogan “The Wongs make everything white” featuring two Asian men in a laundromat.

The homoerotic aesthetic that served as inspiration for Abercrombie & Fitch.

Asian-American students protested on the doorsteps of stores across the country and Abercrombie not only withdrew the t-shirts but CEO Mike Jeffries who took the helm of the company in 1992 and spearheaded the brand’s frat-boy marketing strategy made sure that every single one of the offensive items was set on fire.

Still it was clear the company had a bigger problem than just that one t-shirt design and advertising campaign as other racist prints remained on sale such as a shirt depicting a donkey wearing a Mexican hat and eating a taco with the epithet “eating on the street is cool.”

Indeed the problem was structural and started with its stores. Recruits for floor staff were according to a company manual to have “clean clean-cut hairstyles” while other styles such as dreadlocks were “unacceptable.”

Reports began to emerge of former employees being told things like “we can’t hire you back because we already have too many Filipinos working in the store” while one store’s only Black worker was always put on the night-time cleaning shift so that they would not be in public view. In the early 2000s some A&F store workers filed a class-action lawsuit for racial discrimination which they won.

Despite the ruling which showed that Abercrombie & Fitch had violated the US Civil Rights Act of 1964 the company never acknowledged that they had been racially discriminatory. Their response instead was to hire a chief diversity officer working under the supervision of an external agent who would arbitrate on inclusion and they began to hire racialized people in its stores. Within five years the non-white workforce was 53% a dramatic shift from a workforce where 90% of staff were white.

Mike Jeffries former CEO of Abercrombie & Fitch.

Whiteness still continued to dominate the company’s management and public-facing activities. Black and brown recruits worked mostly in the backroom and warehouses while floor staff and models were still mostly white and white men accounted for most administration and management roles.

While this was going on in 2006 the company’s CEO Mike Jeffries made the following statement which journalist Benoit Denizet-Lewis published in Salon: “In every school there are the cool and popular kids and then there are the not-so-cool kids. Candidly we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don’t belong [in our clothes] and they can’t belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely. ""

In 2009 sales had already fallen considerably in the US by 17% but this did not stop the brand – which also included the Hollister brand – under the same aspirational model from continuing to open its famous flagship stores full of shirtless young men in low-waisted jeans and sandals all over Europe: in Spain it opened in Madrid in 2011 – and closed in 2021.

Activist Ben O’Keefe came across Jeffries’ statements in 2013. Noting how little the brand had changed over seven years O’Keefe started a petition demanding that Abercrombie & Fitch include more diverse sizing.

“If 60% of your potential customers wear plus sizes why not include them?” said O’Keefe whose petition turned into a boycott by young people in rejection of the narrow body image it promoted. The activist was invited to A&F’s offices to present the complaint along with experts and representatives of organizations working with people with eating disorders and to consider ways the company could change.

Mike Jeffries did not show up for that meeting. He resigned from his position a year later in 2014 and disappeared from the map.

Now helmed by Fran Horowitz Abercrombie & Fitch has continued to struggle with its identity as young people continue to turn their backs on brands associated with racism and sexism. A report published by UniDays last March showed that 87% of its ”Generation Z” respondents believe there should be greater gender equality and inclusion in fashion.

Meanwhile allegations continue about inappropriate behavior within the company over the years. In 2020 photographer Bruce Weber was acquitted of charges of sexual abuse. He faced trial for the same reasons in 2021 and the case was settled out of court. The former owner of A&F’s parent company L Brands Les Wexner has also been accused of collaborating with Jeffrey Epstein putting the pedophile in contact with young models to invite to his parties. Now vanished from public life Mike Jeffries lives on as the representative of everything that the fashion of today is under pressure to reject.

At the end of the documentary critic Robin Givhan reflects that “the Abercrombie story is basically an incredible indictment of what our culture was like just 10 years ago. It was a culture that enthusiastically embraced a white upper-class view of the world ... that defined beauty as ‘thin white young’ and was okay with excluding others.”

Asked if the culture has completely solved the problem of exclusion though the critic replies: “No.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Larry Adam interview - Sohn'X TLV ( Sinai Dudfur )

The shake-up on Wall Street is in full swing investors are looking for direction amid the tangle of uncertainty over the war in Ukraine and inflation across the Western world but a conversation with Larry Adam Chief Investment Officer at Raymond James can inspire optimism even in those who are gripped by fear. “It's true the S&P 500 has fallen 14% from its peak but historically when there is a 10%-20% drop the market tends to recoup these losses in about five months provided no recession begins and I do not think we are facing a recession. Therefore the U.S. stock market will rise again by the end of the year and even return to a point that will be close to its historic high"" Adam told Calcalist in an exclusive interview as part of the Sohn’X Tel Aviv Investment Conference which is taking place for the second year in collaboration with Calcalist. The conference includes remote interviews with speakers from the world's largest and leading investment bodies.

The conference which will benefit Silent Angels the Israeli Rett Syndrome Association will include six events hosting leading global investors the first five to be held online and the sixth to be held in-person in June.

Advocate Shmulik Zisman founder of Silent Angels said ""My daughter Hadar was diagnosed with Rett Syndrome when she was two and a half years old. It was the hardest day of my life. A quick Internet search revealed that girls with Rett Syndrome will eventually reach the condition of one hundred percent disability and death in their teenage years. I look at her such a beautiful girl like any other girl. But it turns out that there was a cruel and destructive mutation in her genes.""

Zisman added that ""one in 10000 girls is born with Rett Syndrome regardless of race or ethnicity. The syndrome is not inherited and can happen to any family in the world. The Israel Rett Syndrome Association works in collaboration with its corresponding organization in the United States. Over the years we have been able to cure model animals and we are very close to clinical trials in genetic therapy for the girls themselves.""

According to Dan Gillerman former Israeli ambassador to the UN chairman of Blackstone Israel and chairman of the conference: “Sohn’X TLV is unique in that it allows participants to succeed and at the same time also contribute to the society"" Gillerman said. ""You will succeed by learning listening and receiving enriching information from the best people in the field and you will contribute to society by donating all the proceeds to an organization that is active in finding a cure for Rett Syndrome.""2(סי

We asked Larry Adam: Aren’t you afraid of the impact of the war in Ukraine and the rise in energy prices that is hurting a lot of companies?

""No. The invasion began on February 24 and if you look at the market's performance now it's already looking beyond the unfortunate events. The S&P 500 has risen more than 8% since then. Many people would expect international stock markets to go down. They went down but they made up for their losses. The bond yields went down in search of protection and now they are 40-50 basis points higher than they were on the day of the invasion. Gold also returned to a price of less than $2000 an ounce. My point is that in many cases when there are events of this kind there is an automatic response to them but over time these reactions tend to pass and the market has started to rise especially the capital markets.""

What about the Fed's rising interest rate route the second event affecting investors. How many more raises beyond that of March are you anticipating?

""That's the big question for the market right now. It's very important to see how quickly expectations have changed about what the Federal Reserve plans to do this year. If you recall late last summer there was no expectation that interest rates would rise this year and now the expectation is for nine raises this year and three more times next year. That is we will move from the situation we are in now where the interest rate is 0.25% to 3%. I think it's too aggressive and the interest rate will only go up to 2-2.25%. There are two reasons: the first is that if you go back to 1980 in each of the interest rate tightening cycles one after the other the next peak in the interest rate was lower and lower. If you examine this trend it will bring you to this number of 2-2.25%. The second thing we rely on is the fact that the U.S. economy and in fact the global economy has become much more sensitive to interest rates than in the past. Here in the U.S. for example mortgage rates have risen to 5% corporate bond yields mainly from smaller companies are higher than 6% and these are things that could slow down the economy. Another reason for our lower interest rate forecast has to do with supply chains where we see early signs of relief. The amount of cargo and shipments that have accumulated is decreasing delivery times are decreasing inventory levels are now as they were before the pandemic and as a result of all this a decrease in transport prices is beginning both by sea and by land.""

What do you think about commodity prices? Do you think that even there the hardest part is already behind us?

“The longer they stay high the higher the likelihood of a recession starting. When it comes to energy prices specifically we think oil prices have probably already peaked. As time goes on if there is a ceasefire of some kind or a peace agreement oil prices will return to the $90-95 a barrel level. However there is no doubt that this is not a return to the level below $80 that we saw before the crisis in Ukraine because a large part of the sanctions on Russia will probably remain in force even after any ceasefire that is formed. When it comes to agricultural commodities that's a different story. And I think this is a very important time of year when for example Ukrainian farmers have to sow their crops because if they do not it could lead to more shortages in commodities like wheat since Ukraine is Europe's 'breadbasket'.”

Overall you are quite optimistic even though investors are troubled by signs of an impending recession such as the reversal of the yield curve that usually heralds this.

""We respect what the yield curve signals and in the last six recessions there has been a reversal before but we are not bothered by it. A yellow flag has been raised over the U.S. economy but the economy needs to be examined in depth and all the indicators we tend to look at show that the economy continues to be strong. I really like the index of withholding tax because it shows the tax payments of the companies on a weekly basis. These are higher today than ever before and growing at a rate of 20% per year this shows that the labor market is healthy and more importantly that the American consumer will have money to spend. Another interesting index is our real-time mobility index which examines hotel room bookings restaurant reservations and airport activity. There is a jump in everyone of those and this means that consumers are becoming more active and consuming more. Against the background of all this we expect the American economy to grow by 2.5% this year after lowering the previous forecast of 3.5% following the war between Russia and Ukraine.""

Returning to the war and sanctions to what extent will the cessation of activity in Russia affect American companies and how will this be reflected in the financial statements?

""We will see updates from companies regarding the impact of events in Russia but it is worth remembering that most companies in the S&P 500 have relatively low exposure to Russia and Ukraine so I do not expect a significant impact. What's more if there's a quarter where you can talk about these effects without bearing the consequences from investors it's this quarter. I think that in addition the upcoming reporting season will be quite good including in the high-tech sector which has been hit harder on the stock market in recent months.""

In conclusion what are your recommendations for an investment portfolio in a tumultuous 2022?

“We still prefer stocks over bonds within stocks we prefer the U.S. and within the U.S. the more cyclical sectors like energy finance and industry. Our more defensive sector is healthcare. At the international level we are optimistic about Asia because with the end of the closures in China growth will continue to be rapid and inflation in Asia is less aggressive than the rest of the world which gives the central banks there more flexibility. In our estimation China may even lower interest rates.""

Support Silent Angels:

Rett syndrome is a non-hereditary neuro-developmental disorder that occurs mainly in girls (about one in 10000 girls’ births). The syndrome is characterized by normal development in the early stages of life followed by a variety of disorders: loss of speech loss of hands use walking disorders irregular breathing and indigestion. Despite the difficulties they face girls with Rett syndrome have smart and expressive eyes. They make contact with their surroundings with their eyes. They are active vital and full of joy of life and for this reason they are fondly called around the world “Silent Angels”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbXBhYmF5LmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvYnVjcy8yMDIyLzA0LzI0L25mbC1yZWNlaXZlci10YW1wYS1uYXRpdmUtYnlyb24tcHJpbmdsZS1hcnJlc3RlZC1pbi1wYXNjby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NFL receiver Tampa native Byron Pringle arrested in Pasco,"Bears receiver and Robinson High alumnus Byron Pringle was arrested Saturday in Wesley Chapel and faces misdemeanor charges of reckless driving and driving with a suspended license according to Pasco County court records.

Pringle 28 appeared to have been doing a doughnut on a road in a 2016 Dodge Challenger with a child and an adult male passenger in the car the Chicago Tribune reported citing a Florida Highway Patrol report. An officer pulled Pringle over. A check on Pringle’s license revealed it was suspended in February for “financial responsibility” the report said.

Hillsborough County court records show that as of February Pringle had not paid a citation for running a red light in Tampa two months earlier.

Pringle then ignored an officer’s command to leave the car and “became verbally confrontational” the report said.

Pringle signed with the Bears last month after spending four seasons with the Chiefs where he won a Super Bowl and appeared in another the loss to the Bucs at Raymond James Stadium.

A Bears spokesman told the Tribune the team was aware of the arrest but didn’t have further comment.

In 46 career games Pringle has caught 67 passes for 898 yards and seven touchdowns. He’s also a valuable special-teams contributor with 37 kickoff returns for 986 yards and another score.

Pringle had off-the-field problems at Robinson. He was arrested in August 2019 and faced seven felony charges in an alleged spree that included accusations of car burglaries armed robbery and firing a BB gun at pedestrians. Pringle admitted to firing a BB gun and was sentenced to four years of probation.

That was the collective question that rippled through the PC enthusiast crowd when the RTX 3090 Ti was originally announced. Nvidia already had the best graphics card you could buy with the RTX 3090 and the spec sheet suggested that it was nothing more than a marketing ploy.

But Gigabyte’s GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Gaming OC proves that assumption wrong. Don’t get me wrong — it’s monstrously large absurdly expensive and ungodly power-hungry. But if you’re on a quest to unlock the highest performance possible out of a gaming PC this is the graphics card you’ve always wanted.

Specs and pricing

The Gigabyte RTX 3090 Ti Gaming OC falls in line with Gigabyte’s previous offerings in this range. You’re looking at a slight 2.4% increase in the max boost clock speed over the reference design which is a small but notable difference. Otherwise the difference comes down to the cooler and size.

Gigabyte RTX 3090 Ti Gaming OC RTX 3090 Ti reference RTX 3090 reference CUDA cores 10752 10752 10496 Boost clock 1905MHz 1860MHz 1695MHz Memory 24GB GDDR6X 24GB GDDR6X 24GB GDDR6X Memory bus 384-bit 384-bit 384-bit Effective bandwidth 1008 GB/s 1008 GB/s 936.2 GB/s Interface PCIe 4.0 x16 PCIe 4.0 x16 PCIe 4.0 x16 Size (LxWxH) 331mm x 150mm x 70mm 336mm x 140mm x 61mm 336mm x 140mm x 61mm TDP 450W 450W 350W Recommended PSU 850W 850W 750W

It’s a comically large graphics card  clocking in at 10mm wider and 9mm thicker than even Nvidia’s massive reference design. Gigabyte puts the space to good use with three 100mm fans and an extended heat sink which allows air to pass straight through the cooling apparatus beyond the PCB and backplate.

Performant as it is the Gigabyte RTX 3090 Ti Gaming OC doesn’t look great. It’s flat black which is made all the worse considering this is the only RTX 3090 Ti design Gigabyte offers (even from its Aorus brand).

It’s not sleek; it’s boring. This card could look great in certain builds but I imagine most gamers will opt for something like the EVGA FTW3 or MSI Suprim X editions simply because they’re flashier.

The main difference is price. Gigabyte’s model sells for as low as $2000 while models like the EVGA FTW3 Ultra climb closer to $2200. That’s the range for new in-stock cards however. Now $200 is $200 but it’s not a huge difference considering how much the RTX 3090 Ti costs.

For the RTX 3090 Ti overall it’s one hungry graphics card . It has about a 10% boost in clock speed over the base model along with a slight bump to core count and memory frequency. That comes with a staggering 100-watt overhead bringing the TDP up to 450W.

Nvidia only recommends an 850W power supply which is a little concerning. I wouldn’t use the RTX 3090 Ti with anything less than a 1000W PSU (read our roundup of the best PC power supplies if you need an upgrade).

Gaming

The RTX 3090 Ti is shockingly good for gaming and Gigabyte’s Gaming OC edition pushes it even further. Overall the card was 9.8% faster in my benchmarks over the RTX 3090 reference design and a full 13.2% faster than the RTX 3080 Ti at 4K with Ultra settings. If you want the gritty details you can see my full results in the table below.

I ran all of my tests with a Core i9-10900K and 32GB of DDR4-3200 memory. I only included results at 4K here because let’s be honest you’re not buying an RTX 3090 Ti to not play at 4K . Still I was surprised to see a difference in some games even at 1080p including a 8.5% boost in Red Dead Redemption 2 and 7.2% increase in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla.

The RTX 3090 Ti cements itself as the most powerful GPU you can buy.

Clearly the RTX 3090 Ti hits a gaming mark that the RTX 3090 didn’t. For over a year now I’ve been pushing gamers toward the RTX 3080 Ti over the RTX 3090 because it’s much cheaper and performs about the same. The RTX 3090 Ti especially Gigabyte’s Gaming OC variant makes a compelling argument to buy a flagship for gaming.

RTX 3090 Ti RTX 3090 3DMark Time Spy 19848 18341 Red Dead Redemption 2 84 fps 77 fps Fortnite 86 fps 69 fps Assassin’s Creed Valhalla 72 fps 63 fps Forza Horizon 4 147 fps 158 fps Cyberpunk 2077 49 fps 46 fps Cyberpunk 2077 w/ RT 24 fps 21 fps

Getting down to specifics the RTX 3090 Ti offered a sizable boost in performance over the RTX 3090 in all of my tests except Forza Horizon 4. Across resolutions the RTX 3090 consistently outperformed its more expensive Ti variant here.

Even so the RTX 3090 Ti is remarkable. It’s the first card to crack 70 frames per second (fps) in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and it even got close to 60 fps in Cyberpunk 2077 with everything maxed out.

That performance scaled with ray tracing turned on offering a massive 14% increase in Cyberpunk 2077 over the base model. You would want to turn on Nvidia’s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) but this demanding test shows how the RTX 3090 Ti can still offer real benefits in games.

That was my main concern — the RTX 3090 is already a card made for professionals not gamers so I figured the Ti model wouldn’t offer a big boost. It does. That 10% boost in clock speed translates into about a 10% boost in games far outpacing the competition and cementing the RTX 3090 Ti as the most powerful GPU you can buy.

Content creation

I focused less on content creation benchmarks because the RTX 3090 is already the champion here. Frankly 24GB of RAM and Nvidia’s proprietary rendering technologies dominate the industry so I focused mainly on a stressful GPU workload through Blender to see how the Ti model would scale.

RTX 3090 Ti RTX 3090 PugetBench for Premiere Pro – GPU score 92.7 93.1 Blender Classroom 1691 1394 Blender Monster 2962 2826 Blender Junkshop 1467 1615

Across the three renders in Blender’s 3.0 Open Data benchmark the RTX 3090 Ti was about 5% faster. That’s a solid increase if you’re solely focused on GPU-bound workloads but my results from PugetBench for Premiere Pro show that the Ti model may not offer a boost across applications.

For professionals who are counting the seconds for renders to finish the RTX 3090 Ti is the right pick. Even a 5% boost could represent thousands of dollars. For hobbyist creators who still want an extremely powerful GPU the RTX 3090 is a great option. It may be trumped by the RTX 3090 Ti occasionally but your CPU and RAM will generally play a larger role in performance than when you’re gaming.

Power and thermals

Gigabyte’s RTX 3090 Ti Gaming OC is a thermal performer. I played about an hour of Cyberpunk 2077 at 4K with all of the sliders turned up (including ray tracing ). I had DLSS set to Auto just so the game was playable but even then the card was pinned at 100% utilization any time I wasn’t in a menu.

My clock speeds are a testament to Gigabyte’s cooling solution.

The card peaked at 69 degrees Celsius which isn’t bad. It’s actually impressive considering the card sucked down as much as 429W while I was playing and that the fan speed never exceeded 68%. The card was never loud enough to be distracting and I’m happy to see so much headroom even when the card is nearing its power limit.

What was more interesting in this test was my clock speed. My card boosted up to 2025MHz which is 125MHz above the max boost clock listed by Gigabyte. If nothing else this further shows how pinned that card was during my run Cyberpunk 2077 and it’s a testament to Gigabyte’s cooling solution.

The Gaming OC model has a BIOS toggle that offers the default OC mode or a silent mode. I kept the card in OC mode for my tests but the silent mode is a good option if you don’t need the extra heft. It’s particularly useful in games like League of Legends or Valorant where you’re not stressing the GPU as much and don’t want the extra noise.

Our take

The Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Gaming OC is a monster of a GPU and it comes with all of the hallmarks of peak performance in 2022. It draws an absolutely insane amount of power and it can get fairly hot. But it manages to offset that with tangible gains in performance even over the RTX 3090.

Are there any alternatives?

Yes the RTX 3090 is a solid alternative for content creators who don’t need the best of the best. If you’re a gamer and can’t swing the RTX 3090 Ti I’d recommend going down to the RTX 3080 Ti for the best balance of price and performance.

How long will it last?

The RTX 3090 Ti is the most powerful GPU you can currently buy so it should last several years. If you’re in the market for this type of flagship you’ll probably upgrade your GPU long before the RTX 3090 Ti becomes obsolete.

Should you buy it?

Yes even if you don’t need to. The RTX 3090 Ti is the best-performing GPU I’ve tested but it’s important to remember that flagship options aren’t always necessary.

NVIDIA AD102 without PCIe Gen5 support?

Kopite7Kimi a reliable leaker covering NVIDIA hardware confirmed today that the next-generation AD102 GPU does not have PCIe Gen5 interface.

For now it’s just a rumor but if this was true then GeForce RTX 40 series would not be a bottleneck for next-gen desktop systems. The AD102 GPU would simply not support any faster interface. Right now only Intel Alder Lake supports PCI Express 5.0 but around the same time NVIDIA is expected to introduce Ada GPU series AMD is also preparing its Ryzen 7000 “Raphael” platform which more than likely already has Gen5 support.

The “Ada Lovelace” architecture which is set to launch by the end of this year was rumored to feature PCIe Gen5 interface support mainly because it already has the Intel ATX 3.0/PCIe Gen5 spec 16-pin connector unlocking up to 600W of power per cable.

PCIe Gen4 — kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) April 24 2022

The rumor about lack of Gen5 support are especially surprising considering that back in March this year NVIDIA introduced Hopper architecture which was the first GPU architecture to officially support PCIe Gen5. This is how NVIDIA described the new standard for its data-center H100 accelerator:

PCIe Gen 5 provides 128 GB/sec total bandwidth (64 GB/sec in each direction) compared to 64 GB/sec total bandwidth (32GB/sec in each direction) in Gen 4 PCIe. PCIe Gen 5 enables H100 to interface with the highest performing x86 CPUs and SmartNICs or data processing units (DPUs).

Furthermore Kopite mentioned that the structure of the single-precision (FP32) core configuration might not be as simple as Ampere’s. One should not rule out that the CUDA core count will not change again with the new generation of GeForce RTX series. A matrix of different integer and floating-point FP32 units might increase the number of cores compute power or introduce a new core type altogether. It is simply too early to tell.

NVIDIA usually keeps GPU architecture details under a closed lid even until the very last moment. In fact when GA102 GPU launched many board partners had no clue that FP32 core count was to double. We were still finding wrong core count in official data sheets and product descriptions for many days after launch.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 'AD102 GPU' Graphics Cards To Retain PCIe Gen 4.0 Compliancy

NVIDIA will be launching its GeForce RTX 40 series graphics cards based on the brand new Ada Lovelace GPU architecture later this year. The specifications and specific configurations for the graphics card lineup have already been leaked but the design of the card themselves is a more interesting aspect.

PCIe Gen4 — kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) April 24 2022

So far we know that the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 series graphics cards will adopt the new ATX 3.0 compliant 12PVHPWR 16-pin connector which allows for up to 600W of power draw through a new PCIe Gen 5 power connector interface. This power connector has already been featured on the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti graphics card and currently allows for up to 450W of power draw through a triple 8-pin adapter. But there's another aspect to allow the full PCIe Gen 5.0 compliance and that's the interface connector itself.

Currently modern graphics cards communicate to the CPU through the PCIe Gen 4.0 protocol. The PCIe Gen 4.0 protocol allows for 64 GB/s of total and 32 GB/s of bi-directional bandwidth. But the latest platforms from Intel and AMD support the brand new PCIe Gen 5.0 interface protocol. This new standard allows for up to 128 GB/s of total and 64 GB/s of bi-directional bandwidth. This will essentially double the bandwidth but it looks like upcoming graphics cards or at least the high-end GeForce RTX 40 graphics cards based on the AD102 GPU won't feature PCIe Gen 5.0 interface just yet.

Based on a tweet from Kopite7kimi the upcoming GeForce RTX 40 lineup will retain the PCIe Gen 4.0 protocol which is a bold move by NVIDIA for not hopping on the next-gen standard even though they are doing so in the HPC segment where their Hopper GPU will be amongst the first to utilize the new protocol. Now it makes sense that the HPC lineup features it because servers require a lot of bandwidth and the Gen 5.0 protocol will help those environments. As for consumers the PCIe Gen 5.0 interface is just too much bandwidth and current GPUs are yet to fully stature the PCIe Gen 4.0 interface.

Now having PCIe Gen 4.0 bodes well for the entry-level lineup which doesn't need to worry about bottlenecks if they are equipped with lower lanes as was the case with the Radeon RX 6500 and RX 6400 series which when switching over to Gen 3 standard end up with less than required graphics bandwidth leading to poor performance versus as PCIe Gen 4.0 compliant standard. If the high-end lineup isn't starving the Gen 4.0 standard then the low-end lineup is far from hitting the max threshold. So far we can't say for sure if NVIDIA will truly retain PCIe Gen 4.0 on its upcoming RTX 40 series cards but that could change as marketing does like having the PCIe Gen 5.0 logo for the new cards.

Aside from the PCIe Gen 5.0 and PCIe Gen 4.0 support NVIDIA is also seemingly going to make major changes to the way its CUDA cores are arranged within the Ada Lovelace architecture. The GPUs for the GeForce RTX 40 series will not just be a simple CUDA core bump from Ampere but could include a range of new mixed-precision cores that aren't detailed yet. The lineup is still a few months away from introduction so a lot could change but we will make sure to keep you updated.

For repairing or replacement purposes however these 11th gen CPU mainboards are now on sale complete with CAD and electrical documentation for tinkerers.

Framework made a name for itself last year when it launched its 13.5-inch laptop simply called Framework Laptop. Unlike most other laptops in the market the Framework model promised easy serviceability and repairability for any component — not just RAM or storage. A major part of that initiative would involve selling the individual components themselves to customers who may need them for replacement purposes.

The manufacturer is now offering the mainboard of the Laptop complete with processor and cooling solution for the following prices:

Core i5-1135G7 mainboard - $399 USD

Core i7-1165G7 mainboard - $549 USD

Core i7-1185G7 mainboard - $799 USD

In essence existing Core i5 owners of the Framework Laptop can easily upgrade to a Core i7 by just swapping out their mainboards. Based on our benchmarks jumping from the Core i5-1135G7 to the Core i7-1165G7 should boost CPU and GPU performance roughly by about 15 percent each.

Unfortunately there is no word yet on when Alder Lake-U mainboards will become available. There is very little reason to upgrade within the same processor generation as the biggest performance gains will be inter-generational and not intra-generational. The latest Ultrabooks from major OEMs like Dell HP and Lenovo are already widely available with 12th gen CPUs while the Framework Laptop continues to be limited to 11th gen options. Hopefully the 12th gen mainboards will be made available sooner rather than later.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vaG90aGFyZHdhcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaW5jcmVkaWJsZS1kZWFsLW9uLWFsaWVud2FyZS1hdXJvcmEtcnl6ZW4tZWRpdGlvbi1yMTAtZ2FtaW5nLWRlc2t0b3DSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Huge Deal Save Thousands On Alienware's Aurora Ryzen Edition PC With GeForce RTX 3090,"







If you are looking to get a solid gaming PC at a great price from Alienware  act fast as a limited number of the Alienware Aurora Ryzen Edition R10 Gaming Desktops are left at $1150 off MSRP. Between the machines' Ryzen 9 5900 CPU and its NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090  you would certainly be setup for tons of gaming firepower now at just $2699.99 (regularly $3849.99).When Dell's Alienware gaming division put this PC up for grabs at such a low price we were pleasantly surprised as we had looked at this bad boy for review last year. However our review unit was a little less beefy than what we see here today sporting a Ryzen 7 5800X  AMD Radeon RX 6800XT 32GB of 3200Mhz DDR4 and a 1TB M.2 NVMe SSD. For reference the on-sale R10 Gaming Desktop packs an AMD Ryzen 9 5900 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 32GB of 3200Mhz DDR4 and a 1TB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD. Despite this difference in spec we were still quite happy with the results pulled from our testing and the overall quality of the R10 which should still apply to this current-gen beast that's up for sale now.Of course there were some caveats to this including some concerns with the thermal solution of the build back then. More specifically we noted in our review that in the R10 chassis “some higher-end processors cannot be adequately cooled during long sustained multi-threaded workloads by a single 120mm radiator or at least not with the airflow their smaller fans provide.” However this was the only major concern we had by and large and Alienware has likely refined things a bit more since then as well.The other major benefit of this prebuilt is that even though component shortages and squeezes are starting to ease up is that it will allow you to get a good set of high-end PC components without worrying about something not making the jump in overseas shipping. It also should be considered that an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Founders Edition Graphics Card is a whopping $2224 on Amazon right now which represents 82% of Dell’s total asking price though obviously that's an inflated price for an RTX 3090.Whether or not you are a fan of Alienware you cannot deny that this is a pretty impressive deal. Thus if you want to get the Alienware Aurora Ryzen Edition R10 Gaming Desktop at $2699.99 for a limited time you can do so here . Furthermore if you do happen to grab one of these beasts let us know what you think of it in the comments below.Sadly this deal just sold out shortly after publication.

The new series which was released on Friday (15 April) follows Tory MP and immigration minister James Whitehouse (Rupert Friend) in the wake of revelations that he cheated on his wife Sophie (Sienna Miller) with his parliamentary aide Olivia (Aladdin’s Naomi Scott).

However James’s situation quicky becomes more serious when he is accused of rape.

The scene in which James discovers the allegation is the one that has been highlighted and posted on social media.

It shows him flying backwards in slow motion after he hears the news as if he’s been hit by an invisible force. The scene directed by SJ Clarkson is designed to reflect an invisible gut punch.

Many viewers shared the scene on Twitter in disbelief. Tweeter @AliArikan wrote: “Anatomy of a Scandal is dreadful and hilarious. This is how the first episode ends.”

One viewer replied: “I... did not expect that. Nearly spit out my food in the break room.”

Trying to build your savings pay off debt and make the most of your money? You might want to try living like a billionaire -- but only if that billionaire is Warren Buffett. The investor -- known as the Oracle of Omaha -- is the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. But there's more to this American business magnate than just his job.

Despite his roughly $125.1 billion net worth according to Forbes the eight-wealthiest man in the world enjoys a life of simple taste frugal living and generous philanthropy. Here's a look at Warren Buffett's tips for living frugally.

1. Warren Buffett's House Is the Same One He Bought in 1958

Billionaires live in mansions right? Not Buffett.

He lives in the same residence in Omaha Neb. that he bought in 1958 for $31500 the equivalent of roughly $285000 in 2020 dollars. Buffett has no intention of putting his own home up for sale. ""I wouldn't trade it for anything"" he told CNBC earlier this year.

In today's money Buffett would have paid about $43 per square foot for the 6570-square-foot home. But these days the home is worth about $161 per square foot according to the home's current value listed by the tax assessor's office in Douglas County Nebraska where Buffett lives.

If you want to live like Buffett consider buying less home than you can afford. Instead of paying pricey mortgage payments you'll be able to put more of your money toward savings retirement or vacations.

And if you must take out a loan perhaps get a 30-year mortgage -- it's ""the best instrument in the world"" Buffett told CNBC. In fact Buffett took out a 30-year mortgage in 1971 when he bought a vacation home in Laguna Beach California.

""If you're wrong and rates go to 2% which I don't think they will you pay it off"" he said. ""It's a one-way renegotiation. It is an incredibly attractive instrument for the homeowner and you've got a one-way bet.""

2. Buffett Starts His Day With a Cheap Breakfast

You might assume billionaires brunch at the most extravagant restaurants ordering eggs Benedict and bottomless mimosas. Or they hire a personal chef who can whip up whatever and whenever they want -- right?

Wrong. Adopting Buffett's lifestyle doesn't include paying high prices for daily gourmet French toast prepared in the comforts of your own home.

Story continues

When it comes to food the billionaire investor has been known to save money by taking the fast-food route. In fact he might kick off his day with a trip to McDonald's during his five-minute drive to work reports CNBC.

If he's feeling rich he'll splurge by spending $3.89 on a bacon egg and cheese biscuit sandwich. If the market's down he might spend $3.19 on a sausage egg and cheese sandwich instead. On a really bad day he buys two sausage patties for $2.38 puts them together and washes it down with a Coke he pours himself.

Buffett also is known to opt for cheap food when he's on the road -- but forget the cholesterol-soaked bacon and eggs at a local restaurant. Buffett's travel breakfast might consist of a pack of Oreos his friend Bill Gates -- yes his good buddy is the Microsoft founder -- wrote on his blog.

""One thing that was surprising to learn about Warren is that he has basically stuck to eating what he liked when he was 6 years old"" Gates wrote. ""He did move past baby food of course but he mostly eats hamburgers ice cream and Coke.""

Buffett explained his diet in a 2015 interview with Fortune: ""I checked the actuarial tables and the lowest death rate is among 6-year-olds. So I decided to eat like a 6-year-old. It's the safest course I can take.""

3. Buffett Buys Reduced-Price Cars

Although some CEOs drive around in million-dollar cars you'll likely find Buffett driving something much more modest.

In a BBC documentary his daughter Susie Buffett said he bought cars that he could get at reduced prices -- like those that had been damaged by hail. The cars were fixed and didn't look hail-damaged and became a regular part of the Buffett lifestyle.

""You've got to understand he keeps cars until I tell him 'This is getting embarrassing -- time for a new car'"" said his daughter in the documentary.

Buffett also told Forbes in 2014 about his car-buying habits -- or lack thereof. ""The truth is I only drive about 3500 miles a year so I will buy a new car very infrequently"" he said.

Remember this the next time you're in the market for a car: Cars tend to depreciate quickly so it can be better for your finances if you try to keep your well-working car for as long as possible -- or at least opt to buy a used car instead of new.

4. Buffett Enjoys Affordable Hobbies

A commitment to live like Warren Buffett doesn't mean all work and no play. After all even billionaires have hobbies. But compared to other famous CEOs investors and entrepreneurs Buffett's hobbies are much more affordable. For example he enjoys playing bridge.

""If I play bridge and a naked woman walks by I don't even see her"" laughed Buffett during a CBS News ""Sunday Morning"" interview. Yep Buffett is a self-proclaimed bridge addict and you might even catch him playing the game about 8 hours a week according to a Washington Post interview from 2017.

""I one time said that I wouldn't mind going to jail if I had the right three cellmates so we can play bridge all the time"" he also said in the interview.

When Buffett's not busy being a business mogul you might find him strumming his ukulele and singing as well. He's played for investors and at charity events. A video of him playing the instrument with Gates even went viral after it was posted on Gates' blog in 2016.

5. Buffett Treats His Friends Well but Not Extravagantly

What do you give a friend who's also a billionaire? Buffett's long-standing friendship with Gates is legendary. In honor of Buffett's 90th birthday the Microsoft magnate explained on his blog what's kept their friendship strong over the years:

""Of all the things I've learned from Warren the most important thing might be what friendship is all about"" Gates wrote. ""A person that I admire as well as like -- that's the perfect description of how I feel about Warren. Happy birthday my friend.""

And Buffett didn't earn Gates' gratitude through grandiose and expensive gestures. Instead it's simply about how he treats others. In his 2016 blog post Gates gave examples of how Buffett is a kind and thoughtful friend such as driving personally to the airport to pick up Gates whenever he's in Buffett's hometown town calling frequently and sending news clippings by mail that he thinks Gates and his wife will enjoy.

Those special touches that mean a lot to friends just might be the best takeaway for those seeking to live the Warren Buffett lifestyle.

6. Buffett Used a Nokia Flip Phone Long After Smartphones Existed

Buffett likely won't be shelling out big money for the newest iPhone even though he's now using one. The billionaire revealed in a February 2020 CNBC Squawk Box interview that he has been given several iPhones including by Tim Cook.

He stated the Nokia flip phone which he had held on to for years is permanently gone and he now uses the newest model iPhone which was an iPhone 11 at the time of the interview.

While it's tempting to always splurge on the latest technology take a page from Buffett's book and only upgrade your phone when you really need to. If you insist on buying the latest iPhone to hit the market look for other ways to save on your phone expenses such as using a no-contract phone plan or buying a family plan to share data.

7. Buffett Doesn't Splurge on Designer Suits

Buffett shuns high-end designer suits. Instead he exclusively wears suits created by a Chinese sewing entrepreneur named Madam Li whom he met in 2007.

""They fit perfectly"" he said of the suits in a 2017 CNBC interview. ""We get compliments on them. It's been a long time since I got compliments on how I looked but since I am wearing Madame Li's suits I get compliments all the time.""

The takeaway: Opt for quality goods that will last you a long time rather than buying something just because it has a brand name attached to it.

8. Buffett Clips Coupons

Buffett proves that even billionaires still appreciate an opportunity to save money. In Bill and Melinda Gates' 2017 annual letter Bill recalled a trip he took with the investor during which Buffett paid for their fast-food lunch using coupons. He even provided photographic proof of this.

""Remember the laugh we had when we traveled together to Hong Kong and decided to get lunch at McDonald's? You offered to pay dug into your pocket and pulled out ... coupons!"" Bill wrote. ""Melinda just found this photo of me and 'the big spender.' It reminded us how much you value a good deal.""

Save on your next purchase -- even if it's something as inexpensive as a McDonald's meal -- by using applicable discounts which you can easily find on online coupon sites.

9. Buffett Has Worked in the Same Office Building for More Than 50 Years

Buffett has remained in the same office building since he joined Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s.

""It's a different sort of place"" Buffett said of the company's Omaha headquarters in the 2017 HBO documentary ""Becoming Warren Buffett"" CNBC reports. ""We have 25 people in the office and if you go back it's the exact same 25. The exact same ones. We don't have any committees at Berkshire. We don't have a public relations department. We don't have investor relations. We don't have a general counsel. We just don't go for anything that people do just as a matter of form.""

Even if you're not a business owner you can still benefit from Buffett's way of thinking. It boils down to the old saying: If it ain't broke don't fix it.

10. Buffett Thinks Outside the Box To Save Money

In Roger Lowenstein's biography of the businessman ""Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist"" the author says that after Buffett's first child was born he converted a dresser drawer into a space for the baby to sleep instead of spending money on a bassinet reports Forbes. When it came to the family's second child he borrowed a crib rather than buying one.

Perhaps making your baby sleep in a drawer seems a little extreme but it's just an example of thinking outside the box. Use resources that are already available to you to prevent unnecessary spending.

11. Buffett Values Relationships Over Material Things

Buffett explained his choice to live frugally during a 2009 Q&A session he conducted with a group of business school students.

""You can't buy health and you can't buy love"" said Buffett according to the Underground Value blog. ""I'm a member of every golf club that I want to be a member of [...] I'd rather play golf here with people I like than at the fanciest golf course in the world. [...] I'm not interested in cars and my goal is not to make people envious.""

And in a 2017 interview with People Susie Buffett said of her father: ""...it's really true that he does not care about having a bunch of money."" Instead she said he emphasizes family.

""I don't think people realize he's got a bunch of great-grandchildren and he could tell you everything about what they're all doing. He knows every one of those kids and he knows about their lives"" she said.

Could it be early antibiotic exposure transepidermal water loss the microbiome of the patient or time spent in the newborn intensive care unit? Lisa Swanson MD a pediatric dermatologist at Ada West Dermatology and St Luke’s Children’s Hospital in Meridian Idaho explained during her presentation at the 2022 Society of Dermatology Nurse Practitioners Symposium that all 4 of these could factor into the development of AD but that currently there is no clear answer as to which is most important.1

Swanson described how growing evidence links food allergies and AD—an association the American Academy of Dermatology recently explored2—but they might be associated differently than previously thought. It appears in recent research that the AD might actually be causing the food allergy via increased aerosolized food parti- cle exposure through the skin. In fact a Japanese study looked at 177 infants with severe AD and found that the incidence of food allergy at age 3 was lower in infants that had their AD appropriately treated with topical steroids.3

She noted many parents are asking for natural therapy options but it is difficult to make sugges- tions due to a lack of formal studies. Natural ther- apies that have been studied include the following:

olive oil which has been shown to worsen symptoms of AD 4 ;

; cannabidiol which may help 5 but more research is needed according to Swanson;

but more research is needed according to Swanson; coconut oil has antibacterial properties but does not seem to impact the eczema itself 6 ; and

; and sunflower seed oil which may help but it can be difficult to find a wellprepared formula.4

Swanson said AD is associated with increased risk of multiple comorbidities including mental health issues allergies and cardiovascular dis- ease. Perhaps one of the most devasting issues with having AD is the lack of sleep which both pediatric patients and parents struggle with. These sleep disturbances can even result in less growth hormone secretion. Less growth hormone often means that kids with bad AD can be low on growth curves with respect to height and weight.

“Growth hormone also plays a huge role in bone formation” Swanson said. “So that might explain the increased osteoporosis osteopenia and fractures in children with AD.” Also studies have shown that the overactivity of IL-4 may neg- atively effect brain development potentially leading to increased rates of ADHD anxiety depression and autism spectrum disorder in patients with AD. This means that inhibiting IL-4 could have important benefits beyond AD Swanson said.

She then discussed a few efficacious medications available to treat the pediatric population with AD such as fluocinolone acetonide 0.01% (Derma-Smoothe) and the Aron regimen (30 g betamethasone valerate 0.1% cream 24 g mupirocin cream and 400 g Vanicream). She also touched on bleach baths. Although they have been determined to not kill Staphylococcus bacteria (as was previously thought) they do still have some benefits for those with AD which Swanson said is probably due to an anti-inflammatory effect on the skin.

According to Swanson dupilumab (Dupix- ent; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi) which is FDA approved for AD in patients 6 years and older has changed pediatric AD treatment. The FDA has also accepted for priority review the supplemental biologics license application for dupilumab as an add-on maintenance treatment for children aged 6 months to 5 years with moder- ate to severe AD that is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or for whom those therapies are not advisable.7

Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. Swanson explained that she does not do a load- ing dose for her pediatric patients. “My personal style has been to not do a loading dose in kids. It’s just too hard on them. I don’t want the first experience to be so traumatizing that they don’t come back” she said adding that in the Liberty AD PRESCHOOL trial (NCT03346434) there was no loading dose used in the younger age group.

The other development in AD for patients older than 12 years old includes Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. Swanson explained that although there is a black box warning on these JAK inhibitors because of safety concerns stemming from studies done in patients on tofacitinib (Xeljanz) with rheumatoid arthritis who were older than 50 with at least 1 cardiovascular risk factor. While this might not be representative of AD patients the warning is still important to understand and communicate clearly to patients. It is important to monitor patients on oral JAK inhibitors with labs skin checks and regular appointments to assess for any issues.

For patients on oral JAK inhibitors Swanson explained they should have a complete blood count a comprehensive metabolic panel and a lipid panel done at baseline 1 month and every 3 months after. In addition a QuantiFERON-TB Gold test and hepatitis B and C tests should be done at baseline and depending on the patient annually. Also although creatine kinase elevations were observed in past studies they were transient and not clinically relevant so in her opinion there is no need to test a patient for them.

With the oral JAK inhibitors it is important to consider baseline liver and kidney function and patients must be advised to avoid live vaccines pregnancy and breastfeeding. “Consider talking about [herpes simplex virus] suppression if a patient has a history of cold sores and consider the Zoster vaccination if they’re old enough to qualify for it” Swanson said.

For 2022 and 2023 the health sector will focus on the below response strategies and priority areas to provide life-saving health services to 12.2 million people in need including those most at risk due to poor physical and/or mental health as well as limited access to basic health care services.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm94eWdlbi5jb20vY3JpbWUtbmV3cy9qb3JkaW4tcm9hY2hlLXBsZWFkcy1ndWlsdHktdG8taGFtbWVyLW11cmRlci1vZi1rYXl0bHlubi1jYXJnaWxs0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub3h5Z2VuLmNvbS9jcmltZS1uZXdzL2pvcmRpbi1yb2FjaGUtcGxlYWRzLWd1aWx0eS10by1oYW1tZXItbXVyZGVyLW9mLWtheXRseW5uLWNhcmdpbGw_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas Man Pleads Guilty To Murdering Girl With Hammer When She Was A Teenager,"Jordin Roache has been in custody since he was 16-years-old for the beating death of 14-year-old Kaytlynn Cargill.

Texas Man Pleads Guilty To Murdering Girl With Hammer When She Was A Teenager

A man has pleaded guilty to brutally murdering a 14-year-old girl while he himself was still a teenager.

Jordin Roache 21 pleaded guilty on Thursday to the murder of Kaytlynn Cargill of Bedford Texas according to a release from the Tarrant County District Attorney’s Office. Roache reportedly admitted to beating Cargill to death with a hammer and leaving her body in an Arlington landfill when he was still 16 years old.

372nd District Judge Scott Wisch sentenced Roache to 10 years in prison.

“My hope is that every day you remember what you did to Kaytlynn” Wisch said at the hearing.

Cargill was reported missing on June 19 2017 when she failed to return to her Bedford apartment complex after taking her dog for a walk according to the release. Her body was found at the Republic Service Arlington Landfill two days later.

Investigators with the Bedford Police Department were led to the defendant’s girlfriend’s home which was in the same complex where Cargill lived according to Dallas-Forth Worth Fox affiliate KDFW. A forensic biologist found Cargill’s blood on the door frame bathtub patio ledge and on a claw hammer found in the apartment.

Roache lived at his girlfriend's home at the time of the murder according to police.

On the day of Cargill’s disappearance she was due to collect $300 from Roache as part of a previous marijuana deal according to an arrest warrant affidavit obtained by KDFW.

Roache was arrested on Sept. 1 2017 and booked into the Tarrant County Juvenile Detention Facility in Fort Worth on charges of murder.

“Roache was 16 legally a juvenile at the time of the offense and was certified as an adult to stand trial in this case” said District Attorney Sharen Wilson. “He has remained in custody ever since.”

The case experienced several delays over the years for varying reasons including the COVID-19 pandemic according to police.

The District Attorney’s Office also noted that Cargill’s manner of death was previously “listed as a generic finding” by former Medical Examiner Dr. Marc Krause. Dr. Krause was terminated from his position after botching dozens of postmortem examinations during his four decades in office as reported by Dallas-Fort Worth NBC affiliate KXAS. Krause’s inaccurate findings were “in part unknown to the grand jury due to the condition of Cargill’s remains.”

Cargill’s cause of death was amended in August 2017 when officials ruled she died of homicidal violence according to KXAS.

“On June 19 2017 our lives changed forever” Cargill’s mother Trisha West said at Thursday’s allocution. “The defendant brutally beat my daughter terrorized and tossed her away like trash - a fate no human deserves and especially not Kaytlynn.”

Relatives relayed fond memories of the young girl at the hearing including Easter egg hunts and opening Christmas presents. Trisha West said her daughter loved fishing music skating and animals adding that Cargill “no doubt would be an asset to society.”

“She was not yours for the taking but you did it anyway” Cargill’s father wrote in a prepared statement. “I am tormented every day about what she endured. It plays out in my mind.”

Police say Roache was transferred to the Texas Department of Corrections following his sentencing.

“This day has been a long time coming and we’re grateful for the hard work and countless hours put in by the Bedford Police officers detectives and forensic investigators along with the prosecutors from the Tarrant County District Attorney’s Office” said Police Chief Jeff Williams. “The Cargill family remains in our thoughts as we reach the conclusion of this tragic case.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vYm9yZ2VucHJvamVjdC5vcmcvaGVhbHRoLWNhcmUtaW4tY29uZ28v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Everything to Know About Health Care in Congo,"

The Republic of Congo is one of the most resource-rich and “least densely populated” nations in Africa. Its economy is heavily dependent on oil exports so it is vulnerable to dropping oil prices and economic crises. This combined with its history of civil conflict has resulted in a high poverty rate of 52.5% in 2020. Further in times of economic decline a lack of government funding has plagued health care in Congo. In turn that has led to high out-of-pocket costs for the majority of patients. It also has resulted in a lack of health care professionals and an uneven distribution of health care services. Finally the financial strain of the health care system exacerbates the country’s burden of communicable diseases such as tuberculosis malaria and HIV. It has also contributed to the nation’s high rates of maternal and infant mortality.

Effects of Communicable Diseases

A major challenge that health care in Congo faces is the high rates of tuberculosis (TB) malaria and HIV. Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death in Congo and early diagnosis is a critical first step in ensuring successful treatment. To increase Congo’s TB testing capabilities the World Health Organization (WHO) equipped the cities of Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire with GeneXpert diagnostic machines which the Global Fund financed.

Delivered in December 2021 the GeneXpert machines have increased the TB testing rate eight-fold at the Antituberculosis Centre in Brazzaville. In the past TB centers in Congo could only treat the most critical cases due to backlogs created by inefficient machines. By increasing the number of diagnoses the GeneXpert machines have proven to be a cornerstone in expanding access to TB treatment.

The GeneXpert machines are part of the Global Fund’s two grants that total more than $64 million to strengthen prevention and treatment services for TB malaria and HIV in Congo. Implemented by the UNDP and Catholic Relief Services the goals of the grant are threefold:

Successfully treat 90% of TB cases by 2023. Scale-up access to antiretroviral treatment for HIV-infected patients with a special focus on pregnant women. Deliver 3.5 million mosquito nets across Congo by 2023 and increase access to malaria treatment and diagnostics.

Maternal and Infant Health Care Successes

In the past two decades Congo has made significant strides in reducing maternal and infant mortality rates. The maternal mortality rate has fallen from 739 deaths per 100000 live births in 2000 to 378 deaths per 100000 live births in 2017. Similarly the infant mortality rate has fallen from 106 deaths per 1000 live births in 2000 to 63 deaths per 1000 live births in 2020.

To continue on this trajectory of improving maternal and infant health in June 2021 the World Bank approved $50 million for the Kobikisa Health System Strengthening Project. The project’s goal is to improve the quality and availability of maternal and child health care in Congo among the most impoverished households. With financing from the International Development Association the Kobikisa initiative will provide free health services for pregnant women and their children in 36 districts across the country. Included in these services are treatments for diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis and the provision of vaccines. By delivering essential health care services free of cost the Kobikisa initiative will help alleviate the financial burden of health care for millions of Congolese citizens.

Strengthening Congo’s Health Infrastructure

In addition to these targeted interventions the Congolese central government has also begun to prioritize strengthening the infrastructure of health care in Congo. In 2018 the government increased its investment in health care from 5% of the annual budget in the previous year to 13%.

The main focus of the Congolese government’s investment is improving primary care services and revitalizing health districts. At a workshop in September 2021 executives in the Ministry of Health and Population received coaching and the tools needed to train and supervise various health care professionals “from 93 health areas of the 2020-2021 Operational Strategy.” The training of health care actors at the community level will not only improve the quality of primary care patients receive but will also expand the availability of health care in Congo to remote and rural communities that are underserviced.

Ensuring quality and affordable health care in Congo is one of the cornerstones of the nation’s development. While there is still much work to do improvements are visible thanks to the support of the international community.

UNICEF now provides life-saving nutrition services to prevent and treat acute malnutrition across the north-east but more is needed.

UNICEF and the Nutrition Sector including WFP must continue to expand preventive community-based as well as specialized inpatient nutrition services to children with acute malnutrition and ensure the availability of critical supplies.

2021 was the first year when UNICEF was able to reach every sub-district of Al-Hasakeh Governorate with nutrition centres and mobile teams as well as reaching four of seven subdistricts in Ar-Raqqa . This follows 2019 when UNICEF was able to access only a third of sub-districts in Al-Hasakeh. In 2020 COVID-19 prevention measures saw lockdowns and a curfew in NE Syria which were a major barrier to reaching children and mothers with the nutrition activities and supplies across the year.

In addition to providing life-saving treatment to children suffering from acute malnutrition this access allowed detailed nutrition data to be collected to understand the nutritional status and needs of these children using weight-forheight measurements taken from the nutrition surveillance data in fixed and mobile clinics. This data acts as the basis for this paper.

Al-Hasakeh Governorate moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) rates increased in June 2021 coinciding with the onset of the drought. The lack of safe water in addition to severe heat and limited access to health services were the main causes of this peak along with underlying concerns around limited access to nutritious food and inadequate feeding practices. It is likely that the rise in MAM cases is also related to the subsequent increase in cases of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) detected in September.

Ar-Raqqa Governorate began 2021 with a relatively high GAM rate due in part to the particularly restrictive COVID-19 prevention measures imposed there in 2020. The water crisis and drought conditions as well as lack of access and services contributed to the high GAM rates seen in Ar-Raqqa throughout 2021 along with underlying concerns around limited access to nutritious food and inadequate feeding practices.

In 2021 UNICEF reached 33600 children and caregivers with preventive and curative nutrition services in Al-Hasakeh and Ar-Raqqa Governorate. This was up from 339000 in 2020; and 392000 in 2019. Going into 2022 UNICEF is preparing to provide nutrition assistance to 377000 children in NE Syria whose needs have increased due to drought-affected food insecurity along with on-going underlying factors including conflict displacement economic deterioration precarious livelihoods and inadequate health care services. The section below highlights the key actions UNICEF and partners undertook in 2021 to increase the access and availability of the data and services to inform our approach for the prevention and treatment of acute malnutrition in NE Syria in 2022 and beyond.",,,

Inflation has hit a 41-year high and many Americans fear price increases are outpacing wage growth.

Common knowledge says to ask for a raise because you deserve it not because you need it.

But experts say there's a way to factor inflation into making your case for a salary bump. Here's how to do it.

When asking for a raise everyone knows you should focus on why you deserve one not why you need it.

But what if your biggest argument is that you need it?

Inflation has hit a 41-year high and many Americans fear wage growth isn't keeping pace with price surges. In a recent survey of more than 1000 US workers by staffing firm Robert Half nearly 62% of respondents said they plan to ask for a raise this year with the top reason being to adjust for the higher cost of living.

Fortunately there's a way to work inflation into your raise request. The labor market is still hot so many companies are focused on retention to keep employees from walking.

Here are 6 steps toward getting an inflation-based raise:

Find out your employer's stance on factoring inflation into raises

Some employers may already account for cost-of-living increases when giving raises. If you're uncertain you can bring it up in your annual review or after successfully finishing a project says Tori Dunlap a personal finance expert and founder of Her First 100K a financial literacy platform for millennial women.

Dunlap suggests saying ""I've really enjoyed being a part of this team and am excited for my future here. I was wondering what is taken into consideration when giving raises. In addition to my overall performance will the cost of inflation also be taken into account?""

Crunch numbers

If your employer doesn't automatically account for inflation consult the Consumer Price Index to find the inflation rate from the past 12 months. Take that number in decimal form add 1 and multiply that sum by your current salary to find out how much to ask for says professional coach Brooke McCord of coaching company Ama La Vida.

Ask to discuss your pay

For many people broaching the subject is the hardest part.

Dunlap recommends sending an email along these lines: ""I would like to find a time where we can discuss my current salary. After doing some market research and assessing the way that inflation has affected my cost of living I believe that an increase in my salary is appropriate. I really enjoy this role and this team and see myself being here for many years so I would like to find a number that makes us both happy. What days and times would work best for you?""

If you have a review around the corner you could tie your request to that.

McCord suggests: ""I know my performance review is coming up and I'm looking forward to it. With my recent [achievement] and inflation I'd like to discuss my compensation in addition to digging into what I'm doing well where I can continue to improve and how I can continue to grow within this team.""







Do your research

Use sites like Payscale and Glassdoor to compare your salary to your industry peers. Take into account your geographic region and specialization says Josh Doody founder of Fearless Salary Negotiation and a salary negotiation coach for senior software engineers and engineering managers.

Compile accomplishments praise and positive performance reviews showing how you've specifically succeeded. Focus on metrics and concrete examples and zero in how you've improved.

""The conversation you're having is 'My salary was set sometime in the past and now I feel like my salary does not currently reflect the work that I'm doing'"" said Doody. ""You want to identify what are the things you've been doing that you're not currently being compensated for based on how you agreed to be paid for your work and what is the value of those things? That way what you're doing is saying 'Here's my target salary and the reason I chose that.""

Focus on your value

Though inflation is part of the discussion your achievements should be the cornerstone of your negotiations.

""You always want to bring it back to the value you add to the company"" said McCord. ""Focus on how you have helped the team and company achieve their goals.""

Dunlap advises you provide concrete examples of your contributions before delving into inflation. At that point try saying ""I would love to see what else I can accomplish in this role but my current salary is not meeting the levels of inflation in this area. My costs of living have increased by X% in the last 6 months so I would like to see my salary increase accordingly so that I can continue to grow and reach new goals with our company.""

Follow up

If you get a ""no"" it doesn't have to be the end of the road.

At that point Dunlap suggests saying ""Thank you for having this conversation with me. I would love to set a time to revisit this conversation. Would the end of next quarter be a possibility? In the meantime would you be able to give me some feedback so I can understand what you would like to see from me in that time in order to secure my desired salary?""

Remember that salary is just one part of compensation says McCord.

""If they deny your request for a raise ask about increased PTO flex time remote work bonuses equity"" she says.

If you're consistently denied a raise it may be worthwhile to look for work elsewhere. ""If they are unwilling to budge and acknowledge your hard work that might be a sign it's time to move on"" McCord says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9tYWRpc29uL25hbWUvcm9iZXJ0LXNlcmdlbmlhbi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNDQyMjY3MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert Sergenian Obituary (1928 - 2022) - Madison WI - Madison.com,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/madison/name/robert-sergenian-obituary?id=34422671 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9tYWRpc29uL25hbWUvcm9iZXJ0LXNlcmdlbmlhbi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNDQyMjY3MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXdyYXAuY29tL2Z1bm55LWdpcmwtYnJvYWR3YXktcmV2aWV3LWJlYW5pZS1mZWxkc3RlaW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Funny Girl Broadway Review: She's Back Finally and Very Different,"Despite being a musical-opera aficionado I had seen “Funny Girl” performed on stage only once. The experience was half-memorable half-forgettable. On Sept. 23 2002 the Actors’ Fund of America presented a benefit performance of the 1964 musical that had made Barbra Streisand a star. At the one-night-only benefit Peter Gallagher played Nick Arnstein and Kaye Ballard a performer who lobbied hard to be the original Fanny Brice played Mrs. Brice. The brilliant concept for the benefit however delivered no fewer than 16 actresses in the title role each of them being assigned a song or a moment of extended dialogue.

I vividly remember Kristin Chenoweth delivering a hysterically funny “His Love Makes Me Beautiful”; Sutton Foster having just opened in “Thoroughly Modern Millie” sang “I’m the Greatest Star”; and Lillias White brought down the act-one curtain with “Don’t Rain on My Parade.” The buzz during intermission at the New Amsterdam the site of all those Ziegfeld Follies was nearly as loud as the ovations after each song: Why had “Funny Girl” never been revived on Broadway? It’s a great musical with classic songs by Jule Styne and Bob Merrill.

Then Act 2 happened. Oy vey! Isobel Lennart’s book took a nose dive into bad soap opera and Styne and Merrill’s work sounded second-rate. Performers as gifted as Carolee Carmello Jane Krakowski and Bebe Neuwirth could not bring “Funny Girl” back to life at that starry benefit performance.

The legend surrounding “Funny Girl” has always been that no performer could match Streisand and so the show languished. Many articles in respected newspapers and websites have seconded that belief whenever a Broadway revival has even been suggested. Those articles reappeared as soon as it was announced that Beanie Feldstein would step into La Streisand’s bloomers. That revival of “Funny Girl” opened Sunday at the August Wilson Theatre.

Feldstein doesn’t possess Streisand’s voice but what she does offer is a sweet piping sound that encompasses the score’s range from E below middle C to a high F. Equally important she respects that 1964 score and doesn’t modernize it with a lot of melismatic distortions. After her enchanting Broadway debut playing Minnie Fay in the Bette Midler “Hello Dolly!” Feldstein is a quirky offbeat choice to play Fanny Brice. But then Streisand was also a quirky offbeat choice back in 1964. Carol Burnett and Anne Bancroft were the more conventional choices back then and Brice’s daughter Fran Arnstein Stark wanted to see Mary Martin cast in the title role.

After seeing her in “Beautiful: The Carole King Musical” I wrote that Jessie Mueller should pick up the Brice torch. Feldstein did instead and she makes an especially endearing Fanny. Just as Carol Burnett sports her great galumphing grin Feldstein uses her open-wide overbite smile for great comic effect especially in “You Are Woman” and “Rat-a-Tat-Tat.” That self-deprecation endears us to these two comedians. The word “endears” has never been attached to Streisand.

The big news surrounding this revival is not the leading lady however. It’s the guys director Michael Mayer and Harvey Fierstein who revised the book. Fierstein has sharpened the dialogue throughout and while the new second act is not vintage Broadway it’s no longer a complete dud. In other words it works. A simple glance at the original musical’s lineup of songs shows an imagination gap with Act 1 not only getting the best material but a lot more material.

This revival wisely reprises “People” in the second act making it a brief duet between Brice and Arnstein (Ramin Karimloo) and it adds the song “Funny Girl” from the 1968 film version. In a real surprise Karimloo sings it first delivering it as an ironic statement about his wife and then Feldstein reprises it at the end before singing “Don’t Rain on My Parade” a second time to end the show. No the Brice standards “Second Hand Rose” and “My Man” aren’t sung. Styne and Merrill rightfully freaked out when those classics were added to the movie version corrupting their original score.

This revival’s second act is also aided by reprising some brilliant tapping by Jared Grimes. Playing Fanny’s sidekick Eddie Grimes stops the show with his flashy footwork in the first act. Choreography is by Ellenore Scott.

The revised book doesn’t fix the fact that the star becomes a reactive character in the second act. Also Feldstein never convinces us that she has suddenly become a diva. The new second act does manage to make Arnstein a character worth watching and this production is enhanced by Karimloo’s charismatic performance. It helps immensely that he reprises “People” briefly and goes on to sing “Funny Girl.” Karimloo left me unimpressed after his dull braying performance in 2016’s “Anastasia” on Broadway. His vocals here display a far more impressive singing voice and are among the show’s highlights.

Jane Lynch disappoints as Mrs. Brice unfortunately. She’s not so much bad as wrong.

The family-owned wine and spirits company which Berish founded in 1999 is today responsible for such potables as Luc Belaire French sparkling wine Bumbu rum and McQueen and the Violet Fog gin.

But for all the gregarious party-hard vibes his business provides—Luc Belaire was notably popped by the Los Angeles Rams following their recent Super Bowl victory and Bumbu counts rappers Lil Wayne and Rick Ross among its admirers—Berish 53 is a family man at heart. The father of six who lives primarily near Chicago but maintains additional residences in New York City and Florida becomes animated when speaking about vacations with his clan and reserves the utmost praise for his rollerblading mother. “She’s my guru my role model” he says.

The spirits entrepreneur (who prior to launching Sovereign worked as a merchant banker) was at one time also involved with D’Ussé Cognac. Most recently Berish has brought a new Cognac liqueur dubbed Villon to the market. “Success is the next brand. It’s the next thing for me” he says.

What’s something you’ve done recently for the first time?

I just had my sixth kid so it feels like it’s starting all over again. It’s new.

WATCH

First thing you do in the morning?

I drink two cups of coffee and I walk for two hours. I have a walking stick I whittled and sanded myself and I walk anywhere from 7 to 15 miles a day. If I don’t do it it ruins me.

What advice do you wish you’d followed?

Trusting my gut. It’s the most important thing. I have an expression I just told my team “Consensus does not make for good ideas.” I wish I would have learned that earlier but that comes with confidence and time.

What do you do that’s still analog?

Anytime I travel I’ll go into a wine shop a liquor store a grocery store. I love walking down aisles seeing brands that’ll never change touching and feeling a brand. To me brands are a personal thing and that’s my favorite part of it.

How do you find calm?

I do a series called “Self-Made” where I interview people: influencers celebrities business people sports figures. I like hearing the come-up part; I don’t like hearing success. Knowing that other people have gone through struggles is very relieving for me because I can understand it.

What’s the most recent thing you’ve added to your collection?

I own Charlie Bucket’s golden ticket from the original Willy Wonka film. I bought it at an auction from the director’s family and I got the whole backstory. Everyone you mention the golden ticket to it just brings smiles. I love it. It’s my most prized possession.

What’s the most recent thing you regret not buying?

A 1967 Volkswagen Microbus with 21 windows. I wanted it because I have six kids and I just see my whole family in it driving around. And because of Covid I didn’t pull the trigger because I would have bought it without seeing it and I needed to see it in person. But it was beautiful.

What’s the most impressive dish you cook?

It’s scrambled eggs with cheese burnt bacon a couple of sausages and toast. I can do that really well. You’ve got to have burnt bacon though—burnt really crispy bacon.

What does success look like to you?

Success to me is constantly proving that our ideas worked. If I have a new idea I want to see it become reality. Anybody can have an idea but it’s making it real that’s the hard part.

How much do you trust your gut instinct?

My success has been based on trusting my instincts. And it’s when I didn’t trust them that it hasn’t worked.

Drive or be driven?

Drive. You’ve got to be in control you have to.

Are you wearing a watch? How many do you own?

I own one watch. It’s one of the most special things I own because Rick Ross gave it to me a gold Rolex. And it was engraved to me “From one boss to another.” And I love it I absolutely love it. It’s so heavy it’s hard to wear.

The last time you unplugged?

This past summer I went camping with my three brothers three of my kids all my nephews. Three days camping in the woods which was just awesome.

What’s the last piece of advice you gave?

Don’t be afraid to fail. I tell my team every single day: Try things; don’t wait for approval. If it doesn’t work don’t worry about it. Life is like improv. You make it a little bit better every day.

What is your e-mail etiquette?

Follow up. I will always respond and as quickly as possible. To me it’s about respect.

What is the car(s) you are most attached to?

I have a 1988 Defender which is restored beautifully. It’s got the seats that face each other in the back. We call it Frosty as in Frosty the Snowman—bright blue. And I have a red Moke which the kids named Sharktooth. It’s an electric car. It looks like a Jeep that’s been cut in half horizontally but goes 35 miles per hour. It’s street-legal and it’s amazing.

What do you most crave at the end of the day?

It has to be a drink. I drink every single day and at the end of the day is my favorite. I’ll pour a rocks glass full of one of the brands and I’ll sit by myself and just chill. It’s my favorite thing to do. There’s nothing better. Yes you should drink with friends but I’m an excellent drinker alone.

Bowie or Dylan?

Definitely Bowie. I don’t get Dylan.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXNzZGVtb2NyYXQuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbmV3cy9jcml0aWNzLWFjY3VzZS1sYWtlcG9ydC1wZXQtc3RvcmUtb2YtbmVnbGVjdC13YW50LWl0LWNsb3NlZC1jaXR5LXNheXMtaXRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lakeport residents campaign for pet store closure over treatment of animals,"The owner of the building leased to Pet Country pet shop in Lakeport says he is so heartsick about the way he believes animals are being treated there that he’s selling the property.

He and his wife Rachel who now live on a ranch north of Grants Pass Oregon even dropped the price of the property by $100000 to attract a buyer. It’s been on the market since August.

“We just want to get out of this toxic situation” said Steven Vaughan who inherited the property in 2018 when his father Steven Sr. died of cancer. The elder Vaughan had owned the building and the store for 30 years.

“My father would be heartbroken” he said. “During this time the animals have been suffering.”

The couple said they often hear from Lake County residents who knew the store when his father owned it.

Now accounts of dead lizards in enclosures a rat eating another rat’s carcass rodents rabbits and birds crammed into cages some with no apparent food or water accompanied by pictures illustrating these concerns inside the long-running pet store at 1170 N. Main St. are fodder for a new Facebook group started earlier this month.

Called “Pet Country Has To Go” some members of the group which is comprised of area residents and others interested in the proper care of the store’s animals say they have filed complaints with animal control and the Lakeport Community Development Department. They also are campaigning for the store’s closure.

“They just aren’t receptive to complaints about the care of the animals” said Sarah Hayes of the store which is leased by Joanne Fernandez and is managed by her daughter Annette Schweitzer.

Hayes a longtime visitor to Pet Country said she founded the Facebook group following a March 30 post by Erica Gutierrez of Clearlake Oaks which attracted nearly 600 responses in about a week.

Guitierrez who said she had gone to Pet Country to buy a tank for her bearded dragon had posted pictures of dead lizards she’d seen in an enclosure inside the store.**

“It’s very sad what these animals are going through” Gutierrez said. “They don’t have a voice so I wanted to speak up for them.”

Schweitzer who denies any accusations of animal neglect or other code violations said she is “very hurt and sad that the community would do this. No one is trying to mistreat animals; we’re trying to give them the care they need.”

She maintains that any overcrowded tanks or cages are the result of rotating the animals from one cage to another or when someone brings in animals and they haven’t been placed yet.

“We are setting up cages so they have access to food and water” she said.

Vaughan said last week that he’s tried to improve the situation by having a friend take pictures and sharing them with Lake County Animal Care and Control. He said he and his wife have also turned over those pictures and others from Facebook to their attorney to “try to get something to happen” in court without success.

'We’re doing all we can’

Steve Vaughan believes things took a downturn in 2015 when the man his father had leased the store to ex-employee Clinton Karp left the business after he and his then-wife Annette split in 2019.

“That’s when everything went to hell” Vaughan said.

He said his father gave the Karps “a sweetheart deal” on rent that required them to do most of the maintenance on the building.

He said he has since warned then tried to evict lessee Joanne Fernandez and her daughter Karp’s former wife Annette Schweitzer for more than a year for failing to do the agreed-upon maintenance.

Vaughan said he sent the first notice after receiving a letter from the city of Lakeport about issues with the building and the business after a complaint was filed on July 14 2021.

After animal control and the city inspected Pet Country the Vaughans were notified that besides needed repairs to the roof and other structural fixes conditions within the store were so bad that animals had been impounded.

A second letter sent a short time later in response to an inquiry from the Vaughans stated that two violations had been issued “related to the care and treatment of the animals.”

The Vaughans repaired the roof and made other fixes as required but said Schweitzer is in default of contract for not doing her part.

The couple contends they’ve stopped eviction proceedings because they were intimidated by Schweitzer’s Lakeport attorney Andre Ross who told them they were committing “elder abuse” because Fernandez 72 has Crohn’s disease.

At the Argyle International Airport Prince Andrew 58 and his wife Sophie 57 the Earl and Countess of Wessex were greeted by Acting Prime Minister Montgomery Daniel as Prime Minister Dr Ralph Gonsalves is off-island undergoing medical attention in Venezuela.

Governor-General Dame Susan Dougan. who is the Queen’s representative here as well as Opposition Leader Godwin Friday other government and opposition lawmakers were also present at the airport as steel band music welcomed the royals whose visit to the Commonwealth Caribbean forms part of the activities marking Queen Elizabeth’s Platinum Jubilee 70 years on the throne.

But the pomp and ceremony was overshadowed by a small group of protesters calling on Britain to apologise for its role in the African slave trade as well as to pay compensation.

“The African holocaust is one of the greatest holocausts if not the greatest holocaust” Idesha Jackson 47 told the Caribbean Media Corporation (CMC)

She said that while some people might not agree “we know what our forefathers went through; it’s in our DNA.

“We feel their pain and every time I talk about African brothers and sisters who had to struggle for survival in these ships and work for many years — 400 years of slavery — and still up to this day we are not compensated.”

Jackson noted that at the end of the slave trade it was the slave masters rather than the slaves who were compensated.

“So today we are still standing firm in the cause of reparation. Reparations now! Reparations now! Reparations now! No more idle talk” she said adding “I am here to demonstrate to show my disgust my disappointment my vengeance for my brothers and sisters … who over 400 years had to suffer the slave masters’ whip the slave masters’ rape and brutal dehumanisation of our people.

“So I am here to stand up for those persons and seek from Britain reparations now” she said acknowledging that some people might argue that slavery was legal and permitted when it occurred.

“Our African brothers and sisters were never permitted to be enslaved. So the wrong was done against a sector of the human race by another and this wrong must be compensated.”

Former chair of the National Reparations Committee Jomo Thomas who was among those demanding the apology and reparation said “we just wanted to indicate represent manifest our disgust our disdain and our concern that the neo-colonial government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines would again yet again be welcoming and celebrating these people”.

The former government senator and speaker of the House of Assembly said that under the Royal African Charter the British were “responsible for the hunting down kidnapping and trans-shipment of 60 per cent of all of the Africans who were taken from the African continent”.

Thomas noted that for hundreds of years Europeans forced Africans to work without pay saying “they owe us and they must now pay us as this sign is indicating” referring to the large “Reparations now” banner that he and another protester were holding.

“Reparations now is the demand reparations now is the call” he said and expressed hope that more Vincentians will join the call for reparations

“This is not so much for the colonials who are coming in but to raise the consciousness of our people that the call for reparation is a just cause and a just demand and we will fight until we achieve that.”

Britain and other European countries have dismissed the reparations call saying that current generations should not be held responsible for acts committed by their forebears.

Thomas however said that it was only in 2015 that the British government finished repaying the 20 million pounds it borrowed in 1831 to compensate slave owners in preparation for the end of slavery.

“So if they finished paying in 2015 the argument that slavery is remote is nonsensical it is farcical” said Thomas a lawyer and newspaper columnist.

“Slavery is alive and well. It is alive and well in the underdevelopment of our people; in the fact that so many of our people are captured by a neo-colonial European mindset and we can only emancipate ourselves from mental slavery if we understand that the struggle for reparation is an integral part of freeing ourselves or regaining our patrimony.”

Another protestor 33 –year-old Judah from Pembroke a community six miles northwest of the capital echoed similar views saying “when we say reparation it’s not just money.

“We want to repair for all of the damage that has been done to our people in all the areas of human activity: economics education entertainment religion sex war politics labour.

“The earth is suffering; people are suffering. This is what you all have done. The damage we want it repaired. This is what this stands for” he said referring to the slogan on his placard.

Theo Thomas 69 said he regarded the visit of the royal family as the government joining in the exploitation of the people.

“I came out here because it’s a shame that a so-called progressive government would be using our people as props to entertain members of the Royal Family and there has been no conversation about reparations” said Thomas who travelled 11 miles from the western side of St. Vincent to the protest site.

“The royal family is in the position where they are today because of the pillage of our country and the enslavement of our ancestors” he said noting that Grenada had rejected the royal visit and speculated that the real reason was because of the demands for reparations there.

“And so for this so-called progressive government to be entertaining these people using these people as props is a crying shame” Thomas added.

St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a constitutional monarchy with the queen as the ceremonial head of state. In 2009 the population voted in a referendum to keep the British monarch and Thomas cautioned against using this as an indication of support for the monarchy.

Political observers have said that the constitutional reform vote 13 years ago was a referendum on the Gonsalves administration and electors might have voted differently if given a chance to vote on individual elements of the Constitution.

Sophie was invited to see the St Vincent and the Grenadines’ national bird the Amazona guildingii as part of her visit to the botanical gardens in the country on Saturday.

But as she entered the aviary the countess was unaware of one bird resting on the cage above her.

Her husband the Earl of Wessex was walking in behind her when the bird left its perch and flew over the top of her head forcing her to duck down and leaving her sunglasses falling down onto her face.

The Countess and guests all laughed at the moment which helped to lighten the mood and Sophie was later introduced to the Amazona guildingii feeding the birds from the palm of her hand.

A group of around 15 protesters displayed placards on Saturday as the pair made their way to Government House on the island. Banners read ""end to colonialism"" and ""#CompensationNow"" as well as ""Britain your debt is outstanding"".

The bird swooped down off its perch

The demonstration comes shortly after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were criticized for elements of their recent Caribbean tour deemed to hark back to colonial days.

Sophie and Edward arrived in Saint Lucia on Friday for the beginning of the week-long royal tour of the Caribbean ahead of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations.

If Japan’s Best Car can be believed Toyota thinks so and it’s dusted off the circa 2015 Toyota S-FR concept for production with the help of Daihatsu and Suzuki—two small car specialists the former of which is a Toyota subsidiary. Do we want to believe?

Of course we love the MX-5; we are enthusiasts who love sporty cars and Toyota’s no stranger to the segment. The last car it built in this class was the MR-2 Spyder a nominal Miata competitor that appealed to the quirkier and more hardcore enthusiasts. It had less curb appeal and more “budget Elise” mojo. But the S-FR (well the concept which is old) has one thing the MR2 Spyder doesn’t: undeniable cuteness. Rather than an amphibian shape made out of Duplos the S-FR is funky and organic—more Kermit and less Kerbal.

Forbes’ Japan-based reporter put hands on the exclusive Best Car report and from this we understand that the appeal of shared development costs and partner automakers is what makes the revival feasible. Well rumored revival. The evidence is thin to be clear. The Daihatsu Vision Copen apparently previews the bones of a future S-FR and seems an appropriate basis; the windshield surround and the doors look very S-FR. It’s rounded and cute. Toyota-izing it would be a simple task.

After all if Daihatsu is making a small convertible already it wouldn’t be difficult for Toyota to create a larger more powerful version at a different price point. Bringing in Suzuki’s small engine expertise would help reduce costs as well. Consider the BMW underpinnings of the latest Supra and the co-development of the GR86 and the Subaru BRZ. Toyota has signaled it won’t build a sports car without some aspect of it being shared or already in existence.

Best Car pegs the upcoming S-FR to debut in 2026 or 2027 with tweaked styling but a similar overall vibe to the 2015 S-FR concept and a 150-hp 1.3-liter turbo I-3 engine under the hood.

Plausible? Maybe. Probable? That’s another story entirely. And as for the U.S. market don't expect a Daihatsu-based anything to make it here; besides Toyota has the GR86 already which is essentially a roofed Miata fighter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9zZi9hcnRpY2xlL3MtZi12YWxlbmNpYS1zdHJlZXQtYmljeWNsZS1sYW5lLTE5NDQyMjcyLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,S.F.'s Valencia Street merchants endorse replacing center bikeway with protected side-running lanes,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/s-f-valencia-street-bicycle-lane-19442272.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9zZi9hcnRpY2xlL3MtZi12YWxlbmNpYS1zdHJlZXQtYmljeWNsZS1sYW5lLTE5NDQyMjcyLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vUG9saXRpY3MvcmZrLWpycy1jbGV2ZXItbW92ZS1lYXJuLWJhbGxvdC1hY2Nlc3MtbmF0aW9ud2lkZS9zdG9yeT9pZD0xMDk4NzIxOTfSAWhodHRwczovL2FiY25ld3MuZ28uY29tL2FtcC9Qb2xpdGljcy9yZmstanJzLWNsZXZlci1tb3ZlLWVhcm4tYmFsbG90LWFjY2Vzcy1uYXRpb253aWRlL3N0b3J5P2lkPTEwOTg3MjE5Nw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RFK Jr.'s 'clever move' to help earn ballot access nationwide: Allying with little-known parties,"""You usually don't see this kind of coordination and effort"" one expert said.

One Saturday last month several dozen members of the Alaskan Independence Party a small largely unknown political group whose primary goal is to put Alaskan secession from the United States to a vote gathered in Fairbanks for their biennial convention.

Among the topics of conversation: whether to nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for president.

The party ultimately rejected Kennedy who is running as an independent after a few outspoken members said they did not want him atop their 2024 ticket according to John Howe the party's chairman who was involved in the discussions.

""There was serious consideration"" Howe a machine shop owner told ABC News.

The decision to pass on Kennedy was seen as a blow to the candidate -- ""They wanted us to put him on the ballot"" Howe said -- as Kennedy works to overcome the biggest obstacle to his plans to run as a major outside candidate in November: getting on the ballot across the country.

Typically independent candidates must undergo the painstaking expensive process of gathering thousands of signatures from registered voters in each state in order to qualify for ballot access.

But a candidate can bypass those requirements if a political party that already has ballot access in a given state nominates them to lead their ticket there.

Kennedy has successfully employed that strategy in Michigan and California where he will technically appear on the ballot as the nominee for the Natural Law Party of Michigan and the American Independent Party of California.

What's more his campaign has been in contact with minor parties in at least six other states too ABC News has learned through conversations with leaders in more than a dozen minor parties across the country. (The Kennedy campaign did not return requests for comment for this story or respond to the details that the party leaders provided.)

""As the campaign sees and recognizes that these are very convenient vessels out there it's a clever move and it's not a surprise they do it"" Derek Muller a University of Notre Dame professor specializing in election law told ABC News.

Early polling of the 2024 race suggests Kennedy could take a notable amount of support in a close race between Donald Trump and Joe Biden the two leading candidates -- if Kennedy makes it on the ballot. A new ABC News/Ipsos survey of adults found Kennedy with 12% in a hypothetical five-way election with Trump Biden and two other candidates Cornel West and Jill Stein.

Kennedy's campaign claims to have made it on the ballot in 10 states so far including the battlegrounds of Michigan Nevada and North Carolina. Elections offices in three states have confirmed to ABC News that Kennedy is on the ballot. In other states officials have said they can't yet confirm his candidacy.

Kennedy's strategy of linking with minor parties has encountered both challenges and success. In some cases like Alaska the parties have rejected him while in others they are actively speaking with his campaign about nominating him.

His campaign tried and failed to earn the nomination of the Unity Party of Colorado which chose instead to back West another independent candidate Tijani Cole the party's chairman told ABC News in an email.

The Alliance Party a national group with ballot access in South Carolina has been more receptive.

""National Alliance Party leadership has begun early conversations with the campaign for potential mutual support"" Phil Feuhrer the party's national co-vice chair told ABC News in an email.

Besides nominating Kennedy to lead the party’s ticket in South Carolina Feuhrer said the party is discussing helping the Kennedy campaign gather signatures across Minnesota to appear as an independent candidate there.

""If we reach full agreement with the campaign and our internal statewide leadership teams it would include placement onto the South Carolina ballot as well as the Minnesota Independence-Alliance taking lead on placing the campaign onto the Minnesota ballot"" Feuhrer added using the official name of Minnesota's branch of the party.

""Those conversations are young and still ongoing"" he said.

Kennedy's camp is also in talks with the Reform Party which has ballot access in Florida and Mississippi according to party leaders.

Jenniffer Desatoff the party's Florida chair told ABC News they are ""continuing communication with the Kennedy campaign at this time."" (Kennedy's campaign also contacted the Ecology Party of Florida but was informed the party does not have a ballot line in the presidential race the party's chair Cara Campbell told ABC News.)

Elsewhere the Kennedy campaign twice reached out to representatives of the Constitution Party which has ballot access in nearly a dozen states but the party and the campaign were never able to connect Donna Ivanovich a spokeswoman for the party told ABC News.

Meanwhile Kennedy has formed a party of its own We the People to secure ballot access in several states including in Delaware Hawaii and North Carolina. In those states the signature threshold to make the ballot is lower for candidates aligned with a party than for independent candidates.

Although other independent candidates ally with minor parties for ballot access -- like West is also doing in the 2024 race -- the breadth and ""coordination"" of Kennedy's effort stands out said Muller the Notre Dame election law expert.

""You usually don't see this kind of coordination and effort because the candidacies are usually not serious enough to make the outreach to all these parties in all these different states"" he told ABC News.

But by aligning himself with small often niche parties Kennedy risks absorbing the burden of their sometimes checkered history some observers warned.

The American Independent Party of California which nominated Kennedy last month had backed George Wallace the former Alabama governor and notorious segregationist in the 1960s.

In a video announcing his nomination Kennedy acknowledged the party's past support for Wallace but said it ""has had its own rebirth even before I came along.""

""It's been reborn as a party that represents not bigotry and hatred but rather compassion unity idealism and common sense"" he said.

Another problem with wooing minor parties is that Kennedy's beliefs sometimes don't align with theirs.

The members of the Alaskan Independence Party who rejected Kennedy as the party's nominee were wary he would agree with them on their view that government-owned land should be given back to Alaskans Howe the party chairman told ABC News.

But Kennedy's chances at winning the nomination may have sunk days before the convention when he failed to win over the previous chair of the Alaskan Independence Party Bob Bird in a radio interview with Bird.

""The AIP will not be placing RFK on the ballot"" Bird wrote in a column after the interview casting Kennedy as an outsider.

""Our liberty and prosperity must come from within ourselves"" Bird wrote ""not from a knight galloping in from the Lower 48.""

Chilton Named 21st President of the University of New Hampshire,"Following a national search Elizabeth S. Chilton a native of the Northeast who most recently served as chancellor of Washington State University’s Pullman campus has been appointed the 21st president of the University of New Hampshire effective July 1 2024.

Chilton will succeed James W. Dean Jr. who is retiring after six years leading UNH. She was appointed the inaugural chancellor of Washington State’s Pullman campus in 2022 after joining WSU in 2020 as provost and executive vice president of the WSU system.

“UNH is a leading public university with strong student outcomes a large and diverse research portfolio and dedication to the state of New Hampshire and I am honored and humbled to have the opportunity to serve as president of this incredible institution” Chilton says. “I’ve long admired UNH’s history vibrant and engaged community and commitment to student success and scholarship. I look forward to returning to the Northeast to join the Wildcat family and help UNH serve our students and society in pursuit of a prosperous future.”

WSU Pullman is the system’s flagship and Washington State’s land grant university serving about 18000 students. Prior to becoming chancellor her role as chief academic officer included oversight of research functions across the six-campus system a role she continued in while serving as chancellor for the last two years.

A first-generation college student and a graduate of public universities Chilton is a champion for public higher education deeply committed to access and liberal arts education. She values UNH’s unique position as a leading public research institution that maintains a sharp focus on undergraduate education inspired by the university’s research mission while also remaining a strong believer in the power of a transformational undergraduate experience.

“Dr. Chilton has shown tremendous leadership and strategic vision across the academic and research enterprise and her career is a testament to the mission of public higher education” said Jamie Burnett ‘95 ‘96G ‘98G the vice-chair of the University System of New Hampshire Board of Trustees and chair of the presidential search committee. “She cares deeply about the student experience and is committed to advancing student success at UNH. She has a record of collaboration lifting up her peers building partnerships and creating opportunities. The UNH community and the state should have a high degree of confidence in Elizabeth’s appointment.”

Chilton’s appointment concludes a search launched last fall after Dean announced his intention to retire. A 16-member search committee comprised of representatives of the Board of Trustees faculty staff and students across UNH’s three campuses led the search.

Chilton will visit all three UNH campuses from May 9 to 11. She will spend May 9 and a portion of May 10 in Durham before visiting the Manchester and Concord campuses on the afternoon of the 10th.

“Elizabeth is a proven and versatile leader devoted to the mission and values of public land grant universities” said USNH Board Chair Alex Walker. “She brings the experience track record and capabilities to lead a multi-campus institution that is part of a larger well-coordinated public higher education system. She distinguished herself among a very strong pool of candidates as the right person to lead the University of New Hampshire in these dynamic and challenging times in higher education.”

From 2017 to 2020 Chilton was dean of the Harpur College of Arts and Sciences at Binghamton University part of the State University of New York system. Prior to that she spent 16 years at the University of Massachusetts Amherst serving in a variety of roles including professor anthropology department chair and associate vice chancellor for research and engagement.

She earned her bachelor’s degree in anthropology from the University at Albany SUNY and then her master’s and Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Her academic work focuses on the pre-colonial archaeology of Northeast North America as well as paleoecology cultural resource management heritage studies and materials science. She is the author of dozens of peer-reviewed book chapters and journal articles.

Chilton is an avid hiker kayaker and canoeist as well as an enthusiastic choral singer. Her husband Michael Sugerman is also an anthropology professor. The couple has an adult son and three lively dogs."

Towels on Deckchairs is a German startup that uses algorithms and manual workers to claim and hold the best desks. Our high-frequency bots can book slots as soon as reservation systems open; in offices that operate a finders-keepers system our gig workers will physically occupy space for our customers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2RhdGFkZWNpc2lvbm1ha2Vycy90aGUtbWV0YXZlcnNlLWlzLWEtdHJhbnNmb3JtYXRpb25hbC1vcHBvcnR1bml0eS1mb3ItdGhlLWJ1c2luZXNzLXdvcmxkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The metaverse is a transformational opportunity for the business world,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://venturebeat.com/datadecisionmakers/the-metaverse-is-a-transformational-opportunity-for-the-business-world/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2RhdGFkZWNpc2lvbm1ha2Vycy90aGUtbWV0YXZlcnNlLWlzLWEtdHJhbnNmb3JtYXRpb25hbC1vcHBvcnR1bml0eS1mb3ItdGhlLWJ1c2luZXNzLXdvcmxkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA0LzIzL2Vsb24tbXVzay1pbi1iYXR0bGUtdG8tc2xheS10d2l0dGVyLW5heXNheWVycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elon Musk in battle to slay Twitter naysayers,"The list of suitors who have looked at buying Twitter — and then passed without a second thought — are too many to be counted on one hand and possibly two or three.

That’s partly because for all of its relevance to breaking news starting revolutions — and generally increasing one’s cortisol levels during breakfast lunch and dinner — Twitter is a lousy business.

Yes it gets eyeballs but plenty of the wrong type. Let’s face it: Twitter is a weird social-media platform that attracts some of the worst elements of the human race: Trolls the people behind all those bots and ayatollahs are difficult to sell ads to.

Twitter’s progressive leaders and their programmers meanwhile have canceled too many conservative voices. Again let’s face it: People who voted for Trump represent a lot of ad dollars.

The result quarter after quarter year after year has been wonky revenue sputtering user growth and virtually nonexistent profits. Amid all this Twitter knew it needed to be sold and began a ­futile attempt to shop itself; Disney Salesforce and more passed after looking at the books.

Then along came Elon Musk the mercurial visionary billionaire with a novel idea: Let’s take Twitter private and fix its business problems away from the constant public scrutiny.

Musk’s agenda may seem revolutionary but only inside the progressive bubble that dominates media and tech: Let opposing viewpoints proliferate; verify ­users to combat trolling; maybe start charging a nominal fee even if it hurts Twitter’s already-weak user growth (which continues to maintain an uncomfortable reliance on users who troll under weird pseudonyms).

Most of all: Long-suffering shareholders will finally get paid. Ignore the $77 high in the stock last year; that was primed along with the rest of the market by Jerome Powell’s money printing which is over.

Twitter’s IPO priced at $26 settled its first day of trading at $44.90 about where it was before Musk said he would pony up $54.20 a share for the company. When the Fed starts to tighten who knows how low Twitter will fall.

Sounds like a great deal

Last week after days of speculation whether he was serious Musk signaled he is officially offering shareholders a lifeline. He filed with regulators paperwork stating he would throw in $21 billion of his own net worth.

($260 billion-plus) and finance the rest of the deal with debt that he has secured to reach his approximately $46 billion price tag.

Sounds like a great deal particularly for those smart techies who run Twitter and sit on its board right? Who else is willing to pay that kind of money for something that has never consistently made money? No one it seems because no one has so far stepped up to the plate.

But that logic only works outside the bubble that is Twitter and Silicon Valley’s ideological echo chamber. Yes the tech geeks like to make money but only on their terms. As this column goes to press Twitter is looking at spurning Musk’s bid. And the business media ideological blinders firmly attached is cheering it on.

I’m not sure how anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the way markets and finance are supposed to work can endorse one of the biggest insults to shareholder rights in recent memory but that is exactly what’s happening.

For a change it’s going to be fun rooting for the litigation-happy plaintiffs bar which would be on firm ground suing Twitter management for blowing this deal for the sake of making sure ­Donald Trump’s Twitter account remains suspended.

Tough man to root for

Musk of course does make it tough to be on his side. Remember the crazy “pedo guy” tweet that got him sued albeit unsuccessfully for libel or the infamous “funding secured” tweet to allegedly take Tesla private? On top of it all he’s facing lots of pressure from regulators on accounting ­issues involving Tesla as this column has noted.

But Musk is a survivor having turned around Tesla and avoided bankruptcy even as he was launching ambitious space-travel plans and more. More than that he will pay investors while he fixes things on his own dime along with few sophisticated ­lenders who know the odds.

In a world that’s supposed to be dominated — legally mind you — by what’s good for shareholders dissing Elon’s offer borders on being illegal. Even with the Twitter board putting up roadblocks (poison-pill takeover hurdles claims that his bid is undervalued) shareholders should ultimately get their say.

Musk is strongly hinting he will launch a ­tender offer directly to investors. They will then have a choice of whether to stay with the people who have created no shareholder value or side with one who has a track record of ­doing the opposite.

For all Elon’s craziness this one should be a no-brainer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd2FzaGluZ3RvbmV4ZWMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDQvYXBwaWFucy1hbmRyZXctY3VuamUtaXMtc2VjdXJpbmctaXQtc29sdXRpb25zLXRvLWFjY2VsZXJhdGUtbW9kZXJuaXphdGlvbi1lZmZvcnRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Appian's Andrew Cunje is Securing IT Solutions to Accelerate Modernization Efforts,"Andrew Cunje joined the Appian team in May 2021. As chief information security officer he brings over 20 years’ experience in security and compliance initiatives having ran security engineering and operations for the Salesforce Public Sector software-as-a-service offerings.

In his off hours he’s an avid gamer crypto enthusiast and motorcyclist. By day Cunje is focused on supporting customers’ cyber needs.

“Security definitely goes above and beyond compliance” he said. “With the convergence of IT and OT operational technology there’s a high degree of complexity. We’re helping to simplify that.”

Appian offers a low code platform that enables businesses and government agencies to create applications at scale. Click-and-drag app creation empowers developers to standardize across platforms in a highly secure environment.

This in turn helps accelerate modernization efforts.

“Instead of a government entity having to worry about hiring a contractor that has secure-cleared developers they can use our platform with their existing workforce to create new processes or workflows off of their existing data sets” Cunje said.

As CISO Cunje works to ensure that happens securely.

“Customers rely on us to deliver a secure solution whether that’s their corporate on-prem or our cloud offering” he said. “Security is baked into the process wherever the customers and their data exist.”

To deliver on that promise Cunje looks to leverage economies of scale: finding solutions that work across a disparate and global user base.

“The key is to discover the common denominators across all of the different compliance frameworks then using that to raise the bar for all customers” he said. “That yields an acceleration curve bringing our product to as many customers as possible with the highest degree of security.”

Another key to secure IT solutions: simplicity.

“Simplicity allows you to create consistency and the more things are consistent and measurable the easier the job of security becomes” Cunje said. “We want to address all of those complex requirements with a single high bar then you can secure things consistently. What’s good for one customer or region from a security perspective is good for the next.”

In terms of business strategy delivering on the promise of simplicity opens doors for Appian among government customers looking to accelerate their modernization efforts. They help customers to build fewer things better Cunje said.

“By making things more consistent in their development and deployment we can give them easy access to the latest zero-code integrations pre-built industry standard connectors methodologies and tools” he said. “We make it very easy for them to build secure applications. We give them secure methods secure options out the box.”

As for many in the IT security space Cunje’s biggest challenge is the fast-changing threat landscape.

“Threat actors move at a grueling pace” he said. “But that’s also what makes it exciting. You can kind of always find new ways to break a system. The challenge is to be able to respond and protect that at scale.”

For federal agencies the recent executive order on zero trust gives a nod to this complexity. The bad actors “are exploiting applications in more sophisticated ways” Cunje said. “Those are interesting problems for us in the security community to solve.”

So how can GovCons and agencies keep ahead in this highly charged threat environment?

“You have to assume the possibility of a breach” Cunje said. “That means you build systems to be more resilient in failure.”

“As an industry we have to think about leveraging ‘hyper least privilege’ as a concept that is core to security” he continued. “That’s applying least-privilege not just in the traditional sense but to everything: how you build systems and networks how you establish trust and identities. Think micro policy on macro security principles to build highly resilient security via dynamic configuration.”

Along these same lines it makes sense to promote a pervasive culture of cyber awareness.

“Security is everyone’s job” Cunje said. “It needs to be considered a part of all workloads.”

It helps too when GovCons and other key players pool their insights to stay ahead of the bad actors.

“We do need more collaboration across the industry” Cunje added. “We’re all up against the same bad actors and threat actors and we in security could be working together to find solutions not just here but with other nations as well.”

A longtime veteran of the government space Cunje said he takes special pleasure in tackling the technical challenges around cybersecurity.

“New technologies come out all the time and the most interesting part of the puzzle is in looking at how you can put things together in a way that make it very very difficult to break” he said.

“The fact that it’s continuously evolving and changing keeps me on my toes” he added. “In this business you always have to read the next book learn about the next technology. In a field like this complacency is very dangerous and I really enjoy that sense of continuous evolution.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL2RhaWx5Z3VpZGVuZXR3b3JrLmNvbS93YW50LXRvLWxpdmUtaGVhbHRoaWVyLWxvbmdlci1jZW8tb2YtbWF4LWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtam9zZXBoLXZveXRpY2t5LXVucmF2ZWxzLXNlY3JldHMtdG8tbGl2aW5nLWhlYWx0aGllci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Want To Live Healthier Longer? CEO of Max International Joseph Voyticky Unravels Secrets to living healthier,"Joseph Voyticky

Having successfully expanded its operations into 19 countries Max International ( Max.com ) focuses on providing legitimate long term economic opportunity for its business partners in all markets based upon its outstanding science-based products top quality training and personal development.

During his recent visit to Africa the international businessman visited Nigeria and Ghana where he granted interviews with some prominent media firms where he discussed the enviable opportunities i.e. amazing travel opportunities embedded in Max International ( Max.com ) for its associates and partners.

He also revealed the astonishing health benefits of Riboceine which helps to promote the production of Glutathione in human cells. Max International’s products which are authorized and approved by NAVDAC are available throughout the world market.

According to Mr. Voyticky Cellgevity provides the ultimate in glutathione enhancement which delivers RiboCeine a patented ingredient and twelve other essential nutrients that support glutathione’s vital role in removing harmful toxins assists in reducing cellular inflammation and neutralizing free radical damage in the body.

Speaking on a Nigeria based radio station Mr. Voyticky disclosed that his extended visit to some countries across Africa i.e. Ghana Ivory Coast Nigeria and Kenya forms part of efforts by him and his entourage to provide products that will improve the health of people around the globe. His assertion is that by providing high quality products backed by scientific validation to Max’s salesforce will provide legitimate long term economic opportunity for its business partners in all markets.

Its goal is to address the climate crisis by working toward a net-zero energy future—in other words lowering carbon emissions and generating electricity more efficiently. It began using Amazon WorkSpaces with its back-office support by working with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) an AWS Partner and an IT services consulting and business solutions organization that has been partnering with EDF. And before the COVID-19 pandemic EDF had also been working with Contino an AWS Partner. “We needed to make sure our system was modern and met the needs of our business” says Lillingston. “Using a mix of services from TCS and Contino we gained the support capability and software engineering capability that would help our system scale and meet the usage pattern of our business.”

Contino helps companies facilitate digital transformation and cloud adoption at scale. “We had been helping EDF adopt AWS with a cloud-native mindset since March 2019” says Tegid Edwards a client director at Contino. “We were initially engaged with EDF as part of the company’s Residential Accelerator program an initiative that looked at transforming the way EDF delivered residential energy to four million customers in the United Kingdom.” Since earlier in 2020 Contino had been working with EDF to establish a cloud-native AWS Landing Zone—a solution that helps customers more quickly set up secure multiaccount AWS environments—with a modern cloud operating model that would facilitate a multimodel delivery of digital services.

EDF partnered with TCS from an early phase of its cloud journey on AWS. “Our strategic partnership with EDF goes back 12 years and spans business and IT services” says Yunas Mohammad client partner for TCS Utilities. “Over the years we have built a strong digital foundation for EDF on data and the cloud. This foundation coupled with maturity in Agile and DevOps delivery helped us take up the challenge when the COVID-19 pandemic struck.” TCS made significant contributions in building a complete automated solution to provision Amazon WorkSpaces desktops with robust security controls and packaged application software. When the COVID-19 pandemic began impacting the UK EDF used its existing collaborations and the infrastructure it had built with TCS and Contino to rapidly move a large portion of its global workforce to remote working environments.

Because EDF had already used the services of AWS Partners to build a cloud-native AWS Landing Zone it had worked out several issues related to networking security identity access management and multi-factor authentication. But when it came to standing up remote workstations on top of the necessary network functionality EDF found that its existing on-premises environment couldn’t scale to the company’s requirements at the speed required. That’s when Amazon WorkSpaces which can scale quickly emerged as a viable alternative. The team also anticipated that the move would be user friendly for employees around the globe. “Once you’re using Amazon WorkSpaces there’s no real difference from a standard desktop” says Lillingston.

The food stamp program we know today the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program -- aka SNAP -- was created by the U.S. federal government to end hunger and move people forward to self-sufficiency. SNAP was built on the foundation of the first Food Stamp Program which was established in 1939. The initial program which has evolved over many decades began to be referred to as SNAP in 2008.

Over 42 million qualifying people in the U.S. currently use SNAP benefits to purchase fruits vegetables meat poultry fish dairy products breads cereals snack foods non-alcoholic beverages and seeds and plants that produce food. However items such as cleaning supplies pet foods hygiene products cosmetics and ready-to-eat hot foods are not eligible to be purchased with these government-issued benefits.

To qualify for SNAP benefits you must not exceed SNAP gross and net monthly income limits or the program's resource limits. For example a family of four cannot exceed a gross monthly income of $2871 a net monthly income of $2209 or $2500 in countable resources such as cash or money in a bank account. It's important to note that if one member of the family is at least 60 or disabled different limits will apply.

To determine the 15 states where the most people rely on SNAP for their groceries GOBankingRates referred to the ""Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: Number of Person's Participating"" report from the United States Department of Agriculture specifically the data for December 2020 and December 2021. To help gain perspective the total population for each state is included according to the U.S. Census Bureau's latest estimates dated July 2021.

Some of the states listed have experienced an increase in SNAP participation since December 2020 and some have experienced a decrease. However what all 15 states have in common is that their populations have the most people relying on SNAP for their groceries compared to other states.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger

Claudia Harris and her husband John Wiley Jr. are members of what they say is the last all-volunteer non-billing ambulance service in Vermont. The work requires that they undergo continuous training.

But because their Landgrove home has an early and relatively slow form of broadband called digital subscriber line or DSL which uses telephone land lines training became a challenge when their courses moved online during the first months of the pandemic. They periodically lost their connection.

“During those early days of the pandemic we were trying to learn how to provide health care to our neighbors and we had a really hard time Zooming” said Harris.

Harris has a pole on her property that offers fiber because a neighbor ordered a business line but Harris said she cannot access it without paying the provider Consolidated Communications hundreds of dollars a month.

Harris and her husband are not alone. Their frustrations are shared by others in Landgrove who spoke to VTDigger reflecting the challenges of many Vermonters who live in rural towns with the least access to high-speed internet. And they could be waiting for a while before getting faster service.

Vermont is counting on hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding for an ambitious plan to bring fiber optic service to every home on the electric grid within five years. But Christine Hallquist whom Gov. Phil Scott appointed last year to oversee the delivery of that service told VTDigger last week that inflation and supply-chain problems could slow the project.

“We’ve got a lot of funding” Hallquist said. “Do we have enough? That is quite questionable. Probably not likely with the inflation that’s happening.”

Hallquist the executive director of the Vermont Community Broadband Board said it would probably cost the state more than $1 billion to connect every home to fiber so the state is counting on private telecommunications providers to take care of all the homes that already have cable.

“We believe those will ultimately get connected by fiber and that allows us to focus on the underserved and unserved areas” Hallquist said.

For the largely rural regions of the state without access to high-speed internet Vermont is relying on a strategy of allowing municipalities to band together into communications union districts or CUDs to build fiber optic service.

Hallquist said that last August she estimated it would cost $550 million to connect every Vermont home without a reliable high-speed connection to fiber optic service. She said the board wanted to provide the communications union districts with 60% of the total cost of building out fiber networks or $345 million in grants — if that estimate held. The districts could then go to the bond markets to borrow the rest.

But Hallquist expects that number to continue to rise due to nationwide competition for labor and materials.

Even last year’s $550 million estimate far exceeded the $362 million to $439 million the Vermont 10-year Telecom Plan also published last year estimated it would cost to connect those homes. Hallquist noted that estimate was based on 2020 calculations.

“Costs have risen and we now have a more accurate estimate” Hallquist said. “Our revised numbers are based on the current quotes that we are receiving with more detailed business plans provided by the CUDs.”

The cost of materials Hallquist said is increasing the likely cost of building out fiber. She noted that every other state is competing for materials to build out its broadband network now that federal funding is available from the American Rescue Plan Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act — both signed into law last year by President Joe Biden.

Hallquist said supply-chain problems could also delay Vermont’s ability to complete the buildout in five years. She said wait times for some materials are now one year. She added that the board has pre-purchased some of those materials and said it is working with the communications union districts to identify how long the wait time is for every part.

“One bolt can hold up the whole thing” she said.

Labor is critical as well Hallquist said predicting Vermont will need an additional 216 fiber technicians to meet a five-year construction schedule.

In December and January the board issued about $22 million in pre-construction funds to perform detailed design Hallquist said noting that the design would tackle a key question: “How are we going to get to every address?”

Robert Fish deputy director of the Vermont Community Broadband Board said Consolidated Communications alone is planning to offer fiber optic service to 200000 Vermont homes that already have cable.

Fish cited figures from the state’s Department of Public Service that show 64000 Vermont homes do not have access to a reliable wireline connection that can achieve 100 megabytes per second of download and upload. Fish said these are the addresses that the board seeks to connect to fiber optic service through grants.

Anticipating inflation the board facilitated the pre-purchase of about 2000 miles of fiber optic cable last year Fish said. The first order arrived in East Montpelier last Thursday.

“We’re ahead of most states now” Fish said.

The role of CUDs

As of Jan. 26 according to a map produced by the community broadband board 206 Vermont municipalities covering 64% of Vermont’s population and 91% of unserved locations had joined a communications union district.

“Most of the remaining towns have a great deal of cable or are well served by their existing provider” Fish said.

Hallquist said individual towns not in a communications union district can apply for grants through the state if they partner with an existing broadband provider.

“Those towns are also likely not to get as good a deal as a communications union district” Fish said. “Providers would much rather work with 20 to 50 towns working together than one town at a time.”

Communications union districts have no power to tax. They can only fund themselves by applying for grants or by borrowing money.

The Vermont Center for Geographic Information’s map allows Vermonters to search by street address to see which homes are already connected to broadband.

Fish said that of the nine communications union districts created so far he expects seven to do some construction this year. Earlier this month Fish said the board authorized such districts to buy materials that are now taking a long time to obtain. Last week it awarded NEK Broadband the Northeast Kingdom district an additional $1.3 million and Maple Broadband a district of 20 municipalities in Addison County an additional $781284 to make sure they could begin construction this summer or fall.

Fish said that on Monday the board would consider providing a $421000 construction grant for WCVT in Bolton an additional $15.9 million for NEK Broadband and tentatively an additional $11.2 million for Maple Broadband.

He said the board received $150 million in federal funds last year from Act 71. And it’s expecting $95 million in the state budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1.

Act 71 is a $150 million broadband package approved by the Legislature last year. The law used federal money from the federal American Rescue Plan Act to fund preconstruction and construction projects by the state’s Communications Union Districts. It also established the Vermont Community Broadband Board.

“Vermont is actually leading the nation in terms of the work” Hallquist said. “‘And it’s because the Legislature set up these communications union districts.”

Two districts are ahead of the rest and are already providing service. ECFiber a district that includes 30 towns in the Upper Valley and more than 5000 customers has been operational for more than 10 years Fish said. NEK Broadband brought its first project covering Concord and a portion of Lunenburg online in January he noted.

The Concord and Lunenburg project was largely funded through the U.S. Department of Agriculture according to Will Anderson program coordinator for the Vermont Communications Union Districts Association.

Maple Broadband CVFiber in Central Vermont and DVFiber in the Deerfield Valley have agreements with private partners to design build and operate networks and are awaiting grants as they also try to obtain materials and sign labor contracts.

The Northwest CUD and the Lamoille CUD are planning to partner with Google Fiber and are expecting to start construction this year according to Anderson. He said they are a little bit behind the first five districts.

The two districts that are probably farthest behind are in southwestern Vermont Anderson said. They are Otter Creek in Rutland County and Southern Vermont CUD in Bennington County. Anderson said they got started later but are making progress.

“Southern Vermont definitely faces some of the greatest challenges of any CUD” Anderson said. “They have a large quantity of cable internet service existing already which makes it difficult to sell the idea of a fiber network to potential partners. So this has been a complication for them.”

But the chair of the Southern Vermont Communications Union District Eric Hatch is optimistic.

“The goal of our CUD is really to be the first to finish and have the most fibered CUD in the state” he said.

The National Telecommunications and Information Administration recently denied the Southern Vermont Communications Union District an $8.1 million grant to buy fiber. Hatch said the agency did not explain why Southern Vermont did not get the grant. The agency’s website only lists winning grants. Plan B he said is to get funding from the state.

Hatch said the district is working with its private partner Consolidated Communications to get everyone in the district’s 12 towns connected by 2024. Hatch said the company is planning to invest $6 million of its own money. He said trucks in Bennington and Shaftsbury are already rolling fiber optic wire out to telephone poles. Consolidated Communications already has fiber for the next two years of the Southern Vermont project as well as the labor he added.

According to Hatch the company will have connected 400 of the district’s 2500 underserved and unserved homes by the end of this year with its own capital. The communications union district he said will fund the connection of most of the remaining 2100 homes next year with the 100 most remote homes possibly having to wait until 2024.

In coming weeks the district plans to publish a list of all the homes in the district indicating when they can expect to be connected to fiber optic service Hatch said noting that low-income homes may only need to pay $20 a month for fiber optic service.

For Claudia Harris the rural Landgrove emergency services volunteer it likely means at least another year-and-a-half of waiting for broadband.

“I’ve heard it before and won’t believe it until I see it” Harris said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9ubHlpbnlvdXJzdGF0ZS5jb20vc291dGhlcm4tY2FsaWZvcm5pYS9waWNrLXlvdXItb3duLWZydWl0LWZhcm1zLXNvLWNhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 Farms Perfect For Fruit Picking In Southern California,"Fruit Picking in Southern California

Before it can become a hub of housing business and governance for southern Manitoba First Nations however the nearly century-old building needs a lot of work.

During a gifting ceremony Friday the Hudson's Bay Co. handed ownership of the historic Portage Avenue building to the Southern Chiefs' Organization. Many speakers there became emotional as they talked about what the project could mean for First Nations people in Winnipeg and for the city as a whole.

""I truly got shivers as I had begun to realize that this is so much bigger than any of us will ever understand"" said Sophia Smoke 14 from Dakota Plains First Nation describing her experience participating in a pipe and water ceremony to bless the $130-million project.

""We will only understand when it is written in the history books. My grandchildren will understand and feel the impact of this sooner than I will.""

But SCO Grand Chief Jerry Daniels speaking to reporters after the ceremony acknowledged the work the building will need.

""I think we have to change some of the interior.… The middle of the building is where I think a lot of the attention will be focused"" he said.

The plan for the building includes the creation of an atrium with a view of the sky. A 2019 appraisal noted that the 655000-square-foot building which was constructed in 1926 lets in very little natural light.

The plan also includes nearly 300 units of affordable housing as well as space for businesses including two restaurants and a new seat for the Southern Chiefs' Organization which represents 34 Anishinaabe and Dakota nations in southern Manitoba and more than 81000 people.

Daniels expects the project to be completed within three years.

As with any major construction project however timelines can shift depending on unforeseen circumstances and the redevelopment of the Bay faces some unusual challenges due to its designation as a heritage building.

""Anybody who's fixed up an old house in Winnipeg knows that once you start tearing out electrics and plumbing and things like that you don't really know what's behind those walls"" said Christian Cassidy a local historian who has written extensively about Winnipeg's architectural history.

The 2019 appraisal estimated it would cost $111 million to bring the building up to code while retaining its heritage elements and pegged its market value at $0.

The building's heritage status means renovations need to be ""sympathetic"" to parts of its original design said Heritage Winnipeg executive director Cindy Tugwell.

That includes its Tyndall limestone facade main floor display windows curved elevators and reinforced concrete structural system.

Tugwell said she's excited to see how the building gets modernized while maintaining those heritage elements.

Most of all she's happy to see the iconic building being put to good use she told Up to Speed guest host Emily Brass during a Friday interview.

""I think it's key to [the] protection of any building. You can designate it [as historic] but if it's not fully occupied in a vibrant part of the community you're not going to ultimately protect that building for long"" Tugwell said.

""Change is inevitable. And if it's thought out with all stakeholders I think it's only positive and it's only going to be great for this city and this province.""

Developments stalled

Cassidy noted that Winnipeg has seen numerous projects announced that failed to materialize including one example directly connected to the Bay building via the downtown skywalk.

The redevelopment of the Portage Place mall stalled after Starlight Investments walked away from a plan to build a $400-million mixed use housing and retail project.

Looking east of the Bay the Graham Avenue property that was to become the SkyCity condo tower remains a parking lot after that $200-million development fell through.

Still the enthusiasm of the parties involved along with the financial support from government gives Cassidy hope for the Bay's redevelopment.

The Manitoba government has pledged $35 million to help with a $25-million trust fund announced last year plus an additional $10 million for the housing component.

Another $65 million is coming from the federal government through a $55-million forgivable loan and a $10-million low-cost loan.

The City of Winnipeg has been asked to improve streetscaping and contribute tax increment financing which would involve forgoing future property tax revenue emanating from the site Mayor Brian Bowman said Friday.

""It seems like they have some funding behind them and they're enthusiastic and they have a great vision"" said Cassidy. ""Those are … some of the things you need to to get a project like this started.""

The project could have a major impact on Winnipeg's downtown as it begins to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic says Jino Distasio a University of Winnipeg geography professor and a past director of its Institute of Urban Studies.

""Maybe this post-pandemic downtown is going to be much more engaging"" he told Marcy Markusa in a Friday interview with CBC's Information Radio.

""It's going to take a few years but I think we're going to see a shift in momentum.""",,,

Finance website WalletHub revealed the best and worst US airlines based on data from the Department of Transportation.

Delta Air Lines took the top spot scoring high in terms of reliability comfort and customer satisfaction.

Southwest ranked dead last followed by American Airlines JetBlue Airways and Frontier Airlines.

Personal finance website WalletHub revealed the best airlines in the US based on 2021 flight data collected from the US Department of Transportation.

The company ranked 11 carriers from best to worst including mainline airlines like American and Southwest and low-cost carriers like Spirit and Frontier.

Two regional carriers — SkyWest Airlines and Envoy Air — were included because they make up at least 1% of domestic scheduled service and report data to the DOT according to the company.

WalletHub scored each airline based on 16 metrics across four main categories including baggage departures and complaints animal-related incidents inflight comfort and safety. Subcategories included factors like delays WiFi availability legroom denied boardings and price.

While price is a common dealbreaker for many consumers WalletHub noted that its report examines ""overlooked aspects of air travel"" to help travelers ""make more informed decisions."" However the company said ""for the sake of fairness"" it considered costs ""in relation to inflight amenities.""

""For example it wouldn't be right to penalize an airline that charges for drinks if its tickets are far cheaper than those from an airline with free in-flight refreshments"" it explained.

WalletHub took each airline's score from the four major categories to determine the overall best and worst carriers in the US. Scores were based on specific criteria like the rate of delays or the number of customer complaints.

Then the company totaled the points from each category to give an overall performance rank. Delta earned the highest score of 70.48 out of 100 while Southwest came in last with just 30.60 points earned.

WalletHub disclosed that each metric was allowed a maximum number of available points an airline could earn and that the weight of each and its calculation into the overall score was based on the company's subjective view. However it said points were generally allocated ""based on common sense.""

In addition to ranking the best airline the company also gave six other awards including cheapest airline safest airline most reliable airline the best airline for pets least complained-about airline and most comfortable airline.

Delta took home the most medals including being the best overall US airline the most reliable and tied for the safest for animals. Meanwhile JetBlue and Frontier earned top spots for comfort and affordability respectively.

Here's a closer look at WalletHub's best and worst US airlines and the individual awards each received.







11. Southwest Airlines

Ashlee D. Smith/Southwest Airlines

Southwest ranked last on WalletHub's list bringing up the rear in several categories including being the least reliable and the least safe airline. WalletHub gave Southwest a score of 7.84 out of 50 for reliability whereas the top performers including Delta and Hawaiian scored above 30.

The data also showed Southwest's reliability tanked in comparison to the year prior which earned a score of 26.80. This is likely in part due to the airline's multi-day meltdown in October 2021 that left thousands of passengers stranded.

The airline got its low safety rating due to an uncontained engine failure in 2018 that resulted in the death of a passenger which forced WalletHub to deduct points.

10. American Airlines

American aircraft. Airbus

American ranked second-to-last on WalletHub's list earning low scores in reliability price and safety. According to the data the carrier sustained at least 50 passenger or employee injuries that required medical care in 2021 causing its low safety rating.

Meanwhile the carrier earned a reliability score of 14.24 though it did earn a higher comfort score of 4 out of 5.

9. JetBlue Airways

JetBlue A320 aircraft. Marcus Mainka/Shutterstock

JetBlue was named the worst US airline by the Wall Street Journal earlier this year due to poor on-time performance and a high number of passenger complaints.

WalletHub's data reared similar results scoring its reliability at 16.52 out of 50 as well ranking fourth in terms of customer complaints.

However not all is bad for JetBlue. The carrier was ranked the best airline for onboard comfort including offering free amenities like WiFi inflight entertainment snacks and beverages. The carrier also offers the most legroom in economy Conde Nest Traveler reported.

8. Frontier Airlines

Frontier Airlines Carlos Yudica

Frontier ranked low in terms of reliability with a score of 13.18 and came in last for comfort due to a lack of inflight amenities like WiFi or free snacks and drinks.

The carrier also configures its planes with 28 inches of legroom which is the lowest offered in the US according to travel magazine AFAR.

However Frontier did earn the top ranking for affordability offering consumers the cheapest plane tickets of any other carrier. The data showed Frontier's airfare averaged 3.53 cents per mile.

7. United Airlines

While United ranked low compared to other carriers it received the third-best reliability score of 26.67 out of 50 and a high comfort score of 4.5 out of 5.

However its low overall ranking can be contributed to its high number of passenger complaints. According to DOT data United had 3581 complaints in 2021 which came out to 29.73 complaints per 100000 passengers WalletHub revealed.

6. SkyWest Airlines

Regional carrier SkyWest which flies on behalf of United Delta American and Alaska earned high rankings for pet-friendliness and customer satisfaction. Specifically the carrier received 328 complaints in total according to DOT data giving it a rate of 0.92 complaints per 100000 passengers.

Because Skywest flies for four carriers WalletHub used the average maximum and minimum scores for each situation to determine the regional carrier's overall comfort score.

5. Spirit Airlines

Rounding out the top five carriers Spirit Airlines performed well in 2021 in terms of affordability and safety.

The carrier is the second-cheapest airline behind Frontier with an average airfare of 3.82 cents per mile. Meanwhile the airline received a score of 19.99 out of 50 for reliability which is average compared to other airlines.

Like Frontier Spirit did rank low in onboard comfort offering no free amenities inflight except for a seat and a personal item.

4. Envoy Air

Envoy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of American and is one of the top-performing operators according to WalletHub. The airline earned an overall score of 60.46 out of 100 which is double Southwest's score of 30.60. It also scored high for pet safety.

However Envoy was the most expensive carrier of 2021 with an average fare of 12.42 cents per mile. This can mostly be attributed to the carrier flying on behalf of American to small markets that have higher operating costs causing airfare to increase.

3. Alaska Airlines

Alaska Airlines. Alaska Airlines

Alaska is the third-best airline in the US according to WalletHub. The airline earned the title of the safest airline and scored high in terms of reliability comfort and price.

The airline scored 4.5 out of 5 for comfort tying with Delta and just losing out to JetBlue.

2. Hawaiian Airlines

Hawaiian Airlines Boeing 767 Angel DiBilio/Shutterstock

Hawaiian is the runner-up this year scoring high in affordability reliability and safety. However the airline only beat out Spirit and Frontier in terms of comfort scoring 2 out of 5.

Meanwhile the airline had the second-highest number of passenger complaints with 37.63 per 100000 passengers according to WalletHub data. The airline received an overall high score due to its strong on-time performance and safety.

1. Delta Air Lines

Just like the Wall Street Journal WalletHub named Delta the best airline in the US. The Atlanta-based carrier is the most reliable airline and came in second for comfort tieing with Alaska Southwest and United.

The airline has also proved its responsibility with pets reporting no animal-related incidents in 2021. Moreover the airline had one of the lowest rates of consumer complaints receiving 1.92 complaints per 100000 passengers according to WalletHub data.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vYmVhdG9maGF3YWlpLmNvbS9haXJsaW5lLXJhbmtpbmdzLW9uLWZsaWdodHMtdG8taGF3YWlpLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airline Rankings On Flights To Hawaii 2023,Beat of Hawaii's Special Picks for You,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL3NlbGVjdC9jaGFzZS1zYXBwaGlyZS1wcmVmZXJyZWQtZmF2b3JpdGUtdHJhdmVsLXJld2FyZHMtY3JlZGl0LWNhcmQv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wL3NlbGVjdC9jaGFzZS1zYXBwaGlyZS1wcmVmZXJyZWQtZmF2b3JpdGUtdHJhdmVsLXJld2FyZHMtY3JlZGl0LWNhcmQv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Chase Sapphire Preferred is my favorite travel rewards card and it's offering a 80000-point welcome bonus,"Some offers mentioned below are no longer available. The Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card is a great travel rewards credit card for plenty of reasons but a few stand out perks include its valuable and transferable Chase Ultimate Rewards® points and comprehensive travel insurance benefits — not only that there are no foreign transaction fees and you'll only have to pay a $95 annual fee. And while it may not have as many flashy perks as some of the other premium travel rewards credit cards out of the more than 70 credit cards I've had in my lifetime I've found it to be one of the best. If you're in the market for a new travel rewards credit card the Chase Sapphire Preferred is currently offering a huge 80000-point bonus as its welcome offer for new cardholders available after you spend $4000 within the first three months of card membership and worth a value of $1000 in flights hotels and/or car rentals when redeemed through Ultimate Rewards (and potentially even more if you transfer to partners). Here's a look at some of the reasons why I've enjoyed using the Chase Sapphire Preferred over the past six months and why it continues to be a top-of-the-wallet credit card for me.

My experience with the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card

For several years I wasn't able to get the Chase Sapphire Preferred card because of Chase's 5/24 rule which excludes applicants who have been approved for more than five credit cards within the last 24 months. Because I was always on the hunt for the next valuable welcome offer I continued to consistently exceed that five-card limit. Eventually I found myself within the bounds of the 5/24 rule applied for the card and was approved in Oct. 2021. Soon after I earned the welcome bonus after meeting the minimum spending requirement of $4000 within the first three months of account opening and the 80000 points I received provided a value of $1000 in flights and hotels when redeemed via Ultimate Rewards. Here's why I've found this credit card to be so valuable. Travel insurance is a major included perk When you book travel with the Chase Sapphire Preferred card you're immediately covered with the following travel insurance policies: Trip cancellation and trip interruption insurance

Trip delay reimbursement

Auto rental collision damage waiver (primary rental car insurance)

Baggage delay insurance These benefits have been extremely valuable to me as I've had numerous occasions where my travel plans have gone awry. Most recently when I was flying from California to Florida during the holidays my flight was cancelled due to bad weather and I was forced to stay the night. Thankfully my trip delay insurance kicked in and covered my overnight hotel and meal costs which came to about $250. By saving my receipts and submitting a claim I was able to receive a direct deposit for the related expenses back into my checking account a few months later. Ultimate Rewards points are valuable and easy to use The Ultimate Rewards points I've earned continue to provide excellent value for me. Specifically my partner and I appreciate the ability to transfer them to Southwest Rapid Rewards points at a 1:1 ratio. After recently earning the Southwest Companion Pass with the welcome bonus from the Southwest Rapid Rewards® Plus Credit Card I can now take the points I earn using the Chase Sapphire Preferred card and transfer them to Southwest. And with my Companion Pass perk I can book almost-free flights for myself and my travel buddy as I'm able to book myself with Southwest points and my partner flies for free (we just have to pay the taxes and fees). I've also been able to transfer my Ultimate Rewards points to both the IHG Rewards and Marriott Bonvoy loyalty programs to book free hotel stays during my travels. Best of all I'm always guaranteed a 1.25 cent per point value by using my points within the Chase Travel Portal though in most cases I can usually find a better value by transferring them directly to one of Chase's 14 hotel or airline partners including the following loyalty programs: Aer Lingus AerClub

Air Canada Aeroplan

British Airways Executive Club

Emirates Skywards

Flying Blue (KLM and Air France)

Iberia Plus

JetBlue TrueBlue

Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer

Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards

United Airlines MileagePlus

Virgin Atlantic Flying Club

IHG Rewards Club

Marriott Bonvoy

World of Hyatt For example with the current 80000-point welcome offer you could: Transfer 50000 points to Virgin Atlantic Flying Club to book a one-way flight in business class on Delta Air Lines from the U.S. to Europe (retail price: $2800+). You'll still have 30000 points leftover.

What to consider if you're interested in this card

While the Chase Sapphire Preferred card is an excellent option for people who enjoy traveling ultimately it may not be the best choice if you have other needs. Here's what else you should consider before applying for the card: Options for transferring rewards While you can always cash in your rewards points via the Chase Ultimate Rewards travel portal to get the biggest bang for your buck you're almost certainly better off transferring them to one of the partners listed above. However you should also consider who those partners are — and how often you travel with them — before applying as another travel rewards card could offer different options. Personally I enjoy being able to transfer mine to Southwest Airlines Virgin Atlantic Flying Club (so I can fly with Delta Air Lines) British Airways (so I can fly with American Airlines or Alaska Airlines) JetBlue IHG and Marriott. Check and see if Chase's available transfer partners fit your travel needs — if they don't American Express and Capital One each offer travel rewards credit cards with transferable rewards to different partners that may work better for you. Consider 'doubling-down' on Ultimate Rewards The next step up from the Chase Sapphire Preferred card is the Chase Sapphire Reserve® which offers even more travel benefits including lounge access and fee credits for expedited airport security programs among others. While you aren't allowed to have both cards in your possession at the same time you can always decide to upgrade to the Chase Sapphire Reserve later on. If you're a business owner you also have the option to apply for a business credit card such as the Chase Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card. The card is currently offering a large welcome offer of 100000 bonus points after you spend $8000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening. Finally you can add the no annual fee Chase Freedom Unlimited® or Chase Freedom Flex℠ to earn bonus points in other categories like drug stores and then combine points earned from those cards with your Sapphire cards to make them more valuable.

Bottom line

The Chase Sapphire Preferred Card continues to be a staple in many travelers' wallets for its great value and transferable points network among other valuable perks. Its 80000-point welcome offer also provides a great opportunity to offset rising travel costs since it's worth $1000 of travel booked through the Chase portal all for a modest $95 annual fee. Even if you only fly or stay at hotels a few times a year this card has the potential to quickly pay dividends in saving you money on your travels while also allowing you to earn rewards points. And with the travel landscape continuing to be unpredictable simply using this card to book your trips could wind up saving you hundreds in case your plans go awry.

Woolen came to UTSA as a receiver switched positions to cornerback as a sophomore and is now poised to be the third player in Roadrunner history ever selected in the NFL Draft.

“I never played defense my entire life” Woolen said. “One day at the back of a receiver meeting Coach Wilson pulled me to the back and was like ‘I want you to try out playing cornerback.’”

Woolen — who played sparingly as a receiver his first two years at UTSA — reluctantly agreed to the change.

“I didn’t embrace it at first. I was just thinking you know why me? Why are they switching my position?” Woolen said. “But once I started to embrace it I started to have fun.”

He saw action in the final two games of the 2019 season. Coach Frank Wilson was fired after the season putting Woolen’s position switch in question.

Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. That’s when Woolen got an Instagram message from a FedEx delivery driver in San Antonio.

“Nobody at the time knew if I was gonna play receiver or corner” Woolen said. “I decided myself just to buy into it and I started training with him.”

The driver’s name was Thailand Pierce. He was a defensive back himself who played Arena Football.

“I train a lot of athletes and they don’t return. He stuck with it.” Pierce said. “We did a lot of conditioning. We did our runs around the neighborhood got field work in. We did everything.”

It was valuable practice time that solidified Woolen’s move to cornerback once current UTSA coach Jeff Traylor and his staff were hired.

“Sometimes when you’re uncomfortable that’s a good thing” Woolen said. “I was never comfortable switching positions but I noticed when I was uncomfortable and I kept my faith it led to tremendous growth.”

His growth along with his raw athleticism were displayed at the NFL Combine in March.

“I knew I was gonna run a fast 40 time. I knew it was gonna be 4.2s. It just was a matter of time for the world to see it” Woolen said.

His official time was 4.26 seconds. It tied for the fourth-fastest 40-yard-dash time in the history of the event.

“My notifications on my Apple watch started to go a little crazy” Woolen said.

The craziness hasn’t stopped and neither has the buzz about Woolen’s NFL potential. Being drafted in the second or third round is now a real possibility.

“It doesn’t feel real honestly. It hasn’t really sunk in” Woolen said. “It’s pretty crazy that I’m reaping the blessings that come with the game of football.”

And the rewards for trusting himself enough to make a change that’s about to be life-changing for Woolen and his family.

“I just know when the time comes I’ll be ready” said Woolen about getting drafted. “I’ll be crying tears of joy for sure.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1jZW8tYnJhZ3MtYWJvdXQtZWZmaWNpZW5jeS1vZi1uZXctdG9ycXVlbWFkYS1zZWF0aW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines CEO Brags About Efficiency Of New Torquemada Seating,"One of the biggest mistakes American Airlines has made in the past several years is its new domestic product. They crammed more seats into planes removed seat back entertainment screens and now passengers board thinking they’re on old aircraft.

Ex-CEO Doug Parker greenlit the Torquemada-style seating program and didn’t even try his airline’s product until it was flying for about six months. It turns out they didn’t even build a mockup of it first to see how it would work for passengers and employees. New CEO Robert Isom has previously described needing to make the best of it since they’re stuck it with it.

During the airline’s post-earnings call employee gathering on Thursday he touted the Oasis retrofit program as one of the airline’s great successes

We took on the world’s largest reconfiguration program in commercial aviation history when we set out to change the interiors of our 737 and A321 fleet. Over 400 aircraft went through massive modification. That project started in 2018 had some starts had some stops but it’s done…came in under budget and it is a real driver in terms of what we forecast into the future. It’s because it’s a better product number one and then number two it’s much more efficient. We’re actually able to add capacity into the system without bringing on a lot of the costs that usually come with it.

In fact the program wasn’t well-executed at all. They outsourced it to vendors that did shoddy work leading to the grounding of aircraft. And it was so poorly designed they had to retrofit the retrofitted planes (Project Kodiak).

This new product gives customers

thinner less comfortable seats



less space per passenger



no seat back video



tighter lavatories



not enough extra legroom coach seats (and equipment above the seats in extra legroom coach limiting access to overhead bins by ostensibly premium customers and elites)

On the other hand the upside about the new product is:



high speed wifi but this is not the Oasis retrofit and was done separately from this change



and was done separately from this change bigger overhead bins which fits more carry on bags on the plane and means fewer gate checked bags – good for customers and for getting flights out on time

Of course the basket of deplorable Airbus A320s – maybe the only planes that would have benefited from this retrofit – are still flying around as old America West junkers. They were given high speed internet underscoring that it wasn’t necessary to do the rest of the work to have this feature. Most of the aircraft are over 20 years old yet when American retired Boeing 757 767 Airbus A330 and Embraer E-190 jets these planes remained."

Stanley Black & Decker (SWK 0.32%) a leader in tools and storage solutions released its first-quarter earnings on May 2 showcasing resilience amid economic fluctuations. The company reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.56 slightly above the expected $0.55. Despite a 1.5% drop in revenue from the previous year total revenue of $3.87 billion was likewise better than the consensus forecast for $3.83 billion.

The core of the operation

Stanley Black & Decker has cemented its place as a cornerstone in the tools and outdoor equipment industry. With renowned brands like DeWalt and Craftsman as well as its namesake marques the company thrives on innovation quality and operational excellence. Its focus has sharply turned toward optimizing supply chains reducing costs and innovating on the product front as key strategies for sustainable growth.

In the earnings release the company described consumer demand for its products in Q1 as ""muted"" and noted that volumes also fell on the infrastructure side of the business.

However the company's adept maneuvering through cost-reduction initiatives and strategic portfolio adjustments speaks to its resilience. That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Investors are encouraged to monitor the company's progress in its global cost reduction program and its investments in innovation and growth initiatives. These areas crucial for long-term value creation embody Stanley Black & Decker's strategic pillars for navigating future market dynamics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9zdGFubGV5LWJsYWNrLWRlY2tlci1pbmMtbnlzZS0xNjE0NDAyNzEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange you may begin.

Dennis Lange: Thank you Shannon. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2024 first quarter webcast. Here today in addition to myself is Don Allan President and CEO; Chris Nelson COO EVP and President of Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan EVP and CFO. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. This morning Don Chris and Pat will review our 2024 first quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller.

And as we normally do we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO Don Allan.

Don Allan: Thank you Dennis and good morning everyone. Our first quarter performance was the result of consistent solid execution and we are making progress against key operational objectives. We continue to see significant value creation opportunities tied to our strategic business transformation and the entire company is focused on the disciplined execution of this strategy. We are encouraged by the momentum that is building across the organization. Two of our primary areas of emphasis are free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion. We are focused on what is within our control and are pleased with the momentum behind our gross margin. This is particularly notable considering a significantly worse negative macro environment and corresponding revenue performance in 2023 and '24 versus our initial expectations at the outset of our transformation in mid-2022.

Story continues

Our global cost reduction program remains on track for expected run rate savings of $1.5 billion by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025. As we hit the halfway point of our journey our decisive actions are delivering quantifiable results. Specifically we have captured 1.2 billion of run rate savings program to date. We remain confident this will support 30% gross margins in 2024 consistent with our guidance. We are encouraged that approximately 80% of the company's revenue is expected to carry 2024 adjusted gross margins in excess of 30% and exit this year at or ahead of initial expectations. We believe these product lines will continue to improve upon their current adjusted gross margin profile over the next 18 to 24 months.

As it relates to the rest of the portfolio or that 20% which is predominantly our cyclically depressed outdoor business and the rapidly recovering aerospace fastener business. We are actioning significant cost efficiencies to make necessary improvements to the profitability of outdoor in response to the current market demand and refining the aerospace fastener product line cost base to drive significant growth leverage as widebody plane production continues to recover. Our long-term success will be driven by improved profitability coupled with consistent market share gains. We believe our share position in tools is now stable to increasing. For example our 2023 point-of-sale data in tools performed better than the category average across the North American home centers which was led by our iconic DEWALT Professional brand.

We are also serving our customers better by delivering improved fill rates earning the right for more activity across our brands. Retailers are recognizing this performance. For 2023 ACE Hardware named Craftsman as Vendor of the Year and Grainger recognized Stanley Black & Decker with their partners and Performance Award. Congratulations to our organization. This is a testament to the team's efforts and as we work to get closer to our partners it's an early indication that we are on the right track. As we report our first quarter performance we are energized by how our transformation efforts are taking root. I am confident that by executing our strategy we are positioning the company to deliver high levels of organic revenue growth profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder return.

Turning to the first quarter results. Our top line showed signs of stabilization with organic revenues down 1 point. Excluding the now divested infrastructure business organic revenue was flat as Engineered Fastening and DEWALT growth was offset by muted consumer and DIY demand. Adjusted gross margin was 29% up 590 basis points versus the first quarter of last year and 30 basis points above the second half of 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.56. Adjusted gross margin expansion and EPS growth were both supported by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. We are reiterating our 2024 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $3.50 up to $4.50 as well as our expected free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation. On April 1 we completed the sale of STANLEY Infrastructure to Epiroc. We have already deployed net proceeds from the transaction to reduce short-term debt demonstrating our commitment to further strengthening our balance sheet. Looking forward in 2024 we expect mixed demand trends to persist across our businesses and we are driving supply chain cost improvements to expand margins deliver earnings growth and generate strong cash flow. At the same time we are funding investments designed to fuel targeted long-term growth and market share gains across our businesses. I want to thank our team members around the world for their contributions to the progress that we have made on our transformation journey and for their energy and focus as we continue to charge forward.

I will now pass it to Chris Nelson to review the business segment performance.

Chris Nelson: Thank you Don and good morning everyone. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor first quarter revenue was approximately $3.3 billion down 1% organically versus prior year as growth in DEWALT was more than offset by muted consumer and DIY demand which pressured volume. Pricing was relatively flat consistent with our expectations. Adjusted segment margin was 8.5% in the first quarter a 550 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter of 2023. This was achieved through lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation savings and shipping cost reductions which were partially offset with targeted investments designed to accelerate share gain and organic growth. Now turning to the product lines.

Power tools was up 1 point organically led by pro-driven growth in DEWALT and international sales. We are also seeing benefits from a return to historic promotional levels on high margin DEWALT cordless. Organic revenue for hand tools declined 7% pressured by lower DIY demand. Outdoor product line organic revenue grew 2% in the quarter driven by strong demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment and incremental retail product listings. We are encouraged by U.S. retail point-of-sale data which showed an early start to the season versus prior year. We are cautiously optimistic that demand can be better than the last two years. Our visibility will improve as we move through the second quarter and hit key U.S. holidays. The independent dealer channel continues to work through significant on-hand inventory which pressured shipments in the quarter.

We are monitoring POS trends in this channel and currently expect that they can clear their inventory during the 2024 season to set up a stronger 2025. As Don alluded earlier the outdoor market remains soft versus 2019 volume levels. We are not standing still and are moving with speed to improve profitability by continuing to optimize our cost structure. Consistent with our overall strategy our intent is to focus resources towards capturing targeted share gain opportunities in the most profitable and attractive growth segments such as electric handheld outdoor power equipment. Turning to Tools & Outdoor performance by region. North America was down 2% organically driven by factors consistent with the overall segment. In Europe organic revenue was down 3% as declines in France and Germany were partially offset by growth in the Nordics and the UK.

We are making targeted investments in the region to expand professional product offerings and activate these innovations in the market to capture share. In aggregate all other regions were up 7% organically in the quarter driven by mid-teens growth in Latin America Brazil Mexico Central America and the Caribbean led this performance for the quarter. In summary for Tools & Outdoor we are acutely focused on successfully winning with our customers and winning with the Pro while making profitability improvements. We are navigating mixed market conditions with the goal to capitalize on the areas of strength. We are making deliberate investments in our brands market activation and innovation to capture the growth and margin opportunities that will contribute to the long-term shareholder returns.

I will now discuss our Industrial segment performance. First quarter industrial revenue declined 5% versus last year. Price realization of 1% across the segment and engineered passing volume growth was more than offset by infrastructure volume declines and a point of currency pressure. Within the Industrial segment Engineered Fastening organic revenue growth of 5% includes aerospace growth of 30% and auto growth of 4%. We believe we are outpacing customer production levels as a result of targeted share gains particularly in EV automotive. This growth was partially offset by market softness in general industrial fastening. Industrials adjusted segment margin was 12.1% an improvement of 110 basis points versus prior year driven by price realization and cost actions taken to improve productivity.

A toolbox filled with an array of different tools representing the professional products of the company.

This was a strong performance considering the infrastructure volume decline that the team faced. The quarter was a result of focused execution by our Industrial business associates. On behalf of the entire leadership team I'd like to thank our colleagues around the world for delivering another solid quarter of results and a strong start to the year. Now turning to the next slide. I would like to now highlight a few of our recent DEWALT product introductions which are the results of our investments in innovation. The new DEWALT 20-volt MAX XR cordless framing nailer is engineered for enhanced productivity and performs applications that are traditionally served by pneumatic tools. It is designed to allow the end user to sync framing nails consistently sub flush into LVL material and when used in rapid sequential mode ramp-up time is eliminated between shots.

DEWALT is also introducing the world's first 20-volt MAX cordless 2-1/4 Peak horsepower dedicated plunge router. It provides power like a corded midsized router with the convenience of a cordless tool a prime example of how we continue to help our Pro users transition to a cordless job site. Additionally our TOUGHSYSTEM 2.0 DXL workstation is the industry's first portable storage solution with a 30-inch platform that helps PROs maximize their productivity. This all-in-one workstation delivers customizable mobile storage and a functional work top that is unlike anything else currently available for commercial construction job sites. These are just a few examples of how we continue driving our innovation engine in a manner that is centered on the professional with the intent of making our users more productive.

We believe these innovations coupled with our investments in brand and market activation will stimulate share gains. As we celebrate the DEWALT 100-year anniversary we also reflect on our responsibility and commitment to serving the trades people around the world with brands like DEWALT Craftsman and STANLEY. Thank you and I'll now pass the call over to Pat Hallinan.

Pat Hallinan: Thanks Chris and good morning. Turning to the next slide. I would like to highlight the progress we've made along our transformation journey in the first quarter. We achieved approximately 145 million pre-tax run rate cost savings in the period bringing our aggregate savings to approximately 1.2 billion since program inception. As we focus our portfolio streamline our business structure and transform our operations our teams are actively identifying and prioritizing opportunities to further optimize our cost structure. Given the dynamic macro environment we continue to refine and mobilize plans to deliver targeted savings. We are confident in our ability to execute those plans. We continue to target $1.5 billion of pre-tax run rate savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion pre-tax run rate cost savings by the end of 2025.

Strategic sourcing remains the largest contributor to our transformation savings to date. We are leveraging savings on the $5 billion of addressable spend across areas such as materials and components finished goods and indirect expenditures. Our operations excellence program which leverages lean manufacturing principles is driving productivity improvements. The scope of this work stream improves efficiency and effectiveness within our production and distribution facilities. A pipeline of projects is robust with initiatives lined up to deliver efficiency gains in 2024 and beyond. Footprint-related projects and product platforming which are more event-driven will become increasingly important throughout the remainder of our transformation.

We are optimizing our distribution footprint as well as redesigning our manufacturing network to leverage centers of excellence and to optimize our operations. This multiyear endeavor is accelerating in 2024 as we plan to exit or transform a number of facilities across the globe during 2024 and 2025. And -- the manufacturing sites we previously announced for closure have ceased production and we expect to exit these sites in the near future. We continue to execute manufacturing footprint changes during the first quarter which affected five sites with the goal to complete the site modifications this year. Regarding product platforming this initiative will unlock value by reducing complexity across our value chain. This savings initiative identifies various parts and components that can be standardized across a product family which eliminates complexity and improves procurement scale.

In aggregate our supply chain transformation initiatives are expected to generate approximately $0.5 billion of savings in 2024 improving margins and generating resources for additional growth investments in our core business. We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments. Moving to the next slide. We continue prioritizing free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion to support long-term growth and value creation. First quarter free cash outflow was in line with typical historical trends due to seasonal account receivable increases. This quarter our inventory control contained the working capital build to approximately 360 million where we've traditionally averaged a roughly 700 million increase in the first quarter of the year.

Days of inventory is now approximately 150 days an improvement of 10 days versus the prior year and moving toward our long-term target of approximately 120 to 130 days. We used the net proceeds from the infrastructure sale to reduce our commercial paper balance in the beginning of the second quarter. Because this occurred subsequent to the first quarter close it is not reflected in the first quarter balance sheet. We remain focused on working capital optimization and profitability improvement to generate strong free cash flow in 2024. For the full year 2024 we plan to reduce inventory by $400 million to $500 million as we continue prioritizing working capital efficiency. CapEX is expected to range between $400 million to $500 million which includes support for the footprint-related transformation initiatives.

These items combined with organic cash generation support our full year free cash flow range of $600 million to $800 million which is unchanged from our guidance communicated earlier in the year. Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent investing in organic growth and our transformation funding our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends and further strengthening our balance sheet. Turning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin of 29% in the first quarter improved 590 basis points versus prior year driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and lower shipping costs. We expect to increase adjusted gross margin sequentially in each half of 2024 and we are planning for total company adjusted gross margin to approximate 30% for the full year.

We continue to expect to exit the year at an adjusted gross margin rate in the low 30s. We are off to a solid start in 2024 and the hard work we've done to make adjusted gross margin progress allows us to fund incremental investments to accelerate long-term organic revenue growth. Now turning to the 2024 guidance and the remaining key assumptions. In addition to the free cash flow guidance I just covered we are reiterating GAAP earnings per share range of $1.60 to $2.85 and an adjusted earnings per share range of $3.50 to $4.50. We are maintaining the range of organic revenue assumptions to be plus or minus low single digits. We believe the most likely outcome for organic revenue is to be flat to down 1%. At this level we expect to achieve the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range through cost controls.

Our view incorporates modest headwinds in aggregate for our markets and we remain focused on gaining share in this environment. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to cost management and remain committed to funding investments for long-term organic growth. Turning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor organic revenue is expected to be plus or minus low single digits most likely below flat consistent with the total company. The Industrial segment organic revenue is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Infrastructure's first quarter decline will impact the segment's full year organic growth. And now that the deal is closed we will report the divestiture revenue impact quarterly. Our planning assumption for growth investments is approximately an incremental $100 million in 2024.

These are designed to accelerate innovation market activation and to support our powerful DEWALT Craftsman and Stanley brands. This should result in 2024 SG&A as a percentage of sales in the mid-21% zone for the full year. We will remain agile with the pace of investments should the demand outlook swing in or out of our favor. Turning to profitability. We expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to approximate 10% for the full year supported by the benefits of the transformation program. Segment margin in Tools & Outdoor is planned to be up year-over-year also driven by continued momentum from our ongoing strategic transformation. The Industrial segment margin is expected to be flat to slightly positive versus prior year as operating improvement in Engineered Fastening is offset by the dilution from the infrastructure business divestiture.

Our adjusted EPS range remains $1 with variability in market demand being the largest contributor we will work to optimize adjusted gross margin and manage SG&A thoughtfully throughout the year to balance the macro uncertainty while working hard to preserve investments to position the business for longer-term growth. Turning to other elements of guidance. GAAP earnings include pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from $290 million to $340 million largely relating to the supply chain transformation program with approximately 25% of these expenses being noncash footprint rationalization costs. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to be 10% for 2024 with the second and third quarters in the low 30s. Discrete tax planning items are expected to reduce the full year rate and primarily impact the fourth quarter.

Other 2024 guidance assumptions at the midpoint are noted on the slide to assist with modeling. We expect the second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 21% to 22% of the full year at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter as a percentage of the full year is expected to exceed 25% with EPS contribution lower due to the quarterly tax profile. In summary we continue to make progress on our transformation journey with an unwavering focus on gross margin expansion cash generation balance sheet strength and share gains in a soft market. We are confident that successful execution of our strategy can position the company for long-term growth and value creation. With that I will now pass the call back to Don.

Don Allan: Thank you Pat. As we report another quarter of progress our consistent execution against our plan is building momentum and energizing our team. As our profitability continues to improve we are focusing organic growth investments behind our most powerful brands particularly DEWALT Craftsman and Stanley. We believe these investments can enable organic growth to outpace the market by 2x to 3x. Stanley Black & Decker continues to become a more streamlined business built on the strength of our people and culture with an intensified emphasis on our core market leadership positions in Tools and Outdoor and Engineered Fastening. We are focused on consistent execution while positioning the company to deliver higher levels of sustainable organic revenue growth profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder returns. With that we are now ready for Q&A Dennis.

Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks Don. Shannon we can now start the Q&A please. Thank you.

As you approach the Sunday May 8 holiday you might be thinking of all the things you’d like to do in honor of all the moms (and grand-moms) in your life. Maybe you have a Mother’s Day brunch in the works. Perhaps you've bought Mom just the right Mother's Day gift and you’re planning to present it along with a very special homemade Mother's Day cake. Whatever the case may be we have a pretty good feeling that you’re going to need a little extra oomph that day.

That’s where Starbucks comes into play. The beloved coffee chain is home to dozens of delicious coffee and tea brews that are sure to give you (and your mom) the pick-me-up you need on Mother’s Day. And while you’re there you can even stock up on a bag of beans a pretty new mug or reusable tumbler or a gift card to treat your mom to a cuppa love whenever she wants it most.

Of course if you don’t have time to head to your local Starbucks ahead of time you might have one question lurking in the back of your mind.

Is Starbucks Open on Mother’s Day in 2022?

Thank the caffeine gods y’all! Starbucks is open and ready to take your favorite coffee or tea order on Mother’s Day (and every day in 2022 for that matter). Hours vary by location so the brand recommends checking your local store hours and before heading over.

Example video title will go here for this video

Example video title will go here for this video

SUPERIOR Colo. — When Len Harris saw workers at a Starbucks in Buffalo NY win their union vote last year she said she was inspired.

""That's kind of what kickstarted and inspired me to to really take the plunge"" she said. ""But frankly I had been kind of noticing this pattern of worker disparity in Starbucks ... not even just Starbucks actually really just the working class in general in America.""

Harris a shift supervisor at the Starbucks in Superior off of Coalton Road and Rock Creek Circle took the lead to facilitate the organizing efforts.

She started with communicating with the Starbucks Workers United team through social media.

Fast forward to December 30 2021 and Harris found herself and co-workers filing paperwork to hold an election to unionize.

It was by sheer coincidence Harris says that the filing of that paperwork occurred on the day of the Marshall Fire.

""Everybody was messaging 'I love you. Be safe.' It was a very sort of it was an intimate moment for a lot of for a lot of us"" she said adding that her co-workers had to evacuate work that day. Many of them also had to evacuate their homes.

""Unfortunately one of our coworkers did lose her home"" she said.

Harris recalled a particular moment during the fire evacuations that helped solidify the decision to effort unionizing.

""I evacuated with my spouse and another coworker of mine and their spouse -- two of us [had] kind of a buddy system. We evacuated to Lakewood and once we finally got there our store manager called to see if we were OK like 'Hey are you guys OK? Did you find shelter? Great.' And then the next response was 'OK expect to be back at work at noon tomorrow"" Harris said. ""Like I can't even believe they'd expect us to be at work when we're still running from a fire that we don't know how severe it's going to become after it's already known to be really severe. So yeah I would say definitely motivated us...""

Stronger wages and more comprehensive benefits are also what Harris and her coworkers are after among other things.

""I want people to know what they have they know their worth and to know when they should fight for their worth"" Harris said.

Friday was the first step toward having a hand in that.

Harris and her coworkers gathered inside the Superior location as the National Labor Relations Board counted the ballots.

Ballots had to first be validated by the board 14 of which were. They needed to hit a threshold of eight ""yes"" votes.

""And the moment that eight hit all of us jumped out of our chairs. But the count just kept going. So we felt bad"" Harris excitedly recalled saying the final vote was 12-2 in favor of the union.

The win means the location would join the Starbucks Workers United Union which only a handful of locations across the United States have successfully voted to join.

""But the point is to set forth a motion that's going to help people as time goes on"" Harris said. ""It's people 10 years from now how is this going to better the community in the environment? And that's you know knowing that I was keeping that in mind and that I was trying to keep that at the the top of my goals...""

Starbucks' response

Starbucks leadership has long held their stance that they believe the company operates better without unions.

A spokesperson shared with 9NEWS in early March a statement reading in part:

We are listening and learning from the partners in these stores as we always do across the country. Starbucks success—past present and future—is built on how we partner together always with Our Mission and Values at our core.

Rossann Williams an executive vice president and president of the North American region for Starbucks has shared that they respect their workers' right to organize.

In a letter sent in December 2021 Williams also said “the vote outcomes will not change our shared purpose or how we will show up for each other. … We will keep listening we will keep connecting and we will keep being in service of one another because that’s what we’ve always done and what it means to be partner.”

More recently federal labor officials say Starbucks engaged in unfair labor practices in Phoenix by firing three employees.

A filing yesterday in Arizona District court alleges Starbucks retaliated after learning employees there planned to unionize.

The National Labor Relations Board's Phoenix office is requesting an injunction which would force the company to re-hire the employees.

However earlier this week Starbucks filed two complaints of their own with the NLRB alleging the union organizers in Phoenix and in Denver broke federal labor laws according to CNBC.

Next steps

Harris is hoping that the union they're now part of can help fight for seniority pay and higher pay when the store is short-staffed.

""If you're here for a year get a raise. One of the other things we want to see is compensation for being short-staffed. If there's supposed to be six people scheduled and only four show up as it is right now the company reabsorbed those wages"" Harris said. ""We'd like to see health insurance be covered by the employer. They more than can do that. So there is a lot of things that we want to address even simple things like get rid of the the dress code or be more lenient with the dress code or something.""

Harris said soon they'll be able to work on bargaining and write up a contract.

A union organizer told 9NEWS over the phone Saturday night that four more locations have union elections coming up on April 28. Two of which in Denver and the other two in Colorado Springs.

9NEWS recently spoke to the Starbucks location on the 16th Street Mall after they filed a petition to vote on unionization with an emphasis on safety for employees.

It all comes at a time when Colorado has seen a dip in union membership.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics union members accounted for 6.5% of wage and salary workers in 2021 in Colorado compared to 7.4% in 2020.

The most recent peak was seen in 2018 with 11% of Coloradans in unions.

Jeffrey Zax a professor of economics at CU Boulder who specializes in labor economics explained in March that there are a few reasons for the dip.

""So there's two sets of reasons for why unionization might drop. One is that workers believe that they're getting more of what they need from their employers without the benefit of collective bargaining"" he explained. ""The other is that employers are opposing unionization more effectively now at the moment. My guess is that it's probably the first reason rather than the second.""

EAST ST. LOUIS Ill. — Volunteers on Saturday cleaned up 89 blocks of East St. Louis streets in honor of Earth Day.

The city joined together with Empire 13 and local community organizations for the clean up. Their goal? To have State Street a main east-west thoroughfare in the city completely free of trash for the first time in decades.

The street clean up comes as part of Empire 13's Boots to the Streets campaign which addresses racial and social issues related to discrimination in Black communities. Empire 13 is a grassroots organization of Black workers who work to fight racism in the workplace.

East St. Louis Mayor Robert Eastern III and many others from the Metro East community participated in the event.

“It not only inspires hope it ends the 'culture of poverty' mentality” said J. D. Dixon the founder of Empire 13. “When you see trash it makes you feel down. What can you do if this is where you live at and this is the area that you are in?”

Eastern expressed his gratitude.

""I'm very grateful to Empire 13 Community Lifeline and the consortium of organizations coming together to help us with this citywide cleanup covering all of State Street.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJuZC5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9lZHVjYXRpb24vYXJ0aWNsZTI2MDcwODA3Mi5odG1s0gE-aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuYm5kLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2VkdWNhdGlvbi9hcnRpY2xlMjYwNzA4MDcyLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,East St. Louis citizens clean up the city’s 89 blocks to celebrate Earth Day,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.bnd.com', port=443): Read timed out.

The St. John Fisher College Men's and Women's rowing team competed in the New York State Collegiate Rowing Championship on Saturday at Fish Creek in Saratoga.The Women's varsity 8 started off the day finishing fifth in its heat with a time of 7:58.986 behind Ithaca College University of Rochester Skidmore and Manhattan.Then in the petite final they finished third with a time of 8:04.141 behind Union and Manhattan and ahead of Nazareth for an overall finish of ninth place.The women's novice 4 came in third place behind Union and Stony Brook with a time of 9:55.The men's novice 4 also came in third in its flight behind Vassar and Union with a time of 8:40.205 that would've placed them sixth overall between the two flights.Conditions for the Women's 8 and novice 4 featured a gusty tailwind and increasing chop on the water through the course. The Men's novice 4 flight was after lunch and the conditions were perfect as the wind dissipated making for glassy conditions.""Overall results were okay"" mentioned head coach. ""The Women's varsity 8 raced top level D3 teams and some D1 teams as well. Colgate Marist Canisius were in the other heat so it was an opportunity to see how fast some of these teams in New York are. We are a young squad comparatively so while we may be taking our lumps now in the long run it is going to help us get faster. Next week we are racing at the Liberty League Championship so we get to see many of the same crews again and hopefully build on our performance.The women's novice 4 had limited time in a lineup due to various factors but their coxswain completed her first race and got them down the course. They'll be in a 4 again at the Liberty League Championship so hopefully they have a bit more confidence knowing they completed a race in a 4 so won't be as nervous.The novice men's 4 battled in a tight race with Vassar and Union and are excited to have a rematch with Union at the Liberty League Championship and put a bow on their novice season.For me this regatta was 2 years in the making. A handful of coaches started meeting over zoom over the shutdowns due to covid and out of that grew the NYS Collegiate Rowing Assoc Board which I was elected to. The board has spent a lot of time organizing the regatta and it went off smoothly. I'm eager to see all of our crews hopefully put together their best row of the season on Friday back in Saratoga."""

T-Mobile confirmed the attack in a statement to The Verge and says the “systems accessed contained no customer or government information or other similarly sensitive information.”

In copies of private messages obtained by Krebs the Lapsus$ hacking group discussed targeting T-Mobile in the week prior to the arrest of seven of its teenage members. After purchasing employees’ credentials online the members could use the company’s internal tools — like Atlas T-Mobile’s customer management system — to perform SIM swaps. This type of attack involves hijacking a target’s mobile phone by transferring its number to a device owned by the attacker. From there the attacker can obtain texts or calls received by that person’s phone number including any messages sent for multi-factor authentication.

Lapsus$ hackers also attempted to crack into the FBI and Department of Defense’s T-Mobile accounts

According to screenshotted messages posted by Krebs Lapsus$ hackers also attempted to crack into the FBI and Department of Defense’s T-Mobile accounts. They were ultimately unable to do so as additional verification measures were required.

“Several weeks ago our monitoring tools detected a bad actor using stolen credentials to access internal systems that house operational tools software” T-Mobile said in an emailed statement to The Verge. “Our systems and processes worked as designed the intrusion was rapidly shut down and closed off and the compromised credentials used were rendered obsolete.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vNmFiYy5jb20vY3Jhc2gtaW50by10LW1vYmlsZS1zdG9yZS1odW50aW5nLXBhcmstdGVlbnMtYXJyZXN0ZWQtc3RvbGVuLWNhci1jcmFzaGVkLzExNzg0MTczL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vNmFiYy5jb20vYW1wL2NyYXNoLWludG8tdC1tb2JpbGUtc3RvcmUtaHVudGluZy1wYXJrLXRlZW5zLWFycmVzdGVkLXN0b2xlbi1jYXItY3Jhc2hlZC8xMTc4NDE3My8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Philadelphia police: Stolen car filled with teens crashes into T-Mobile store in Hunting Park,"Police said there were 11 employees and around five customers inside at the time.

PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- A stolen car filled with teenagers crashed into a T-Mobile store in Philadelphia's Hunting Park section Saturday.

The incident happened around 5:30 p.m. on the 700 block of East Hunting Park Avenue.

Police said there were 11 employees and around five customers inside at the time. Two employees were injured.

""One who was close to the storefront was injured when glass shattered and cut his face. And additionally counters that were up against the storefront were pushed into that employee"" said Inspector D.F. Pace with Philadelphia Police Department. ""Another employee suffered more serious lacerations to the face from glass that had shattered.""

Police said the driver was a 16-year-old boy.

Three passengers were ages 14 to 16.

Investigators say this all started Friday when the car was stolen on the 1200 block of East Hunting Park Avenue around 5 p.m.

Police say the owner of the car left the keys inside the vehicle.

Saturday the owner spotted it on the road with a fake Texas temporary tag on East Hunting Park Avenue.

He notified police in the area who immediately turned their car lights on.

""But it was too late. The vehicle took off at a high rate of speed and the officers were never able to engage that vehicle"" said Pace.

The car even knocked over a stop sign crashing into the front of the store.

Police say one of the injured employees chased and caught the teen driver. The owner of the car chased and caught another teenager.

Police were able to apprehend the two other teens.

""It is extremely fortunate that more people were not seriously injured or killed given the way that that car impacted the store. Had individuals been looking at some phones close to that storefront they would have been seriously injured or possibly killed"" added Pace.

Police say the teens could be facing aggravated assault charges in addition to theft of auto and other charges.

T-Mobile Breached Again; Lapsus$ Behind the Attack

Company Says No Sensitive Customer or Government Information Leaked

Chat showed Lapsus$ breached T-Mobile several times. (Source: ISMG File photo)

The U.S. telecom carrier T-Mobile has confirmed that the Lapsus$ ransomware group has breached its internal network by compromising employee accounts according to multiple media reports. But it says hackers did not steal any sensitive customer or government information during the incident.

See Also: Take Inventory of Your Medical Device Security Risks

Information security blogger Brian Krebs recently reviewed a copy of the private chat messages between members of the Lapsus$ cybercrime group before the arrest of its most active members last month.

He reported that the chat messages show Lapsus$ breached T-Mobile several times and stole source code for a range of company projects.

A spokesperson for T-Mobile told Krebs that its ""monitoring tools detected a bad actor using stolen credentials to access internal systems that house operational tools software"" but no sensitive customer or government information was stolen.

The Washington-based telecommunications giant fell victim to another data breach early this year that was linked to a SIM swapping attack that it said affected ""a very small number"" of its 105 million customers (see: T-Mobile: Some Customers Affected by SIM Swap Data Breach).

In direct response to Information Security Media Group's queries about this latest incident T-Mobile says: ""Several weeks ago our monitoring tools detected a bad actor using stolen credentials to access internal systems that house operational tools software. The systems accessed contained no customer or government information or other similarly sensitive information and we have no evidence that the intruder was able to obtain anything of value. Our systems and processes worked as designed the intrusion was rapidly shut down and closed off and the compromised credentials used were rendered obsolete.""

Lapsus$ has operated openly on its Telegram chat channel since December 2021. Currently the channel has close to 60000 followers. The notorious group used its channel to leak huge volumes of sensitive data stolen from victims.

In March police in London said that they'd arrested seven people that the BBC reported are tied to the Lapsus$ hacking group which has claimed responsibility for data breaches involving Okta Microsoft Nvidia Ubisoft and others.

Two teenagers arrested and charged by the City of London Police in connection with its investigation into the Lapsus$ hacking group have been released on bail for an undisclosed sum and are due back in court on Friday. The City of London Police which handles fraud reporting and cybercrime for the U.K. is investigating the Lapsus$ hacking group (see: Lapsus$ Teens Out on Bail Due Back in Court April 29).

Account Takeover Attack

Krebs says he reviewed a week's worth of private conversations between Lapsus$ members which shows that the gang members obtained initial access to targeted organizations by purchasing it from Russian criminal markets that sell access to remotely compromised systems as well as credentials stored in these systems.

Gunnar Peterson the chief information security officer at fraud detection services provider Forter says that the recent attacks and extortion attempts on large enterprises are clear examples of the damage that can be done when compromised credentials are used to carry out account takeover or ATO attacks.

""The Lapsus$ ransomware group is conducting all of their ATO activity using stolen usernames and passwords that were obtained using unconventional and sophisticated means"" Peterson says.

Apart from buying access to compromised systems and using stolen credentials the gang was involved in social engineering of the targeted organization's employees to trick them into adding one of the gang's infected machines to the allowed devices that authenticated the company's virtual private network Krebs says.

Lapsus$ also mastered a range of tricks allowing the group to access credentials gain initial access into a network and move laterally according to research from Microsoft.

Lapsus$ which Microsoft refers to as DEV-0537 is known for ""living off the land"" which refers to using native operating system tools to probe systems the company's security researchers report in a blog post. To gain initial access Microsoft says the group’s tactics include using the RedLine password stealer buying stolen or brute-forced credentials in underground markets paying employees of targeted organizations to share credentials or MFA codes searching public data breach dumps for exposed credentials and gathering enough data about an employee in a targeted organization to phone the help desk and ask it ""to reset a target's credentials"" to those of its choosing.

Repeated Attacks

In August 2021 T-Mobile was the victim of a widely publicized data breach in which more than 50 million customers' data was stolen and attackers attempted to extort $2 million from CEO Mike Sievert (see: T-Mobile CEO Apologizes for Mega-Breach Offers Update).

This is at least the sixth time T-Mobile has been a target of an attack in the past three years (see: T-Mobile Probes Attack Confirms Systems Were Breached).

More than 100 million T-Mobile data records were found for sale online after the August 2021 breach - with sensitive records including Social Security numbers driver's license numbers names addresses birthdates and security PINs.

The massive data breach allegedly was carried out by John Binns a 21-year-old American who discovered an insecure router belonging to T-Mobile. After detecting the router Binns was able to find a point of entry into a Wisconsin data center where he began exfiltrating data. Binns told The Wall Street Journal at the time that T-Mobile's security practices were ""awful"" and bragged about the attack which he claimed he did more for recognition than monetary gain.

In December 2020 T-Mobile notified customers that its cybersecurity team had detected ""malicious unauthorized access"" to around 200000 customers' accounts (see: T-Mobile Alerts Customers to New Breach).

Data from more than 1 million customers was leaked after a malicious hacker gained unauthorized access to prepaid wireless accounts in November 2019. In this instance T-Mobile advised customers to reset their PINs (see: T-Mobile Says Prepaid Accounts Breached).

The first in this series of breaches affecting T-Mobile customers took place in August 2018 when a threat actor stole customer names ZIP codes and other information on prepaid and postpaid accounts. Some 2.3 million customers were victimized (see: T-Mobile Database Breach Exposes 2 Million Customers' Data).

Lapsus$ Revamp

First appearing in 2021 Lapsus$ swiftly generated attention by publicly dumping stolen data extorting companies and openly offering to pay for information that helped the group breach more businesses.

The group is believed to have a connection to Brazil since some of its public posts are in Portuguese and some of its hacking targets are Brazilian.

The group's activity intensified earlier this month with a series of releases of sensitive data. The group usually posts its data breach dumps to a Telegram channel where members regularly mock and threaten their victims.

On March 5 Lapsus$ released source code belonging to Samsung. It then dumped data belonging to South Korean electronics maker LG.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRhdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2NyaWNrZXQtcGxhbnMtNzg3MjkyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here are the best Cricket Wireless plans,"Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority

Even if you’re not familiar with Cricket Wireless you’ve undoubtedly seen the carrier’s commercials. They’re the ones with animated characters that look like they’re straight out of a Pixar flick. Well the carrier is hoping you take those ads to heart and is backing them up with savings. Cricket has doubled its subscriber count since joining AT&T but there’s a lot more to learn about Cricket Wireless plans before you sign up. See also: The best Cricket Wireless deals

Cricket Wireless sticks to prepaid service so we’ll take you through all of the options and the best phones you can get. As an MVNO there are some unique aspects to Cricket Wireless and we’ll touch on a few alternatives that use Big Blue’s network. Are you ready to see what all of the excitement is about? Let’s talk Cricket and look at the best Cricket Wireless plans.

Cricket Wireless at a glance

As we’ve alluded to Cricket Wireless is an MVNO that joined the AT&T family in 2014 as part of a merger with AIO wireless. The carrier currently serves a base of 12.4 million subscribers up from five million before the merger. Cricket isn’t Better Business Bureau accredited though it does have an A-plus rating. The page is also in the process of being updated which may impact the accreditation as well as the customer reviews. At the moment the carrier lists 2420 complaints over the last three years with 722 coming in the last 12 months.

Once upon a time Cricket had its own small regional network. These days thanks to its affiliation with AT&T Cricket Wireless has access to a robust network in all 50 states and uses the carrier’s 4G LTE and 5G towers. It took a while for Cricket to join AT&T’s 5G network but now it has a new slate of devices on offer. You can finally tap into faster speeds at low prices following an extended rollout. You can use third-party coverage throughout southern Canada and Cricket has veins of LTE coverage throughout Mexico.

5GB Plan Simple name simple plan — at least that’s the idea behind the 5GB option. As the name suggests you’ll get 5GB of 4G LTE or 5G data access per month along with unlimited talk and text. Cricket’s 5GB plan also supports HD Voice and Wi-Fi calling if you have a compatible phone. Beyond that you can add another gig of data as needed for a fee. Each line of 5GB service runs at a constant $30 per month rate. Cricket has also added 5G access to all of its plans and removed the long-standing 8Mbps speed cap from its most affordable options.

Highlights: Enough data for low-limit users.

Unlimited talk and text at a low price. Best for: Users who want to talk and text on a budget.

Users who spend most of their time on Wi-Fi.

10GB Plan 2GB of data isn’t enough for everyone so you may want to jump to the 10GB Cricket plan if you need to stay connected on the go. Luckily each line is more affordable than the last so five times the data is well worth the extra fee. Additional data and the per-line discount are the only differences though — there’s still no streaming or hotspot available. However you still get access to 5G as mentioned above without the 8Mbps cap.

Highlights: Five times more data at a low cost.

Discount for each line you add. Best for: Users who plan to use data and don’t want to pay per gig.

Users who don’t need a hotspot and would rather stream on a TV.

Cricket Core Plan The Core plan is Cricket Wireless’s best option for most people — it offers plenty of unlimited functions but you don’t have to pay for a hotspot if you don’t want one. Core includes standard definition (480p) streaming and international texting to 37 countries and unlimited LTE data access. You can also use your talk text and data in Canada and Mexico as long as you just more than 50% of your plan in the US.

Highlights: Unlimited data talk and text.

Streaming in standard definition. Best for: Users who plan to text other countries.

Users who want the option of hotspot and streaming.

Cricket More Plan The most expensive Cricket plan of the lot Cricket More is just like Core except it includes 15GB of hotspot access for just $5 more. It’s the more affordable option if you know you’ll need that extra data each month and it packs all of the same perks as Cricket Core. Streaming is still limited to standard definition but it’s always nice to know that your plan will work for trips to Canada or Mexico. Cricket More also comes with a new slate of perks at just $60 per month. You can test out ad-supported HBO Max and get your shopping on with a one-year membership to Sam’s Club.

Highlights: Usage in Canada and Mexico up to 50%.

15GB of included hotspot access. Best for: Users who plan to make the most of the included hotspot.

North American travelers who want to stay connected with a single plan.

Add-on options Although some of Cricket’s basic plans are bare adding a few extra features doesn’t take much effort. Each comes at a cost but these add-ons cover everything from an extra gig of data to international access. Check out the table for the specifics of each add-on.

Cricket More 15GB more for $10 per month



Here’s what each add-on includes:

Bark Jr and Bark Premium Cricket’s new partnership with Bark means that you can get free access to manage your kids’ screen time and filter websites to keep them safe. You can even sign up for Bark Premium which adds email monitoring and monitoring across more than 30 apps to the mix for just $9.99 per month.

International As long as you’ve set up a plan that costs $40 per month or more Cricket International will let you dial landline numbers in 35 countries. You can cancel at any time.

International Extra International Extra adds pictures and video calling to the mix for all 35 countries and you can dial mobile numbers in 31 of those countries for up to 1000 minutes.

Individual Countries If you have relatives in a particular country that does not fall within the 35 international options you can add select nations for a varying fee. Available countries include much of Central America as well as the Philippines and Vietnam. Plans include varying talk minutes and typically unlimited texting.

Add 1GB of data Mainly designed for limited data plans this add-on kicks your cap from 2GB to 3GB or from 10GB to 11GB. You can add it just once or on a recurring monthly basis.

Hotspot Although Cricket More includes 15GB of hotspot data this add-on grants the same amount to the Core plan. It’s helpful if you only want to use a hotspot for one month but you may be better off with the More plan if you’re going to use a hotspot often.

Hotspot add-ons If 15GB isn’t enough for your needs you can add another 15GB to either the Core or More plans. Like the standard hotspot addition you can add it once or regularly.

Does Cricket have any perks?

While there are no fancy perks on Cricket like free Netflix or anything one of its more important perks is its Group Save discount.

It’s not as generous with savings as it once was but you can save $10 on a second line and $20 more per line after that. There is a limit to the savings — after the fifth phone there are no more discounts. When it’s all said and done you’re looking at four lines of data for your family with a monthly bill of just $100 — not an easy price to top.

Which Cricket Wireless plan is right for you?

If you’re ready to make a move it’s tough to top the Cricket Core — or basic unlimited — plan. There’s the obvious draw of unlimited data but you also benefit from standard-definition streaming and usage in Canada and Mexico that can’t exceed 50%. You can text your friends in 37 countries and once you have more than three lines the Cricket Core plan costs less than the 10GB alternative. Cricket’s affordable plans are now more enticing than ever with 5G and the removal of the 8Mbps cap.

You won’t get a hotspot with the $55 per month Cricket Core but you can always add one for an extra monthly fee. If you know that you’ll need that hotspot opt for Cricket More as it will save you $5 per month and give you access to sweet perks like HBO Max.

Cricket Wireless vs the competition

As an MVNO it seems unfair to compare the best Cricket offers with the best that Verizon and AT&T can do. Instead we’ll stack it against a few of the other MVNOs on each network. We’re comparing all of the plans featured in the Best prepaid and no-contract plans in the US if you want to do a bit more research.

Visible Visible like Cricket is a wholly-owned subsidiary carrier. However it relies on the Verizon network and swaps some perks for a lower base price. There’s only one plan to choose from and it offers unlimited talk text and data. The plan also allows for hotspot access and you can finally call internationally and tap into Verizon’s Nationwide 5G.

Party Pay is what sets Visible apart as you can join as many friends as you please and each of you will pay as little as $25 per month. One late payer doesn’t hurt the others and you’ll all save money. Visible has no physical stores so customer service can be a challenge.

Highlights: One plan one rate.

Everything is unlimited.

Mint Mobile Mint Mobile is a true MVNO owned by Ryan Reynolds himself rather than a larger carrier. It offers an unlimited plan or you can pay $25 per month for 15GB of 4G LTE or 5G access — whichever is stronger. You can call Mexico and Canada at no extra charge and you can dedicate as much of your data to the hotspot as you please.

Unlike some carriers that charge you for a SIM card when you switch Mint includes one that you can punch out to any of three sizes. You won’t get much by streaming perks or add-ons but Mint is an affordable and fast option on T-Mobile’s network.

Cricket Wireless is an MVNO making it a great way to get your hands on a budget device. There are certainly plenty to choose from but Cricket has many of the latest and greatest devices on the market too.

If you purchase a Cricket device and then decide to leave the network you’ll have to wait six months unless you’re heading to AT&T. The most important factor in changing carriers is band support as always. If your device doesn’t support the right bands then you’re all out of luck.

AT&T's (T 0.53%) stock price rose 4% on April 21 after the telecom giant posted its first-quarter earnings report. This marked AT&T's first earnings report after its long-awaited spin-off of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD -2.39%) which closed on April 8 and finally ended its messy media expansion plans.

AT&T's consolidated revenue fell 13% year over year to $38.1 billion which missed analysts' estimates by $190 million. That decline reflected its spin-offs and divestments of DirecTV Vrio Xandr and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) over the past year. Excluding those impacts AT&T's stand-alone revenue rose 2.5% to $29.7 billion. Its adjusted earnings declined 9% to $0.77 per share but it still beat the consensus forecast by eight cents.

Those headline numbers were mixed but the market's response suggested that investors were warming up to the ""new"" AT&T again. Could AT&T be a dependable income-generating value play in this challenging market?

AT&T's wireless business is growing

AT&T's first-quarter numbers included a lot of noise from its recent spin-offs divestments. However its core wireless business is still growing.

AT&T's wireless revenue rose 5.5% year over year to $20.1 billion as its total number of postpaid phone subscribers grew 4% to 67.5 million. It gained 691000 postpaid subscribers during the quarter which represented its highest first-quarter net adds in over a decade. Its postpaid churn of 0.79% rose slightly from 0.76% a year earlier but it still declined from its postpaid churn of 0.85% in the fourth quarter.

During the conference call CEO John Stankey attributed its robust growth rates to its ""strong network performance simplified offers and improving customer experience."" Stankey also said AT&T was ""confident"" that it could ""continue this momentum in a disciplined manner.""

However the wireless segment's operating income still fell 3.2% year over year to $5.9 billion. Its expenses rose 9.5% to $14.2 billion as it shut down its 3G network racked up higher equipment costs and incurred higher costs related to bundling HBO Max into its wireless plans. AT&T expects to maintain those bundles even though WBD is now a separate company but WBD will shoulder all the costs of developing new content.

The wireline business is messier

AT&T's wireline business which is transitioning from older cable and DSL-based connections toward faster fiber networks turned in less impressive results. Its total broadband connections increased 0.6% year over year to 15.5 million as its number of fiber subscribers rose 21% to 6.3 million.

Those growth rates look stable but the weakness of its business wireline business -- which it blamed on delayed government orders -- offset the growth of its consumer wireline business.

The consumer wireline segment's revenue rose 2% to $3.2 billion as its operating income grew 3.3% to $317 million. But the business wireline segment's revenue fell 6.7% to $5.6 billion as its operating income tumbled 20.5% to $859 million.

CFO Pascal Desroches predicts the business wireline segment will ""rebound later this year"" as the U.S. government passes the federal budget but it will likely remain weaker than the consumer wireline segment.

Maintaining its long-term targets

Prior to spinning off WBD AT&T predicted that its revenue would rise by the low single-digits (on a pro forma basis) in both 2022 and 2023. It expects the broadband business -- led by the expansion of its fiber networks -- to grow faster than its wireless business in both years.

It plans to increase its capital investments from $20 billion in 2021 to $24 billion in both 2022 and 2023 to expand its 5G and fiber networks. But even as it increases its spending it still expects its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to rise 0%-2% in 2022 and 2%-7% in 2023.

AT&T also expects to reduce its net debt to adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) ratio from 3.1 at the beginning of 2021 to 2.5 by the end of 2023. The removal of DirecTV and WBD from its balance sheet should make it easier to achieve that goal.

AT&T reiterated most of those long-term targets which could make it more comparable to Verizon (VZ -0.05%) during its conference call. Its forward dividend yield of 5.7% also remains higher than Verizon's 4.7% yield.

Is this the start of a ""new era"" for AT&T?

Stankey said AT&T's first-quarter report marked the start of a ""new era"" for the telecom giant. That would certainly be true if it achieves its growth targets for 2022 and 2023 but it still faces intense competition from Verizon and T-Mobile in the telecom market.

AT&T's high yield and low forward P/E ratio of 9 should limit its downside potential but it probably won't rally until it proves it can achieve its ambitious goals. Investors should stick with AT&T if they already own it but they should consider buying other dividend stocks before starting a new position in this slow-growth telecom giant."

But they had no intention of following other corporations in an exodus from the city’s business district.

While the city’s original business core has been hit by a wave of recent or planned corporate relocations some to newer digs elsewhere in the city Wells Fargo and a growing chorus of businesses are doubling down on downtown.

Wells Fargo said last week it will move from the Wells Fargo Tower on St. Paul later this year to one floor at 111 S. Calvert Street a renovated 28-story mixed-use tower at the Inner Harbor that also includes the 680-room Renaissance Hotel and the former Gallery at Harborplace mall.

Also on Friday the architecture firm Design Collective said it signed a 10-year-lease with room to grow at 100 E. Pratt St. the tower that is currently home to T. Rowe Price Group. Last fall Truist Bank formed through a merger between SunTrust and BB&T said it planned to keep its Maryland regional headquarters downtown at 120 E. Baltimore St. where SunTrust was located. And Alertus Technologies will be moving its headquarters from Beltsville to 10 N. Charles St. a building it bought citing downtown’s accessibility and amenities.

Additionally about 3300 workers at a dozen state agencies will be relocated to leased space downtown under a plan announced a year ago by Republican Gov. Larry Hogan.

While the leasing decisions stem from post-pandemic workplace evaluations and a desire to attract talent and encourage employees to return to offices full of upgrades and amenities the businesses say choosing the central business district shows a commitment and renewed confidence not only in those blocks but in the city as a whole.

Downtown Baltimore.

Wells Fargo has done business in Baltimore for more than a century entering the market in 1914. Relocating within the city’s central business district shows commitment to Baltimore and Maryland said John A. Allen Wells Fargo’s region bank executive for Maryland and Washington D.C.

“We want to be a dominant player in this market” and that means remaining downtown Allen said. “We want to be here.”

And many say they’ve been encouraged by momentum in key city projects such as the redevelopment of Lexington Market opening later this year and the renovation of Royal Farms Arena. Also Friday the city announced a new series of once-a-month one-day festivals at the Inner Harbor this summer.

Business leaders as well as leasing and city officials said they expect recently announced plans for new ownership and revitalization of Harborplace to further boost both the office market and downtown investment.

Baltimore developer P. David Bramble and his MCB Real Estate firm said earlier this month they have struck a deal to acquire Harborplace the struggling onetime centerpiece of Baltimore’s Inner Harbor redevelopment in the 1980s out of receivership. The deal would pave the way for what Bramble described as an extensive redevelopment effort to “completely re-imagine” the faded retail attraction and revitalize the city’s downtown waterfront.

“Having these businesses commit and recommit to downtown it gives the energy and momentum we need” said Shelonda Stokes president of the Downtown Partnership of Baltimore.

Such projects already are sparking more interest in downtown office leasing even from among businesses currently located outside the city said Bronwyn LeGette a senior director at real estate brokerage Cushman & Wakefield which helped Design Collective in its office search.

“A lot of people do realize that when you’re really competing for talent that’s really where the epicenter of the talent is and wants to be specifically because they can walk to work or bike to work or scooter to work” LeGette said. “There’s more density in downtown Baltimore for that type of lifestyle.”

The clock adorns the northwest corner of the current 24-story Wells Fargo Tower on Saint Paul Street. The building was formerly known as the First Union Signet Tower Wachovia Tower and Union Trust Building.

New investment downtown is expected to help counter a wave of recent or planned corporate relocations out of the central business district some of which has come as part of downsizing in response to increased remote work as a result of the pandemic.

Danish jeweler Pandora is seeking someone to sublease its office space at 250 W. Pratt St. downtown. Transamerica which now occupies the top nine floors of 100 Light St. plans to move to just one floor of the Wills Wharf office building in Harbor Point.

T. Rowe Price headquartered at 100 E. Pratt St. since 1975 broke ground last month on a future 550000-square-foot headquarters in Harbor Point. And Bank of America plans to move its Baltimore offices from downtown to the Legg Mason Tower in Harbor East.

Wells Fargo executives said they realize they are bucking a trend.

The bank said it plans to relocate all 108 corporate employees currently at St. Paul Street in retail banking and its commercial middle market banking group which serves business clients. The move likely will start before the St. Paul Street lease expires at the end of the year bank officials said. It is taking 17336 square feet and will have signage prominently displayed atop the Calvert Street building.

The bank also plans to close its branch in the current Wells Fargo Tower and is negotiating to open a new branch — likely by the end of the year — in the former Jos. A. Bank Clothiers store space at 100 E. Pratt St. which bank officials said offers prime ground-floor visibility.

After re-evaluating space needs based on changes in the workplace over the past 40 years and more recently during the pandemic Allen said bank officials decided to leave a building that was built and first occupied by Wells Fargo in 1980. For instance an entire floor used to be dedicated to training but now much of that work is done remotely. And the bank’s return-to-office policy now requires just three days a week in the office but even on designated days many workers spend more time out meeting with clients.

Derek Lynch Wells Fargo’s commercial banking leader in Baltimore who was involved in the new office search said it was important to stay within the central business district.

“We’re doubling down” he said. “Baltimore needs to succeed.”

He added that the bank is “bullish” on the Baltimore area’s economy. By midyear the bank expects to have doubled its loan commitments over 18 months to Maryland business clients in real estate health care technology manufacturing and port-related and other businesses.

Shelonda Stokes president of the Downtown Partnership of Baltimore talks in 2020 about the plan to relocate 3300 state employees to downtown Baltimore.

The head of Design Collective which now has an 85-employee office in Power Plant at the Inner Harbor said he thought it was important for the firm to remain downtown where it moved 30 years ago from Columbia. The lease for nearly two floors at 100 E. Pratt comes with building amenities such as a fitness center cafe and coffee shop harbor views and walkable amenities said Fred Marino the firm’s president and CEO.

“A lot of our employees live in the surrounding neighborhoods and so we wanted to be centrally located because a lot of them ride their bikes to work too” Marino said. “We looked all over the city but for a lot of reasons it seemed to make sense to stay in the downtown. We’re hoping to be a part of the new growth and revitalization that we’re hoping to see here in the downtown Baltimore area.”

The company will lease about the same amount of space nearly 27000 square feet with capacity to grow. Though employees have the option to work remotely two days a week the firm believes in the future of the office.

“In our profession there’s nothing like being in the office and being surrounded by other architects where you can learn from one another on a day-to-day basis” Marino said.

Brookfield Properties the owner of 111 S. Calvert said the 265000-square-feet of office space there will be 80% occupied with the addition of Wells Fargo and other new tenants announced last week. They include SIA Solutions an engineering and consulting firm and the law firm Evert Weathersby Houff Brookfield said. Current tenants include Ballard Spahr Cigna Health Lupin Pharmaceuticals and Niles Barton & Wilmer.

The building at Pratt and Calvert streets also includes the now shuttered Gallery mall and a five-level underground parking garage. Brookfield closed the mall at the end of the year and is continuing to explore plans for the multilevel space a Brookfield executive said.

The building’s leasing momentum follows the completion last fall of a $12 million revamp of the office space with upgrades such as health and wellness amenities said Robert Swennes executive vice president and head of the mid-Atlantic and southeast regions for Brookfield Properties.

“What they want is more of a hotel-like feel” Swennes said. “We’ve found as people come back to the office leadership wants something appealing to get their employees back. This is an engaging place to come to work.”

Renovations included several move-in-ready office suites a 24th floor lounge that includes a coffee bar and pantry a private wellness room for nursing parents a 45-person conference room and a 17th floor lounge with a terrace and a fitness center with locker rooms showers towel service and Peloton bikes.

Not all office tenants are downsizing in the wake of the pandemic and increased remote work Swennes said. As leases come due some tenants want more space and others have not changed requirements he said.

Some businesses may have reduced their space needs but are still out in the market seeking upgraded or more flexible space said Colin Tarbert president and CEO of the Baltimore Development Corp. Some are moving within downtown.

“A lot of businesses are re-thinking their office space in general” Tarbert said. “Generally businesses are creating more flexible workspaces for employees that might not be coming to the office five days a week.”

Many organizations looking downtown are re-imagining their space to be more about collaboration said Cushman & Wakefield’s LeGette.

“These spaces are more about connecting face-to-face collaboration technology … access to daylight walkable amenities” such as the harbor she said. “They can just walk right out the door and hit a promenade that has 7 1/2 miles of walkable waterfront.”

Swennes said Brookfield one of the nation’s largest owners of office real estate remains focused on downtowns such as Baltimore’s that offer both access and desirable views.

Downtown Baltimore “has had some challenges on the retail front” he said “but … we think it’s an incredibly dynamic place to come and work.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Most upcoming games in the galaxy far far away are still short on details but what we know so far should be enough to get any Star Wars fan excited.

8. Star Wars: Hunters

Of all the Star Wars games in development we know the most about Star Wars: Hunters. Announced in 2021 a pre-release version of the game is available now in some countries and it’s set for a full release in 2022. At launch it will be playable on Android iOS and Nintendo Switch.

Star Wars: Hunters is a free-to-play multiplayer battle game starring original characters in the Star Wars universe. Like other team-based competitive games each character specializes as either a Tank Damage or Support class. Multiple modes will be available at launch including Huttball a game that debuted as a side activity in the MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic.

The game is set between the events of Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens putting it in the same time period as The Mandalorian. Given that all the action takes place in a battle arena it’s likely that it won’t deal too directly with canon events of the timeline but that still leaves plenty of room for cheeky nods and Easter eggs.

Star Wars: Hunters is being developed by mobile developer Zynga creator of Farmville which started the process of being acquired by Rockstar parent company Take-Two Interactive in January 2022.

Star Wars: Hunters features competitive battles in familiar Star Wars settings.

7. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake

Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is perhaps the most revered Star Wars game ever so the announcement of its remake was met with excitement from fans. The game takes place 4000 years before the Star Wars movies when the Sith launched an attack aimed at wiping out the Jedi for good.

The original KOTOR was developed by BioWare creator of the Dragon Age series. The studio won’t be in charge of the remake which is being developed by Aspyr and Sony Interactive Entertainment. While the KOTOR remake’s release date hasn’t been announced it will be a timed console exclusive on PS5 at launch alongside a PC release.

According to its announcement the KOTOR remake will rebuild the game “from the ground up” but no specifics about its gameplay have been revealed.

6. Star Wars Eclipse

Revealed at The Game Awards 2021 Star Wars Eclipse is an “action-adventure multiple-character branching narrative game” according to its website. It’s being developed by Lucasfilm Games and Quantic Dream the controversial studio known for narrative adventures like Detroit: Become Human. It will feature multiple playable characters whose actions will change the events of the game’s story.

Star Wars Eclipse is set in the galaxy’s Outer Rim a relatively lawless region that holds desolate planets like Tattooine. Don’t expect to see too many familiar faces as it’s set in the High Republic period hundreds of years before the Star Wars film series.

Upon its announcement Quantic Dream and Lucasfilm Games said Star Wars Eclipse is “early in development” so it’s likely still a few years from release. However it does have a flashy mood-setting reveal trailer.

5. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order 2

After the success of 2019’s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order a sequel was all but guaranteed so it was no surprise when a follow-up was announced in January 2022. Publisher EA didn’t specify how far along in development the game is so there’s no telling exactly when its release date will be though late 2022 or early 2023 wouldn’t be out of the question. It’s all but certain to launch on PS5 Xbox Series X/S and PC but whether it will come out for last-generation consoles is up in the air.

Like the original game Fallen Order 2 is being developed by Respawn Entertainment the studio behind Apex Legends and Titanfall. The original game’s director Stig Asmussen is once again at the helm for Fallen Order 2.

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order centered on a quest to rebuild the Jedi Order between Darth Vader’s rise in Revenge of the Sith and the Rebel Alliance’s counterattack in A New Hope. It’s likely that the sequel will follow the same thread perhaps with Cal Kestis and the rest of the crew seeking other potential Jedi to keep them safe from the Empire.

Gaming industry insider Jeff Grubb has said more news about the game could come on May 4 or during Star Wars Celebration 2022 which begins May 26.

4. Respawn Star Wars FPS

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order 2 developer Respawn is also working on a first-person shooter in the Star Wars universe. Beyond that almost nothing is known about the game including its title. Former LucasArts VP of development Peter Hirschman is directing the game which is reportedly early in development. With several years to go before its expected release it’s likely that the new game will be exclusive to current-gen consoles and PC.

3. Respawn Star Wars RTS

The third and final Star Wars game under Respawn’s oversight is a real-time strategy game. For the game Respawn is working with the newly formed Bit Reactor headed by XCOM 2 art director Greg Foertsch. Bit Reactor is developing the game with production and publishing support from Respawn. Like Respawn’s FPS the untitled strategy game isn’t expected for several years.

2. Ubisoft open-world Star Wars game

Ubisoft announced its open-world Star Wars game in early 2021 but we still know next to nothing about the game. Development is being handled by Ubisoft’s Massive Entertainment which previously made The Division and the upcoming Star Wars game will use the studio’s proprietary Snowdrop engine. Julian Gerighty director of The Division 2 is heading development.

The Division 2 shows off the Snowdrop engine’s impressive graphical capabilities. Ubisoft

While no gameplay details have been revealed Ubisoft’s open-world games tend to stick to a fairly rigid formula. There’s no telling if it will be repeated for the Star Wars game but series like Far Cry and Assassin’s Creed could indicate that a massive map full of optional objectives and enemy fortresses to liberate are likely to make an appearance.

1. Amy Hennig’s Skydance Star Wars game

The most recently announced Star Wars game is also the most mysterious (and maybe the most exciting). The untitled game is described as “a narrative-driven action-adventure game.” Development is being helmed by Amy Hennig a game industry veteran who worked on massive hits like Legacy of Kain and Uncharted. Hennig previously led development on a Star Wars game codenamed Project Ragtag for EA before the game was canceled.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvY2twYXBlcnNob3RndW4uY29tL3Jwcy1hdC1wYXgtMjAyMi1hbGwtdGhlLW5ld3MtZnJvbS1nZWFyYm94cy1iaWctcGF4LXBhbmVsLWluLTUtbWludXRlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RPS@PAX 2022: All the news from Gearbox's big PAX panel in 5 minutes,"Pretend it's Thursday for a second. We've just emerged from Gearbox's 80-minute panel at PAX East 2022 and we're wondering how they managed to spend so much time talking about so little. You know something's gone wrong in a conference when you've got an entire segment dedicated to just merch and Gearbox groupies are hollering for Tiny Tina G-Fuel cans like it was mana from heaven. Lucky for you we suffered through all the merch plugs the failed trailer loads nothing announcements and yet another 20-minute magic set to bring you this condensed version of Gearbox's panel news all so you don't have to suffer through that interminably long stream. Here's everything you need to know from the Gearbox Main Theatre Show panel in 5 minutes.

In truth there were some announcements. As you may have seen earlier today CJ covered the return of Tales Of The Borderlands which we also talk about in the video below. But there were two more games announced at PAX East from Gearbox's publishing arm that caught our attention as well: Eyes In The Dark a monochrome roguelite platforming game and Relic Hunters Legends a cartoonish top-down multiplayer looter shooter that sounds suspiciously like another of Gearbox's famous games. To see both of them in action and our initial thoughts on what we saw have a watch of our round-up video below.

The rest though was a big load of nothing. Trailers for games we already knew about. Trailers for games that are already out. A tiny section about Tiny Tina's Wonderlands DLC that mostly felt like a preliminary plug for their terrible G-Fuel tie-in drink rather than anything remotely useful about the DLC. Then a 20 minute magic section in which Gearbox Studios president (and former Gearbox Software pres) Randy Pitchford proclaimed he could practically read minds before proceeding to be terrible at reading minds before proving that actually he really could read minds and what a clever Hollywood guy he was now. All to promote their D&D tie-in Bunkers And Badasses which the three unlucky members of the audience subjected to this terrible magic show got to take home with them.

The only redeeming highlight aside from new Tales From The Borderlands news was a photo montage from previous Gearbox PAX panels which revealed that Pitchford clearly only has one suit for occasions like this as he wore exactly the same combo of eye-searingly yellow trousers and blue shirt and blazer combo at PAX East 2019 the year they revealed Borderlands 3. As someone who also sat through that achingly long conference I also chuckled slightly when they experienced yet another video malfunction which famously plagued the Borderlands 3 reveal.

The billionaire actually dabbled into the world of game development and even lend his hand to a number of projects. The SpaceX founder was interested in exploring the vast landscape of the endless vacuum at an early age. His stint in the gaming world saw him developing a few FMV games.

In a recent short clip that surfaced on the internet Musk along with his mother talked a bit about his humble beginning. He stated that at just the age of 12 he actually build a shooter title Blastar that featured a space battling against aliens. This project ended up earning him $500 which must have made it quite a compelling career for him to explore.

What did Elon Musk do as a game developer?

Musk’s first major project may have only featured just basic directional controls and one useable weapon. The Tesla owner aspired to do more in this business but sadly he did not get the right role that he envisioned. Musk found himself working for Rocket Science Games (RGS) and was responsible for writing the drivers designing the control interface organizing the routine and so on.

He never got the chance to explore VFX and other intriguing aspects of the project and after this Musk also aided in the production of another FMV game RGS but only this time it was published by Sega. This project was known as Cadillacs and Dinosaurs: The Second Cataclysm.

The short-lived career in the video games industry may haven’t panned out how Musk had anticipated but he is still keeping in touch with his gamer side. In one of his tweets the businessman took aim at Rockstar Games for milking GTA V to the ground. He shared a pretty on-point meme which incited a response from the fans.

While most of Wall Street focuses on large-cap and mega-cap stocks as they provide a degree of safety and liquidity many investors are limited in the number of shares they can buy. Many of the biggest public companies especially the technology giants trade in the hundreds all the way up to over $1000 per share or more. At those steep prices it is difficult to get any decent share count leverage.

[in-text-ad]

Many investors especially more aggressive traders look at lower-priced stocks as a way not only to make some good money but to get a higher share count. That can really help the decision-making process especially when you are on to a winner as you can always sell half and keep half.

Goldman Sachs is the premier investment bank in the world so we screened its outstanding research database and found five stocks trading under the $10 level that could provide investors with upside potential ranging from over 125% to 400%. For those leery of low-priced shares just remember that Amazon and Apple at one time traded in the single digits. Zynga a stock we have featured over the years recently was purchased by Take-Two Interactive Software.



While all five are rated Buy at Goldman Sachs they are much better suited for very aggressive investors. It also is important to remember that no single analyst report should be used as a sole basis for any buying or selling decision.

Angi

Shares of this popular home services company have been crushed and have huge upside potential. Angi Inc. (NASDAQ: ANGI) connects home service professionals with consumers in the United States and internationally.

The Angi Ads business connects consumers with service professionals for local services through the Angi nationwide online directory of service professionals in various service categories. It provides consumers with valuable tools services and content including verified reviews to help them research shop and hire for local services and it sells term-based website and mobile and digital magazine advertising to service professionals as well as provides quoting invoicing and payment services.



The company also owns and operates Angi Leads digital marketplace service which connects consumers with service professionals for home repair maintenance and improvement projects; offers consumers with tools and resources to find local pre-screened and customer-rated service professionals as well as online appointment booking; and connects consumers with service professionals by telephone and home services-related resources.Angi also operates Handy a platform for household services primarily cleaning and repair services; Angi Roofing which provides roof replacement and repair services; and home services marketplaces under the Travaux MyHammer Werkspot MyBuilder and Instapro names.

Goldman Sachs has a $12 price target for Angi stock while the consensus target is $11.59. The shares closed trading on Friday at $4.73. Hitting the Goldman Sachs target would be about a 128% gain.

Array Technologies

This company is still sometimes confused with a biotech with a similar name that Pfizer bought in 2019. Array Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: ARRY) provides solar tracking solutions and services for utility-scale projects. Its products include DuraTrack HZ v3 a single-axis solar tracking system and SmarTrack a machine learning software that automatically adjusts module angles in response to weather and site conditions.

This stock had a red-hot initial public offering in 2020. Shares charged out of the gate as the first trade was 34% above where the upsized IPO was priced. A total of 47.5 million shares were sold in the offering as the maker of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects sold 7 million shares to raise $154 million and a selling shareholder sold 40.5 million shares.

Since then Array Technologies stock has crashed and is offering investors an incredible entry point.

The Goldman Sachs target price is $21 and the consensus target for Array Technologies stock is $21.80. Shares traded on Friday at $7.02 down 5%. Hitting the Goldman Sachs target would be a 148% gain or so.

Kinnate Biopharma

If clinical data goes the way the analysts expect this stock could be an incredible home run. Kinnate Biopharma Inc. (NASDAQ: KNTE) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of small molecule kinase inhibitors to treat genomically defined cancers in the United States.

The company develops KIN-2787 a rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma inhibitor for the treatment of patients with lung cancer melanoma and other solid tumors; KIN-3248 small-molecule kinase inhibitors that target cancer-associated alterations in fibroblast growth factor receptors FGFR2 and FGFR3 genes; and small molecule research programs including Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 12(CDK12) inhibitor in its KIN004 program.

The company recently announced that the first patient has commenced treatment in its Phase 1 KN-4802 clinical trial evaluating its lead fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) product candidate KIN-3248. This is a next-generation pan-FGFR inhibitor being developed for the treatment of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and urothelial carcinoma as well as other solid tumors.

The $44 Goldman Sachs price objective is higher than the also incredible $41.50 consensus target. The shares closed trading at $8.26 on Friday. Hitting the Goldman Sachs target would be a moonshot 415% gain.



Vivint Smart Home

This off-the-radar company has been growing quickly as home security has become a priority for many. Vivint Smart Home Inc. (NYSE: VVNT) engages in the sale installation servicing and monitoring of smart home and security systems primarily in the United States and Canada.

The company’s smart home platform includes cloud-enabled smart home operating systems; AI-driven smart home automation and assistance software; software-enabled smart home devices; and tech-enabled services to educate manage and support the smart home. It also offers other devices including control panel door and window sensors security cameras and smoke alarms door locks motion sensors glass break detectors key fobs emergency pendants carbon monoxide detectors and fire flood and burglary sensors.

[in-text-ad]

Vivint Smart Home solutions enable subscribers to interact with their connected home with voice or mobile device including front door viewing live and recorded video inside and outside homes as well as control thermostats locks lights and garage doors and managing movement of families friends and visitors. As of March 31 2021 its smart home platform had approximately 1.9 million subscribers and managed approximately 26 million in-home devices. It markets its products through direct-to-home and inside sales channels.

The Goldman Sachs price target of $14 compares with a $12.14 consensus target and a $5.40 per share Vivint Smart Home stock price on Friday. Hitting the Goldman Sachs target price would be about a 166% gain.



Zevia

This is another micro-cap idea with incredible upside potential. Zevia PBC (NYSE: ZVIA) is a beverage company that develops markets sells and distributes various carbonated and non-carbonated soft drinks in the United States and Canada.

The company offers soda energy drinks organic tea mixers kids beverages and sparkling water. The company offers its products through various retail channels including grocery distributors national retailers warehouse club and natural products retailers as well as e-commerce channels. It provides its products under the Zevia brand name.

The company is focused on addressing the global health challenges resulting from excess sugar consumption by offering a broad portfolio of zero-sugar zero-calorie naturally sweetened beverages. All Zevia beverages are made with a handful of simple plant-based ingredients contain no artificial sweeteners and are Non-GMO Project verified gluten-free Kosher vegan and zero sodium.

Goldman Sachs has set a $16 price target. The consensus target is $11.27 and shares wrere last traded on Friday at $3.44. Hitting that Goldman Sachs target would be a gain of 300% or so.



These are five stocks for aggressive investors looking to get share count leverage on companies that have sizable upside potential. While not suited for all investors they are not penny stocks with absolutely no track record or liquidity and major Wall Street firms have research coverage.

Several instances of authorities mistreating Black children have circulated the news in the past week. Earlier this week a 14-year-old Black boy with autism was violently handled by law enforcement in a confusing incident at a Clifton Park NY Target. According to the Times Union the boy was waiting for his siblings when approached by a Saratoga County sheriff’s deputy.

The lack of compassion shown to Black children and teens is not new but it’s still jarring to watch. While the video is not included in this article it can be viewed from the GoFundMe link below.

Video of the incident is disturbing with a child crying in the background and someone shouting “these are children” at police and presumably security staff. The kids continue to yell that the boy had money and his sister is insistent that officers get off on him. In the video a sheriff’s deputy can be seen pinning the boy down with his own body.

In an interview with Spectrum News Ware said her children were traumatized by the incident. From available information her 17-year-old daughter who attempted to intervene is facing charges for allegedly assaulting an officer.

An official from the Clifton Park Target claimed that a security team member called authorities alleging that one of the youth had previously threatened violence. There is no allegation they did anything justifying the physical aggression.

According to the NeuroClastic Twitter account the Saratoga Sheriff’s Department has Autism decals on their cars in recognition of the awareness month. Seems like they need to learn de-escalation and how to handle autistic people of all ages instead of removable decals.

Local news quoted the Saratoga sheriff as saying 50-80 percent of the people his officers encounter have a disability.

“We’re trying to make sure that first responders know for example that there could be another reason why a person might not be responding to them and that it’s not always a case of them being uncooperative” told News10. “It’s all about safety.”

Apparently it’s only about protecting safety when the person isn’t Black.

Tracy Sangaré the bystander who caught the video told Spectrum a manager remarked they only wanted the youth to leave the store again suggesting there wasn’t a specific reason for instigating the altercation. She previously tweeted about the violent interaction saying the boy tried to show the officer that he had money and didn’t have any merchandise on him.

“The police approached him & he immediately showed them that he had cash on him & he had no merchandise on him. The manager wasn’t saying he was stealing- the manager wanted him removed.

The Saratoga Black Lives Matter account also tweeted a link to a GoFundMe for the family.

“The family’s home was ransacked by police this morning and the young girl is being targeted” tweeted Saratoga Black Lives Matter. “The mother and children no longer feel safe in their home and would like to move into a hotel. Anything helps so please donate and share.”

As of Friday night $2625 of a $5000 goal had been raised.

A New York Times op-ed written in June 2020 after the murder of George Floyd called out another Target for mistreating an autistic child who tried to hug an employee. Written by the boy’s mother Doreen Oliver the op-ed outlined a similar overreaction on behalf of Target staff at a New Jersey store and the likelihood that his white sitter likely saved his life.

Lucid Group (LCID -14.10%) the electric vehicle maker that went public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) last July has often been compared to Tesla (TSLA -3.76%).

Lucid's CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson previously served as Tesla's chief vehicle engineer from 2009 to 2012. Its debut vehicle the Lucid Dream can travel up to 520 miles on a single charge which beats Tesla's Model S Long Range by more than 100 miles. Lucid also targets a higher-end market than Tesla with even pricier EVs.

However Lucid only started shipping its first vehicles last October and it will likely take more than a decade for the fledgling company to match Tesla's current production capabilities. Lucid's market cap of $35 billion is also tiny compared to Tesla's market cap of $1.01 trillion. But could it repeat Tesla's success story and join the 12-zero club by 2030?

Overcoming its near-term challenges

Between last October and the end of this February Lucid delivered 300 Air sedans. It had planned to deliver 20000 vehicles in 2022 but it reduced that target to 12000-14000 during its fourth-quarter report in February.

It blamed that reduction on the ongoing chip shortage and supply-chain challenges across the world. It also postponed the upcoming launch of its second EV the Gravity SUV from 2023 to the first half of 2024.

Despite those challenges Lucid's reservations still reached 25000 at the end of February which represents a steady increase from 13000 reservations last September and 17000 reservations last November.

Lucid's AMP-1 manufacturing plant in Arizona has an annual production capacity of 34000 vehicles. It expects its Phase 2 expansion which broke ground last July to boost its annual capacity to 90000 vehicles in 2023.

Expanding its capacity and entering new markets

At the same time Lucid plans to expand overseas. It already expanded into Canada last year and it's gearing up to enter the Europe Middle East and Africa (EMEA) market this year with its first factory in Saudi Arabia. It also plans to enter the booming but fragmented Chinese EV market in 2023.

Lucid expects its expenses to soar in 2022 and 2023 as it executes those plans. Based on its reduced shipment targets analysts expect the company to generate just $1.3 billion in revenue this year compared to its original target of $2.2 billion while incurring a net loss of $2.2 billion.

In 2023 analysts expect Lucid's revenue to rise 172% to $3.5 billion as its net loss narrows to $1.6 billion. In 2024 they expect its revenue to grow another 70% to $6.0 billion as its net loss narrows to $1.1 billion.

Lucid expects to turn profitable on an adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) basis for the first time in 2024 and for its free cash flow (FCF) to turn positive the following year.

Swinging for a home run by 2030

Lucid expects to generate $14 billion in revenue in 2025 as it ships 135000 vehicles and to generate $22.8 billion in revenue in 2026 from 251000 vehicles. Here's a clearer breakdown of that ambitious roadmap:

Model 2025 Shipments 2026 Shipments Air 42000 42000 Gravity 86000 134000 New Model 7000-8000 75000 Total Shipments 135000 251000 Target Revenue $14.0 billion $22.8 billion

But between 2026 and 2030 Lucid expects to double its annual shipments to 500000. By comparison Tesla's annual deliveries rose from 245240 in 2018 to 499550 in 2020 and it delivered 936172 vehicles in 2021.

Lucid's planned four-year gap between a quarter-million and half-million deliveries seems more conservative than Tesla's two-year gap. But it's still a very lofty goal considering that Lucid lacks Tesla's first-mover advantage and targets a much smaller niche of top-tier luxury buyers.

Could Lucid possibly become a trillion-dollar company?

Assuming that Lucid's average selling prices stay roughly the same (at about $91000 per vehicle) between 2026 and 2030 it will likely generate about $45 billion in revenue by the final year.

With a market cap of $35 billion Lucid currently trades at 27 times this year's sales. If we multiply that price-to-sales ratio by $45 billion we get a market capitalization of $1.2 trillion.

However it's highly unlikely that Lucid will continue to trade at such a high valuation as its year-over-year revenue growth decelerates. That's why Tesla currently trades at 12 times this year's sales.

If Lucid hits its growth targets and also trades at 12 times sales in 2030 it would be worth about $540 billion -- which would broadly miss the trillion-dollar mark but still make it one of the world's most valuable automakers.

I believe that's the best-case scenario for Lucid's investors and it would still represent a 15-bagger gain from its current price. But for now investors should focus on Lucid's ability to achieve its near-term goals for 2022 and 2023 as it navigates its supply chain challenges. If it needs to cut its production targets again or revise its long-term roadmap it could struggle to maintain its current valuation and its stock could crash."

Smart Summon mode allows drivers to hail the car using their phone. Tesla

A witness told Insider that a Tesla in Full Self-Driving mode crashed into a Cirrus jet at an event.

The car was using Smart Summon when it crashed the witness said.

Drivers are able to hail a Tesla from 200 metres away using the feature.

A Tesla appeared to crash into a private jet valued between $3 million and $3.5 million while in its self-driving Smart Summon mode on Friday according to a witness.

A Reddit user with the username u/smiteme said they witnessed the event and posted a video of the incident to the platform.

The footage shows a driverless Tesla crashing into a Cirrus Vision Jet at Felt Fields Airport in Spokane Washington. The airport did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment made outside normal working hours.

Cirrus confirmed to Insider that the plane was a Cirrus Vision Jet priced between $3 million and $3.5 million and belonged to a customer who it was unable to identify. It is unclear how much damage the car or plane sustained in the incident.

The Reddit user u/smiteme who asked not to share their real name told Insider they were at the event which was put on by Cirrus.

They said: ""It was at Felts Field airport in Spokane for an event put on by Cirrus. I'm not sure whose jet it was — it arrived later into the event (there was another Vision jet and several Cirrus planes there as well).""

They added: ""I don't know the owners of either vehicle. Just that the Tesla owner was using summon.""

Tesla's Smart Summon mode allows its driver to hail the car using their phone within a distance of 200 feet. The feature reportedly caused havoc when it was first rolled out in 2019 with some Teslas reportedly driving into foliage or being involved in near-misses.

Tesla did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment outside normal working hours.

Tesla's website carries a number of warnings for its Smart Summon mode. These include the fact that it is a Beta feature and that as such the car should be continually monitored by its owner while in that mode.

""Smart Summon is designed and intended for use only on parking lots and driveways located on private property where the surrounding area is familiar and predictable. Do not use Smart Summon on public roads"" one of the warnings states.

Self-driving technology is receiving gradual approval by US regulators. In March the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration approved the production and deployment of cars without steering wheels or pedals in a landmark ruling.

Elon Musk has accused Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates of shorting Tesla .

In a tweet on Friday the Tesla CEO admitted that he asked Gates if he was short-selling shares of the electric carmaker. When investors short a stock they are betting that the price of the asset will fall.

""I heard from multiple people at TED that Gates still had half billion short against Tesla which is why I asked him so it's not exactly top secret"" Musk said in the tweet.

He was responding to a Twitter user's question on whether a screengrab of a supposed text conversation between the two billionaires was real.

The Tesla chief's response was: ""Yeah but I didn't leak it to NYT. They must have got it through friends of friends.""

Fort Bend County Judge KP George penned a letter to Disney CEO Bob Chapek Friday inviting the Walt Disney Company “to consider Fort Bend County as a welcoming and diverse place to do business.”

The invitation comes after Florida lawmakers passed a bill that would dissolve Disney World’s private government which has been in operation for 55 years and provides municipal-like services for its 27000 acres according to the Associated Press.

The Associated Press said the law has been viewed as retribution by many for Disney’s criticism over the “Don’t Say Gay Bill” which prevents instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade.

FAA approves ALSIM AL40 simulator as AATD

ALSIM announced that the FAA has approved the ALSIM AL40 simulator as an Advanced Aviation Training Device (AATD). The AL40 is an exact replica of a new Diamond DA40 NG aircraft equipped with a real Garmin G1000 NXi avionics suite. In the United States ALSIM’s AL40 is currently operated by the Aspen Flight Academy in Colorado a one-of-a-kind programme that offers every Aspen High School student the chance to experience flight and learn about careers in aviation.

Captain Mike Pearce the Aspen Flight Academy’s chairman a Boeing 777 captain for American Airlines and the creator of the Every Student Flies program said “The ALSIM AL40 is an exceptional simulator with state of the art flight characteristics. It is ability to provide substantial instrument training and provide realistic emergency situations is astounding. This device has truly improved the performance of my students in all aspects of flight training.”

Dr Scott Firsing of the ALSIM North America team said “Having the AATD approval for the AL40 now means student pilots in America can log respectively up to 20 hours and 50 towards their instrument rating and CPL certificate. Moreover with the current higher prices for aircraft fuel insurance and most aviation related items a high-fidelity simulator with real Garmin avionics immersive visuals and an authentic force feedback system makes the AL40 a must have business and training item. We developed a new industry leading flight model for this simulator that can replicate the most basic flight manoeuvres to the more advanced emergency procedures.”

AAI Textron Sig Sauer and General Dynamics were the finalists in the NGSW tender. Experimental batches of rifles and machine guns were delivered to the troops by the competitors while the official comparative tests took place at the beginning of 2021.

On Tuesday 19th of April the army officials announced that Sig Sauer had been awarded a 10-year contract worth $20.4 million for building the XM5 Rifle and the XM250 Automatic Rifle along with the 6.8 mm ammunition.

Earlier the company had also won a contract to provide M17 and M18 handguns for the Army replacing the Beretta M9 after three decades of service.

How is the X.M. better than the M4?

Several factors contribute to the better performance of XM5 and XM250 for instance:

Firstly both M4 carbine and M249 Squad Automatic Weapon fire the 5.56 mm round. The 6.8mm round has a much higher lethality at distances beyond the effective range of the 5.56mm and also retains a better accuracy than the 7.62mm.

According to the 2017 Small Arms Ammunition Configuration Study the 5.56 mm reaches its lethality limits at or before the 300 meter range. On the other hand the 6.8 mm can effectively destroy targets at 600 meters and beyond.

Secondly the M249 and M240 machine guns weigh around 18 pounds and 28 pounds respectively but Sig Sauer’s design for the machine gun variant weighs 12 pounds making it lighter than both. However XM5 weighs around 8.3 pounds which is slightly heavier than an M4 (7.3 pounds).

Third soldiers generally need to replace the barrels on their M4 carbines after firing 6000 rounds and Sig Sauer’s design for NGSW could fire up to 12000 rounds before needing to change barrels.

Fourth the 5.56 x 45 mm NATO round chambered by M4 carbines and M249 machine guns has a maximum chamber pressure of around 62000 pounds per square inch while the Sig Sauer design has a maximum chamber pressure of 80000 pounds per square inch which the officials claim extends the weapon’s range without the need for a longer barrel or heavier ammunition.

Fire Control System

Vortex Optics subsidiary Sheltered Wings is making the XM157 Fire Control optic that both weapons will feature. The company won a contract for the same in January and will be worth $2.7 billion over the next ten years.

A January release from the Army’s Cross-Functional Team-Soldier Lethality stated that the NGSW-FC system is a ruggedized fire control which increases the lethality and accuracy of Close Combat Force. It integrates various advanced technologies such as visible and infrared aiming lasers compass a digital display overlay atmospheric sensor suite backup etched reticle ballistic calculator laser rangefinder a variable magnification optic and Intra-Soldier Wireless.

From the competitors

Sig Sauer’s design was selected over the one offered by LoneStar Future Weapons owned by True Velocity and Textron Systems. Both provided prototypes that made it to the late stages of the rifle competition with the former.

On the one hand the design by LoneStar’s Beretta made RM277 WEAPON SYSTEM featured a “bullpup” configuration where the magazine feed was mounted behind the grip and to absorb the recoil a reciprocating barrel moves backwards with each shot while on the other Textron System design used a polymer casing to reduce weight and a cased telescoped ammunition that reduced overall cartridge length.

Ongoing status

Apart from the above the M4s will continue to be used by general-purpose forces for the coming decades. Other than the Army the Marines are expected to receive quantities of the weapons for their close combat forces.

The automatic rifle is named the XM250 and the rifle variant is currently dubbed the XM5. According to the report the “X” status remains until fielded in most Army naming conventions.

The first batch of the above-mentioned rifles along with their high-tech fire control optic is scheduled to arrive by the end of fiscal 2023.

The weapon is designed and aimed at close combat forces including infantrymen but also forward observers combat medics combat engineers and cavalry scouts.",,,,,,

Here the level of APP-αCTF was found to increase linearly with total protein concentration in a manner comparable to the amido black total protein stain (Fig. 1A). Moreover no saturation by the anti-APP_CTF antibody (1:1500 dilution) was observed up to 25 µg of loaded protein as confirmed by linear regression (R2 = 0.9637) (Fig. 1A). We further demonstrated that APP-αCTF was readily detected in five commonly used cell lines of various human origin HEK293 HeLa MDA-MB231 A375 and SH-SY5Y at 10 µg of total protein (Fig. 1B). Our results accompany previous research that describes the detection of APP-αCTF in cell lysates from PC12 KNS-42 HT22 H4 and CHO cell lines as well1819212223. Moreover proteomic analysis of eleven common cell lines (A549 GAMG HEK293 Hela HepG2 Jurkat K562 LnCap MCF-7 RKO U2OS) showed the presence of APP (except in the K562 cell line while the Jurkat cell line was inconclusive) and ADAM10 (one of the α-secretase suspected to cleave APP1617 in all)24 suggesting APP-αCTF could be present in these cases as well. Therefore APP-αCTF appears to be ubiquitously expressed in several mammalian cell lines. Overall the level of APP-αCTF and the sensitivity of the anti-APP_C99 antibody were suitable to detect changes in protein level as is required for a protein loading control.

(A) Western blot analysis of HEK293 cell lysate with APP-αCTF detection as total protein concentration increases (2.5–25 µg) as compared to amido black total protein stain (TPS) with corresponding standardised optical density plots as analysed for APP-αCTF (open purple triangle) and TPS (open red square) as mean ± SD showing R2 and slope for each (n = 3).

We subsequently evaluated the thermal stability of APP-αCTF over a broad temperature range (4 °C room temperature (RT) and 40–95 °C) and as compared to the other commonly used loading controls—vinculin HSP70 GAPDH SOD-1 and β-actin (Figs. 2 3 Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2). APP-αCTF protein level remained constant up to 95 °C (including 4 °C and RT controls) yielding no significant difference across all temperatures assessed (p > 0.05) (Fig. 3C). Importantly the APP-βCTF produced only by overexpressing APP20 also yielded constant protein levels up to 85 °C (Supplementary Fig. S2). No significant difference was achieved when αCTF and βCTF were directly compared suggesting the two APP-CTF fragments behave similarly within the CETSA (p > 0.05) (Supplementary Fig. S2). In contrast to APP-CTFs the other loading control proteins displayed temperature sensitivities. Specifically no discernible detections were observed for vinculin at > 70.0 °C GAPDH at > 60.0 °C and β-actin at > 50.0 °C (with Taggs of 58.4 ± 1.0 °C and 55.2 ± 0.4 °C calculated for vinculin and GAPDH respectively) (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S1). Moreover the level of HSP70 also decreased with increasing temperature although protein was detected up to 85 °C (Figs. 2A and 3). The Tagg for HSP70 was determined to be 56.0 ± 0.9 °C (Fig. 2B). Under the experimental conditions used here (non-reducing) SOD-1 appeared as oligomers of > 25 kDa from 45 to 65 °C (Fig. S1) while the unfolded monomerized protein was only detected at > 65 °C (Fig. 2). We therefore could not quantify nor determine a melting temperature for this protein. As expected total protein levels decreased as temperature increased (Supplementary Fig. S3). This illustrates the suboptimal performance of common loading control techniques and the superior nature of APP-CTFs in the CETSA.

To confirm that APP-αCTF protein level remains constant i.e. soluble across a temperature range the protein level in both the soluble and insoluble fractions were compared from 4 to 95 °C (Fig. 3). HSP70 was included to illustrate the transition of protein from a soluble to an insoluble form with an increase in temperature as is expected for most proteins (Fig. 3B). We report that the protein levels of APP-αCTF in the soluble fraction were constant up to 95 °C with negligible protein detected in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 3AC). Conversely as temperature increased HSP70 level in the soluble fraction inversely reflected its level in the insoluble fraction clearly demonstrating the movement of protein from a soluble to an insoluble form (Fig. 3BC). This suggests that APP-αCTF does not aggregate into an insoluble protein at unfavourable temperatures.

We further suspected that APP-CTFs soluble protein levels would remain constant even in the presence of a binding ligand. To assess this we conducted a broad-range CETSA (45–85 °C) in the presence of the previously identified APP-βCTF binding ligand CHF5074 (Itanapraced). The assay was conducted in the presence of 5 and 10 µM concentrations exceeding the reported binding concentration of 3 µM25. When our APP-overexpressing cell line—used to generate βCTF—was exposed to CHF5074 and CETSA conducted the level of βCTF remained constant and comparable to the DMSO control (Fig. 4A). Moreover the relative band intensity of βCTF in the presence of DMSO and 10 µM CHF5074 were not significantly different across the temperature range tested (p > 0.05) (Fig. 4B). This provides evidence that APP-CTF protein level should not fluctuate even in the event of unexpected off-target binding of ligands tested in this assay. Taken together this data clearly indicates that APP-CTFs (both α and β) are highly stable soluble proteins with negligible fluctuation in protein level over a broad temperature range (4–95 °C) or in the presence of a binding ligand.

Figure 4 The APP-βCTF binding ligand CHF5074 has no impact on protein level and stability. (A) A representative cropped western blot of APP-βCTF in the soluble fraction from APP-overexpressing HEK293 stable cell line after treatment with 5 and 10 µM CHF5074 for 4 h and subsequent temperature exposure (broad range: 45–85 °C) as compared to a DMSO vehicle control with (B) a comparative relative band intensity graph of DMSO (blue) and 10 µM CHF5074 (green) calculated by setting the 45 °C as 100% as mean ± SD (n = 3). Multiple paired t-test was performed where ns not significant. See supplementary information file raw data images for full-length western blots. Full size image

Next we ascertained APP-αCTF applicability as a loading control in a CETSA where a protein is successfully stabilised by ligand binding—a working example. We therefore exploited the readily detectable MEK protein in conjunction with two previously identified potent inhibitors PD184352 and U012626. Based on previous investigations of these inhibitors on the MEK cascade in mammalian cell lines we determined that 5 µM would be an effective concentration to determine binding2728. As expected after inhibitor exposure for 4 h the Tagg of MEK increased in the presence of both PD184352 and U0126 from 47.1 ± 0.4 °C (DMSO control) to 53.4 ± 0.7 °C and 48.2 ± 0.6 °C respectively (Fig. 5). Of note the shift obtained with PD184352 was statistically different from the control (**p ≤ 0.0001) while with U0126 it was not (p > 0.05) (Fig. 5D). As previously reported U0126 does not behave as a tight binding inhibitor which may explain the results observed here27. APP-αCTF was clearly detected at all temperatures confirming sample was loaded in each lane (Fig. 5A). The loading control was further used to normalise each relative band intensity and Tagg recalculated (Fig. 5C). In these cases the normalised (N) Tagg was 47.0 ± 0.6 °C for MEK alone (N_Control) 53.7 ± 0.3 °C in the presence of PD184352 and 48.8 ± 0.3 °C in the presence of U0126 (Fig. 5CD). Normalised Taggs were not significantly different from the pre-normalised Taggs (p > 0.05) however it was observed that the variance of each data point was reduced in most cases (Fig. 5CD and Supplementary Fig. S4). Importantly the increase in Tagg observed for U0126 after normalisation was now found to be significantly different from both pre-normalised and normalised controls (**p ≤ 0.01). This clearly demonstrates the use of APP-αCTF as a genuine loading control for the CETSA where αCTF level remained constant while the protein of interest’s level changed due to stabilisation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNTk4LTAyMi0xMDY0MC150gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Human amniotic fluid stem cells can alleviate detrusor dysfunction caused by bladder outlet obstruction in rats ...,"Animal preparation

Female Sprague–Dawley rats (10–12 weeks old) were maintained at 21–23 °C room temperature and 47% humidity with a 12 h light–dark cycle and given free access to standard laboratory chow and tap water ad libitum. All protocols were approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals (No. 2017121812) and the Institutional Review Board of our institute (IRB no. 201701998A3). All procedures were performed in accordance with the National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications No. 80–23) and ARRIVE guidelines (https://arriveguidelines.org).

Experiment design

A total of 72 rats were randomly assigned to 3 groups for in vitro and in vivo studies: (1) sham-operated rats with the injection of 0.3 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (control group); (2) pBOO rats with single injection of 0.3 mL PBS (pBOO + PBS); (3) pBOO rats with single injection of 1 × 106 hAFSCs in 0.3 mL PBS (pBOO + hAFSCs). An abdominal incision was made and either the hAFSCs or the PBS was directly injected into the submucosal layer of bladder wall using a 500-μL syringe with 26-gauge needle.

For in vivo study 36 rats received bladder function test using conscious cystometry at 2 and 6 weeks after pBOO (n = 6 in each time point). Animals were euthanized after cystometry and bladders were removed and weighed. Expressions of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF1α) CCL2 interleukin-1β (IL-1β) transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) collagen I collagen III and protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5) in bladder were examined by immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction. With the same grouping method as in vivo study another 36 rats were used in the in vitro study. The whole bladder of each rat was extirpated for detrusor muscle cell culture and then the expressions of HIF1α CCL2 IL-1β TGF-β1 CTGF α-SMA collagen I collagen III CD11b/c and HIS48 [for myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) assessment] were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The experimental procedure is shown in Fig. 1.

Isolation and characterization of hAFSCs for treatment

The hAFSCs were obtained from freshly collected amniotic fluid by routine amniocentesis from second-trimester healthy pregnant donors. Cells were cultured in StemPro® MSC SFM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen Carlsbad CA USA) and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 . The specific surface antigens of hAFSCs were characterized using flow cytometry according to our previous work131415. The cells in culture were trypsinized and stained with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated antibodies against CD44 CD45 CD73 CD90 CD105 and CD117 (BD PharMingen San Diego CA USA). Thereafter the cells were analyzed using Calibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Heidelberg Germany). Passage 6–8 hAFSCs were collected and prepared to a final concentration of 1 × 106 cells/0.3 mL in PBS. In the hAFSCs-treated groups 1 × 106 collected hAFSCs were injected into 5 sites of bladder in each rat (anterior posterior bilateral and dome) under inhalation anesthesia according to our previous method1415. The treatment dose of hAFSCs was determined according to our previous study that used hAFSCs to treat bladder dysfunction after focal cerebral ischemia in rats15.

Surgical induction of BOO

Partial BOO was made in rats through proximal urethral ligation16. Under 2% isoflurane inhalation rats were placed in supine position. A suprapubic midline incision was made and abdominal cavity was opened to expose the urethrovesical junction. A polyethylene 50 tube was introduced into the urethra as the stent for urethral ligation so that the outer diameter of catheterized urethra was about 1.0 mm. A 5–0 silk suture was loosely tied around the catheterized urethra and the catheter was then removed shortly after. The bladder was repositioned and the abdominal wall was closed. Control rats received temporary catheterization in the urethrovesical junction after surgical procedure without urethral ligation.

Conscious cystometry

Two days after implantation of suprapubic catheter animals were placed in a special metabolic cage (Med Associates Inc. St. Albans VT USA) for conscious cystometries at 2 and 6 weeks after sham treatment pBOO + PBS and pBOO + hAFSCs treatment according to our previous studies1415. All the cystometric parameters on 5 consecutive micturition cycles were collected for analysis. Three cystometric variables were investigated including peak voiding pressure bladder capacity and residual volume17. Cystometry Analysis Version 1.05 (Catamount Research and Development St Albans VT USA) was used for cystometric analysis.

Culture of bladder smooth muscle cells

For in vitro study rats were euthanized with an overdose of isoflurane. The tissue of bladder body was placed on ice and then the mucosa and the serosa on detrusor were quickly trimmed off with scissors. The smooth muscle layer was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in PBS(-) containing 0.2% trypsin (Gibco Thermo Fisher Scientific USA) in a shaking incubator18. The smooth muscle layers were finely minced with scissors and allowed to suspend in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco Thermo Fisher Scientific USA) containing 0.1% collagenase (Gibco Thermo Fisher Scientific USA). After digestion cell suspension was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 250 × g to remove supernatant. Pellet was re-suspended with RPMI-1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and centrifugated at 250 × g. Supernatant (I) was collected and pellet was re-suspended with RPMI-1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and then centrifugated at 125 × g. Supernatant (II) and pellet contaminating tissues including fibroblasts intimal cells and tissue debris were also collected. The supernatant fraction which contained smooth muscle cells was collected. Then the pure smooth muscle cells were cultured on dish containing RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO 2 . The culture medium was changed every 3 days. At 7 days the cultured smooth muscle cells of rat bladder body were immunostained with anti-α-actin antibody.

Tissue preparation

After cystometries were performed all rats were euthanized with an overdose of isoflurane. The dissected bladder walls were fixed in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C. The bladders were then subjected to cryosection to yield tissue sections of 12-μm thickness at − 20 °C and the sections were transferred to glass microscope slides coated with silane (Muto Pure Chemical Tokyo Japan).

Histology assessment

Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining was performed for the measurements of bladder wall thickness and Masson's trichrome staining was performed for histopathological observation. The bladder wall thickness was measured at the 4 ends of a cross in 3 whole bladder sections separated in 1 mm for each rat. The smooth muscle and the connective tissue were stained in red and blue respectively. The percentage of bladder tissue affected by fibrosis was determined by calculating the ratio of collagen area to smooth muscle area. The bladder wall thickness and areas for connective tissue and total tissue were quantitated using Image-Pro Plus Software (Media Cybernetics Silver Spring MD USA) under Olympus BX-51 microscope and compared among the groups.

Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent assessment

The dissected bladders were fixed in OCT compound frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C. The bladders were then subjected to cryosection yielding sections of 12-μm thickness at − 20 °C and the sections were transferred to glass microscope slides coated with silane (Muto Pure Chemical Tokyo Japan).

Bladder sections were immunostained against HIF1α CCL2 IL-1β TGF-β1 CTGF α-SMA collagen I collagen III and PGP9.5 using the avidin–biotin peroxidase method and against CD11b/c and HIS48 using the immunofluorescent method. The catalogue number isotype dilution concentration host species and manufacturer of each antibody were summarized in Supplementary Table S1. First fresh-frozen sections were fixed for 10 min in acetone (Honeywell Germany) or 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA Merck Millipore USA). Acetone was used for HIF-1α CCL2 IL-1β TGF-β1 CTGF and PGP9.5 antibodies and 4% PFA for α-SMA collagen I collagen III CD11b/c and HIS48 antibodies. After blocking with Dako REAL peroxidase blocking solution (DAKO Corp Carpinteria CA USA) against HIF1α CCL2 IL-1β TGF-β1 CTGF α-SMA collagen I collagen III and PGP9.5 for 20 min and with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA Thermo Fisher Scientific USA) against CD11b/c and HIS48 for 30 min sections were washed and incubated with primary antibody for 20 h at 4 °C. Sections were then washed and incubated for 1 h with biotinylated secondary antibodies (1:200 Vector Laboratories Burlingame CA USA) or Alexa-fluor 488 (1:250 Invitrogen Grand Island NY USA). Staining was developed with 3 3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB Thermo Fisher Scientific USA) plus hydrogen peroxide as the chromogen and counterstained with hematoxylin for HIF1α CCL2 IL-1β TGF-β1 CTGF α-SMA collagen I collagen III and PGP9.5. In addition nuclear staining using CD11b/c and HIS48 was performed with 4' 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI BIOTOOLS CO. LTD Taipei Taiwan). Sections from the three experimental groups were put on the same slide during staining to keep same incubation time for the antibodies and chromogen.

Immunofluorescence against HIF1α CCL2 IL-1β TGF-β1 CTGF α-SMA collagen I collagen III and PGP9.5 was done on detrusor smooth muscle cells. Detrusor smooth muscle cells of 2–3 passages were collected plated at an appropriate density and attached to a 12-well plate. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min and then rinsed 3 times with PBS. After incubation with 1% BSA blocking agent and 0.1% Triton-X 100 (Sigma-Aldrich USA) cells were washed and incubated for 20 h at 4 °C with primary antibodies and then incubated for 1 h with secondary antibody Alexa-fluor 488 (1:250 Invitrogen Grand Island NY USA). Nuclear staining was performed with 4' 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).

Immunoreactivity was analyzed using Image-Pro Plus Software (Media Cybernetics Silver Spring MD USA) under Olympus BX-51 microscope. The ratio of immunoreactivity level of pBOO rats with or without hAFSCs treatment to that of sham rats was determined for all the reactions.

Quantitative reverse transcription PCR of bladder

Real-time PCR was carried out according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Total RNAs were prepared using a Trizol reagent (Invitrogen Carlsbad CA USA) and incubated in reverse transcription mixture at 25 °C for 5 min 50 °C for 1 h 70 °C for 15 min; finally the tubes were cooled to 4 °C for 5 min. Gene expression for HIF1α CCL2 IL-1β TGF-β1 CTGF α-SMA collagen I collagen III and PGP9.5 in the bladder tissue was analyzed by real-time PCR using inventoried TaqMan assays from Applied Biosystems (Life Technologies Grand Island NY USA). The assays codes of HIF1α (Rn01472831-m1) CCL2 (Rn00580555-m1) IL-1β (Rn00580432-m1) TGF-β1 (Rn00572010-m1) CTGF (Rn01537279-g1) α-SMA (Rn01759928-g1) collagen I (Rn01463848-m1) collagen III (Rn01437681-m1) and PGP9.5 (Rn00568258-m1) were obtained from manufacturer (Applied Biosystems Oster City CA USA). GAPDH (assay code Rs99999916-s1) was used as an endogenous control to allow for quantification of relative gene expression. Thermal cycling and fluorescence detection were performed using an ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems Oster City CA USA). PCR conditions were 50 °C for 2 min 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for one min. The data were calculated using the 2[-Delta Delta C(T)] method19. A ratio of the mRNA level of pBOO rats with or without hAFSCs treatment to that of sham rats was determined. The values were summated and expressed as mean ± SD and were compared statistically among the groups and among different time points in each group.

Statistical analysis

Data were analyzed with Prism 5 (GraphPad Software San Diego CA USA) and expressed as mean ± SD for continuous variables. Continuous data were compared among the groups by using one-way analysis of variance. The Tukey–Kramer test was used for post-hoc comparisons. To evaluate the effect of hAFSCs among groups Chi-Square test was performed with Fisher’s Exact Test. Probability values of < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNTk4LTAyMi0xMDY5Mi0w0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Asteltoxin inhibits extracellular vesicle production through AMPK/mTOR-mediated activation of lysosome function ...,"Discovery of asteltoxin a new EV production inhibitor from fungi extracts using cancer cells engineered to secrete luciferase-labeled EVs

We previously developed cancer cells that secrete luciferase-labeled EVs25 which make it possible to measure EVs produced into the culture medium in a high-throughput manner. These cells were used to screen extracts of fungi isolated from marine organisms. To exclude cytotoxic compounds cell proliferation was simultaneously monitored. As a result of screening from 2300 of extracts library prepared from marine sponges and marine-derived microorganisms a culture extract from the marine-derived Aspergillus ochraceopetaliformis 14D23-1–2 fungi was found to inhibit EV production. The bioassay-guided separation of the active EtOAc-soluble portion led to the isolation of asteltoxin (Fig. 1A) which was previously identified as a mitochondrial inhibitor. The target of asteltoxin is recognized as F1 region of ATP synthase26 which was supported by the crystal structure of F1-ATPase complexed with aurovertin B27 which is a polyketide sharing a polyene α-pyrone-type structure of asteltoxin. Asteltoxin was identified using electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses and these results were compared to authentic spectral data28. Using CD63-Nluc expressing HT29 colon cancer cells we determined that asteltoxin inhibited CD63-positive EV production with an IC 50 of 2.1 μg/mL but exhibited low cytotoxicity with an IC 50 of more than 100 μg/mL (Fig. 1B). Interestingly other mitochondrial inhibitors Rotenone and CCCP suppressed cell growth at the concentrations that inhibited EV production (Supplementary Fig. S1). The reason for the difference in action observed between asteltoxin and other mitochondrial inhibitors is not known in detail at this time. However this result suggests that asteltoxin has a characteristic mode of action other than mitochondrial inhibition.

(B) HT29/CD63-Nluc cells were treated with different concentrations of asteltoxin for 24 h and luminescence in the culture medium was analyzed (blue). Simultaneously cell growth was analyzed using the WST-8 assay (orange). The relative percentages of luminescence were compared to the DMSO control (100%). (C) PC3 expressing CD63-Antares2 cells (PC3/CD63-Antares2) were treated with DMSO or asteltoxin at the indicated concentrations for 24 h and luminescence in the culture medium was analyzed.

To further investigate the mechanism of action of asteltoxin the effect of the compound on EV secretion was examined in the prostate cancer cell line PC3 because EVs are important for the construction of the cancer microenvironment which leads to metastasis in prostate cancer29. Asteltoxin decreased the luminescence level observed in the culture medium for PC3 cells expressing CD63-Antares2 (PC3/CD63-Antares2) (Fig. 1C)30. CD63-positive EVs from PC3 cells were 100–150 nm in size and their particle number was decreased by asteltoxin in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementally Fig. S2A and B). It was also verified to contain EV marker proteins such as Alix and syntenin which were suppressed by asteltoxin (Supplementally Fig. S2C). These findings suggest that the asteltoxin inhibits EV production. CD63-positive EVs inhibited by asteltoxin have the characteristics of so-called exosomes while it is difficult to experimentally determine the origin of secreted EVs. Therefore in this article following the recommendations of the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles31 we continue to use the generic term EV hereafter.

Asteltoxin does not induce mitochondrial damage at low concentrations

We examined the relevance between EV inhibition and mitochondria dysfunction. To evaluate the effect of asteltoxin on mitochondrial membrane proton pumps (MMP) PC3 cells were incubated with the fluorescent dye JC-1 which is sensitive to mitochondrial membrane potential. Even at an asteltoxin concentration that caused about 50% inhibition of EV secretion (10 μg/mL) we did not observe any significant difference in JC-1 fluorescence intensity relative to the DMSO control. By contrast cells treated with CCCP which was used as a positive control exhibited significant collapse of MMP (Fig. 2A). In healthy cells mitochondria exhibit fusion structures but in cells with mitochondrial damage they adopt fission structures32. Because mitochondrial structure dynamically changes to maintain their function we examined the mitochondrial structure in PC3 cells. The structure of mitochondria after treatment with asteltoxin was almost identical to the fusion structure observed in the DMSO control (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that low concentrations of asteltoxin inhibit EV secretion without appreciable damage to mitochondria. Given the effects of asteltoxin on cellular events we investigated its effects on cell phenotype. Although treatment of PC3 cells with CCCP resulted in an atrophied shape asteltoxin did not induce dramatic changes in cell morphology (Fig. 2C). In addition an in vitro proliferation assay showed that asteltoxin did not affect anchorage-dependent growth of these cells (Fig. 2D). Together these results suggest that asteltoxin inhibits the EV secretion of cancer cells without causing mitochondrial damage.

Figure 2 Asteltoxin does not induce mitochondria damage at low concentrations. (A) PC3 cells were treated with DMSO asteltoxin (0.1 1 or 10 μg/mL) or 10 μM CCCP for 24 h.

Asteltoxin decreases cellular ATP levels and activates lysosome function through AMPK-mediated mTORC1 inactivation

We examined the effect of asteltoxin on cellular ATP levels. As described previously3334 the level of cellular ATP decreases after the addition of asteltoxin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that asteltoxin treatment at the low concentrations (1 μg/mL) that are sufficient for EV inhibition results in a decrease in ATP levels to some extent but does not induce mitochondria damage which would lead to apoptosis. Interestingly oligomycin a mitochondrial inhibitor which binds to F0-ATPase26 also caused a similar decrease in ATP levels as asteltoxin and reduced EV production (Supplementally Fig. S3). Therefore we hypothesized that asteltoxin influences EV secretion indirectly through ATP-related signaling. ATP depletion coupled with an increase in the AMP/ATP ratio is known to activate AMPK-mediated signaling pathways35. Consistently we found that asteltoxin induces phosphorylation of AMPK at threonine 172 the major autophosphorylation site for AMPK (Fig. 3B). We next examined mTOR-related signaling because AMPK phosphorylates the tumor suppressor tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) thereby inhibiting mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) which is involved in cell growth36. In PC3 cells asteltoxin significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP1 critical downstream effectors of mTORC1 (Fig. 3B). AMPK activation and mTORC1 inactivation were observed at the same concentrations of asteltoxin that induced a decrease in ATP levels (more than 1 μg/mL). Taken together asteltoxin promoted AMPK-mediated mTORC1 suppression by inducing a decrease in ATP levels. Under these conditions we also observed the increases of ULK phosphorylation and LC3A/B (Fig. 3B) suggesting the induction of autophagy upon mTORC1 inhibition37. We then examined the cellular level of CD63 a marker for MVBs because autophagosome–MVB fusion decreases EV secretion38. The level of CD63 was downregulated in asteltoxin-treated PC3 cells although CD63 transcription remained unaltered (data not shown). Interestingly asteltoxin-induced downregulation of CD63 was appreciably restored by addition of the lysosome inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (Fig. 3C) suggesting that degradation through lysosomes determines MVB fate. Lysosome/autophagosome–MVB fusion decreases EV secretion2. Hence we evaluated the impact of asteltoxin on lysosome function through the inhibition of mTORC1. Lysosome acidity visualized by lysotracker staining increased considerably in PC3 cells upon the addition of asteltoxin (Fig. 3D). To further verify the significance of lysosome activation in the asteltoxin-mediated suppression of EVs we performed lysosome function rescue experiments using bafilomycin A1 (Fig. 3E). The decrease in luminescence observed in the culture medium in asteltoxin-treated PC3/CD63-Antares2 cells was significantly restored after the addition of bafilomycin A1 and the increase in luminescence observed in bafilomycin A1–treated cells was suppressed after the addition of asteltoxin. These findings suggest that asteltoxin-mediated lysosome activation is crucial for the regulation of EV secretion in cancer cells. Lysosome acidity was also observed after treatment with rapamycin a specific mTORC1 inhibitor (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. S4A). Because it was recently reported that rapamycin-mediated mTORC1 inhibition regulates EV secretion39 we confirmed the effects of rapamycin on EV secretion in PC3 cells. As was observed with asteltoxin rapamycin decreased the luminescence observed in the culture medium and the number of EVs in PC3/CD63-Antares2 cells at more than 20 nM (Supplementary Fig. S4B C). Rapamycin suppresses EVs in hepatocytes as was observed in PC3 cells in this study but increased numbers of EVs are observed in MEFs3940. The underlying mechanism behind this difference in EV secretion caused by rapamycin is not known but it might be due to differences in cell type. Our findings suggest that asteltoxin-mediated mTORC1 inhibition activates lysosome function and suppresses EV secretion in cancer cells.

Asteltoxin induces nuclear localization of TFE3 and lysosome activation

Because the microphthalmia family of basic helix-loop-helix-leucine-zipper transcription factors (MiT/TFE) including TFEB TFEC TFE3 and MITF regulate lysosomal gene expression4142 we evaluated the effects of asteltoxin on the function of MiT/TFE family members. MiT/TFE proteins are phosphorylated by mTOR or ERK2 which determines their subcellular localization; phosphorylated MiT/TFE proteins localize in the cytoplasm and bind to 14-3-3 but dephosphorylated MiT/TFE proteins localize to the nucleus and activate transcription of lysosomal genes4143. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that TFE3 was distributed in the cytoplasm and TFEB and MITF were in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of PC3 cells. After asteltoxin treatment most TFE3 translocated into the nucleus (Fig. 4A and B) whereas TFEB and MITF did not exhibit considerable changes in localization (Supplementary Fig. S5). Although similar MiT/TFE protein localization changes were observed after rapamycin treatment there were differences in the translocation ratio of TFE3 and MITF; rapamycin induced nuclear translocation of MiTF but did not affect TFE3 localization (Fig. 4A B and Supplementary Fig. S5). Moreover the transcription of lysosome-related genes was upregulated in PC3 cells treated with asteltoxin (Fig. 4C). Among the lysosome-related genes tested LAMP1 cathepsin D (CTSD) and V-type proton ATPase subunit d2 (ATP6V0D2) were significantly upregulated upon treatment with asteltoxin and rapamycin whereas cathepsin B (CTSB) was only upregulated after rapamycin treatment. The mechanisms underlying the differences observed in the translocation of MiT/TFE proteins after asteltoxin and rapamycin treatment are currently unknown. Our results demonstrate that asteltoxin induces nuclear translocation of MiT/TFE proteins and lysosome activation via upregulation of lysosomal gene transcription which is accompanied by suppression of mTORC1 activity.

Effect of asteltoxin on the balance between the number of lysosomes and MVBs

Finally we verified the role of asteltoxin in the formation of organelles in cancer cells using electron microscopy analysis. Electron microscopy analysis of PC3 cells revealed that the number of lysosomes significantly increased after asteltoxin treatment (Fig. 5A and B); by contrast the number of MVBs markedly decreased (Fig. 5C and D). Notably considerable levels of lysosome–MVB fusion were observed after treatment with asteltoxin (Fig. 5C right panels). A similar result was observed after rapamycin treatment (Supplementary Fig. S6) suggesting that this phenomenon is associated with mTORC1 inactivation. Overall these results demonstrate that asteltoxin promotes lysosome biogenesis and activity through AMPK-mTORC1 signaling caused by ATP depletion which results in MVB degradation and subsequent downregulation of EV secretion. A hypothetical model for asteltoxin function is presented in Fig. 5E. In cancer cells MVBs tend to fuse with the plasma membrane to release inclusions as EVs (Fig. 5E a). After treatment with low concentrations of asteltoxin the AMP/ATP ratio increases through inhibition of ATP synthase and AMPK-mediated stress signaling is upregulated without inducing mitochondria damage. Activated AMPK suppresses mTORC1 activation thereby allowing MiT/TFE family members to translocate into the nucleus and activate transcription of lysosome-related genes including V-ATPases. Upregulation of lysosomal genes induces lysosome formation and promotes MVB degradation. Therefore EV secretion is suppressed due to depletion of the level of MVBs (Fig. 5E b).

(E) Schematic model of the role that asteltoxin plays in regulating the fate of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and controlling EV secretion. (a) In cancer cells MVBs fuse with the plasma membrane and promote EV secretion. (b) After treatment with asteltoxin at low concentrations the AMP/ATP ratio increases due to inhibition of ATP synthase and this increase induces AMPK-mediated suppression of mTORC1. Inactivation of mTORC1 promotes nuclear translocation of MiT/TFE family members thereby inducing transcription of lysosome-related genes and activation of lysosomal function. MVBs are then degraded and the number of MVBs fused with the plasma membrane is low resulting in suppression of EV secretion. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01. Full size image

Based on the mechanisms underlying EV inhibition by asteltoxin stress-induced activation of AMPK was found to be the trigger for suppression of EV secretion. However it is difficult to control the activation of AMPK by decreasing cellular ATP levels to a modest enough extent whereby mitochondrial damage does not occur. Hence we attempted to inhibit EV secretion by activating AMPK in other ways. AMPK is activated by several stress signals including amino acid and glucose starvation36. PC3 cells were cultured with low glucose medium. Under these conditions AMPK was activated and the level of luminescent EVs observed was greatly suppressed (Supplementary Fig. S7A and B) even though the amount of glucose is a quarter of the normal amount given (1000 mg/L). Taking advantage of the fact that cancer cells produce ATP from glucose rather than relying on production from mitochondria we wondered if we could inhibit EV formation specifically in cancer cells by adding 2-deoxy glucose (2-DG) a glucose analog. Addition of 2-DG induced AMPK activation in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S7C). Suppression of the level of luminescent EVs was also observed (Supplementary Fig. S7D). By contrast under the same conditions AMPK activation and EV secretion did not change in normal human keratinocyte HaCaT cells (Supplementary Fig. S7D). Although low glucose or 2-DG treatment suppresses EV secretion444546 our findings provide firm evidence that stress-induced activation of AMPK by depleting glucose effectively suppresses cancer-derived EV secretion.

In conclusion we showed that asteltoxin is a unique EV inhibitor with a potentially novel mode of action that is not categorized for currently reported EV inhibitors.

FRAMINGHAM – The TJX Companies Inc. an off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the U.S. and worldwide announced plans to expand and accelerate environmental goals as part of the Company’s ongoing environmental sustainability strategy.

As part of its global efforts TJX is aiming to:

Achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in its operations by 2040

Source 100% renewable energy in its operations by 2030

Divert 85% of its operational waste from landfill by 2027

Shift 100% of the packaging for products developed in-house by its product design team to be reusable recyclable or contain sustainable materials by 2030



[broadstreet zone=”59948″]

“For 45 years TJX’s mission of delivering great value to our customers every day has gone hand-in-hand with our commitment to act as a responsible corporate citizen invest in our Associates and our communities and operate our business ethically” said Ernie Herrman Chief Executive Officer and President of The TJX Companies Inc. “I am so pleased with all we have accomplished over the years and we are by no means done. These new environmental sustainability goals are important to us in terms of our work to mitigate our impact on the environment. We look forward to continuing to enhance our programs and reporting as we move forward.”

These commitments expand upon the work the Company has been engaged in and build on its environmental priorities of reducing its emissions and energy usage managing waste and sourcing responsibly. In June 2020 after exceeding its previous GHG emissions reduction goal TJX set a science-based target in alignment with the United Nations’ Paris Agreement guidelines: a 55% absolute reduction in GHG emissions from direct operations by Fiscal Year 2030 against a Fiscal Year 2017 baseline.

The Company plans to continue to report against this target on its path toward its net zero emissions goal in its operations. TJX has responded to the CDP Climate Change Questionnaire for 12 consecutive years most recently earning an A- for its 2021 disclosure.

Environmental Sustainability is one of four key pillars of TJX’s Corporate Responsibility efforts which also includes Workplace Communities and Responsible Business.

Now after enduring two years of COVID-related restrictions and limitations eastern Nova Scotia’s largest shopping complex is welcoming a number of new tenant stores including the increasingly-popular HomeSense a Canadian discount home furnishing operated by the same corporation that owns Winners.

HomeSense along with Winners and Marshalls is owned by Massachusetts-based TJX Companies. The chain has more than 140 locations in Canada including six in the Maritime provinces. There are presently HomeSense outlets in Halifax Dartmouth New Minas Fredericton Moncton and Charlottetown. A new store is also slated for Bedford.

The Charlottetown-based Guardian newspaper a sister paper of the Cape Breton Post and member of the SaltWire Network reported on the 2015 opening of HomeSense’s Charlottetown store. The story stated that the line to get into the new store stretched around the building before the doors had even been opened.

Sydney shopper is excited about some of the new Mayflower Mall additions. “When me and the girls go on a shopping trip one of the first places we hit is a HomeSense.” David Jala/Cape Breton Post - David Jala

Positive response

The spring 2023 coming of HomeSense is welcome news to retired Sydney resident and shopping enthusiast Louise MacDonald who claims it is one of her favourite stores.

“When me and the girls go on a trip I call them shopping trips one of the first places is we hit is always HomeSense whether we’re in Halifax or Charlottetown” said MacDonald who is also a frequent visitor to the Winners’ Mayflower Mall location.

“I’m very happy they’re opening a HomeSense here. I’ll shop there. But that doesn’t mean we won’t go on any out-of-town shopping trips.”

Howie Centre resident Sheri Steele who was found leaving the local Winners store on Sunday said she hadn’t heard about the plans for a new HomeSense.

“I didn’t know but it’s great to hear” she said.

“I’ve shopped there in Halifax and I like it. Now all we need in Cape Breton is a Costco.”

Given the social-media attention surrounding the news of the HomeSense’s intent to open a new retail outlet in Sydney it appears the opening will be somewhat of a coup of the Mayflower Mall which casually announced it on Facebook last week.

The post garnered more than 1400 likes 470 comments and some 600 shares.

The comments which were mostly brief utterances of approval included “Great” “YES!” “Can’t Wait” “Woohoo” “Exciting” “Awesome” and “Hooray."" There were also a few posts from those not in the know about HomeSense including “What’s a HomeSense? I’ve never heard of one.""

Despite the recent announcements of a number of new stores to be opened at the Mayflower Mall Cape Breton’s largest shopping centre still has a couple of vacant locations. DAVID JALA/CAPE BRETON POST - David Jala

More mall happenings

Mayflower Mall general manager Greg Morrison said HomeSense will be a welcome addition to the Grand Lake Road shopping centre that opened in August 1980 with Hudson’s Bay Dominion and Woolco serving as the original anchor stores. Today its anchor stores include the Bay Best Buy Winners Sport Chek Staples Depot Michaels and Mark’s (formerly known as Mark's Work Wearhouse). The mall is administered by Canada-wide McCOR Management.

“The McCOR leasing department has been working on attracting new tenants including HomeSense which we are thrilled about” said Morrison.

“We also have Bluenotes/Aeropostle opening in May the new (Ricki's) store will open in June and a new Urban Kids will open this summer.”

Other mall moves include the relocation of Emerald Isle’s E2 stores from the Winners end of the complex to the Bay side of the shopping centre and the opening of a new Ricki’s store which has been sharing a store with Cleo across the walkway from Sport Chek.

The last big addition to the Mayflower Mall was in March 2021 when Old Navy opened a location near the food court.

There are still a couple of vacancies. The empty spaces are available for lease.

Meanwhile McCOR Management has yet to confirm where the new HomeSense store will be located but persistent rumours have surfaced that it may take over the current Best Buy location at the west end of the mall with the electronics giant moving to another site within the complex.

There are a number of new stores and new locations for some existing stores at Sydney’s Mayflower Mall. DAVID JALA/CAPE BRETON POST - David Jala

Rebound

When it opened more than four decades ago many saw the Mayflower Mall as the beginning of the end for downtown retail in the communities that now comprise the Cape Breton Regional Municipality. Downtown Sydney is not only surviving but it’s also going through a rejuvenation of sorts with the construction of Nova Scotia Community College’s new waterfront campus well underway. There is also $9 million earmarked for downtown redevelopment and upgrades.

Ironically online shopping and home delivery have been a challenge for the brick and mortar retail shops both downtown and at the mall.

However mall general manager Morrison believes people are more than ready to return to in-person shopping.

“All these developments are extremely positive” said Morrison.

“It’s been a rough go with COVID but our customers have continued to support the mall and we feel we’re in a really good place now a place that we’ve anticipated over the past few years. There is an energy in the local marketplace that we haven’t seen in a long time in our community. It’s exciting.”

The Mayflower Mall is located on Grand Lake Road just east of Sydney on the way to Glace Bay.",,,,,,

As of now anyone can go into a farm supply store and purchase a farm use plate to display on their vehicle whether it is being used for farm purposes or not.

SEE ALSO:



But beginning on July 1 2023 farm vehicles will be required to display a DMV-issued permanent plate.

Andrew Smith with the Virginia Farm Bureau Federations says this was necessary because they were seeing more and more people abusing the system by driving with these tags on personal-use vehicles.

He says people may want these tags if they have lost their driver’s license they do not have proper registration or they do not have the necessary identification to drive a vehicle.

“My fear is that one day somebody would get into a hit-and-run or something like that and the people around or law enforcement can't identify the vehicle"" said Smith.

SEE ALSO:

Smith says they have even been seeing personal vehicles with these tags in populous places like Downtown Richmond.

The new required plate will cost $15 and there will be an application to fill out before receiving the plates to make sure your vehicle meets the criteria for farm-use.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5jZS1ibG9nLmNvbS9nZXJtYW55LXRvLXN1cHBseS10aGUtdWtyYWluaWFuLWFybXktd2l0aC1oZWF2eS10YW5rLXRyYW5zcG9ydGVyLXZlaGljbGVzL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5jZS1ibG9nLmNvbS9nZXJtYW55LXRvLXN1cHBseS10aGUtdWtyYWluaWFuLWFybXktd2l0aC1oZWF2eS10YW5rLXRyYW5zcG9ydGVyLXZlaGljbGVzLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Germany to supply the Ukrainian Army with heavy tank transporter vehicles,"Berlin is planning to supply upgraded 4×4 vehicles armored trucks tactical buses and nearly 100 HX81 heavy tractor-trailer systems to Ukraine as the Russian offensive in the eastern Donbas region escalates.

Citing a report from Bild Militarnyi reported that Germany agreed to ramp up the supply of weapons and military vehicles to Kyiv including HX 81 tractors.

The vehicle is based on an 8×8 MAN HX-series chassis. Germany’s new tractor-trailer systems will be used for transporting tracked and wheeled vehicles containers and heavy equipment.

Two cable winches with a pulling force up to 20 tonnes each enable loading and unloading of defective equipment. A self-recovery winch with a traction force of eight tonnes is mounted to the front of the vehicle. Designed for maximum mobility the tractor-trailer system will also be able to operate for long distances in areas with poor infrastructure.

The HX81 heavy tank transporter vehicle was jointly developed by MAN and Rheinmetall.

But there is a store that opened Tuesday in west Santa Rosa that is perfectly made for these economic times combining the thrill of a treasure hunt with the practicality of bargain-basement prices.

It’s evident in the shop’s name: Falling Prices.

The store receives liquidated items from such retail giants as Amazon Target Home Depot Lowe’s and Wayfair on a weekly basis that are less than $50. They range from pet food and children’s clothes to duvets and some food items such as flavored almonds.

The twist is its pricing operates on a sliding scale based on the day of the week. All items on Tuesday are priced at $6 then on Wednesday at $4 Thursday at $2 and Friday at $1. Everything left on Saturday is just a quarter so the inventory can be all cleared for next week.

Another new batch of products are then refilled into the plywood bins which are spaced out through the store like a checkerboard. The process begins again the following Tuesday morning with about 8000 various items for sale and eager customers ready to rummage through the product mix.

“I love this because it’s real” said Richard Cawood a Bennett Valley resident who operates the store on College Avenue with his wife Ruth.

Cawood is an independent dealer within the RL Liquidators network out of Sacramento that helps facilitates the weekly truck deliveries into the location.

“Yes it makes money. But the people that will shop here really need us … the small food section toys or books or household items. They're buying stuff that has just come off the shelf at Target that they can pay for a fraction of the cost.”

Those shoppers on Wednesday included Al Siedentopf a retired veteran from Santa Rosa.

While other shoppers were more eager on grabbing items Siedentopf was carefully perusing one bin being very selective on what he would put in his cart. He had selected two reams of printer paper from Amazon costing $8.

“That’s a pretty good price to pay” Siedentopf said.

He also had eyed the 10-pound bag of organic chicken feed but found it too expensive for $4 on Wednesday as he typically buys his chicken feed at Tractor Supply Co. Siedentopf said he may visit later in the week when the price for the bag comes down even further.

But Cawood noted the bags could all be gone if he waits too long given that word-of-mouth spreads in the local community which has a sizable number of chicken owners. A check on Cawood’s smartphone revealed a comparable item sells at a price near $20 a bag at Walmart.

“Come back on $1 day and make sure you get your dollar chicken food” Cawood informed Siedentopf.

“I like 25 cents better” Siedentopf chuckled.

That exchange epitomized the give-and-take that goes into a decision that the more than 50 customers on Wednesday morning were making. They ranged from moms to millennials and they all were looking for special deals.

The store activity also reflects the crucial role that liquidation plays in the U.S. retail market allowing major companies to quickly get rid of their merchandise that is seasonal being discontinued or doesn’t sell well.

The liquidation market in this country has more than doubled since 2008 and reached $688 billion in 2021 according to Zachary Rogers assistant professor of supply chain management at Colorado State University.

The business is seeing an upswing with inflation said Larry Morgan chief executive officer of RL Liquidators who has 10 Falling Prices locations in the Sacramento area and is expanding his reach.

His company also has another operation BidRL where consumers can bid on more premium items that are typically offered at retail for $50 and above such as mattresses laptop computers and coffee makers. Overall RL Liquidators receives more than 1000 semitrailer loads a month Morgan said.

Cawood also operates a Santa Rosa location for BidRL where customers have to come and pick up their purchases if they are successful. That pickup location will be moved to the Falling Prices store in the near future.

“As inflation rises people have to find ways that they can save on items they buy every day” said Morgan. “It’s like Black Friday every single day.”

Cawood said there were 60 people outside the store before the doors opened at 10 a.m. on its first day of business as shoppers looked to get the first pick of any bargains at $6 per item. Bags of dog food sold out quickly and one man found a framed autographed picture of a San Francisco 49ers player he said.

Anticipating its popularity Cawood already is giving thought on ways to manage crowds especially on Tuesday mornings. Shoppers can download the Falling Prices app on their smartphone to reserve a space in line up to 24 hours in advance to help limit customer flow and ensure it is orderly.

“We only have a limited number of shopping carts so by getting a line pass you can have coffee in your car and stand up at 10 o’clock when I say who is number one?” Cawood said.

During the latter part of the week the store will attract shoppers looking for items that they can later resell via their own garage sales Cawood said keeping the business cycle going.

Cawood previously worked as an executive for Charles Schwab & Co. and got interested in the reselling market as a result of his son Ben who had been running a small business selling on Amazon and eBay.

When Ben left for college in Boston Cawood became more interested in “reverse logistics” which is taking back items from retailers in large volume and selling them back to the public. He and his wife connected with Morgan in 2018.

“We were intrigued. By operating a store where you reduce the price of every item based on the day of the week you can empty a store during the week so you can restock and go again” he said.

Opening a retail store was a big step but Cawood said he relied on advice from Teejay Lowe whose family operated G & G Supermarket before selling to Safeway in 2016. Lowe who is now managing the commercial shopping center where the Falling Prices store is located.

“It’s an exciting retail model quite honestly” Lowe said of the store. “If you provide people a value they will shop with you.”

Having a disability in 2022 shouldn’t hold you back. But the reality is access difficulties cost and a lack of choice mean the able-bodied are still travelling far more than disabled holidaymakers.

The National Travel Survey carried out just before the pandemic found disabled adults in England made on average 26 per cent fewer trips and travelled 41 per cent fewer miles than the non-disabled.

Thankfully some innovative tour operators airlines hotels and self-catering companies are trying to redress the balance. Here’s a few places to look.

Best for… the blind and sighted

TRAVELEYES

By the age of 18 Amar Latif had lost 95 per cent of his sight. He went to Canada anyway for his last year of university then went jungle trekking in Nicaragua for a BBC documentary about travellers with disabilities. Now Amar runs his own tour company where uniquely each group trip has a mix of blind and visually impaired holidaymakers plus sighted travellers.

Each day a sight-impaired person is paired up with a sighted group member who will describe the sights in destinations such as the U.S. Deep South Armenia Menorca and Northern Ireland. Sighted travellers get up to 50 per cent off.

BEST FOR… variety of assistance

LIMITLESS TRAVEL

Limitless Travel organises holidays with many types of assistance to destinations including the Cotswolds. Pictured is the village of Castle Combe in the area

Founded by Angus Drummond a former investment banker who was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy at the age of 22 Limitless Travel offers many types of assistance for holidaymakers. These range from help carrying luggage to a full one-to-one carer package to cover everything from getting dressed to a swimming partner.

Destinations include Rome Crete the Netherlands and Jersey as well as cruises and UK stays: a five-day Cotswolds break is priced from £949.

BEST FOR… safaris

2 BY 2 HOLIDAYS

Even able-bodied people can sometimes find a safari holiday challenging but 2 By 2 is one of the few UK operators which offers trips to see the Big Five — leopard lion buffalo elephant and rhinoceros.

The company has been organising wheelchair-accessible safaris to Africa for more than 20 years. It offers tailor-made trips to Kenyan Namibian and South African game reserves. Vehicles fitted with ramps for power chairs are used on journeys into the bush.

A typical seven-night stay in Kruger National Park South Africa costs from £1395pp for seven nights excluding international flights.

BEST FOR… self-catering

INDEPENDENT COTTAGES

Independent Cottages has a far wider range of accessible properties than most UK self-catering providers. More than 250 have at least partial wheelchair access.

The company’s website also has a wonderfully opinionated guide as to which parts of Britain are best for accessible breaks.

Surprisingly given the age of many of its buildings Oxford scores highly with above-average wheelchair access as do the beaches of Dorset and West Wales.

Prices for accessible cottages are reasonable too. At the moment Driftwood Cottage in Combe Martin North Devon which sleeps four costs from £249 for seven nights.

BEST FOR… once-in-a-lifetime trips

RESPONSIBLE TRAVEL

Responsible Travel offers a 10-day trip to Kerla above for travellers with access needs

Kudos to Responsible Travel for noticing that the vast majority of accessible hotels and resorts are of the mega-chain variety.

This bespoke tour operator has gone in the other direction and specialises in smaller characterful accommodation in places that are often difficult to go to for those with disabilities.

Its ten-day Kerala trip which you can take either solo with a partner or in a small group is one of the most popular opening up the mountains houseboats forts and beaches of this part of India to travellers with access needs.

It’s not cheap though. Prices start at £2092pp excluding flights. But as Responsible Travel puts it (rather brilliantly) ‘an accessible holiday is still a holiday. It just has special trimmings.’

BEST FOR… package vacations

TUI HOLIDAYS

Most of the big airlines offering package holidays don’t provide much inspiration or help beyond the bare minimum when it comes to accessible travel.

TUI is the exception; it has more than 150 accessible hotels to choose from — with a strong focus on the Caribbean.

The company has a specialist customer phone line for people who want to have a more in-depth chat about their access needs before making a booking. It also has four types of specially adapted vehicle for transfers from the arrival airport to the hotel.

Customers are now entitled to a refund of all money including fees

Have you seen a recent cruise itinerary being canceled? It has been a trend since the pandemic and many passengers have doubts and fears when it comes to planning a cruise vacation but now they will be able to book with confidence.

The US Federal Maritime Commission (FMC)—the agency in charge of regulating sea travel— has recently announced new rules and customers will now have the right to get a refund if a cruise operator cancels or delays an itinerary.

The Passenger Vessel Act has been updated to protect travelers regardless of the cruise company. Louis Sola FMC Commissioner told NBC 5 that this new update in the Passenger Vessel Act represents a historic event: “It's the first time that the law has been changed since 1881 since the California gold rush.” Sola also added: “People can be confident moving forward.”

According to the information shared by the commissioner the FMC got hundreds of complaints from passengers who didn’t get refunds or amends from cruise operations. One of the scandalous cases that activated a large number of complaints this year was Crystal Cruises’ unexpected shutdown.

Fortunately travelers can start booking and planning future cruise trips since the new rules already started to apply on April 18 2022 and from now on all cruise lines must comply.

The New Cruise Refund Rules

The new amendment to the regulation has brought pride to authorities. The FMC has shared commissioner Sola’s words on their official website:

“Hundreds of thousands of Americans enjoy taking a pleasure cruise every year. For some these are trips of a lifetime where people have worked hard to save the cost of a ticket. Amending the Commission’s regulations to provide passengers more rights and options when a cruise line has not performed is good for consumers. I am grateful for the trust my fellow Commissioners placed in me to lead Fact-Finding 30 and for their support in expanding consumer protections.”

In order to protect customers these are the main considerations of the new FMC rules include:

The Implementation of a process for obtaining refunds.

Defining “non-performance” as a cruise canceling or delaying a voyage by three or more calendar days.

From now on cruise lines are required to publish clear instructions —shown on their websites—for obtaining refunds.

In a “non-performance” situation of a cruise operator passengers are entitled to a refund of all money including fees.

Commissioner Sola also explained that these new rules will help to organize policies since every cruise line has different approaches and it makes it harder to process complaints: “As far as consumer protection goes what we found is that almost every single cruise line had a different refund policy.” Sola feels hopeful for travelers: “You're going to get treated the same across the board you're going to have the rights to get a refund.”

Travelers interested in learning more about the new rules can visit FMC’s website and read the documentation. In the updated Passenger Vessel Financial Responsibility they will find more details about the process for obtaining refunds and the responsibility requirements.

The New Cruise Travel Experience

The new rules will allow passengers to book with confidence and embark on new opportunities. The cruise industry also has been making changes and optimizing services to provide travelers unique experiences across seas oceans and fascinating destinations.

Now that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has changed travel advisories for cruises and removed travel warnings more adventurers can take advantage of this travel experience. From food onboard like the self-service buffet of the Royal Caribbean to sail aboard the world’s largest cruise.



Cruise companies like Oceania Cruises have been including eco-friendly tours for their destinations and even solo-travel opportunities for those who want different travel experiences onboard.

Cruisers should ensure they have travel health insurance that not only covers medical care while onboard a cruise ship but also covers them before their trip if they happen to get covid and can no longer travel.

All vaccinated travellers arriving in Singapore via air or sea checkpoints will no longer need to take a pre-departure COVID-19 test as restrictions for controlling the spread of the coronavirus are eased.The Ministry of Health (MOH) also announced that from July 1 all long-term pass holders aged 13 and above travelling to Singapore will have to be fully vaccinated before entering the country unless they are medically ineligible for vaccines.This is a change from the present rule which states that long-term pass holders aged between 13 and 17 can travel into Singapore even if they are not fully vaccinated.The ministry said in a statement on Friday that it is now requiring vaccinations for this group ""given the increased availability of vaccines globally for those aged between 13 and 17"".(Join our ETNRI WhatsApp channel for all the latest updates)With the latest easing of restrictions on people's movement in COVID-19 environment fully vaccinated and well travellers will no longer need to be tested for COVID-19 to enter Singapore it said.All vaccinated travellers and non-fully vaccinated children aged 12 and below arriving in Singapore via air or sea checkpoints will no longer need to take a pre-departure COVID-19 test effective midnight Tuesday.The entry requirements for travellers who are aged 13 and above and not fully vaccinated remain unchanged reported TODAY newspaper quoting the MOH statement.This means that travellers still have to take a pre-departure test within two days before leaving for Singapore undergo a seven-day stay-home order and take a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test at the end of the isolation period.Such tests are also required for vaccinated travellers for now until the new rules take effect.For people travelling through the land checkpoints of Malaysia and Singapore pre-departure or on-arrival Covid tests are also not needed if the traveller is fully vaccinated.From May 1 fully vaccinated non-Malaysian work permit holders who have an in-principle approval document for them to work in the construction marine shipyard and process sectors no longer need to apply for entry approvals to enter Singapore MOH said.Instead they will need to book a slot at the onboard centre of the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) to undergo residential onboarding upon arrival.The centre is a one-stop venue for them to verify their vaccination get enhanced medical examination and learn to settle into the country among other needs.These workers are also required to undergo a two-day Pre-Departure Preparatory Programme if it is available in their home countries -- namely Bangladesh India and Myanmar -- before they can enter Singapore from May 1 according to the Today report.Within Singapore there will no longer be limits to group sizes or workplace capacities here from next Tuesday (April 26).For the first time in more than two years the city state's disease outbreak response system condition (Dorscon) level will also be stepped down from orange to yellow in what Health Minister Ong Ye Kung called a major milestone in Singapore's pandemic journey.Dorscon gives an indication of the disease outbreak situation and measures needed to control infections.In a series of sweeping changes and the strongest push yet for a return to normal MOH said that from next Tuesday individuals will no longer be required to keep to a group of 10 people for mask-off activities while the use of SafeEntry and TraceTogether (apps for verifying vaccination status) will cease at most venues.At the same time the multi-ministry task force on COVID-19 urged Singaporeans to stay vigilant and maintain readiness in the face of potential risks and stressed that the pandemic is not over.Ong who is co-chair of the task force said one such risk is of a new wave of infections emerging in the coming months as protection from vaccines and past infections wanes. Another worrying risk is of the emergence of a new variant of concern.""This continues to be a potential curveball that may knock us back to square one and we must be alert to that"" he said at a press conference on Friday.All workers may now also return to the workplace from next Tuesday up from the current limit of 75 per cent of those who can work from home.The ministry said that with the current changes almost all of Singapore's safe management measures with the exception of the wearing of masks indoors will be eased.Noting that Singapore has gone through many rounds of restrictions Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said on Friday that the changes are a ""very significant step forward"" in Singapore's journey to live with Covid.""Two years isn't that long but it somehow feels like a lifetime ago because so much has happened and we have been through so much together"" said Wong who co-chairs the task force virtually from the United States where he is on a work trip.""And working together we have been able to keep everyone in Singapore safe to protect lives and livelihoods and to achieve one of the lowest Covid-19 fatality rates in the world.""""With these changes we can now have a well-deserved breather after two very difficult years of fighting the virus. But let's always remember we are getting closer to the finish line but the race is not over"" he said.""The pandemic is certainly not over. A new variant will emerge sooner or later... No one can predict what this next variant will be. And if need be we may very well have to tighten our restrictions"" said Wong."

Grammy award winning duo For King & Country took the stage for their “What Are We Waiting For” tour at the newly renamed Truist Arena on NKU’s campus. The brothers performed on April 23 for fans in the surrounding area and some that traveled to be there.

Joel and Luke Smallbone have been performing with a band under the name “For King & Country” since 2007 and their stage presence has only gotten bigger. The brothers are originally from Australia but moved to Nashville Tennessee when they were young.

However through the help of many different people in their community along with fans they were able to get where they are now and it shows in their music.

NKU students were particularly thrilled to see such an influential band perform on campus this Saturday.

Saturday was the first “For King & Country” show NKU SGA member Christopher Prince attended.

“I’ve listened to their music for like two years. My favorite song is God Only Knows but I like the version with Dolly Parton more than the original.”

Going into the show the audience got a lot of energy from seeing Dante Bowe open for the band and perform some of his most famous songs such as “Voice of God.” Bowe had a fantastic stage presence that kept the audience on their feet and showed his love for the Lord. Though the audience were sad to see him end his set they were ecstatic that “For King & Country” were coming on next.

After a brief intermission the band came on stage and brought a renewed energy for the audience along with them.

Beginning with the song “Broken Halos” the band came out with strobe lights flashing to the beat of the drums and the cheers of their dedicated fans.

As more songs were played such as “Love Me Like I Am” “The Proof of Your Love” and “Busted Heart (Hold On to Me)” the atmosphere of the arena became more comfortable and welcoming.

The band stopped multiple times throughout the show to talk to the fans and get to know them one on one. During one of these moments Luke spoke of how difficult coming to America was for his family due to how low they were on money and how their family barely had a place to call their own.

After telling their story he began talking about the organization called Compassion that the audience could get involved in by sponsoring a less fortunate child in another country. This moved many fans to sponsor children from many different places all over the world and to make a real difference in their lives.

As the show went on the fans grew more comfortable to dance sing and even cry during the sad songs.

The audience knew that the adrenaline from being there couldn’t last forever as the band closed with the song “Little Drummer Boy.” Outsiders would see this as strange but For King & Country fans know that is a classic song for the band to leave the biggest impression with.

Waving goodbye to the brothers the fans hoped that this wouldn’t be the last time Truist Arena sees For King & Country.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1sYi5jb20vYnJhdmVzL3ZpZGVvL296emllLWFsYmllcy1ob21lcnMtNi1vbi1hLWZseS1iYWxsLXRvLXJpZ2h0LWZpZWxkLWRla2FwdtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ozzie Albies' home run | 04/23/2022 | Atlanta Braves,"add-reel-320837 Reels share-square-2-320838 Share

Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports

Jorge Soler made a return to where he had achieved his career’s greatest success. With the former World Series MVP now turning out for the Miami Marlins his return to Truist Park first came with a ring presentation ceremony for their pennant-winning effort in the 2021 World Series.

The Atlanta Braves won the World Series after almost a quarter-century in 2021 and they have Jorge Soler’s efforts to thank for it. And they made their gratitude known when the Miami Marlins came to visit.

The ring presentation happened before the game began as the World Series MVP came to Truist Park sporting Miami Marlins’ threads. Despite winning the ultimate achievement in baseball at the end of 2021 Soler saw his exit from the side in the 2022 off-season as a free signing.

Signing on with the Miami Marlins on a three-year $36 million deal to start the 2022 season in Florida the applause ran for him even in Braves Country.

Jorge Soler receives World Series 2021 Ring

The Braves manager Brian Snitker presented Soler with the ring before the beginning of their game to raucous applause from the crowd. Clearly the hitter is still a fan favorite in Braves Country. Acquired on Deadline Day in 2021 Soler almost doubled his home-run tally to that point. And he kept his best for the most crucial moments winning the Braves the pennant in November.

The Braves were glad to acknowledge Soler’s contribution to the effort. They even had the deadline day date engraved onto the ring to mark the shifting of fortunes for the Braves with the clutch hitter making his way to the roster for the team.

Soler seemed glad to receive the accolade wearing it straight out of the box and flashing it for the cameras as well. The Braves were a surprise package. Most fans expected the LA Dodgers to make it out of the NLCS. However the Braves not only surprised the National League but went on a stellar run to capture even the World Series in 2021 with a Game 6 victory at Minute Maid Park.

The ring is a special feature for the Braves of 2021. Featuring a variety of gemstones and adorned with a whole host of hidden features the ring is surely one of the most memorable pieces to come from the Braves’ jewelry box. And Soler for one looks glad to have it.

He's selling his 6000-square-foot house in Fayetteville and moving with his wife Nancy into a condo about half that size.

An online auction of more than 500 items from his house began last Sunday and will end today.

It includes African art a life-size reconstituted terracotta soldier and two campaign jackets from Bill Clinton's 1992 run for president.

While going through some boxes Blair came across a picture of his late wife Diane doing a New York Times crossword puzzle with Clinton.

Diane Blair was in hospice at their house in Fayetteville at the time. She died of lung cancer in 2000.

Jim Blair said he'll give the picture along with some other newly found things to Special Collections at the University of Arkansas Fayetteville where the Diane Blair Papers are stored. She was a prominent political science professor at the university.

""All of the stuff people want to see I shredded"" said Jim Blair. ""Can't write a book until a lot of people die and I'm afraid I'll die first so the book will probably never be done. A lot of people breathed a sigh of relief on that I guess.""

Blair 86 is a well-known figure in Arkansas legal business and political circles. He's probably best known as the former general counsel for Tyson Foods Inc. and as a close friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton.

Blair has lived in the house on Tanglebriar Lane in Fayetteville for 46 years.

Raised by his grandparents in Fayetteville Blair learned to read ""by accident"" when he was 3 years old. By the age of 19 he had graduated from the university and by 21 he had finished law school.

When he was 13 he said a voice moved through him as adults quarrelled during a meeting at First Baptist Church.

""I'm sitting there on a Wednesday night listening to all this and God tells me to go up and take the microphone and tell these people to knock it off"" said Blair. ""Do I think God talks to 13-year-old boys? I do not. I think it must have been some kind of auto-hypnosis. But I go up I take the microphone I chew out the congregation of the First Baptist Church in Fayetteville.""

Blair said the incident marked him as being maybe more religious than he actually was.

By the time he was 18 Blair was an ordained Baptist minister.

A few years later things changed.

""When it came to the segregation issue the church in 1957 would not stand up on what was clear to me -- if you believe in the Bible and you believe in Christianity you could not be a segregationist"" said Blair referring to the Little Rock Central High crisis.

""At that point I just had to leave the church"" he said.

While going to college in Fayetteville Blair made milkshakes and malts at Jug Wheeler's Drive-In on Dickson Street and was a janitor at the Baptist Student Union he said during a 2008 interview with the David and Barbara Pryor Center in Fayetteville.

While he was a young lawyer at a Springdale firm one of Blair's major clients was Tyson Foods.

By 1980 he had become the company's in-house attorney.

Blair said he was often involved in politics but not as a candidate.

""I never wanted to hold office"" he told the Pryor Center. ""Well I say I never wanted to hold office. I mean I fantasized when I was young that the greatest job in the world would be to be a United States senator. Now as I got older I managed to be associated with so many United States senators I decided it wasn't a good job after all.""

Blair married Margaret Gibson in 1957 according to the Pryor Center interview. They divorced in 1974 and he married Diane Divers Kincaid in 1979. After Diane died in 2000 Blair married Nancy Beth Horton a native of Marshall in 2005.

Blair's grandfather and great-grandfather were born in Marshall.

Blair has been a donor to many causes. In 2002 he announced a $3 million donation to the Fayetteville Public Library which named its new building Blair Library in honor of his late wife his grandmother and his aunt according to the library's website.

""What little money I've had most of it I've made out of the stock market or the commodity market"" Blair told the Pryor Center in 2008. ""And I got sittin' down thinkin' the other day that I've made a little over $5 million out of the commodity market and I've given all of that money away. And I've given a substantial part of what I've made in the stock market away.""

While there are plenty of things in the auction Blair said he has already given a lot of stuff away. Much of his art went to the Museum of Native American History in Bentonville.

Rusty Brockman of Rarity Ventures in Fayetteville bought the belongings of Blair's house on Tanglebriar. Brockman said it's not the biggest estate he has bought but it's a unique one.

""Basically we're just trying to get his cleaned up"" so he can sell it said Brockman.

The auction is online at https://bit.ly/3k4nqUv.

Blair said work on the condo was finished almost three years ago. He and Nancy began spending two nights a week there then three nights a week.

Three weeks ago when he decided to get rid of the house the Blairs started staying in the condo when they were in Fayetteville. They also have a part-time home in North Miami Beach Fla.

Blair said he recently realized that he had accidentally been to 47 states. So he's going to make a point to visit the others. He and Nancy recently returned from a trip to West Virginia. Now he just needs to visit North Dakota and New Hampshire.

""I've been in 107 countries and I've been in 48 states and I hear all these people on the internet giving all these world opinions about world affairs and national affairs who've never been anywhere"" he said. ""You don't really understand the world if you haven't traveled the world. You don't understand the United States if you haven't traveled the United States.""

Blair said he won't really miss the things that are being sold in the auction. What pained him most was having to rehome Boston Blackie the 110-pound labradoodle he's had for nine years. But the new owner has brought Boston Blackie by a couple of times to visit the Blairs.

Nancy Blair said she and her husband have discussed end-of-life wishes.

""He told me what he wanted on his headstone"" she said. ""I said: 'That's real good. That speaks volumes about you.' I said 'You need to write it down for me.'

""He said: 'I don't need to. I'll remember it.'""

""What I said I wanted on there"" said Jim Blair ""is 'I am content in my belief that I've done more good than harm.'""

“We know that there are some unavoidable stressors on the farm” Stephanie Cottee animal welfare manager Probiotech International said

These can include transitions in housing and feed aggression or social stress within the flock handling and heat stress.

Adding citrus essential oils to feed or water could help mitigate a bird’s response to these stressors preliminary research claims. It could help poultry better adapt to changes in its environment decrease abnormal behaviors like cannibalism and support feed intake during chronic stress periods due to weather or changes in bird density.

How it works

Citrus essential oils have anxiolytic or anxiety-reducing properties. This is achieved by helping to maintain the levels of tryptophan a precursor to serotonin in the brain.

Increased serotonin levels directly correlate to thermoregulation and the regulation of stress anxiety and feeding behaviors in poultry and other animals increasing feelings of calmness stabilizing mood and reducing fearfulness and anxiety behaviors.

“At the neuroanatomical level we know that citrus essential oils show the ability to attenuate or dampen some of the hyperactivity of certain brain regions due to stress” explained Cottee.

“The important thing about the additive is that animals must be able to smell or taste it” she added noting that this helps demonstrate that citrus essential oils have a neurosensory effect rather than an impact on the poultry gut.

The additive works quickly with behavioral changes occurring within three to five days after citrus essential oils are first given to the birds. In addition there is no withdrawal period for citrus essential oils. It can be used until the day of slaughter.

The majority of research into citrus essential oils has been conducted in laboratory rats and mice however in early poultry trials citrus essential oils increased the eye surface temperature of broilers raised in high density houses. An increase in eye surface temperature is correlated with a reduction in stress."

French chess star and businessman Jöel Lautier was added to the US sanctions list over the war in Ukraine back in March French business daily Les Echos reported on Wednesday the only non-Russian to be targeted by Washington.

On a long list of mainly affluent people targeted by US sanctions one name stands out. Of the more than 340 individuals sanctioned by the United States on March 24 over the war in Ukraine only one is not Russian: Frenchman Joël Lautier a former international chess champion turned mergers and acquisitions consultant.

Lautier’s inclusion on the ever-growing US blacklist went completely unnoticed until French business daily Les Echos mentioned him in an article published on April 20.

Lautier the head of a mergers and acquisitions consultancy actually appears twice on the US sanctions list: once under his French name (Joël Raymond Lautier) and once under the ""Russified"" version of his surname Zhoel Raimon Lote.

Why Lautier?

Lautier even gets a special mention from the US Treasury because he is quoted separately in a press release about Washington's efforts to target ""the elite close to Russian President Vladimir Putin"". The 48-year-old Frenchman is named alongside 15 wealthy Russians including Gennady Timchenko a businessman and longtime friend of Putin.

However unlike the oligarchs targeted by the US and European authorities Lautier is not being targeted for making a fortune from his Putin ties.

Instead he owes his inclusion on the list to the fact that in 2020 he became a non-executive director and member of the supervisory board of the Russian bank Sovcombank.

One of Russia's ""systemically important"" banks Sovcombank is suspected of helping the Russian elite enrich themselves illegally. It was one of the first targets of US sanctions as soon as the Russian invasion of Ukraine began on February 24.

A month later Washington decided to ramp up the pressure on Sovcombank by individually targeting all of its executives including members of the board of directors.

For Les Echos it is ""bizarre"" that Lautier should come under fire from Washington. Firstly the daily points out he resigned from his position at Sovcombank on February 25 the day after the bank was placed on the sanctions list. This decision is only effective after ""an AGM [of shareholders]"" Les Echos says. Since the US sanctions were announced all references to the members of the board of directors have disappeared from the bank's website.

Moreover there seems to be a double standard at play in Washington. Lautier was officially sanctioned because he was on the supervisory board of Sovcombank. But German national Regina von Flemming became a non-executive director of the Russian bank in 2020 a position she held just before the start of the war and yet she does not appear on the US sanctions list. When contacted by FRANCE 24 the US Treasury did not comment on this discrepancy.

From chess champion to businessman

When contacted by Les Echos Lautier made no comment on his inclusion on the US sanctions list.

His listing means that any assets he holds in the United States or at a US bank can be seized and he cannot do business with Americans.

Ironically Lautier was put on the US sanctions list on the same day as Anatoly Karpov the former world chess champion who became a Russian MP and voted for the war in Ukraine. These two have clashed in the past on several occasions – on a chessboard.

Lautier’s feelings for Russia a superpower in the chess world appear to stem partly from his chess career.

Until 2006 Lautier was the greatest chess star in France. He was world junior champion in 1988 competed in the Chess World Cup 2005 and is one of the few players to have beaten chess legend Garry Kasparov twice in 1994 and 1995.

His love of the game has taken him to Russia on numerous occasions. He became fluent in Russian by devouring the chess books of the Russian grandmasters.

When he retired from chess in 2006 to turn to finance ""Russia offered me the best bridge to go from chess to business"" he told French business daily Les Echos in 2016. He also used the interview to denounce two years after the annexation of Crimea the ""demonisation of Russia in Europe"" and called for more business ties with Moscow.

In 2006 he founded his own mergers and acquisitions consultancy RGG (Russia goes global) which specialises in buying and selling assets in Russia. At the same time he trained at Skolkovo the leading management school in Moscow.

Since then he has advised several large Russian groups in sectors as diverse as oil electricity and pharmaceuticals. In addition to his role at Sovcombank Lautier was also a non-executive director for Evropeyskaya Elektrotekhnica a Russian electronics company.

Any one of these may have been a role too many for the US Treasury; for the US authorities it looks like the former chess champion may have positioned too many of his pawns inside Russia.

The central bank will also trim US dollar and euro holdings in a bid to diversify its foreign reserves the report said.

Israel’s foreign-currency reserves which last year exceeded $200 billion for the first time have traditionally been made up of dollars euros and British pounds. Israel will now include Canadian dollars and Australian dollars in its foreign-currency reserves as well as the Japanese yen and the Chinese renminbi.

The reshuffle was a change in Israel’s “whole investment guidelines and philosophy” Bank of Israel Deputy Governor Andrew Abir said adding that the rise in Israel’s foreign-exchange reserves forced the central bank to consider “the need to earn a return on the reserves that will cover the costs of liability.”

The central bank which as recently as 2020 held 67.4% of its foreign exchange in US dollars 30.1% in euros and 2.5% in British pounds now plans to have the pound and yen account for 5% each. The yuan will account for 2% of its holdings while the currencies of Canada and Australia will each be 3.5%.

A reduction in US dollar and euro holdings is planned to make room for the new reserves being held. US dollar holdings will go from 66.5% in 2021 to 61% down about 8.3% while euro holdings will be reduced from 30.8% to 20% down 35%.

Chinese Yuan and ""De-Dollarization""

China has pushed for a larger role in the foreign-exchange sphere for the renminbi with limited success. International Monetary Fund data shows that the renminbi’s share of global currency reserves rose to a record 2.79% by the end of 2021. However efforts to expand renminbi holdings have been met with criticism of the Chinese government’s tight regulation limits on exchange and accusations of currency devaluation.

Amid a barrage of sanctions placed on Russia to cripple its economy over its invasion of Ukraine numerous countries have grown weary of the risks involved with a US dollar-based global economy in what is being called a potential “de-dollarization” – potentially forging a path for the yuan to grow in international importance.

Japan South Korea and Singapore imposed sanctions on Russia but the Philippines a US treaty ally decided in March to proceed with its purchase of 17 Russian military transport helicopters worth $249 million.

While China has faced criticism for not formally condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine nor imposing sanctions prominent countries such as India a major US ally have declined to formally condemn the invasion or impose sanctions on Russia. Advertisement

India Russia’s largest military trading partner has said it would set up a rupee-ruble exchange mechanism to settle Russian arms sales to India to avoid sanctions under Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act.

China which developed its own alternative to the SWIFT banking system in 2015 was exploring a joint alternative to SWIFT with Russia and India as early as 2019 according to The Economic Times an Indian English-language business-focused daily newspaper.

Alcohol and the powerful opioid fentanyl killed a student from South Carolina who was left at a hospital after watching parades 10 days before Mardi Gras the Orleans Parish Coroner's Office reported Thursday.

""The family of Ciaya Whetstone is saddened by the information contained in the coroner's report ... and distraught that their daughter may have been the victim of a spiked substance"" said a statement by attorneys for the family of the Bamberg South Carolina student.

Attorneys Justin Bamberg L. Chris Stewart Brandon DeCuir and Michael Adams said they need information about an Uber driver who reportedly drove the 21-year-old University of New Orleans student from Bamberg South Carolina to look for her car.

""They want to know what the Uber driver did as he witnessed a passenger dying and why he never called 911 as he witnessed a medical emergency"" the statement said. ""Uber still has not released any information to the family so we are forced to file our lawsuit.""

Uber said Thursday that it cannot comment on pending litigation.

The company has given police requested information about the driver vehicle and GPS trip data according to emailed information from the company. The statement said police will decide whether to release that information to Wheatstone's family or the public.

The company forbids contact with passengers after their trips and its safety team has removed the driver's access to the app the statement said.

The coroner's office said Whetstone died about 7 a.m. on Feb. 19 at a hospital in eastern New Orleans.

That's on the other side of the city from suburban Metairie where news outlets reported she had watched parades before going out with friends. Her roommate told The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate in February that after returning home via Uber to check on her dog she went back out with the same driver saying she wanted to look for her car.

""This coroner's report simply confirmed what we already suspected: she died of an overdose and her Uber driver failed to take appropriate action"" the lawyers said.

The statement continued ""We are waiting for law enforcement and Uber to offer additional details that will provide this family with the real information they need.""

City leaders have said that fentanyl was present in the vast majority of the overdose death cases in 2021 and that it continues to be trending that way this year WWLTV reported.

""It takes a small amount of (fentanyl) to render someone incapacitated"" Dr. Jennifer Avegno Director of the New Orleans City Health Department told the station. ""Fentanyl is in everything. A preliminary analysis of our overdose deaths last year show that it is in at least 90 percent of those deaths.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnViZXIuY29tL214L2VuL2UvZHJpdmUvc2FuLXBlZHJvLWdhcnphLWdhcmNpYS1ubC1teC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Driver jobs in San Pedro Garza García NL - Choose Your Hours,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 406 Client Error: Not Acceptable for url: https://www.uber.com/mx/en/e/drive/san-pedro-garza-garcia-nl-mx/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnViZXIuY29tL214L2VuL2UvZHJpdmUvc2FuLXBlZHJvLWdhcnphLWdhcmNpYS1ubC1teC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRlcGVuZGVudC5jby51ay9saWZlLXN0eWxlL2Zvb2QtYW5kLWRyaW5rL3ViZXItZWF0cy1kZWxpdmVyeS1kcml2ZXJzLW11c2xpbS1mYXN0aW5nLXJhbWFkYW4tZnJlZS1tZWFsLWIyMDY0MjQ2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber Eats to provide free meals for Muslim delivery drivers fasting during Ramadan,"Sign up to IndyEat's free newsletter for weekly recipes foodie features and cookbook releases Get our food and drink newsletter for free Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers events and updates from The Independent.

Uber Eats has partnered with restaurants in three of England’s major cities to provide free iftar meals to Muslim delivery drivers who are fasting during Ramadan.

The initiative named “Sundown Spots” will run from 25-27 April in London Manchester and Birmingham.

It comes as a survey commissioned by the courier service found that less than half (48 per cent) of Muslims feel that their company takes some measures to support them during Ramadan.

When asked about what kind of initiatives would be most appreciated during the month most people said they would benefit from more flexibility (56 per cent) an earlier finish (55 per cent) and being able to work from home (45 per cent).

More than a third of respondents (41 per cent) said they would like more frequent breaks throughout the day while 35 per cent said they would prefer a later start time.

Positively almost half of those surveyed said they feel their colleagues have a good understanding of Ramadan and that they have enjoyed fasting with non-Muslim peers.

As Ramadan draws to an end – Muslims will enter the last week of fasting this week – Sundown Spots will offer drivers the choice of opening their fasts with either a complimentary dine-in meal at selected restaurants or a free takeaway.

The initiative is open to all food delivery couriers regardless of which service they deliver with.

In London the company has partnered with Ayam Zaman in Sheperd’s Bush which serves a Middle Eastern menu. The initiative is running here through 25-27 April.

In Birmingham and Manchester drivers can dine at MyLahore a chain of restaurants serving a fusion of British and South Asian food.

Diners in Manchester can take up the offer on 26 April while it will be available to those in Birmingham on 27 April.

Uber Eats has also collaborated with BAFTA-nominated Muslim chef Zuhair Hassan known to most as Big Zuu to create a signature dish for Ayam Zaman. “Big Zuu’s Big Grill” includes a selection of grilled meats served with chips salad and bread.

“It’s so important that Muslims are represented and feel seen and heard in modern Britain not least during the most sacred month in the Islamic calendar so it’s great to be able to highlight the fantastic food our culture has to offer” Hassan commented.

He added: “For me Ramadan is a time to reset and reflect. Iftar is my favourite part of Ramadan it feels like a pinnacle moment…you take a step back realise where you are now and where you’re meant to be heading.”

Hassan said he is looking forward to forward to Eid Al-Fitr the Muslim celebration which marks the end of Ramadan.

“When it’s time to celebrate Eid for me that’s also centred around food – a nice dinner surrounded by my closest friends or family” he said.

Charity is especially important to Muslims during the month of Ramadan with the UK Charity Commission estimating that Muslims donated £100 million in 2016.

Uber Eats said it will donate a meal to charity for every Halal meal ordered through its app this month and is providing a 50 per cent discount using the code SUNDOWN50 for all grocery orders placed throughout Ramadan.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vN25ld3MuY29tLmF1L2xpZmVzdHlsZS91YmVyLWRyaXZlci1zaGFyZXMtdGhlLW1vc3QtaGVhcnRicmVha2luZy1zdG9yeS1hYm91dC1hLXBhc3NlbmdlcnMtZGVlcGVzdC1zZWNyZXQtYy02NTM2OTkx0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly83bmV3cy5jb20uYXUvbGlmZXN0eWxlL3ViZXItZHJpdmVyLXNoYXJlcy10aGUtbW9zdC1oZWFydGJyZWFraW5nLXN0b3J5LWFib3V0LWEtcGFzc2VuZ2Vycy1kZWVwZXN0LXNlY3JldC1jLTY1MzY5OTEuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber driver shares the most heartbreaking story about a passenger’s ‘deepest secret’,"A former Uber driver has shared the most heartbreaking story about a ‘sweet’ passenger who confessed she was dying from brain cancer.

The female ride-share driver believed to be from the US said she was called to pick up the young woman at a bar about 10pm on a Wednesday after she had drinks with colleagues.

During the ride the passenger told the driver she didn’t have much time left to live because she was secretly battling against the terminal illness.

“I remember my heart just pounding” the driver said.

Before the devastating confession the young woman had hopped into the car before she apologised for being “so drunk”.

“She politely asked if we could just drive around a little while with the windows down” the driver said.

“I was prepping for a cleaning fee trying to drive and pull a vomit bag out of the glove box but no she just did that airplane thing with one hand out the backseat window.”

‘She told me she was dying’

Suddenly things took an unexpected turn.

“She asked me if I had ever thought about dying to which I replied ‘Yeah - I guess so’” the driver said.

“That’s when she told me that she had cancer. It was in her brain and it was too far gone to consider chemo.

“She told me she was dying and she was going to be okay.”

The passenger then explained to the driver why she was out drinking that night.

“She was celebrating with her work friends who threw her a going away party” the driver recalled.

“She told them she was taking a position abroad.”

The girl then said to the driver “I just didn’t tell them that abroad was heaven.”

Clearly shocked the driver confessed “Jesus. F***ing. Christ. I turned off my app and cried all the way home.”

The story was shared on Reddit in July 2016 - but it has been doing the rounds on TikTok in recent months.

‘My heart is broken into a million pieces’

The video on TikTok has been viewed more than 10.4 million times with many saying the young passenger’s confession “hit home”.

“She made peace with death this made me cry because as of writing this I have a relative who has six months to one year left because of cancer” one wrote.

Another said: “Every time I see this story I still cry. It hits hard my mum passed away to cancer almost three years ago.”

While one added: “This broke my heart into a million pieces. My brother just lost his girlfriend she passed away in February. About a month before she had sent a message telling me how grateful she was to have spent all that time with us.

“She was sick but we didn’t know how seriously ill she was.”

Meanwhile one woman said she hopes this story was a reminder for everyone to be kind.

After the critically acclaimed release of her most recent studio album “Positions” Grande shifted her focus to her brand-new makeup line R.E.M. Beauty.

Grande officially launched the company on Nov. 12 2021 but has garnered attention for its release at Ulta Beauty stores on April 14. Reviewers have praised the products for being vegan and cruelty-free which has allowed the company to become a bestseller. R.E.M. Beauty’s mission is to allow people to express their creativity through makeup.

She garnered the name R.E.M. Beauty from one of her song titles which means “rapid eye movement.” The beauty line is space-enthused and dreamy going hand-in-hand with her retro-styled discography. Among the beauty shop items are lipsticks that resemble astronaut helmets and eye shadows that appear as space dust to name a few. Her variety of releases allow buyers to lean into a sense of nostalgia and warmth as if it was designed just for them.

Aside from R.E.M. Beauty Grande also has a signature perfume line which is unrelated to her makeup line. I have personally bought a wide array of her fragrances which were purchased from Ulta Beauty. The first perfume I bought was titled “R.E.M.” and came as a deluxe set with their largest perfume a travel-sized tube and a limited edition comic book.

Affectionately titled “Ariana Grande vs Sargeant Shade and the Clonebot Brigade” the pop superstar took on a character persona from her “Break Free” music video in the comic book. Grande has stated that she’s “always the version of [herself] when [she] was in ‘Break Free’” and she “wanted to spend more time as this character.”

R.E.M.’s scent is a fruity mix of sandalwood lavender and marshmallows holding a light and airy tone. Similar scents include “Cloud” and “God is a Woman” both of which I own and love. I’ve found that her perfume line is quintessential and I can’t wait to try some of her products from R.E.M. Beauty. Though expensive I can confidently say that they are worth it.

Whether Ariana Grande is making music or being an entrepreneur her display of creativity is a highlight in our lives. With the artistic power of her signature makeup and fragrance collections she truly can transport her buyers ‘out of this world.’",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpZ2hzbm9iaWV0eS5jb20vcC9nbG93LWNhbi1iZWF1dHktYWNoaWV2ZS1jaXJjdWxhci1lY29ub215L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Circular Economy In Beauty: Would You Buy Used Makeup?,"It’s a familiar story. You grow out of your once-loved T-shirt or pair of sneakers. You list it on Grailed StockX eBay or depop hoping to clear some closet space and earn extra cash. If you’re lucky you might even make a premium by reselling it for more than what you paid. Then you do it all over again.

This dance of buying and selling isn’t exclusive to fashion: It also happens in the unlikely – but nonetheless thriving – realm of beauty. Makeup skincare and fragrance (even samples) are traded online and hyped limited releases of special edition products – coveted for their rarity collectability and social media buzz – are resold at prices higher than retail.

Last July when rumors of Kylie Jenner using the Dior Backstage “001 Pink” Rosy Glow blush went viral on TikTok it instantly sold out at Sephora the LVMH-owned cosmetics chain. Even though Jenner cleared up the rumor a few weeks later and said that she’s “never used it or owned it” the blush remains sold out to this day. If you’re dying to get your hands on that hot pink blush (like I once was) chances are you can’t. Unless of course you know where else to look.

The Dior blush is listed for sale on platforms like Poshmark and Mercari user-run marketplaces comparable to Grailed Vestiaire Collective and depop. In multiple postings the $39 blush is priced anywhere from $59.99 to $76. Some people “copped” used versions of it for $45 and $55 – and with shipping fees of up to $7.67 in the case of Poshmark – paid almost $63 plus tax for the blush that had already been used by someone else.

There’s abundant dialogue surrounding the much-needed secondhand marketplace for clothing shoes and other accessories. But the topic as it relates to beauty is less broached because well using secondhand makeup and skincare is simply unhygienic — or so you’d think (more on this later).

The global beauty market is projected to reach $545 billion this year and $738 billion by 2027. Waste is just as big an issue in beauty as it is in fashion with consumers increasingly looking to support eco-conscious brands. “Woke” brands in the beauty space boast their use of biodegradable or recyclable packaging over plastic and the non-use of toxic chemical ingredients harmful to the environment. Fenty Beauty Humanrace Grown Alchemist Khiel’s and even diptyque have introduced refillable packaging to combat waste and major industry players like L’Oreal Estee Lauder Procter & Gamble and Unilever vowed to reduce water use decrease deforestation and generate alternative sources of energy.

But rather than exclusively buying from sustainably-minded brands – which is admirable of course – what if consumers could do more? What if buyers could share the burden with manufacturers and brands and actively participate in creating a more circular economy in beauty?

In April 2020 a video of an ULTA employee revealing how the beauty chain disposes of its returned items went viral sparking discussions on impulse buys and irresponsible shopping habits. Arnaud Plas co-founder of haircare brand Prose estimates that anywhere from 20 to 40 percent of products made in the beauty industry end up as waste either from individual disuse or companies’ bulk liquidation of items at the end of their shelf life.

Venturing beyond skincare and into discretionary beauty categories like makeup and fragrance the issue of waste becomes even more pronounced. Makeup for the face eyes and lips come in a wide range of formulas and finishes and an endless array of color variations. For many beauty lovers a meaningful makeup collection equates to choice: owning different options to change up their look which for many can result in piles of product that eventually end up in the trash.

All of us are beauty consumers in one way or another. The vast majority of us regularly use cleansers skincare perfumes — even shampoos and toothpaste fall into the beauty category. Studies show that 56 percent of men also use makeup like foundation and concealers.

When was the last time you actually emptied a bottle of facial cream or cleanser? When you discard an expired skincare item do you toss the whole vial in the trash or wash and recycle applicable components? Do you feel guilty about throwing away unused product?

While secondhand beauty sales can be met with skepticism they illustrate the potential of beauty’s circular economy.

Kylie Jenner’s rumored Dior blush is just one example of the many beauty items circulating at resale value. While hyped items like Supreme’s $38 Pat McGrath lipstick are listed at prices of up to $200 a scroll through re-commerce apps shows that the bulk of secondhand beauty transactions are of discounted run-of-the-mill items. And in many cases used products sell without issue.

Technically most platforms prohibit the listing and selling of used beauty products. “Makeup and personal care products must be new. Any liquid products must be new and in their original sealed packaging” Poshmark's policy states. Depop’s list of restricted items includes “used perfumes and cosmetics” and “unsealed product samples” but the platform does allow “unused and genuine perfumes and cosmetics” “samples as long as they come in the original container” and “homemade perfumes and cosmetics as long as they comply with the applicable regulations.” Mercari doesn’t explicitly prohibit used beauty but it does ban “items that are soiled with human materials such as used underwear.”

None of this seems to stop makeup lovers from transacting with used goods. “Lightly swatched in a smoke-free pet-free home” reads one seller’s posting of an eyeshadow palette. “New without box” reads another. While the apps prompt a warning message before posting a beauty or liquid item all it takes is one tap for sellers to complete their listings. With at least 2 billion listings across these platforms and half a million new posts every day it’s nearly impossible for administrators to adequately monitor filter and delete listings that go against their policies.

Not all consumers who buy and sell used beauty have sustainability or circularity at the top of their minds. Most are simply looking to declutter their vanity and make a few bucks in the process. “Decluttering” unwanted makeup and skincare is a common practice in the beauty community so much so that it’s spawned an entire genre of YouTube videos.

If decluttering is the motivation for sellers why would buyers want to purchase used beauty especially from complete strangers on the internet?

“Colors and products are often discontinued so I can imagine a lot of people [try] to find whatever is left of their favorite products” says Devon Abelman former beauty editor at Allure. “[There’s] also cheaper prices of course.”

Despite the plus-sides of supporting the beauty resale market using pre-owned makeup poses health risks. “Unfortunately makeup and makeup applicators run the risk of becoming contaminated with microorganisms” explains Joshua Zeichner Director of Cosmetic & Clinical Research in Dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital. “When it comes to open makeup you just don't know how the previous owner used the products and whether they were exposed to contaminants.”

Abelman agrees: “Moisturizers cleansing balms [and] cream blushes definitely shouldn’t be sold after use” she says. “Serums with pumps and any skincare product that comes in a tube are pretty much the only secondhand beauty products I feel comfortable sharing. Anything with a dropper is also off-limits because people often touch them to their hands and faces.”

Plenty of online sellers claim to have properly sanitized their pressed powders or bullet lipsticks and buyers seem to believe them. If you’re set on purchasing a pre-owned product Zeichner recommends powder as the least likely to become contaminated. “Theoretically if you could remove the entire section of makeup that came in contact with the skin” he says. “You also need to clean the packaging since microorganisms can live there as well.”

On Reddit numerous threads debate the legitimacy of secondhand beauty shopping. “I've purchased a few things secondhand and I don't see the problem with doing it – especially because otherwise most things will end up in the landfill!” wrote beautybunny505. “Lipstick/mascaras are where I draw the line but powder products that can be sanitized or things in tubes are fair game. Great way to try something out – plus you're likely saving $ and keeping something usable from the garbage.”

“I’m a makeup artist. Used makeup is beyond revolting” tudie0011 replied.

Abelman views the sale of used makeup as contrary to the widening accessibility of beauty. “Beauty should be accessible and safe to all – straight from its source. There are so many affordable beauty brands these days with effective products so you can shop them without having to take any major risks. You can get fresh products for an affordable price if saving money is your goal.”

While skepticism of secondhand beauty is valid the phenomenon is catching on. San Francisco-based e-tailer Glambot specializes in used makeup and skincare with the aim to shift consumer buying habits in the beauty industry. Its homepage features a list of accepted brands and a calculator widget to estimate how much sellers can be paid for turning in their goods. Shoppers can find foundation eyeshadow lipstick body lotion and more just as they would at any other beauty store — except most of Glambot’s are used and discounted. According to the site a lab member “thoroughly cleans each piece of makeup along with its packaging with a variety of methods including heat light therapy product removal alcohol or a combination of all of these methods.”

There seems to be a blue ocean industry opportunity in refurbishing used beauty for resale as Glambot is the only well-known shop of its kind.

There is also the option to donate unwanted personal care items and pass them onto those in need. Organizations like Beauty Bus Share Your Beauty and Dress for Success accept new unopened and unexpired merchandise to give to terminally ill patients and their caregivers or victims of domestic abuse and addiction. Project Beauty Share Rise of Broken Women and Homes for the Homeless also accept gently used sanitized items to give to women and teens in crisis situations.

Regardless of your stance on secondhand beauty there is more than ample room for us to reevaluate our consumption habits. That can mean shopping more responsibly and making a conscious effort to return less product to stores using up what we own before discarding it and moving onto something new or donating unwanted items to organizations that can professionally clean and distribute them to those who need it more. The resell model as it stands may be far from perfect but it brings to light an inkling of what a circular beauty economy could look like.

Supporting sustainable brands and holding big names accountable is a necessary first step but we must go further and consider how else we can protect Mother Earth. After all makeup is beautiful but so is our planet.

Milwaukee Bucks guard Grayson Allen (7) celebrates a basket just before the buzzer at the end of the 3rd period during the second half of the Bucks 119-95 win at the United Center in Chicago on Sunday April 24 2022.

Chicago Bulls fans didn't exactly need additional reasons to dislike Milwaukee Bucks' swingman Grayson Allen with a passion.

But they now have a few more.

Allen came off the bench to score 27 points in 28 minutes and help give the Bucks a commanding 3-1 lead in the NBA first-round playoff series after a dominant 119-95 win in Chicago.

Bulls fans were quite displeased with Allen in January after his flagrant foul broke the wrist of Bulls guard Alex Caruso.

Allen was ejected from the game and suspended for the next contest by the NBA.

Caruso needed surgery.

As a result Bulls fans aren't exactly kind to Allen whenever he touches the ball but giving Allen the business this week at the United Center didn't exactly go as planned.

In his last two playoff games Allen is 11 of 14 from three-point range and has scored a total of 52 points.

The Bucks were plus-23 when Allen was on the floor in Game 4. Even his own teammates were booing him.

Rihanna committed to her penchant for glamour — and dispelling unnecessary gossip — in a pair of Amina Muaddi sandals. The $1380 Giorgia style featured black patent leather uppers with thin toe straps counters and 4-inch stiletto heels. Giving the set added drama were wraparound ankle straps composed of glittering crystals boosting Rihanna’s ensemble with a glitzy finish.

Glamorous heels like Rihanna’s are a top trend during the high heel renaissance as sultry and dramatic pairs are on the rise. Many include eye-catching feather crystal and PVC accents as seen in new styles by Schutz Nina Shoes and Alexandre Birman. Rihanna has exemplified the movement’s shoes in her wardrobe wearing numerous pairs with sparkle bold colors and more on numerous occasions — including Muaddi’s Giorgia which she’s worn in lavender satin as well.

Aside from the soon-to-be mother stars like Chrissy Teigen Jennifer Lopez and Mindy Kaling have also strapped into bold sandals by Tom Ford Gianvito Rossi and Jimmy Choo in recent weeks.

For Rihanna no shoe is too bold — or heel too high. The “We Found Love” singer has worn a wide range of shoes over the years including sky-high heels and chunky sneakers. Rihanna’s red carpet styles often include strappy sandals platforms and pointed-toe pumps by Muaddi Prada and Tom Ford that coordinate with her outfits. Her off-duty styles also include similarly daring sandals and boots by Celine Givenchy and Saint Laurent.

However she’s also known for wearing statement sneakers by New Balance Nike and Puma. Aside from her repertoire of stylish shoes Rihanna’s also found success in launching her own Savage x Fenty Fenty Beauty and Fenty labels in the fashion and beauty industries. Additionally she’s served as a collaborator campaign star and muse for top brands that including Dior Chanel and Manolo Blahnik.

There are around 175000 white and orange U-Haul rental trucks in the United States and Canada for do-it-yourself movers. And they all have something strange in common: Arizona license plates with the word “apportioned” slapped on them.

The reason?

An esoteric agreement between the 48 continental US states Washington DC and all 10 Canadian provinces determining how big-rigs and other commercial vehicles that travel across state lines divvy up billions of dollars of license plate registration fees.

The issue of U-Haul’s license plates took on greater significance last week after investigators in New York City said they were looking for information about a U-Haul van with Arizona plates in connection with a subway shooting that left more than 20 people injured.

License plate fees

When you register your passenger car you usually pay a small license plate fee to your state DMV that goes to funding roads bridges and other public infrastructure projects.

But commercial trucking rental and leasing companies that use big rigs to transport goods through multiple states operate under a completely different system. These vehicles need special permission to travel across state lines and have to pay higher license fees often upwards of $1000 a year.

Such vehicles — known as “apportionable vehicles” — are registered and licensed under what’s known as the International Registration Plan (IRP) an agreement created between states in the 1970s.

The IRP allows commercial trucks traveling within the United States and Canada to use one state-issued license plate and registration card but requires operators to pay fees to other states based on how many miles they drive in them and their weight. Some companies keep track of miles manually while others use GPS systems.

So U-Haul which has been based in Phoenix since 1967 registers all of its rental trucks in Arizona and the state then distributes those license plate fees to other states where the rental trucks travel.

Say for example one U-Haul van drove 20000 miles in a year. If half of the miles were in Utah and the other half were in Colorado the fees would be split among those two states.

U-Haul owned by the holding company Amerco (UHAL) does not disclose how much it pays in registration fees annually or which states receive the most cash. But a spokesperson for U-Haul said it paid “a vast sum of money” in IRP fees.

No free riders

Although most travelers have never heard of the IRP it was developed as the interstate travel system expanded.

The agreement eliminated the hassle of trucks having to carrying separate license plates and cab cards for each state they traveled through. It was also designed to ensure that states got a fair share of license plate fees from out-of-state vehicles that were wearing down their roads.

“There are pictures of old trucks with 10 or 12 license plates on the front” said Tim Adams the CEO of International Registration Plan Inc. an organization that oversees compliance with the agreement.

Around 3 million vehicles and 350000 companies were part of the IRP in 2021 Adams said. They paid $3.5 billion in fees that were used to fund highway projects and safety initiatives.

“It generates a lot of money for the road funds each year” he said. The IRP is a “fluid agreement that still has purpose.”

In fact the agreement has worked so effectively that the International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA) a similar arrangement between states divvying up commercial vehicles’ fuel tax sales was modeled after it.

So the next time you’re playing the license plate game during a road trip and keep passing U-Haul vans with Arizona plates you can impress your family by explaining why.",,,,,,,,,,,,

But this is not Zipline’s first overseas endeavour. The company started working in the land-locked nation of Rwanda in 2016. Healthcare workers wanted a better solution for blood transfusion which was a long and complicated process.

Rwanda’s government saw the potential of drones in healthcare and signed up with Zipline. The autonomous drones transport blood from a distribution hub and parachute it down inside an insulated cardboard box to the facility caring for the patient. Zipline has two drone hubs in Rwanda and they complete up to 500 deliveries each day.",,,,,,,,,

As Oregon continues to contend with the pandemic health care workforce shortages and the impending loss of Oregon Health Plan coverage for hundreds of thousands of people the state’s next governor will have no shortage of health care crises to tackle.

The Lund Report reached out to top contenders in the 2022 gubernatorial race to see how they’d address the state’s most pressing problems related to health care. Here’s how Democratic candidate George Carrillo replied to our questions:

What specific policy would you pursue to improve health care for Oregonians?

Our government and health care system has failed our BIPOC and marginalized communities. Our government and health care system have not provided equitable access to health care services education preventative care and have not been willing to listen recognize or rectify historical injustice discrimination and undermined health needs for BIPOC LGBTQIA2S+ and other marginalized communities. For this reason I support H.B. 4052. I believe all Oregonians should have equitable access to health related care educational supports preventative care and services that are impacted by racism. We must be inclusive. We must provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services to our diverse communities across Oregon to improve health outcomes.

Oregon is simultaneously in the midst of addiction and behavioral health system crises. What is your plan for ensuring Oregonians have access to treatment when they need it?

Substance abuse and behavioral/mental health is a crisis in Oregon because we continue to criminalize individuals that suffer from these medically diagnosed illnesses and cannot access necessary services. Incarceration does not equal rehabilitation. We must listen to our Community Based Organizations (CBOs) and recognize the work they are doing with our vulnerable and at times dangerous individuals that are lost in their battle with addiction and mental health challenges. We must meet people where they are at. We need to treat them with dignity and respect at each and every contact because you never know if they are attempting to seek help. Building trust and being available to provide support and services when that individual is ready is critical.

As governor I will make sure that CBOs are adequately funded and staffed. There will be trained medical and behavioral health professionals to provide wrap-around services that can include any combination of the following: substance abuse treatment inpatient treatment transitional support outpatient treatment medication management psychiatric supports and strength-based peer support. Goals for achieving health well-being and self-sufficiency will be equity focused. Much of the support will teach life skills such as: emotional regulation healthy problem solving and coping skills to manage life stressors budgeting building a healthy support system identifying addictive traits that could lead to relapse and having a plan for sustainable sobriety and mental health wellbeing. Additional support will also include employment training self-advocacy transition services and adequate cultural and linguistic support for BIPOC and other marginalized communities.

What does Oregon need to do to rebuild its public health system — and strengthen it — to address disparities and improve equity?

The Oregon Legislature needs to give power back to Oregonians. We must listen to the people to our CBOs that meet with our most vulnerable populations understand their barriers and understand needs of our communities. Government has to shift the way that decisions are made and bring CBOs and those directly experiencing hardship to the table. Government must listen to the people empower the community and be willing to implement new strategies to improve or reform the public health system so that it benefits the overall health and well-being of all Oregonians.

About 300000 people must exit the Oregon Health Plan over the coming year because their incomes exceed the threshold and Oregon is in the early stages of developing a bridge plan to cover a fraction of them — the working poor who make up to twice the poverty level. Do you agree with those who say Oregon needs a more ambitious “public option” plan covering people with incomes four times the poverty level?

Yes because I believe in health care for all because you can’t place value on someone’s life. I will sign into law Medicare for All single-payer health insurance program. I will ask the Legislature to provide me with a bill that has been approved by the task force within my first 100 days.

Oregon’s public health response to the pandemic has been criticized from different perspectives. What is your take on what worked well and what didn’t?

What worked well in the beginning was taking appropriate measures to keep our community safe. For example there were ongoing indoor social distancing requirements and face mask requirements. We saw more of an emphasis on cleaner environments throughout all of our service industries.

As the pandemic went on we started accepting a certain amount of loss of life. We saw that each time we had a surge we couldn't bring our case numbers down to the beginning of the pandemic.

The pandemic was heavily politicized and not viewed as a global health crisis. The government failed to see that we need to focus on Oregonians’ well-being and overall health to sustain our health system and economy. Oregon’s public health was not prepared to serve the public. Health care workers did not have adequate PPE to stay safe. We did not have a pandemic mobilization plan or strategy to collaborate with the expertise of the National Guard. There were not enough health care workers to meet the demand of the pandemic and allow sufficient recovery time for health care workers. We also didn’t have strong relationships with marginalized communities. The government struggled to work with community because they do not have trusting relationships with marginalized communities in Oregon. We can see in the data that our marginalized communities were heavily affected by this lack of trust.

UPDATE April 24: Carrillo notified The Lund Report that his staff mistakenly sent a rough draft of his answers which we had published on this page.

Many blame the province's fee-for-service system,"Camille Currie has less than a year of battery life on her pacemaker and no family doctor.

The Greater Victoria resident and mother of two says she also has bleeding and connective-tissue disorders that would make post-op care challenging when she does get the battery replaced. If she has trouble healing she is afraid she will have to line up at an urgent and primary care centre (UPCC).

Currie also says both her children have a rare auto-inflammatory disorder.

Yet she and her family are among almost a million British Columbians without a family doctor. According to the B.C. College of Family Physicians only 80 per cent of residents in the Capital Regional District have one compared to 84 per cent of people provincewide.

According to Canadian tech company Medimap which publishes online wait-times for walk-in clinics B.C. residents wait an average of 58 minutes at walk-in clinics — more than double the national average. Victoria had the longest average wait time in the country at more than 2½ hours.

CBC spoke to patients doctors and other people impacted by the shortage for a special series titled ""A Crisis in Care: The Family Doctor Shortage in Greater Victoria"" to examine the roots of the problem and one issue that came up multiple times was B.C.'s fee-for-service system.

Current system leading to doctor burnout

Fee-for-service is a system of care that pays doctors for each office visit.

People familiar with how it works say the high volume of administrative work needed for doctors to get payment — combined with the low amount of take-home pay it generates — is discouraging doctors from practising family medicine and that's created a dire need for family physicians and a reliance on emergency rooms and clinics.

""B.C. is not providing us with universal health care"" said Currie on CBC's All Points West on Tuesday.

Dr. Adrian Yee a hematologist in Victoria said the Urgent and Primary Care Centre (UPCC) system is failing many of his elderly patients who come to him with medical conditions that have worsened while they waited to see a primary care provider. (Mike McArthur/CBC)

Greater Victoria physician Jennifer Lush is trying though.

Lush has been a family doctor for 20 years and understands why others would choose not to be. Most doctors are paid about $30 per patient visit and from that Lush pays for staff medical equipment and office space.

She says she works 70-hour weeks and struggles with work-life balance.

Half the hours Lush puts in are unpaid she says because they are spent doing paperwork.

""The minute my kids are tucked in bed I'm pulling out my computer and I start charting. Often I will chart until two or three in the morning"" Lush told CBC's On The Island on Tuesday.

It is possible in BC but only if the family doc works for free. Now if the govt would pay the doctor for all work done after hours included it would be one step to attracting docs back into family medicine. <a href=""https://t.co/hjJ537BYuY"">https://t.co/hjJ537BYuY</a> —@DrJLush

Comparable to minimum wage

A report published in the Canadian Family Physician Journal in November 2021 found up-and-coming doctors are choosing more hospital-based work and specialized practice rather than family medicine — in part because they're worried about the consequences of B.C.'s fee-for-service model on work-life balance.

Alicia Pawluk became a doctor in 2018 and does hospital-based work alongside treating patients at the Cool Aid Community Health Centre in Victoria.

She says under the current system the take-home income of a family doctor is comparable to minimum wage.

""The average physician graduates with about $200000 of debt. Minimum wage is not going to be able to cover the sort of payments that we need to make"" said Pawluk.

In May 2020 the College of Family Physicians of Canada called for alternative funding models to replace the fee-for-service method in order to recruit and retain more family doctors.

B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix said connecting people with a family doctor has been his ""highest priority"" since entering the role in 2017.

'I did not receive that care until too late'

Change can't come soon enough for Joy Williamson who has been without a doctor for eight years. Diagnosed with breast cancer in 2020 she believes it would have been caught sooner if she had had one.

""I did not receive that care until too late"" said Williamson who explained that the cancer had travelled to her lymph nodes by the time it was detected and she needed to have her whole breast removed instead of a lumpectomy.

The day before her surgery Williamson was worried she had a blood infection and says she drove around Greater Victoria with her husband and two kids for hours looking for a UPCC that was not full. She ended up waiting five hours in emergency for a diagnosis.

Currie hears how frustrating that is firsthand. She created B.C. Health Care Matters  a website where patients can petition for change and share their stories.

Those stories include parents who waited eight hours in emergency with sick kids and a senior couple with mobility issues who lined up for hours several days in a row at a UPCC that was constantly full.

As time ticks closer to Currie's own pending surgery her own fear grows.

Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission includes Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) previously known as Health ID Healthcare Professionals Registry (HPR) and Health Facility Registry (HFR). Let’s take a look at each component.

What Is A Health ID?

Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) aims at creating India’s digital health ecosystem. ABHA allows you to create digital health records for yourself and your family and access and share them digitally. ABHA is a randomly generated 14 digit number used for the purposes of uniquely identifying persons authenticating them and threading their health records (only with their informed consent) across multiple systems and stakeholders.

How To Create ABHA?

You can get ABHA by self-registration on the ABHA web portal or by downloading the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission Health Records application from the Google Playstore. You can also request for creation of your ABHA at a participating health facility which may include public or private hospitals community health centre and health and wellness centres across India.

You can create ABHA either through Aadhaar or mobile number or a driving license. If you use your Aadhaar Number to create your ABHA on the ABHA portal one-time password (OTP) will be sent to the mobile number linked to your Aadhaar. Registration through a mobile number or Aadhaar takes less than 10 minutes.

Remember in the case of driving license after submitting your details you will get an enrolment number which you will have to take to a nearby participating facility to get ABHA.

What Is The Purpose Of ABHA (Health ID)?

Picture this: Working in a factory in the national capital Delhi Prateek who hails from a remote village in Bihar meets with an accident. He is rushed to a nearby hospital where the doctor asks for his medical records. Apparently all his documents are back in his village. Under such a scenario a patient is asked to take all essential tests again which obviously adds to the medical cost and is time-consuming resulting in delayed treatment.

Here comes the role of ABHA or Health ID which will contain details of every test every disease the doctors visited the medicines taken and the diagnosis. Since the information is stored digitally it can be made available anytime anywhere.

What Is Healthcare Professionals Registry?

Healthcare Professionals Registry is a repository of all healthcare professionals involved in the delivery of healthcare services across both modern and traditional systems of medicine. The Healthcare Professionals Registry (HPR) is a bridge built by Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission to connect healthcare workers with patients.

Since doctors do not advertise in newspapers it is only through word of mouth that one gets to know about a good doctor. Now all the information of the doctors regarding their specialty the nearby doctors where to reach immediately will be available PM Modi had said.

As part of HPR verified healthcare professionals can treat patients remotely through telemedicine and review digital health records.

What Is Health Facility Registry?

Health Facility Registry (HFR) is a comprehensive repository of health facilities of the country across different systems of medicine. It includes both public and private health facilities including hospitals clinics diagnostic laboratories and imaging centers pharmacies among other.

As of April 5 2022 21.18 crore ABHA numbers have been created 24390 health facilities and 11645 doctors have registered themselves.

NDTV – Dettol have been working towards a clean and healthy India since 2014 via Banega Swachh India initiative which is helmed by Campaign Ambassador Amitabh Bachchan. The campaign aims to highlight the inter-dependency of humans and the environment and of humans on one another with the focus on One Health One Planet One Future – Leaving No One Behind. It stresses on the need to take care of and consider everyone’s health in India – especially vulnerable communities – the LGBTQ population indigenous people India’s different tribes ethnic and linguistic minorities people with disabilities migrants geographically remote populations gender and sexual minorities. In wake of the current COVID-19 pandemic the need for WASH (Water Sanitation and Hygiene) is reaffirmed as handwashing is one of the ways to prevent Coronavirus infection and other diseases. The campaign will continue to raise awareness on the same along with focussing on the importance of nutrition and healthcare for women and children fight malnutrition mental wellbeing self care science and health adolescent health & gender awareness. Along with the health of people the campaign has realised the need to also take care of the health of the eco-system. Our environment is fragile due to human activity that is not only over-exploiting available resources but also generating immense pollution as a result of using and extracting those resources. The imbalance has also led to immense biodiversity loss that has caused one of the biggest threats to human survival – climate change. It has now been described as a “code red for humanity.” The campaign will continue to cover issues like air pollution waste management plastic ban manual scavenging and sanitation workers and menstrual hygiene. Banega Swasth India will also be taking forward the dream of Swasth Bharat the campaign feels that only a Swachh or clean India where toilets are used and open defecation free (ODF) status achieved as part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014 can eradicate diseases like diahorrea and the country can become a Swasth or healthy India.

Distinguished Guests

Ladies and Gentlemen

Good evening to all of you.

I am very glad to be with you at tonight’s Lecture and Formal Dinner to celebrate SGH’s illustrious journey. I accepted it first in 2019 and I am glad finally to have this opportunity tonight to deliver on that and at a good time for us to gather look back and enjoy the evening.

Since its establishment two centuries ago in 1821 SGH has gone through remarkable transformations. From a wooden shed in a British military camp near Bras Basah nursing injured soldiers to the largest hospital in Singapore today caring for more than one million patients annually and flying Singapore’s flag high as a world-class centre for leading edge clinical care research and teaching.

SGH’s success mirrors our journey as a nation and the tremendous improvement in our healthcare standards. Today Singapore has one of the highest life expectancies and lowest infant mortality rates in the world.

SGH supported the nation during moments of great need and crisis. Caring for casualties of the Hock Lee Bus strike and racial riots during the tumultuous years of our independence struggle; treating victims of the Spyros oil tanker explosion and Hotel New World building collapse in the 1970s and 80s; and standing steadfast on the frontline of public health services in this ongoing pandemic.

COVID-19 is our latest trial but it certainly will not be our last. So tonight as the pandemic gradually subsides I would like to assess where we stand how we got here and how we should move forward.

Where we stand

We have come a long way since our first local COVID-19 case two plus years ago.

The journey has not been easy – the virus surprised us repeatedly and each time we had to move quickly and to adapt. Battling the surge in our migrant worker dormitories. Imposing a Circuit Breaker followed by multiple rounds of easing and tightening. Implementing contact tracing TraceTogether and SafeEntry. Procuring precious medical supplies such as surgical masks and ventilators. Securing vaccines early and inoculating the whole population. Dealing with the Delta variant and then Omicron. Going from “Zero COVID” to “Living with COVID”. We experienced anxious moments when we were not sure how things would turn out.

Finally now we are approaching our goal of living with the virus though not yet out of the woods. The virus may yet surprise us again. But overall we are in good shape.

We just announced another major step to relax our COVID restrictions and you can feel the city coming back to life. We are quietly confident of dealing with whatever may come and continuing to progress towards the new normal.

How we got here

How were we able to get heresafely and successfully? Let me cite three factors.

A Resilient Healthcare System

First we established a strong and resilient healthcare system over the years. At its heart is a highly professional healthcare team. We invested heavily in our healthcare workers equipped them with the right set of skills and kept them up to date with medical developments. We regularly reviewed remuneration packages to keep healthcare jobs competitive. We recruited and retained the right people – doctors nurses and healthcare professionals – who are not just technically competent and at the top of their fields but just as importantly dedicated to their calling.

We also invested heavily in our healthcare infrastructure. Since 2010 we have constructed and expanded eight public acute and community hospitals.

Crucially after SARS we enhanced the capabilities for isolating and managing infectious diseases in all our hospitals. We built the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) which integrates clinical services public health research training and community engagement all within a single purpose-built facility to manage disease outbreaks. NCID opened just in time for COVID-19.

We also expanded our network of affordable and accessible primary care. We increased the number of polyclinics from 18 to 23 over the last five years. We partnered more than 1000 General Practitioner (GP) clinics through the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) the Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPC) scheme and the Primary Care Network (PCN) scheme.

All these proved their worth when COVID-19 hit us. The public healthcare institutions were instrumental in caring for COVID-19 patients and supporting MOH in making evidence-based decisions.

Our hospitals geared themselves up for surges in case loads. Built up stockpiles of essential medical supplies. Ramped up ICU capacity. Reorganised and mobilised resources to support the Emergency Departments and COVID-19 wards.

Our extensive network of polyclinics and PHPCs also played vital roles. Initially they helped us identify treat and isolate infections. Later on they also offered vaccinations and augmented our Home Recovery Programme to relieve the load on our healthcare system.

Most of all our healthcare workers displayed professionalism and commitment kept our healthcare system strong and resilient and enabled Singapore to maintain a degree of normalcy in extraordinary times. They were stretched to the limit but they maintained the highest standards and did not break. They were constantly on the frontlines determined and resilient even at the start when we understood little of the virus. When the migrant worker dormitories experienced outbreaks they fearlessly went in to test and take care of the residents. They were amongst the first to endure the discomfort of using the enhanced Personal Protective Equipment for the entire working day and amongst the last to go off Rostered Routine Testing.

Our healthcare workers endured extremely high workloads and stress levels during the pandemic. We have done our best to give them some respite and adequate breaks from their duties to recover and recharge.

Still these two years have been very challenging for them and such a pace is clearly unsustainable in normal times. So we must continue our efforts across the board – at the institutions clusters ministry and also in the community – to prevent fatigue and burnout amongst our healthcare workers. We must take good care of their welfare and well-being if we expect them to continue doing their best for all of us.

A big thank you to all our healthcare workers including the many who are here today for your courage perseverance and commitment to the cause. Singapore is deeply grateful to all of you.

An Effective Public Health Response

While a resilient healthcare system saw us through the pandemic a pervasive crisis of this nature cannot be dealt with solely within the confines of hospitals and clinics.

We needed also to mount an effective public health response and we did so – this was the second factor that made a big difference in this crisis.

Public health is different from healthcare. We are fortunate to have dedicated and outstanding medical practitioners many of whom are here tonight but excellent clinical care must be complemented by equally competent public health management to bring the pandemic under control and prevent the healthcare system from becoming overwhelmed.

Healthcare focuses on providing the best possible medical treatment for individual patients whereas public health focuses on the state of health of our overall population. It seeks to reduce the burden of the pandemic on our society and use public policies including non-medical interventions to manage the course of the pandemic and limit the spread of the virus.

This requires a different mindset. Looking at the whole system and deciding how to prioritise our resources under the given circumstances to benefit as many people as possible.

One prime example was how we replaced Polymerase Chain Reaction Tests (PCR) with Antigen Rapid Tests (ART) for most use cases. From a clinical perspective to ascertain whether a particular patient has COVID-19 PCR is preferred. It is more sensitive than ART. If we are planning to treat a patient with a powerful anti-COVID-19 drug then it is prudent to confirm definitively that he in fact has COVID-19. But from a public health perspective if our goal is to slow down disease spread in the population ART is better. With ART you can pick up and isolate the most infectious cases faster and more cheaply. Some positive cases will slip through but overall we are able to make a bigger impact on disease transmission. Therefore once ART kits became available we started using them extensively and to good effect.

We implemented many other public health non-medical interventions including case isolation contact tracing quarantine SMMs and cross-border restrictions. The national vaccination programme required many public health decisions – which groups to vaccinate first how soon to administer booster shots whether and if so how to differentiate between the vaccinated and unvaccinated.

Effectively integrating these public health tools and considerations with our resilient healthcare system made all the difference in this pandemic.

Public Trust

The third and probably most critical factor in our pandemic response is trust.

We have built up a high degree of trust in our society over the years – between Singaporeans and the government and most of all in one another. This trust is a most precious resource. It is the fundamental reason why Singaporeans were able to come together during the pandemic instead of working against each other.

We all abided by burdensome SMMs. Patiently endured repeated rounds of easing and tightening. Went for vaccinations and booster jabs. Exercised personal and social responsibility. In other countries a precaution as simple and essential as wearing a mask became a heated point of contention between citizens and in fact between warring factions. Fortunately in Singapore the opposite happened.

A big part of this is the public’s trust in our healthcare system founded on three things.

One competency – Trust that our healthcare workers are professional and know their job well.

Two commitment – Trust that our healthcare workers are dedicated and selfless committed to the care treatment and well-being of their patients and put their patients first.

Three transparency – Trust that the healthcare system is open and honest with the public even when things fail to go as intended.

For example during the vaccination campaign MOH regularly reported statistics on serious adverse events. When there were errors in execution and someone received the wrong vaccine or the wrong dose we proactively investigated and explained to the public what had happened.

Some may be tempted to think that it would have been easier to keep things quiet and avoid causing unnecessary alarm with bad news. It would have been expedient and convenient but it would have been very unwise. If we kept quiet it might work once or twice. But rumours will spread people will gradually lose faith in the system and we will eventually pay a high price – the loss of public trust. We should always be upfront when we encounter problems and setbacks and address them honestly and transparently.

If we make a mistake – own up take responsibility and strive to put things right. This is not an easy thing to do. It requires courage discipline and integrity. But it is absolutely essential to strengthening public trust especially during crises when stakes are high.

These three factors: a resilient healthcare system an effective public health response and a high degree of public trust together made a big difference for us during the pandemic. But at the same time we also had some lucky breaks.

Had COVID-19 been like the Spanish flu that swept the world a century ago which was a lethal disease for young and healthy people our COVID-19 outbreak in the migrant worker dormitories would have been much worse. We were lucky that COVID-19 was not only generally a mild disease for the young and healthy but even for other patients it was less virulent than SARS though more transmissible.

And fortunately super-transmissible variants of COVID-19 like Delta and Omicron only evolved and spread a year or two later. By that time countries around the world had painfully learnt how to cope with COVID-19 and were able to limit the damage these new variants did.

Coping with Delta and Omicron was made easier by a final piece of good fortune – highly effective mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 had become available within a year. This was much faster than any other vaccine had ever been developed and produced. It was the result of sustained advances in biotechnology over decades and the collective efforts of governments international institutions pharmaceutical firms and universities. Scientists could not have done this at the time of SARS 17 years ago. Nor might they have succeeded if COVID-19 had been a different virus like HIV for which after four decades a vaccine is still elusive.

So while we count our blessings we must prepare seriously for the next pandemic lest we are not as lucky next time.

How we should go forward

What should we learn from our COVID-19 experience to better prepare for the future?

One day we will encounter Disease X. A new pathogen that is highly transmissible highly lethal and mutates easily.

With COVID-19 countries already struggled to cope and humankind paid a heavy price in suffering and death. It is entirely possible that within the next few decades another novel pathogen more lethal and infectious than COVID-19 will sweep the world within our lifetime and within your working lives. We must prepare for it early the best we can so as to be ready to mount a swift and effective response when it happens.

Beyond future pandemics we must make the most of the changes forced on us by the crisis to improve the way we do things. We cannot thoughtlessly revert to the status quo ante after this crisis. Or let valuable lessons for which we have paid dearly go to waste.

What does this mean for Singapore healthcare?

First we must keep up our high standards of medical excellence as the backbone of a strong and resilient healthcare system. Keep investing in our healthcare workers provide them the recognition and support they deserve and continue to develop their professions: work with our Institutes of Higher Learning and healthcare institutions to equip our workers with skills for the future and thus ensure that healthcare jobs remain attractive and relevant.

We must also support our healthcare workers with good medical facilities and healthcare infrastructure. We are adding 9 more polyclinics and 6 more acute and community hospitals by 2030. The overall capacity of our hospitals and laboratories should include reserves to cater to surges in demand from time to time.

SGH is an integral part of our healthcare system. The SGH Campus Master Plan now underway will redevelop SGH into a new complex combining the best in facilities and technology with future-proof capabilities so that SGH can offer best-in-class services spanning the entire care continuum from home to rehabilitative care.

At the same time we need to build up our scientific and biomedical capabilities to deepen and capitalise on the R&D expertise that we have spent the last two decades building up. We will need to collaborate internationally with researchers in many other countries because we cannot do everything ourselves and will benefit enormously from keeping in touch with progress and developments worldwide.

Secondly we must further develop our emphasis on public health. In normal times many other “popular” medical specialisations are more sought after. Yet in a pandemic as we have seen public health expertise is absolutely crucial.

We need to be able to understand how a new disease is spreading. Make sense of disease trends and devise models to assess and predict them. Evaluate alternative public health measures and devise non-medical interventions that can help bring the outbreak under control in our population. We must strengthen our skills in these areas and high-quality public health input must inform policy making.

Beyond pandemics we also need to shift our centre of gravity to focus on “health” rather than just treating the “disease”. In particular we must address the pressing needs of our ageing population and the burden of chronic diseases. That is why MOH recently announced plans for the next bound of healthcare reform Healthier SG.

Healthier SG will shift decisively from hospital-centric care to a patient-centred preventive care. Focus on healthcare outcomes starting early while the person is still healthy and tackling illness at the root before it progresses to the point of needing treatment. This will help bend the cost curve downwards and in the long run keep our population healthier and our healthcare expenditure more sustainable.

Healthier SG is clearly the right strategic direction to take but implementing it will be a huge challenge. It will demand considerable commitment and effort from many stakeholders – not just from the Government. It calls for a mindset shift and a fundamental reorientation of how the whole system works.

We will encourage everyone to enrol with one regular family physician as the first line of care rather than to hop from doctor to doctor. And work with your family physician on preventive health plans including regular screening and addressing risk factors instead of seeing the GP for treatment only when you fall sick.

Family physicians will in turn work with community partners like the People’s Association and Sports SG to fulfil their patients’ ‘social prescriptions’ such as better diet and more physical exercise.

Our three health clusters together with MOH will coordinate all these efforts. MOH will be publishing a White Paper this year to discuss the concepts with

stakeholders and come up with an implementable plan.

Which brings me to my third point – trust. I spoke earlier on the importance of the public trusting the healthcare system in a crisis. We must continue to nurture this trust during normal times. Always maintain high standards of competency commitment and transparency in our healthcare system. Instil this trust in our people so that in the next crisis we can again draw upon the same deep reservoir of trust to see us through. And of course even when the going gets tough and especially when the going gets tough we must continue to live by these cardinal values and continue to strengthen the trust that we depend on to stay together and pull through.

I have been emphasising the importance of trust to good social outcomes of all kinds for some time now. It is not just trust in the healthcare system but general trust levels in our society in our institutions and in one another that greatly influence health outcomes.

You do not have to take my word for it. There is now a peer-reviewed academic study published in The Lancet which confirms this. The study found that higher levels of trust in the government and among the population were associated with greater compliance with COVID-related restrictions and higher vaccination rates. In fact by this measure trust levels mattered much more even than the quality of healthcare and access to universal healthcare.

I do not believe this means a good healthcare system makes no difference – it is absolutely necessary. But it does show how crucial trust levels in the society are to public health and healthcare outcomes.

Singapore is fortunate to be a high-trust society. The strong public trust that we have built up over the decades between Singaporeans and the Government and in one another sets us apart from many other countries. Trust that the Government has the best interest of Singapore and Singaporeans at heart; trust that the Government is competent and will make the right decisions on behalf of Singaporeans; trust that every citizen will play his or her part not just for themselves and their loved ones but also for others out of respect and regard for fellow citizens and concern for our collective well being.

Let us long maintain this happy state of affairs not just to achieve good healthcare outcomes but to deliver good governance progress and prosperity to our people.

Conclusion

Tonight I have spoken about where we stand how we got here; and how we should go forward.

COVID-19 was a baptism of fire for our nation. But that is how we have written every chapter of our Singapore story. We are a nation born and forged in crises. We have weathered many storms to get to where we are today.

Looking ahead Singapore must continue to grow in maturity and resilience learning from our experiences and those of others and so must our healthcare system.

I trust that SGH will continue to contribute your talent and leadership to this endeavour and in so doing help to achieve good healthcare outcomes for Singapore for many years to come.

EDITOR’S NOTE: When it’s not investing in campaigns to stall federal climate action (2009) or spreading falsehoods about the dangers of climate change (2022) Valero Energy Corporation can often be found greenwashing via charitable giving about town. This includes maddeningly for a certified planet killer sponsoring San Antonio’s Monarch Butterfly and Pollinator Festival (2021). ¶ While the Exxons of the world will likely get top billing in The Power of Big Oil docuseries we should not neglect our own hometown Top Tier climate villain which maintains a benign celebrity status via the cover provided by too many supposedly do-gooding (but always a little light in the wallet) NGOs—not to mention the routine filling of campaign coffers for local electeds. But at what point does the devastation wrought by fossil fuel companies on display in The Power of Big Oil finally shift our local relationship with the agents of our collective demise? As we work to decarbonize our communities and households we must also be thinking about how Valero could be brought to understand and come to pay for the violence it has inflicted on our communities and world. — Greg Harman

Frontline’s three-part series calls on a parade of former oil company scientists lobbyists and public relations strategists to show how Big Oil all-but-ensured global environmental catastrophe.

Chris McGreal

There is a moment in the revelatory PBS Frontline docuseries The Power of Big Oil about the industry’s long campaign to stall action on the climate crisis in which the former Republican senator Chuck Hagel reflects on his part in killing US ratification of the Kyoto climate treaty.

In 1997 Hagel joined with the Democratic senator Robert Byrd to promote a resolution opposing the international agreement to limit greenhouse gases on the grounds that it was unfair to Americans. The measure passed the US Senate without a single dissenting vote after a vigorous campaign by big oil to mischaracterize the Kyoto protocol as a threat to jobs and the economy while falsely claiming that China and India could go on polluting to their heart’s content.

The resolution effectively put a block on US ratification of any climate treaty ever since.

A quarter of a century later Hagel acknowledges that the vote was wrong and blames the oil industry for malignly claiming the science of climate change was not proved when companies such as Exxon and Shell already knew otherwise from their own research.

“What we now know about some of these large oil companies’ positions … they lied. And yes I was misled. Others were misled when they had evidence in their own institutions that countered what they were saying publicly. I mean they lied” he told the documentary-makers.

Asked if the planet would be better placed to confront the climate crisis if the oil industry had been honest about the damage fossil fuels were causing Hagel did not flinch.

“Oh absolutely. It would have created a whole different climate a whole different political environment. I think it would have changed everything” he said.

But Hagel apparently has not asked why he was so willing to be swayed by big oil when there was no shortage of scientists including prominent NASA researchers telling him and other political leaders the truth.

The Power of Big Oil has the answer. The documentary’s makers have dug out a parade of former oil company scientists lobbyists and public relations strategists who lay bare how the US’s biggest petroleum firm Exxon and then the broader petroleum industry moved from attempting to understand the causes of a global heating to a concerted campaign to hide the making of an environmental catastrophe.

Over three episodes—called Denial Doubt Delay—the series charts corporate manipulation of science public opinion and politicians that mirrors conduct by other industries from Big Tobacco to the pharmaceutical companies responsible for America’s opioid epidemic.

Some of those interviewed shamefacedly admit their part in the decades-long campaign to hide the evidence of climate change discredit scientists and delay action that threatened Big Oil’s profits. Others almost boast about how easy it was to dupe the American public and politicians with consequences not just for the US but every country on the planet.

What emerges is a picture of a political system so compromised by corporate money that even when it finally appears that truth will win out reality is swiftly smothered.

Former senator Timothy Wirth tells the documentary-makers how in 1988 he organized historic hearings at which a distinguished NASA scientist James Hansen testified that greenhouse gases were changing the climate.

“That was a kind of a magic sentence” Wirth said. “This was not environmental groups. This was not some green cabal. This was probably the lead climate scientist in the federal government making this statement.”

The New York Times reported the testimony on its front page. It seemed a turning point to Wirth and Hansen. Now the country would have to face reality. Instead the hearing served as a warning to the oil industry to intensify its campaign of denialism.

“There have been quite a few moments where it has felt to people interested in climate change that it’s all about to change” said Dan Edge the Power of Big Oil series producer to the Guardian.

“There’s a moment in episode one where Senator Wirth laughs and says ‘I really felt we were getting somewhere. It was so exciting.’ That was 30 years ago. Then you hear some of the Obama speeches and the genuine hope that something might be done about climate change in 2009. It was palpable and it was destroyed so quickly.”

As the documentary-makers trace the evolution of the fossil fuel industry’s success at staving off climate legislation it becomes clear that the oil firms were swift to adapt their strategies to changing circumstances.

Jane McMullen the director of the first episode in the series said the research revealed how as it became harder to deny the overwhelming evidence of global heating the industry shifted gears.

“They realized that they were losing the science arguments especially after the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report came out in ’95 that said there is a discernible human influence. So they turned to economics” she said.

Frontline shows that key to that shift was a little known company in the 1990’s Koch Industries which specialized in refining and distributing some of the heaviest and dirtiest oil. The firm was run by brothers Charles and David Koch. Charles also founded a libertarian think tank the Cato Institute in Washington.

The Kochs saw a threat to their business from the Clinton administration’s plan for a carbon tax. They mobilized Cato and a Koch-funded front group masquerading as a grass roots organization Citizens for a Sound Economy to oppose it. The Kochs drew in lobby organizations such as the American Petroleum Institute and the Global Climate Coalition a group of businesses that opposed climate science.

“We would be meeting in various locales in Washington with over 100 people in the room. It was a real war room situation” Jerry Taylor director of Natural Resources Studies at the Cato Institute told the program.

Jeff Nesbit communications director for Citizens for a Sound Economy told the documentary makers that the decision was made to target a senator from Oklahoma David Boren who chaired the committee handling Clinton’s budget and therefore the carbon tax.

“They basically said: if we can get David Boren to flip we win. So they said we’re gonna do whatever it takes” he said.

The industry ran adverts claiming that the tax would cost the average Oklahoma household $500 a year and mobilized supporters to call Boren to complain that people would effectively be paying a carbon tax every time they took a shower or drove their car.

Years later Nesbit admitted that the supposed public backlash was an illusion manufactured by the Koch brothers.

“Maybe there were a handful of folks who thought oh gosh I should call my senator and register my complaint. But they had no such grassroots army. It was funded and fueled by the corporate interests” he said.

Still it worked. Boren caved and killed the carbon tax. The oil industry took note.

“He folded right away” Nesbit said. “It’s like wow this can really work. We can pick our targets strategically and win even when we’re not in political power.”

McMullen said research for the documentary showed that strategy playing out repeatedly over the years.

“It’s become almost accepted fact that tackling climate change will cost the economy whereas look at the cost of damages were faced with today” she said.

The result she said is that one administration after another from Clinton onwards found reasons to delay action because they did not want to face accusations of making Americans poorer.

“That’s been a problem all the way through this 40-year history. There’s this very strong impetus for politicians to say we’ll just wait we don’t need to do it now. But obviously there isn’t time. And the longer you put it off the steeper the hill that you have to climb to deal with it” she said.

There was a point in my investment life when I would sell any stock that cut its dividend without question or a deep look at why the dividend was trimmed. I wound up selling some great companies at exactly the worst time. Ventas (VTR 0.17%) cut its dividend in 2020 and I've held onto it. Not only has the stock bounced back strongly but I expect good things in the future because of the underlying fundamentals of the business.

A terrible year

I think most people would agree that 2020 was just a miserable year. It was particularly bad for real estate investment trusts (REITs) that owned senior housing like Ventas. Move-outs were elevated move-ins were weak and occupancy fell sharply throughout the sector. For Ventas which has a sizable senior housing operating portfolio (SHOP) it was even worse. Essentially it both owns and runs these assets so their performance flows through to the top and bottom lines.

Ventas' SHOP assets were the main reason it ended up cutting the dividend from $0.7925 per share per quarter to $0.45. The thing is if you understand the business that dividend cut makes complete sense. And more importantly the cut was really driven by a global pandemic which is an outlying event that wouldn't be expected to recur at regular intervals. In other words Ventas had to make a tough call at a tough time. As an investor I chose to sit tight and keep holding.

That turned out to be a good move. At the worst of the 2020 bear market Ventas was off by around 60%. When it cut the dividend it was still lower by roughly 40% or so. And today the stock is a couple of percentage points above where it started out in 2020. In other words around two years on the shares have fully recovered. Not selling looks like it was a good call.

It's the fundamentals

The reason Ventas has muddled through in relative stride comes back to the basics of its business. For starters management has long highlighted diversification. Senior housing is important making up roughly 47% of net operating income. That's a big chunk of the business for sure. But the rest is spread over medical offices (22% of net operating income) medical research properties (10%) health systems (8%) and other assets.

Even in the senior housing portfolio there's some diversification with 31% of net operating income in the SHOP portfolio and 16% in net lease assets where the tenant is responsible for most of the operating costs of the properties and has to pay rent even if it's struggling. Ventas is one of the most diversified healthcare REITs you can own. Notably in 2020 medical office and medical research both performed relatively well helping to offset the hit from the senior housing segment of Ventas' portfolio.

Furthermore the demand for senior housing is likely to increase materially in the years ahead. That's because the baby boomer generation is cresting into retirement. And as it continues to age medical needs across the group will increase pushing up demand for the care that is provided in the types of properties Ventas owns. As that happens the current weakness in the SHOP portfolio will shift to a net positive because improved performance at these assets will flow through to the REIT's top and bottom lines. Basically Ventas is leveraged to an industry upturn that is demographically speaking almost guaranteed to take place.

Ventas is also an investment grade rated REIT. So despite the need for a dividend cut it has the balance sheet strength to muddle through this rough patch. In fact it actually bought a competitor to increase the size of its SHOP business. So it acted opportunistically to ensure it exited the downturn in better shape. While the pandemic backdrop here is unusual actively managing the portfolio is typical for Ventas. It's the type of thing long-term investors should appreciate.

Too many positives

When it comes to investing I am no longer trying to hit home runs. I'm happy with consistent singles with a few doubles or triples along the way. Ventas' dividend cut would have made me run for the hills when I was younger and in the process I would have locked in a big loss. Today I'm more concerned with owning good businesses that will thrive over the long term. Yes the pandemic has been hard on Ventas but its diversification and financial strength suggest it will get through this period in relatively good shape. And its active portfolio management tells me that it will come out in better shape than when it entered.

All that's needed now is an upturn in the senior housing space. When that eventually transpires as the aging demographic trends suggest it will the dividend will probably start growing again. A little patience was really all that was needed here because of Ventas' strong underlying business. And that's exactly why I have no plans to sell this industry-leading healthcare REIT anytime soon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVudHJlcHJlbmV1ci5jb20vZXMvbWFya2V0aW5nL2xlY2Npb25lcy1kZS1wZXJzb25hbGl6YWNpb24tbG8tcXVlLW5ldGZsaXgtcHVlZGUvNDI1NTY20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lecciones de personalización: lo que Netflix puede enseñar a los equipos de marketing y ventas,"Este artículo fue traducido de nuestra edición en inglés.

Las opiniones expresadas por los colaboradores de Entrepreneur son personales

Netflix es el estándar de la industria cuando se trata de personalizar y captar la atención de la audiencia. Durante años ha cautivado a los espectadores y los ha mantenido pegados a sus dispositivos entregando contenido hora tras hora mediante la recopilación de grandes cantidades de datos de los usuarios y la creación de recorridos personalizados para brindar contenido relevante. Nos hemos acostumbrado y esperamos este nivel de personalización y capacidad de respuesta en la vida de nuestros consumidores. Pero ¿qué pasa en el panorama de compra y venta B2B?

Los clientes B2B de hoy exigen un nuevo nivel de personalización y conocimiento digital. A medida que crece la demanda de experiencias de compra personalizadas  las empresas buscan formas de encontrarse con los compradores dondequiera que estén. Buscan respuestas en el rey de la personalización.

Recopile datos de forma continua y mida el rendimiento

La primera lección que enseña Netflix es que más datos siempre es mejor. El modelo de Netflix no podría existir sin una gran cantidad de datos de espectadores que incluyen todo desde información demográfica básica hasta cuánto tiempo los espectadores se desplazan por la página principal. ¿Por qué necesitan tanta información? Porque cuanta más información tengas más preguntas podrás responder.

Netflix no solo se sienta en sus datos tampoco. Lo usan para informar cada decisión posible desde predecir lo que los espectadores quieren ver a continuación hasta informar su creación de contenido. La tasa de éxito del contenido original de Netflix es del 93% lo que significa que se predijo que éxitos récord como Stranger Things y Bridgerton tendrían éxito incluso antes de llegar a la pantalla.

Netflix también busca constantemente nuevas y mejores formas de medir la audiencia y el éxito. Antes de 2019 Netflix contaba el 70 % de finalización de un episodio o una película como vista su principal métrica de participación. En diciembre de 2019 cambió una vista a cualquier tiempo de visualización de dos minutos o más con el razonamiento de que esta medida representaría ojos únicos en una pieza de contenido. Luego en octubre de 2021 la métrica cambió nuevamente pasando de la cantidad de vistas a los minutos vistos.

Ahora examinemos la importancia de los datos y la medición desde una perspectiva de ventas y marketing B2B . Para tener impacto los equipos de marketing y ventas deben recopilar la mayor cantidad de datos posible incluido el tráfico web las estadísticas de marketing por correo electrónico y los datos de compras anteriores. Estos datos ayudarán a crear perfiles de clientes integrales y completos que son fundamentales para comprender y llegar a los clientes potenciales.

Una vez que tenga los datos organícelos y preséntelos de una manera que los haga utilizables. La creación de una única fuente de verdad para sus datos así como paneles integrales que puedan brindar vistas generales amplias y granulares será clave para obtener información sin importar qué departamento los esté utilizando. Los paneles brindan una visión holística de las actividades de marketing y ventas para determinar las tácticas que impulsan los ingresos lo que ayuda a los equipos a tomar decisiones comerciales basadas en datos.

Por último establezca KPI claros y mida el rendimiento observando sus datos y métricas clave. No se conforme con su estrategia de datos. Emplee estrategias de enriquecimiento y limpieza para mantener los datos optimizados y procesables y esté siempre atento a formas de mejorar y medir mejor el éxito.

La personalización es primordial

Netflix construyó su marca sobre la personalización. Cada uno de sus 216 millones de usuarios tiene una experiencia de página de inicio única adaptada a sus gustos personales. Son tan buenos para las recomendaciones personalizadas que generan el 80 % de la actividad de sus espectadores .

Una parte crucial de la experiencia de personalización de Netflix es que entienden que a diferentes personas les puede gustar el mismo contenido por diferentes razones. Por ejemplo a algunas personas les gustan las películas de superhéroes a otras les gusta mirar a Chris Hemsworth y ambos grupos ven Los Vengadores . Puedes ver esta práctica en funcionamiento cuando miras el arte y los tráileres del contenido original de Netflix.

Para su primera gran pieza de contenido original House of Cards  Netflix grabó 10 tráilers diferentes  cada uno para un tipo diferente de audiencia. Adoptan el mismo enfoque con el diseño de su programa mostrando una imagen diferente según sus preferencias de contenido. Si a un usuario le gusta un actor específico es más probable que vea una tarjeta de título con su imagen mientras que un usuario al que le gusta la acción puede ver una imagen fija de una explosión.

Desde un punto de vista B2B la personalización es igualmente crítica. Las personas que compran son muy similares a los perfiles de visualización cada uno con sus propios puntos débiles y razones para comprar. Las empresas a menudo subestiman el esfuerzo y la cantidad de tácticas de personalización que necesitan para llegar a los clientes donde están hoy pero es fundamental.

La personalización debe usarse para alinear el marketing entre personas y etapas del viaje del cliente . Quizás más importante en el entorno de COVID-19 la personalización garantiza que los mensajes atraviesen todos los demás ruidos con los que se bombardea a los consumidores. Los consumidores incluidos los responsables de la toma de decisiones B2B pasan más tiempo que nunca en las redes sociales y el correo electrónico por lo que la personalización profunda es la clave para llegar a los clientes donde están con experiencias impactantes y atractivas.

Tácticamente las organizaciones pueden personalizar el contenido con páginas de inicio únicas o encabezados de correo electrónico para posicionar los mensajes centrales en torno a diferentes perspectivas o probar la venta de conserjería. Usando los datos recopilados y los compradores equipe las ventas con varias piezas de contenido que se considerarían relevantes para el cliente luego presente estas opciones una vez que las ventas se introduzcan en el ciclo de compra. Las organizaciones pueden fomentar la confianza a través de un enfoque de ventas asistido digitalmente que personaliza todas las interacciones y se basa en conversaciones anteriores.

Bingeing de contenido y su lugar en B2B

Netflix tiene la costumbre de mantener a los espectadores en sus pantallas durante horas lo que ahora llamamos observación compulsiva . Hicieron crecer esta práctica al capitalizar el deseo de la audiencia de querer más de un programa inmediatamente después de consumirlo un concepto que no ofrecían los servicios de cable en ese momento. Al hacer esto pudieron maximizar la participación mental y hacer que sus espectadores regresaran por más.

A través de funciones como la reproducción automática el próximo episodio de una serie se inicia inmediatamente después del primero lo que permite a los usuarios continuar sin navegar por el menú. Cuando termina una serie o película ahí está Netflix con otra recomendación personalizada. Incluso generan categorías completas basadas en reproducciones anteriores extrayendo programas con temas actores o géneros similares.

Los atracones de contenido también desempeñan un papel específico en el panorama B2B al cumplir con las expectativas de los compradores y hacer recomendaciones sobre qué leer a continuación. Armados con una gran cantidad de contenido los especialistas en marketing B2B pueden maximizar la participación mental y generar confianza con los prospectos que buscan aprender e investigar. Hay algunas maneras de utilizar este concepto para su ventaja en un entorno empresarial.

En primer lugar cree múltiples recorridos de clientes y rutas de recomendación basadas en diferentes personajes de compradores . Al apoyarse en los datos y mantener la personalización en primer lugar puede aprovechar la atención total de un cliente potencial para mantenerlo comprometido por más tiempo. Cuando finalice una pieza de contenido coloque la sugerencia de otra pieza relacionada al final.

Luego use CTA como puertas de enlace de contenido. Una llamada a la acción convincente no debe ser el final de una pieza de contenido sino la apertura de un viaje de atracones de contenido que mantiene a los prospectos comprometidos atraídos y los lleva más profundo en el embudo de ventas. Proporcionar una pieza de información personal es una señal explícita de interés. Una vez que un prospecto haya enviado datos dale otra recomendación de contenido. Los complementos de software o sitios web también pueden ayudar a crear recomendaciones de contenido automatizadas.

Conocer y comprender profundamente a los clientes siempre ha sido parte de un negocio exitoso pero ahora lo estamos haciendo a gran escala. Al recopilar datos de usuarios y descomponerlos en perfiles de usuario completos puede aprovechar sus productos y servicios existentes para crear un viaje que responda a sus necesidades únicas. Al aplicar estas prácticas de personalización que Netflix ejecuta tan bien las organizaciones pueden ver clientes potenciales más fuertes y calificados y en última instancia generar ingresos en una era digital.

Para conseguir hacerse más hueco a nivel interno se ha creado el grupo operativo Cavale cuyo fin es ""crear un mercado nacional"" que permita al ganadero poder suministrar carne de potro a nivel local según señala a Efeagro el técnico de proyectos de la Asociación de Investigación de Industrias de la Carne de Asturias (Asincar) Sergio Serrano.

Asincar es la que coordina este grupo operativo que arrancó en 2018 con la identificación de problemáticas del sector para luego buscar soluciones innovadoras en el equino.

En una primera etapa se determinará la curva de crecimiento poblacional de la raza hispano-bretón de la montaña asturiana y la de la raza marismeña localizada en el entorno de Doñana según explica.

Se harán diferentes pesadas y mediciones para determinar cuál es el mejor momento para la venta y en su caso el sacrificio del animal una información valiosa para el ganadero.

Un paso esencial eso sí es que pasen un par de meses por el cebadero para la finalización de su engorde antes del sacrificio detalla.

Otro de los proyectos del grupo es poner en marcha un sistema de clasificación de las distintas categorías de canales como las hay para el vacuno que sirvan también para conformar los precios de mercado en función de la calidad.

Serrano pone en valor los potros para aprovechamiento cárnico que hay en la cordillera cantábrica y en los Pirineos porque su sistema de producción es en extensivo lo que unido a un entorno natural único facilita la obtención de esas carnes de calidad.

Se asocia a animal de compañía

El problema para impulsar su consumo nacional es que el caballo entronca y forma parte de la cultura española y eso hace que el potro a su vez se vea como un animal de compañía.

A ello se suma el hecho de que las generaciones que vivieron los años de posguerra en España desarrollaron un rechazo a la carne equina porque se vieron obligados a comer carne de caballo viejo endurecida: ""Fue un recurso más de alimentación -en esa época- y ahora la relacionan con la carne de potro"".

Otras dificultades para consumirla son la falta de hábito o el desconocimiento de que esta carne se puede encontrar en los puntos de venta.

No obstante sí hay algo de demanda interna y se localiza principalmente en Cataluña y en Comunidad Valenciana.

También tienen el reto de calar en la sociedad el mensaje de que es una carne con una propiedades ""tan buenas como otras"".

De hecho incide en que a nivel organoléptico no están encontrando diferencias ""significativas con otras carnes como la de ternera"".

La principal especificidad es su riqueza en omega 3 respecto a otras carnes rojas reseña.

Ganaderos en Asturias

De la mano de Asincar está trabajando la Asociación de Criadores de Caballos de la Montaña Asturiana (Acgema) los dos pilares esenciales de este grupo operativo.

El presidente de Acgema Adrián Lagar destaca a Efeagro que es ""importante"" la labor de divulgación para animar el consumo interno.

También valora las herramientas que quiere facilitar el grupo operativo para ayudar a los ganaderos de equino en su toma de decisiones a la hora de la venta del animal o para monitorear el crecimiento y la evolución de los pesos del animal.

Detalla que el criador de potros responde normalmente al perfil de un ganadero que también gestiona cabañas de vacuno o en todo caso complementa con otras actividades no ganaderas.

A pesar de ese punto débil del consumo interno y de que no reciben ""ningún tipo de ayudas"" Lagar reconoce que los precios en el equino ""se han triplicado en los últimos seis años"" por esa ""importante"" demanda internacional.

SEATTLE — The union representing Verizon Wireless employees in western Washington claims a Seattle employee was illegally fired after attending a union event in Lynnwood and after joining with his coworkers to organize a union.

The Communications Workers of America (CWA) which has more than 700000 members nationwide filed an ""unfair labor practice"" charge with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) against Verizon Wireless.

CWA said the employee Jesse Mason was fired just days after he attended the union vote count for Everett and Lynnwood Verizon workers on Friday April 15.

Mason and his colleagues at the Seattle Northgate and Aurora Village Verizon stores recently went public with their own union campaign.

The union said Mason ""had a stellar employment record with no previous disciplinary action"" while working at Verizon.

“Jesse’s firing just days after dozens of other workers at two nearby Verizon Wireless retail stores successfully formed a union is a clear tactic meant to intimidate other workers” said CWA Secretary-Treasurer Sara Steffens.

Employees at the Everett and Lynnwood Verizon Wireless stores are the first to unionize in the country outside of New York.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcGVjb2R0aW1lcy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA0LzI0L2NhcGUtY29kLXJ1cmFsLWludGVybmV0LWJyb2FkYmFuZC1ib3N0b24tdmVyaXpvbi1jb21jYXN0Lzc0MDkxODkwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cape Cod's 'rural' internet inferior say fiber optic advocates,"Advocates pushing for better internet service on the Cape believe the future lies in building their own local fiber optic networks independent of the private providers.

Part of their belief is Boston and other densely populated areas have better service.

Courtney Bird president and founder of FalmouthNet a nonprofit organization which wants to create a municipally operated fiber optic network says the reason Boston and has better internet than the Cape is a simple matter of economics.

Denser areas mean higher profitability he said which is why private companies like Comcast are more likely to invest in upgraded infrastructure in those areas rather than rural areas like the Cape. Areas in and around Boston carry more fiber in their networks than the Cape he said. Bird and others believe that creates higher quality internet.

“You don’t fault Comcast they need to return a profit” he said.

The lack of incentive to upgrade infrastructure leads to the Cape being underserved he said. One of the biggest problems is that telecom companies have been able to narrow the minimum definition of high-speed internet he said. The FCC minimum requirement for broadband internet is 25 megabits per second download and 3 megabits per second upload speeds according to Verizon.com.

In fact Verizon FiOS won’t serve the Cape because of a lack of economic incentive said Bird.

FalmouthNet board member David Isenberg however says the lack of incentive to invest in the Cape’s internet infrastructure has less to do with density and more to do with return on investment.

New York City he said sued Verizon FiOS because of Verizon’s decision to not wire some households in low-income neighborhoods.

The lack of competition on the Cape also leads to a less than robust internet service said Steven Johnston CEO of OpenCape a nonprofit seeking to spread fiber optic networks throughout the Cape and Islands and southeastern Massachusetts.

More:Joe Biden wants to provide millions of Americans with high-speed internet. It won’t be easy.

Cities have multiple internet providers competing which leads to better pricing for customers and a higher incentive to upgrade infrastructure he said. Isenberg echoed that sentiment saying because Comcast has a de facto monopoly on the Cape it isn't motivated to improve the network.

Through a spokesman Comcast said there's no difference between the infrastructure on the Cape and in Boston.

Much of the evidence that the fiber advocates lean on is a feasibility study for Falmouth conducted by CCG Consulting in 2020 which found that broadband customers in Falmouth experience outages and inconsistent speeds.

According to the study Comcast advertises basic download speeds in Falmouth as “up to 150 megabits per second” however 43% of Comcast customers had download speeds under 100 megabits per second and 23% had download speeds under 50 megabits per second. The study states that finding was surprising since most Comcast customers studied in other markets have speeds equal to or greater than the speeds they are subscribing to.

More:Study says fiber optic network feasible for Falmouth

The study also said 78% of Comcast customers in Falmouth had upload speeds under 15 megabits per second though Comcast reported to the FCC that it could achieve upload speeds of 25 megabits per second in Falmouth.

“The broadband in Falmouth is not nearly as good as the broadband in nearby urban centers and the surrounding suburbs” reads the study.

The study was done specifically for Falmouth but contends the broadband system in Falmouth is like the rest of the Cape.

“One thing we learned is the entire Cape has nearly the identical broadband situation. Verizon has not built any FiOS on the Cape and all of the communities are served by a combination of Comcast along with Verizon DSL” reads the study.

Should internet providers be treated like a public utility?

Truro a significantly rural community with a year-round population of around 2000 has had its struggles with internet connectivity. Select Board chair Robert Weinstein said up until two years ago many residents depended on satellite service which he said was horrible. After nearly a decade of battling with Comcast Truro was able to get adequate wiring he said.

Weinstein doesn’t blame Comcast but the federal government.

The federal government he said allows internet companies to be treated like entertainment companies rather than a public utility which means they aren’t obligated to wire every town.

“In terms of internet we’re a Third World nation” he said.

Truro resident Curtis Hartman said at his old home on Long Nook Road he couldn’t get wired internet service. He has moved to a different part of town served by Comcast where he said service is ""adequate.""

Hartman said there have always been parts of the town that Comcast has refused to wire. However because internet is mandatory today he believes that internet companies should operate like a regulated utility rather than merely a business.

Comcast perspective

Marc Goodman a director of public relations for Comcast said there’s no difference between the broadband systems for Comcast customers on the Cape and those in Boston. He said Comcast has invested billions in its network and that the network design in Falmouth and in Boston is identical.

Comcast also has invested thousands of miles of fiber in its network including on Cape Cod he said and is working to offer customers multi-gigabit speeds on its existing infrastructure.

“Across Massachusetts and Cape Cod Comcast has invested billions in our smart fast and reliable fiber-rich network to deliver residential broadband speeds up to 1.2 gigabits per second and business speeds up to 100 gigabits per second for our customers. We will continue to invest in our network our technology and our local workforce to offer residents and businesses throughout the Cape unbeatable internet with the best connection advanced cybersecurity faster speeds and the best technology available” said Goodman.

Additionally Goodman hopes that Xfinity customers on the Cape who have issues deal directly with Xfinity employees such as by going to their stores in Falmouth or Hyannis or talking to customer service by phone or online.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vbHlubndvb2R0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNC8yMy92ZXJpem9uLXVuaW9uaXplLTIyMDQyMy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Verizon Wireless allegedly fires Northgate employee for attempting to unionize,"SEATTLE Wash. April 23 2022 – Just days after Verizon Wireless employees from the Everett-Lynnwood locations voted to form a union Verizon terminated an employee from its Seattle Northgate and Aurora Village locations who supported his coworkers’ efforts to unionize. Believing the termination to be retaliatory The Communications Workers of America (CWA) filed an Unfair Labor Practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) against Verizon Wireless yesterday.

The NLRB is an independent Federal agency that was created by Congress in 1935 to “assure fair labor practices and workplace democracy nationwide.” The agency is currently in federal court in an attempt to get three Starbucks workers in Arizona who were attempting to form a union back on the job – two were fired and one is on unpaid leave.

The CWA filed the charge on behalf of Jesse Mason who worked as a Specialist with Verizon for eight months. The CWA’s press release asserts that Mason was illegally fired by Verizon in retaliation for Mason’s union support.

Mason was in attendance when his fellow Verizon workers in Everett voted to unionize on April 15 where he posed in photos alongside the Everett-Lynnwood employees that were published in the Lynnwood Times and another county paper. Mason was fired when he came in for his next shift following the publications.

Additionally Mason and his team in Seattle recently went public with their campaign to unionize. However they’ve yet to officially file to form a union because the employees fear retaliation according to Mason. “And Verizon is trying to confirm that fear by firing me” he says. “I’m going to prove to them that retaliation doesn’t work.”

“Mason had a stellar employment record with no previous disciplinary action while working as a Specialist at Verizon Wireless’ Seattle Northgate and Aurora Village retail store locations just miles from two nearby Verizon Wireless retail stores in Lynnwood and Everett WA where workers successfully voted to form a union last week” the CWA press release states.

“Verizon management targeted me for organizing a union. It’s illegal to do that” says Mason “and I’m confident that I will eventually be reinstated. I’m not scared because I know that there’s a growing movement of retail workers — from Verizon Wireless to Starbucks to Apple — who are joining together to demand a voice on the job. They can fire me but they can’t fire all of us and we won’t stop fighting until every worker who wants a union has a union.”

As was the case with the Everett-Lynnwood employees after they went public with their efforts to unionize Verizon swifty sent its union-busting team to the Northgate and Aurora Village stores. According to Mason the team’s arrival marked a dramatic shift in tone at his store.

“The tone that managers took with me changed immediately when the union-busters came to the store. Before they were accelerating me being a key holder and asking whether I wanted a management role or some different promotion” Mason recalls. “Then my firing was the next working day after I was at the tailgate vote count party.”

Mason is confident his termination was a retaliatory move. “They knew I was strongly in favor of unionizing” he says.

Mason had no disciplinary actions on file prior to his termination and believes Verizon failed to follow standard protocol when they let him go. “No write-up; nothing” he says “straight to termination.”

When he was terminated Mason says he was accused of “a really minor procedural violation—something I didn’t even do.” However due to the current NLRB case Mason opted to not disclose anything more.

This isn’t the first time Verizon has been accused of illegally terminating one of its employees in the Seattle area and his story is similar to another now-former Verizon employee from the Everett-Lynnwood locations Brandon Carter.

Carter had no previous disciplinary record on file and was fired the week after he and his coworkers announced they were unionizing. “I was called in and they just laid a whole bunch of stuff at me and then just let me go” Carter said.

“Normally Verizon’s a process where there’s a documented council; first write-up second write-up you know third write-up final written. All that was just kind of skipped” Carter continued. “And then you know I came into work and then I’m gone.”

Mason has long-time been a proponent of unions. “If I had the best workplace or the worst I’d want it unionized because it’s the only way working-class people can help ourselves.”

The Lynnwood Times has reached out to Verizon for comment and will share updates to this story should they respond.

UPDATE: In response to the Lynnwood Times a Verizon spokesperson issued the following statement on April 25:

Mr. Mason’s termination had absolutely nothing to do with union activity. While we’re not going to publicly discuss the reasons for the dismissal we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these baseless accusations.



We respect the rights of our employees to choose whether or not they wish to be union-represented and we routinely provide facts to our employees so that they can make an informed decision for themselves.

In an exclusive interaction Verizon Business Chief Revenue Officer Sowmyanarayan Sampath told BusinessLine “As 5G proliferates Indian system integrators and Indian IT companies all want to build their value stack and develop their 5G practices.” The American communications giant is in talks with Indian system integrators to build products and applications using Verizon’s mobile edge computing platform.

Verizon’s mobile edge platform called the 5G Edge allows for cloud computing facilities or IT services to come at the edge of any mobile network. Typically when enterprises use facilities such as cloud computing the cloud servers could be in a different city or in a different State entirely. By bringing these applications to the edge of a network customers or enterprises can carry out computation locally reducing latency and increasing throughput and bandwidth significantly. Real-life use cases for the same can be autonomous cars usage in oil and manufacturing operations manufacturing data analytics and computation in hospitals etc.

“The magic of 5G is that it is mostly a B2B technology and it will require a lot of new products. So we have started partnering with system integrators in India to say heyyou build a practice on Verizon’s 5G mobile edge computing and you bring and put application on top of our base infrastructure” Sampath said. Sampath estimates the total addressable market of 5G applications to be around $20-30 billion dollars.

Sampath said “It is still very early days Indian system integrators have gotten into this before other players there is lot of opportunity and they have a lot of choices we want us to be the primary partner for them.”

Vectors of growth

Sampath describes Verizon Business to have three vectors of growth in the Asia Pacific which are- cyber security networks as a service and private 5G networks. In October 2020 Verizon launched a private 5G platform for enterprises located in Europe and the Asia Pacific region partnering with Finnish Network Giant Nokia to provide private 5G wireless networks solutions for enterprises. Nokia is going to be the sole partner for Verizon Business for private 5G networks in India

“Our private 5G is delivered in partnership with Nokia and the offering will enable Indian businesses to deploy a private industrial-grade dedicated 5G network capability within their premises. We will work with Indian MNCs on deploying private 5G. We won’t be involved in any spectrum acquisition” Sampath said.

Reacting to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s diktat on private networks Sampath said “Our overall thesis on the spectrum is that we want more spectrum to be allocated for services and we don’t want to lock down the spectrum in a few hands. That is our policy stand globally on how it goes.”

Creating the sort of long complicated passwords that best deter cyber-thieves — especially for dozens of different online accounts — can be tedious. But it's necessary considering the record number of data breaches in the U.S. last year. That's why it's so enticing to dream about a future where nobody has to constantly update and change online passwords to stay ahead of hackers and keep data secure. Here's the good news: Some of the biggest names in tech are already saying that the dream of a password-less internet is close to becoming a reality. Apple Google and Microsoft are among those trying to pave the way. In that hopeful future you'd still have to prove your identity to access your accounts and information. But at least you wouldn't have to remember endless strings of unique eight-character (or longer) passwords right? Well maybe not quite. The answer is still a little complicated.

What password-less options already exist?

In theory removing passwords from your cybersecurity equation nixes what former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff has called ""by far the weakest link in cybersecurity."" More than 80% of data breaches are a result of weak or compromised passwords according to Verizon. In September Microsoft announced that its users could go fully password-less to access services like Windows Xbox and Microsoft 365. Microsoft users can instead use options like the Windows Hello or Microsoft Authenticator apps which use fingerprints or facial recognition tools to help you log in securely. Microsoft also allows users to log in using a verification code sent to your phone or email or with physical a security key — resembling a USB drive — that plugs into your computer and features an encryption unique to you and your device. Joy Chik Microsoft's vice president of identity wrote in a September company blog post that tools like two-factor authentication have helped improve users' account security in recent years — but hackers can still find ways around those extra measures. ""As long as passwords are still part of the equation they're vulnerable"" she wrote.

Similarly Google sells physical security keys and its Smart Lock app allows you to tap a button on your Android or iOS device to log into your Google account on the web. In May 2021 the company said these tools were part of Google's work toward ""creating a future where one day you won't need a password at all."" Apple's devices have used Touch ID and Face ID features for several years. The company is also developing its Passkeys feature to allow you to use those same fingerprint or facial recognition tools to create password-less logins for apps and accounts on your iOS devices. So in a sense a password-less future is already here: Microsoft says ""nearly 100%"" of the company's employees use password-less options to log into their corporate accounts. But getting every company to offer password-less options to employees and customers will surely take some time – and it might be a while before everyone feels secure enough to dump passwords in favor of something new. That's not the only problem either.

Debinha and Malia Berkley scored goals for North Carolina and Ashley Hatch recorded a brace for Washington. The draw comes on the final match day of Challenge Cup group play as the Courage are into the semifinals but must wait on results from Sunday's matches to see who they will play. Fans can watch Challenge Cup matches live and on demand with Paramount+.

The two sides each established fairly open end to end play during the match's opening minutes. The Spirit were able to pressure the Courage and limit their impact in the midfield early on and the visiting side got on the scoreboard early forcing an error out of the back line that led to a turnover for Hatch's opening goal.

Brazilian international Kerolin Nicoli earned her first NWSL Challenge Cup start for the Courage and had a significant impact on the team through the attack. Kerolin won a foul in the box just ahead of halftime and her international teammate Debinha converted the penalty to level things before halftime.

Second-half shift

The Courage had the momentum early after halftime and Berkley scored the go-ahead goal for North Carolina just seven minutes into the second half.

The Courage had an opportunity to extend the scoreline as Kerolin won another penalty kick but Debinha's second attempt to convert was saved by Spirit goalkeeper Aubrey Kingsbury. The missed opportunity led to a penalty scenario for the Spirit after Trinity Rodman was fouled in the box and Hatch stepped up to convert the penalty kick to level the game for good.

The 2-2 draw was enough for the Courage to clinch first place in the East Region and a spot in the Challenge Cup semifinals. Courage coach Sean Nahas credited the team for pulling off the result despite the slow start.

""It wasn't one of our better games statistically obviously. You know we didn't show up in the first 10 minutes And against good teams they're going to punish you. We made a couple of silly decisions that we haven't been making all year and they pounced on it"" Nahas said during post-game comments.

""Each week we've had to learn something new because the game has presented something different. And today we had to learn how to compete from being behind. [We] haven't been behind this season. So the ability for us to have to fight back get the PK call on a pretty good sequence and then obviously Malia's absolute stunner of a strike. We made some changes at halftime and talked about a few things but I'm really really proud of the players. They deserve this. They put the work in and sometimes you have to grind it out all credit goes to them.""

Look ahead

The NWSL regular season kicks off on April 29 and North Carolina Courage will be on the road to face Angel City FC in Los Angeles. Challenge Cup semifinals begin on May 4.

His cash incentives totaled $1.857 million up from $1.752 million and other compensation including pension earnings totaled $626413 down slightly from a year ago

Biggs’ successor 51-year-old John Rainey will join Walmart on June 6. Biggs will work in a transitional role until his retirement and exit on Jan. 31. Rainey will receive a $5 million signing bonus base salary of $1 million and a restricted stock package valued at $24 million.

Suresh Kumar is the second-highest-paid executive at Walmart as the chief global technology officer who joined the company in 2020 from Google. Kumar’s total compensation last year was $16.706 million up from $11.736 million the year before. Kumar’s base salary was $1.05 million compared to $1.021 million the previous year.

His cash incentive was $2.442 million up from $2.125 million year over year. Furner’s pension and other compensation also increased last year to a combined $590.381 up 9.76%.

Walmart’s two highest-ranking females earned less than Furner who holds a similar job albeit on a larger scale. Walmart International CEO Judith McKenna earned compensation of $13.9 million up 15.6% compared to $12.02 million in the prior year. Her base salary totaled $1.111 million up from $1.088 million from the prior year. Stock awards rose to $9.61 million up from $7.24 million in the prior year. McKenna’s cash incentive pay was $2.49 million last year on par with the year prior. Her pension and other compensation totaled $690800 and was down substantially from $1.2 million in the prior year.

McKenna has been in the International CEO job for four years and four months and her base salary is still 20% less than Furner’s who has been in his role for just two years and six months McKenna’s total compensation of $13.9 million was 5.7% less than Furner’s last year. Her stock awards were also substantially lower than his. Their annual cash incentives were similar with McKenna earning a bit more than Furner.

Sam’s Club CEO Kathryn McLay earned total pay of $11.53 million down from $12.95 million in the prior year.

Walmart’s top executives’ pay was a reflection of overall growth in sales revenue of 2.4% from the prior year. Walmart Stores posted revenue in the previous fiscal year of $573 billion and $13.678 billion in net income.

Just 11 weeks prior he had taken one.

At the time the rapper was a few years shy of global fame whether for a steady stream of chart-topping songs and Grammy nominations various brawls or widespread condemnation last summer after making homophobic remarks and comments about people with HIV/AIDS.

But in 2018 DaBaby whose real name is Jonathan Kirk was just another buzzy cocky North Carolina artist who relied on a local fan base to pass around his YouTube videos and SoundCloud links in the hopes of landing a major record label.

Jaylin Craig was one such listener. Being an early admirer of Kirk cost the 19-year-old his life according to his family after a chance encounter at a Charlotte-area Walmart ended with Kirk shooting and killing Craig on Nov. 5 2018.

Kirk has always claimed he acted out of fear for his and his family’s safety describing a scenario where he was approached by two young men who allegedly threatened him and whipped out a firearm while he was shopping with his then-partner and their children. Kirk claimed he fired his own gun in an act of self-protection and to keep his family safe.

But Rolling Stone has obtained never-before-seen security footage of the fatal altercation that appears to contradict key aspects of Kirk’s version of events. From the footage the rapper appears to be the initial aggressor in the situation calling into question DaBaby’s self-defense claim. To Craig’s family the video footage raises some serious questions; most important would Jaylin Craig still be alive if Kirk hadn’t thrown the first punch?

“I feel like they just swept it up under the rug” Craig’s mother LaWanda Horsley tells Rolling Stone of the investigation into her son’s death. “[Kirk] knows what he did. I’m not doing this for no fame or anything because at the end of the day Jaylin Craig is gone.”

Craig’s family members and his best friend Henry Douglas claim the altercation only started when Kirk became annoyed that the teens had recognized him and he allegedly demanded they take things outside for a fight. While Kirk claimed to police that one of the teens had first suggested they should fight the footage shows Craig standing nearby as Kirk sucker punches a blindsided Douglas barreling into him and striking him in the face. The injury left Douglas with a bruised eye socket and a gash in his forehead that required stitches.

At one point immediately after Kirk’s initial attack on Douglas Craig appears in one block of footage to pull out a gun from his waistband but as he walks out of frame he appears to begin to put it back. Other footage from later on in the fight in which it’s unclear whether or not Craig is still brandishing his gun then shows Kirk pulling out a concealed Glock from his waistband and mortally wounding Craig. Officials later determined based on the security footage witness testimony and a weapon found near Craig’s body that Craig had a gun on him but it’s inconclusive if Craig was brandishing the gun as he approached the two men.

The whole altercation lasted less than a minute and ended with a wounded Craig running into a nearby aisle and leaving a trail of blood before collapsing in the same spot where medics would pronounce him dead minutes later.

Kirk has hardly shied away from the events of that fateful Monday evening in fact bragging about the shooting on several tracks. In the 2020 hit “Rockstar” he boasts about his one-year-old daughter having witnessed him kill someone hailing her as a gangster. (“My daughter a G she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two.”) Four days after Craig’s death Kirk released a video for his new song “No Tears” compiling local news footage of the mayhem for the song’s intro with lyrics mentioning the shooting despite the case still being under investigation. “And any nigga touch me catch a body like Boosie. Try me I’m shootin’. No back and forth just up it I’m blowin’.” (A rep for the rapper did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)

Outside of his music Kirk has been more tight-lipped on specifics. He has always maintained that he acted in self-defense; a loving father protecting his then-partner Mariah Osborne and their two young children while the family was shopping for winter clothes. He claimed to police that Craig and Douglas had been eyeing him up and lurking in nearby aisles until they finally approached him allegedly threatening him and brandishing a gun leading Kirk to draw his own weapon and shoot killing Craig.

“Daughter could have got hit son could have got hit [and] me” DaBaby claimed in an Instagram video days after the shooting. “Lawyers … telling me not to say nothing … But two [people] walk down on you and your whole … family threatening y’all whip out [a gun] on y’all let me see what y’all going to do.”

The case was closed in June 2019. Kirk wasn’t prosecuted for Craig’s death but was charged and convicted of carrying a concealed weapon and sentenced to 12 months’ probation with a suspended jail sentence.

Dave Chappelle’s mention of the killing last year renewed some short-lived attention on Craig’s death amid various other criminal matters and civil lawsuits involving Kirk. But while Kirk’s fans may have moved on Craig’s family has not. Four years after his death his relatives have adopted a street in his honor in Charlotte as the family is still trying to make sense of how Kirk was able to get off relatively scot-free for the killing.

Still living in Charlotte Horsley suffers from anxiety learning of her son’s death when she was sent a graphic image being shared on social media of Craig lying lifeless on the ground next to a pool of blood.

She steers clear of anything related to Kirk saying that she finds him and his music triggering. Before the death of Craig her third child she shopped every week at the same Walmart where he was shot dead. Today she can’t even drive past the location without suffering an anxiety attack. “I kind of stay at home” she tells Rolling Stone. “I don’t go to the mall; I don’t do anything. I quit going to events. If I know I have no control in the music I don’t go.”

Jaylin’s father Curtis who works as a truck driver says he and his son were inseparable. He has trouble understanding how his son wound up dead with Kirk claiming the 19-year-old had been looking to cause trouble. “​​My son wasn’t even like that” he says. “He wasn’t even ‘gangster.’ We didn’t raise them like that.”

“That’s what eventually started it; when he took it the wrong way. We were trying to see who you are and he took it as somebody is looking at him with a problem” – Henry Douglas

Horsley Curtis and other family members all believe Craig’s killing was unjustified yet their story has largely gone unheard. It’s not because they were trying to stay under the radar; during Kirk’s trial for the concealed-weapon charge Horsley and Curtis turned up to court to speak with local outlets in the hope of sharing their son’s story. They disputed the unfounded rumor that Craig had attempted to rob Kirk and claimed it was the rapper who had started the altercation by throwing the first punch only to see their quotes whittled down to a line or two and in multiple cases Craig’s name misspelled. (Even the death-investigation report prepared by Mecklenburg County Assistant District Attorney William Bunting misspelled Craig’s name throughout the six-page document.)

Kirk destroyed their family Horsley says but it took all these years before anyone came to them asking for their side of the story. “We never hid from nobody” she explains. “We never [heard] from nobody. Y’all knew our names from a news clip. But nobody ever asked us what was Jaylin like. Nobody.”

“This is stressing me out right now because every time you turn on the radio you hear him” Curtis adds. “You can’t even listen to the radio. I think about my son constantly. We all are going through the same stuff. Every time we talk about it we think we are getting somewhere and nobody is trying to help us. Every lawyer we talked to they look into this case [and say] ‘OK we are going to get back with you.’ We don’t hear nothing [back].”

Then there was Kirk seemingly crowing about the shooting in his music. After “No Tears” he released a video for “Walker Texas Ranger” in January 2019 where he fights with a Black man whose hair is braided similarly to Craig’s followed by the release of “Leave Me Alone (Freestyle)” on which he raps “The last nigga played he no longer here goddamn.” By the end of the month 11 weeks after Kirk had killed Craig Interscope Records announced a deal with the rapper.

It sickened Craig’s family to watch Kirk seemingly launch a career off the back of their son’s death. But until last spring they could only go on their faith in their son’s character and the word of Douglas who insisted that Kirk instigated the fight. After years of pleading with Huntersville Police and the district attorney’s office as well as being bounced around different departments Horsley was finally handed the entire police file pertaining to Craig’s case in April 2021.

It took days for Horsley to sift through the hefty white binder filled with various reports alongside dozens of videos and audio recordings connected to the case. But nestled among the videos was a clip that changed everything in the family’s eyes. Because to them it’s proof that the full truth of what actually happened has never been told.

Henry Douglas learned that his best friend since fourth grade was dead a day before Douglas’ 20th birthday. The news was delivered following a 12-minute interview with police after the shooting with Huntersville Police Department Detective Tim Lesser questioning Douglas in his hospital bed while he was waiting to receive stitches. (Lesser referred Rolling Stone’s request for comment to the department’s public-information officer who did not respond to multiple requests for comment beyond providing a police incident report.)

“Do you know anything on Jaylin’s status?” Lesser asked him to conclude the interview.

“Nah I ain’t talked to him. Is he all right?” Douglas replied. “Why don’t you tell me if he not?”

Life has not been the same for Douglas since. He says he’s crossed paths with Kirk twice since the fatal altercation; once at a downtown Charlotte sports bar another time more recently at a Charlotte Hornets basketball game. Each time Douglas was far enough away from Kirk but he still felt the need to remove himself from the venue unable to bear being in Kirk’s presence even from a distance. “I guess you could kind of say it’s like a PTSD type of thing” Douglas tells Rolling Stone.

The childhood friends were fresh off a shift at Wikoff Color Corp. in nearby Fort Mill South Carolina. It was November and with colder weather moving in they made a stop at Walmart to find thermals to wear under their work gear.

Walmart surveillance footage reviewed by Rolling Stone shows the pair entering the store around 6:30 p.m. laughing both dressed in hoodies tracksuit bottoms and rubber slides. While walking around Douglas recalls Craig spotted someone he thought looked familiar a local rapper who went by the name of DaBaby. At first Douglas tells Rolling Stone he doubted it was Kirk simply because he wasn’t dressed in a way befitting a hot rising rapper. And beyond that this man was shopping for baby clothes in a Walmart. Douglas admits that as they kept walking he took some extra glances toward Kirk to figure out if it was really him.

That’s when Kirk noticed them. “That’s what eventually started it; when he took it the wrong way” Douglas says. “We were trying to see who you are and he took it as somebody is looking at him with a problem.”

Jonathan Kirk aka DaBaby (left) gets into an altercation with Henry Douglas (right). Kirk would later shoot and kill Jaylin Craig (background) during the fight.

Kirk’s memory of the lead-up to the shooting aligns with Douglas’ according to the 45-minute testimony Kirk gave to Lesser obtained by Rolling Stone. In the midst of shopping with Osborne and their children Kirk claimed that Craig and Douglas were staring at him.

“They’re staring at me like they recognize me; like they was about to come pull a gun out” Kirk told detectives adding that he assumed the teens were looking to cause trouble. “What I’m hearing from it they see me with my girl and my kids and [think] ‘This is a perfect opportunity to do something to him.’ … They’re trying to get me to provoke them so they could pull a gun out.”

Throughout his interview with police Kirk repeatedly plays up being a loving protective father mentioning how he was doting on his daughter holding up outfits with “hearts and unicorns” planting kisses on the one-year-old and giving her a lollipop. He alludes to feeling vulnerable with two people allegedly lurking nearby while he was out with his family confessing to police to having a firearm on him.

Both Douglas and Osborne told police that Kirk initiated the conversation calling out something to the effect of “Do you know me?” Recognizing Kirk’s voice Douglas says he responded back: “I said ‘Oh I thought that was you.’ We turned around and walked off.”

Douglas claims he was about to say hello to a woman he knew in the store and walked past Kirk again when Kirk seemed intent on creating an issue demanding to know what he and Craig were doing and insisting on going to the parking lot to fight. (Kirk claimed to police that Douglas had first suggested the idea of fighting.)

Douglas claims he had never been in a fight before. But because an acquaintance of Kirk’s seemed ready to get involved too Douglas says he wanted to diffuse the situation. Douglas says he agreed to go outside thinking he and Craig could just hop in their cars parked near the entrance and leave.

In line with Douglas’ account as he takes a few steps back and slightly turns away Kirk is seen on surveillance footage unexpectedly launching into Douglas striking him in the head and nearly tackling him to the ground. He would later tell the police that he began to “tussle” with Douglas to try to “get the jump on” either Douglas or Craig because he was with his family and the two men allegedly wouldn’t leave them alone. Douglas Kirk and Osborne make no mention in police interviews of Craig being directly involved throughout the brewing altercation and Bunting’s death-investigation report notes that in his statements to police Kirk did not say he’d actually seen a gun on Craig until after Kirk began fighting with Douglas.

Footage reviewed by Rolling Stone shows Craig standing nearby when Kirk rammed into Douglas his left hand hanging by his side and his right scratching his face. At one point after Kirk and Douglas start fighting “Craig reaches into the front of his waistband to pull out what appears to be a firearm” according to Bunting’s report. Craig moves toward the interlocked men and “puts his left hand between the fighting pair as if to pull them off one another” according to the report. Osborne then interjects herself into the scuffle attempting to separate Kirk from Douglas before moving closer to Craig pushing him and hitting him in the face according to the surveillance footage and report.

At that moment Kirk is able to break free one of his hands pulling out a concealed .40-caliber Glock from his waistband and shooting Craig one time in the side at close range. Craig stumbles before running into a nearby aisle his body doubled over as splatters of blood leave a trail behind him. A third camera angle shows Craig collapsing to the ground at the other end of the aisle.

While Douglas claims that he never saw Craig draw a weapon Osborne and Kirk told police they saw Craig pull a gun out while the rapper was entangled with Douglas and Kirk told police he heard Osborne yelling “He got a gun he got a gun.” One witness — a Walmart customer — told police he saw Craig with a weapon in his waistband area and another — a Walmart employee — said he also saw Craig with a gun according to the death-investigation report which ultimately concluded that prosecutors couldn’t prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Kirk didn’t act in self-defense.

“He’s like trying to get around his homeboy and shoot me” Kirk says excitedly telling police that he discharged his firearm multiple times. “When I break loose and get free with [my] gun … his homeboy is right here and I shoot boom boom boom.”

“He said ‘Do I think he murdered your son? Yes I do. … If I could I would charge his ass with murder.’” – LaWanda Horsley

Although the shooting occurred around 6:30 p.m. Horsley says the Huntersville Police Department didn’t contact her until three hours after her son had died. She had already feared something was amiss as reports were spreading on social media about a shooting at Walmart and she couldn’t get a hold of her son. Calling up Curtis Horsley instructed him to rush to Walmart.

“When I found out my son was killed everything from the bottom of my feet came up and out of me” Horsley says. “I never knew your body could feel like that.”

It never made sense to Horsley and Curtis how Craig who they say had never gotten into any trouble with the police could have gotten mixed up in this. It was also a shock to them when detectives told them that Craig had been carrying a pistol even more so when the gun was reported as stolen. Douglas claims that Craig had purchased the firearm secondhand and wasn’t aware that it had been reported as stolen.

While his parents acknowledge that Craig had guns they point out that he had a permit and claim that the rest of his weapons were registered to him. (North Carolina largely favors gun rights with roughly 46 percent of residents owning at least one firearm.)

Initially Craig’s parents believed that Kirk was being investigated in relation to Craig’s death expecting a charge of homicide against the rapper. But while sitting in an attorney’s office trying to find out the status of the case they learned that Kirk was claiming self-defense. They were stunned.

“Right now it’s life and death for me and my kids” Kirk had told police. “I don’t know what their situation is; for me it’s strictly defense life or death.”

Craig’s family takes issue with multiple aspects of the Huntersville Police Department’s investigation. For starters officers allegedly failed to interview multiple people at Walmart who were acquaintances of both Kirk and Douglas. Furthermore there appear to be inconsistencies and omissions in Kirk’s and Osborne’s police testimony such as Kirk skipping over how the physical fight started not directly mentioning that he threw the first punch. (The Huntersville Police Department did not respond to multiple requests for comment about aspects of its investigation.)

“I don’t look at him as no DaBaby. I look at him like ‘You’re Jonathan Kirk and you murdered Jaylin Craig.’” – LaWanda Horsley

Todd Owens a criminal-defense attorney and former North Carolina district court judge tells Rolling Stone that he finds issue with Kirk claiming he was in a life-or-death situation given that Osborne and an acquaintance of Kirk’s who was in the store were shown on camera still approaching Craig when he was allegedly brandishing a firearm. To Owens that weakens Kirk’s claim that he was acting out of imminent fear of danger.

“Going up and pushing a person who is brandishing a firearm or who she can see has a firearm is really really risky business” he explains. “That completely undermines that legal theory.”

Although Kirk was never charged over Craig’s death the Mecklenburg County District Attorney’s Office pursued a misdemeanor charge against him for carrying a concealed weapon for which he did not have a permit. However the case was suddenly dismissed in March 2019 because “a key civilian witness was unavailable” according to a county representative.

But the state brought back the charge against Kirk and he was convicted in June 2019. Judge Tyyawdi Hands sentenced Kirk to 12 months of unsupervised probation with a suspended 30-day jail sentence. (The next summer she was pictured posing with Kirk following a panel in support of Black Lives Matter where Kirk complained about local police over receiving two citations in December 2019 for possession of marijuana and resisting arrest according to local reports. In a statement to Rolling Stone Hands says her attendance was unrelated to Kirk’s trial.)

In a comment provided to Rolling Stone on why Kirk didn’t face more serious charges a representative for the DA’s office says they “reviewed the police investigative file and agreed with the Huntersville Police Department’s decision not to charge Mr. Kirk further as prosecutors could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self-defense.” It declined to further comment on the case.

Horsley claims that was the same reasoning she initially received from the DA’s office. But after Kirk’s 2019 citations she says she spoke to Bunting who she says was sympathetic and allegedly admitted that he believed Kirk should have faced direct charges for Craig’s death.

“He said ‘Do I think he murdered your son?’ He said ‘Yes I do. … If I could I would charge his ass with murder. But I have to go off the evidence that the Huntersville Police Department gave me.’” (Bunting declined to comment for this story including whether he believed Kirk should have faced homicide charges.)

The matter ultimately comes down to the state’s Stand Your Ground law which provides strong protection for those claiming self-defense two criminal-law experts tell Rolling Stone.

That defense hinges in part on who the initial aggressor is legal analyst Emily Baker explains. To rely on the Stand Your Ground law a person who initiates a conflict has to justify their use of force according to Owens the defense attorney. If someone acts “as the aggressor and he initiates the conflict he’s got to be able to show not just that the person was armed but that there was a serious threat of imminent death or physical injury” Owens says. “That the person was going to use that weapon not just that they were armed.”

After reviewing the security footage Baker says Kirk appears to be the initial aggressor by starting the fight but because witnesses claimed to see Craig with a gun it changed the dynamic of the situation.

“But it’s not clear-cut and it is not a ‘These people rolled up on me and tried to roll me and I had to defend myself’” she says. “That’s not what this video shows. This video shows a fight that got way out of hand very fast and that resulted in somebody dying.”

Owens adds that even with witnesses telling police they saw Craig holding a gun during the scuffle Kirk’s self-defense claim would be “100 percent contingent” on the belief that his life or the lives of others were in danger.

“Self-defense is difficult on a good day” Baker says. “Cases can be charged when people look like they may be acting in self-defense and it can go to a jury and be decided and that’s often the proper way because that’s the community where those laws are written.”

Considering the footage Owens says he thinks the case should have been left up to a jury to decide if Kirk reasonably acted in self-defense. “I don’t see anything enough here to say that it shouldn’t have been presented to a jury” he says.

“I don’t see anything enough here to say that it shouldn’t have been presented to a jury” says one North Carolina criminal-defense attorney

Craig’s parents also feel that their position is strengthened by Kirk’s track record of physical altercations. He was linked to a nonfatal shooting at his home on April 13 and although police wouldn’t confirm Kirk as the shooter the rapper implied as much on social media. “Chose not to take a n*gga life the other day & it felt great” he wrote. “Heal up & live my boy! Just don’t bring ya ass back.

In March 2020 he was seen on video smacking a woman in the face for trying to film him at a club. That December he was arrested for allegedly punching a Miami club promoter in the face. (Battery charges were dropped against Kirk but the promoter is suing Kirk for the alleged attack.) In February of this year he was caught on video throwing a punch at Brandon “Bills” Curiel the brother of his former girlfriend musician DaniLeigh. (A representative for the LAPD says a case on the altercation has since been closed but Curiel’s civil suit is still pending.)

Curiel’s is one of two lawsuits in Los Angeles that Kirk is currently facing. Last February 65-year-old rental-property owner Gary Pagar sued the rapper claiming Kirk sucker-punched him in December 2020 knocking out his tooth after Kirk and his associates broke the terms of their rental agreement.

“There are people who believe that the rules don’t apply to them” Pagar tells Rolling Stone. “Whatever the rules are whether it’s the law that they can do what they want with impunity and there are no consequences. That’s who [Kirk] was.”

Ultimately Pagar says he wants to “have this man pay for his behavior and hopefully teach him a lesson that the rules actually do apply to him.”

That’s exactly what Horsley Curtis and the rest of their family want for Kirk: some form of justice for the rapper’s role in Craig’s death. They hope that publicly sharing their story will prompt an independent investigation into how the case was handled and hopefully end with Kirk being charged with homicide.

But if they were shown proof that Craig played a pivotal role in provoking Kirk to fire his weapon they would be ready to accept that. “Show me my son was wrong; tell me that” Horsley says. “I could take that and I will be at peace because I would have to accept the fact that my son done something that he shouldn’t have done.”

After obtaining the Walmart security footage and having serious questions about the police investigation Craig’s family feels strongly that justice has eluded them.

“In my eyes I feel like [Jaylin] was murdered” Curtis says. “And [Kirk] got away with it. Everything he [does] is pretty much the same thing. He’s assaulting people he’s getting away with it. Every case that you look at they’re dismissing it. Why is he getting off?”

“I don’t look at him as no DaBaby” Horsley says. “I look at him like ‘You’re Jonathan Kirk and you murdered Jaylin Craig.’”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpc2lvbm1vbmRheS5jb20vdm0tZXZlbnRzL3ZtLXN1bW1pdC9hcnRpY2xlL3dhbG1hcnQtc2Vlcy1hbi1vcHBvcnR1bml0eS10by1wcm92aWRlLWFmZm9yZGFibGUtaGVhbHRoLWNhcmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart Sees an Opportunity to Provide 'Affordable Health Care',"

























NEW YORK—While the significant role Walmart has played in American retail over the past 50 years is readily apparent the company’s effort to provide health care services especially to underserved individuals and rural markets has often gone unnoticed in spite of the major effort Walmart is making in the health care sector. This was one of the underlying themes in the VM Summit presentation of David Reitnauer vice president for health and wellness and specialized services at Walmart Inc.Addressing the landscape in retail health Reitnauer told attendees that Walmart has been in the pharmacy business for over 40 years and in the optical retail sector for over 30 years “but we’ve really started to accelerate in the last decade.”He noted that when Walmart launched its affordable generic drug program in 2006 ($4 to fill any generic drug prescription) the company believed this unique offering would be an incredible way to drive store traffic and sales. But what the company also discovered was that in addition to “taking share from the competition and things of that nature” there were many Walmart customers who weren’t getting the care they needed because they couldn’t afford the medication. This led to escalating health issues for this group.This idea is what forms the company’s thinking around “affordable access to care” he noted. “We want to make sure that we’re providing affordable access to care and there has been tremendous learning around the $4 prescription program.”Reitnauer also noted that Walmart works diligently to “get the base model right” particularly as it relates to the company’s new Health Centers. Reitnauer leads Walmart’s optical and audiology businesses including retail sales lab manufacturing and doctor of optometry relationships.“The number one reason people want to come to work at Walmart is scale” he told the audience. “And so what we have to do is make sure that when we scale something we do it right.” Reitnauer noted that during the pandemic Walmart took time to reevaluate its Health Center model and worked to “put the customer in the center of everything we want to do.”With its nationwide store base Walmart has grown to a position in which 90 percent of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of one of its stores and 70 percent of the population lives within 5 miles of a Walmart store. Reitnauer noted that the company has achieved an NPS (net promoter score) of 80 with its health care offerings and that the retailer is set up to provide telehealth services across all 50 states via its 2021 acquisition of MeMD a multi-specialty telehealth provider.“Four thousand of our stores are in medically underserved communities” Reitnauer said. “Those are the things that give us the right to say that we can play in health care and also to say we can provide care in those medically underserved communities and medically underserved doesn’t just mean rural today. A lot of inner cities are medically underserved.”He added “We want to make sure that the customer feels like whether [he or she] is going to the optometrist or the dentist or the doctor that everyone knows what’s going on with [their] case. ‘Everyone knows what’s going on with me and I don’t have to repeat it time and time again’” he said echoing the typical patient. Walmart had approximately 20 of its new Health Centers at the beginning of the year with plans to add more in 2022.A few days after Reitnauer’s presentation at the VM Summit Walmart announced that it would expand the Health Center format with the opening of five new Walmart Health centers across North and Central Florida. This marks the company’s expansion of this new format in Florida beginning with Jacksonville. Four additional locations in Florida will open this month in the Jacksonville Orlando and Tampa areas the company said.In its vision centers Reitnauer noted that the company has a new prototype format which it will have rolled out to 40 percent of its store base by the end of the year. The overall plan is to roll out the new vision center prototype to “in excess of 400 stores a year” and to provide this updated look and feel as a way to make sure customers have this more modern environment for their care. Walmart operates more than 2800 vision centers nationwide.Reitnauer also commented on the success of the recent Walmart partnership in eyewear with Elton John.“It isn’t just a partnership with Elton John eyewear [with the idea] ‘Hey here are some frames.’ It is really a partnership with who he is and this is an incredible story...And if you think of an iconic eyewear individual that’s Elton John.”Then three prominent optometrists—Solomon Gould OD Jennifer Stewart OD and Amanda Nanasy OD held a three-way conversation which focused on how they are expanding their scope of practice to include new methods of primary care that open new access points for patients while also differentiating their practices.Dr. Solomon Gould is a professional speaker practice management consultant author and practice owner of two private practices in the Twin Cities. The 4th generation optometrist with over 14 years of consulting experience for both the private and public sectors said “The field of optometry has stepped up over the past year.” Dr. Gould pointed to three prominent trends in optometry: the rise of preventive holistic care new technologies such as telehealth and a serious movement to take eyecare to the next level.Dr. Gould started the conversation by quizzing the audience about what is the most common sports injury today—and the collective audience response was concussion.Dr. Nanasy specializes in performance vision enhancement and vision rehabilitation after concussion and she practices at two locations—the Florida Institute of Sports Vision and The Eye Center of Pembroke Pines. Dr. Nanasy said “I give my patients above what they expect—comprehensive care and education about concussion.” She stressed that all optometrists and athletes especially children need to be educated about the dangers and treatment of concussion.She also talked about how eye tracking technology such as RightEye could be used as part of a sports vision evaluation. “Technology like RightEye allows me to show patients exactly what’s happening with their vision. It has also allowed me to learn how to use prism to correct the misalignment of patients’ eyes.”Dr. Stewart is a nationally recognized speaker with a passion for helping optometrists and organizations with operations optical success contact lens sales and practice management through her company OD Perspectives and she is a partner at Norwalk EyeCare in Connecticut.“I am passionate about sports vision and my goal is that all ODs should have an idea about what sports vision is. Eyecare protection has come a long way—it’s no longer about massive goggles. The paradigm is shifting on what we are wearing for sports protection which is good because the stats on injuries are concerning.“Today’s ODs need to be compliant with the standards associated with lenses and UV protection. But it’s just as important for them to be up-to-date on the latest technologies for patients’ vision protection” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsZXZlbGFuZDE5LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA0LzI0L2N1c3RvbWVycy1kaXNhcHBvaW50ZWQtd2FsbWFydC1tYXlmaWVsZC1oZWlnaHRzLXNldC1jbG9zZS1uZXh0LW1vbnRoL9IBe2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsZXZlbGFuZDE5LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA0LzI0L2N1c3RvbWVycy1kaXNhcHBvaW50ZWQtd2FsbWFydC1tYXlmaWVsZC1oZWlnaHRzLXNldC1jbG9zZS1uZXh0LW1vbnRoLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Customers disappointed Mayfield Heights Walmart set to close next month,"CLEVELAND Ohio (WOIO) - Walmart on Mayfield Road in Mayfield Heights is set to close May 20 and many shoppers are disappointed.

“Our decision is based on several factors including historic and current financial performance and is in line with the threshold that guides our strategy to close underperforming locations” said Communications Director Felicia McCranie.

The store is set to close on Friday May 20 but not everyone is ready to let go.

That includes Cheryl Price.

“By them closing this particular store I just think that this was the worst decision they could have ever made” Price said.

McCranie added they hope the associates will want to continue their careers at Walmart and all are eligible to transfer to another store. State filing said employees won’t be terminated until July.

In the end Price and other customers say they fear they’ll be living in a food desert with the closure of this affordable option.

Online shopping has seen an incredible rise because of the pandemic and the ensuing lockdowns. Indeed total e-commerce sales for 2021 were estimated at $870.8 billion an increase of 14% according to the Commerce Department. But not all stores are faring the same and consumers are very particular in terms of what makes an online shopping experience worth their time and money.

Good To Know: 6 Household Staples That Are a Waste of Money

A new GOBankingRates survey that asked which store had the best online shopping experience finds that American consumers overwhelmingly favor Walmart for their online shopping at 42%. In terms of age groups the 65 and over age group had the strongest preference for Walmart at 49% followed by the 45 to 54 age group at 47% and the 55 to 64 age group at 40%. Following Walmart Target takes the second spot with 31% and Costco is far behind with 9%. Finally at the bottom of the list for best online shopping experience are Ikea at 6% Dollar General at 6% Dollar Tree at 4% and Five Below at a meager 2%.

So what makes Walmart more attractive for online shopping? Keep reading to find out.

What Puts Walmart at No. 1 for Online Shopping?

There are a few offerings that have likely helped to boost Walmart ahead of the others.

Walmart+

According to experts getting in the top spot is a combination of several factors including the Walmart+ perk Walmart’s same-day on-demand shopping service.

Shannon Vissers retail analyst at MerchantMaverick.com told GOBankingRates that Walmart+ is similar to Amazon Fresh or Instacart.

“Target does offer a similarly priced same-day delivery service called Shipt but it doesn’t have as many benefits as Walmart+. In addition to free same-day delivery Walmart+ also offers free ground shipping with no order minimum and member prices on fuel and prescription meds” Vissers said.

The Walmart+ Partnership With American Express

Another benefit (for some) Walmart+ members is its partnership with American Express which was announced in October 2021.

“I remember it surprised a lot of people last year when American Express added a free Walmart+ membership for its Platinum cardmembers” Ted Rossman senior industry analyst CreditCards.com told GOBankingRates. “On the face of it it seemed like an odd match — isn’t the Amex Platinum for millionaires not the kinds of people who shop at Walmart? But Amex said Walmart is actually among the most popular retailers for its Platinum card members.”

Variety of Items

Another factor that is appealing to consumers for online shopping is Walmart’s huge variety of items. Indeed while Walmart Target and Costco all offer highly navigable websites and apps and have a convenient online checkout process Walmart sells a much larger number of items than Target or Costco Merchant Maverick’s Vissers said.

“The variety is pretty incredible and Walmart is able to achieve it because it uses a vast seller marketplace similar to Amazon. Target does have a seller marketplace called ‘Target Plus’ but it’s invite-only and thus much smaller than Walmart’s — 272 sellers on Target Plus versus 100000 Walmart Marketplace sellers” she said.

Catering to a Wide Range of Consumers

Some experts also note that another driver for Walmart is that the retailer has made tremendous efforts to cater to various audiences online.

For example it has expanded the number of language offerings on its website which is allowing it to be a frontrunner retailer among global audiences as the use of native language makes the shopping experience one that is familiar and easy Hila Shitrit-Nissim CMO of BLEND Localization told GOBankingRates. “This is just one of several ways they’ve created a meaningful online shopping experience for their customers” Shitrit-Nissim said.

Gaining Access to Talent and Knowledge

Walmart’s omnichannel strategy that entailed purchasing successful e-commerce businesses such as Jet.com Bonobos and ModCloth gave Walmart overnight access to the talent and know-how required to build a best-in-class online experience.

“Armed with this expertise they’ve invested in a mobile app fast shipping and buy online pick-up in-store (BOPIS) service etc. to create a seamless customer experience” Fang Cheng founder and CEO of Linc told GOBankingRates.

Accessibility

Cheng added that Walmart’s proximity to customers is a huge advantage over everybody — even Amazon.

“With more than 5000 stores nationwide Walmart has made the claim in recent years that 90% of Americans live within only 10 miles of one of their stores. This goes back to the convenience of one-stop shopping while giving shoppers full control over how and where they receive online orders” Cheng said. “Walmart has made BOPIS super easy whether shoppers want the convenience of curbside grocery pick-up or prefer visiting a store because they’re concerned packages will be lost or stolen off their doorstep. Plus nearby stores give shoppers an easy way to handle returns and receive in-person customer service as needed.”

Well one Texas judge has invited the Disney CEO to move the amusement park to Fort Bend County just outside of Houston amid a battle over self-government in Florida according to KPRC KSAT’s sister station.

Fort Bend County Judge KP George penned a letter to Disney CEO Bob Chapek Friday inviting the Walt Disney Company “to consider Fort Bend County as a welcoming and diverse place to do business.”

The invitation comes after Florida lawmakers passed a bill that would dissolve Disney World’s private government which has been in operation for 55 years and provides municipal-like services for its 27000 acres according to the Associated Press.

The Associated Press said the law has been viewed as retribution by many for Disney’s criticism over the “Don’t Say Gay Bill” which prevents instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade.

You can read the full letter from Judge George down below courtesy of KPRC:

“Dear Mr. Bob Chapek

It’s kind of a shame that one of the great myths of my baby boomer childhood — that the late Walt Disney had frozen himself so he could spring back to life Sleeping Beauty-like after humankind had cured cancer — turned out to be an urban myth. Because these days ol’ Walt would probably be spinning so fast he’d be melting up the cryogenics lab if he only knew what his former best friends in the GOP were saying about his beloved business empire.

To say that the original Disney was an icon of 20th-century blood sport capitalism is like saying Michael Jordan was a good basketball player. At the dawn of the Cold War in 1947 the cartoonist-turned-entrepreneur proved his anti-communist bona fides by naming names before the notorious House Un-American Affairs Committee (HUAC) even though the alleged “reds” whose lives were ruined by Disney were just workers who wanted to unionize his studio.

So how crazy was it this week to see a leader of today’s extreme-right anti-democratic Republican Party Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs — still a member of Congress despite his involvement in a 2021 coup against the U.S. government — tweeting a picture of the Disney company logo with the “D” replaced by the hammer-and-sickle of the USSR? Or much more important to see the governor and lawmakers of America’s third-largest state enact a law that explicitly punishes Disney for criticizing the government a nuclear-level violation of the First Amendment?

The new law signed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis late last week strips Disney of the ability the state granted the firm in the late 1960s to self-govern its massive Orlando-area theme parks with uncertain but expected to be massive economic consequences — a measure DeSantis and other Republicans unambiguously linked to the Disney stance on an earlier bill about not raising LGBTQ+ issues in a grade-school classroom.

The punitive move — whether or not it’s constitutional and I’d argue it’s not — makes a mockery of right-wing wailing about “free speech” and “cancel culture.” It’s also inspired a growing mob of QAnon types — taking their cues from elected officials who know better — to accuse decent folks who work for Disney of serving as pedophilic “groomers” of young children first online and then in mobs outside Walt Disney World. Surely innocent people will get hurt.

I don’t mean to give short shrift to the First Amendment issues raised by Florida’s all-out assault on one of the state’s largest employers — especially since my livelihood and passions as a journalist depend on continuing America’s imperfect traditions of free speech and a free press. That part of the story was summarized pretty succinctly by Ian Millhiser writing for Vox: “Florida’s decision to strip a government benefit from Disney because in DeSantis’s words Disney expressed ‘woke’ opinions and ‘tried to attack me to advance their woke agenda’ is unconstitutional. And it’s not a close case.” I sure hope our Trumped-up federal courts agree.

But it’s also important to put the move in a much broader context. For starters the Disney attack is just the latest and most forceful salvo in a wider Republican war against what they’ve branded as “woke corporations.” These are big firms where socially conscious branding has evolved — with a push from their younger college-educated workforce accelerated during 2020′s George Floyd protests — into stands on issues like transgender rights or voter suppression that are typically at odds with today’s GOP.

But a place like DeSantis’ Florida which has become a kind of laboratory for the mad science of post-Trump neo-fascism isn’t only attacking so-called woke corporations like Disney with the heavy blunt object of punishing their free speech. Republicans pushing dark censorship in the so-called Sunshine State also want to pull up the very roots of “woke corporations” — which is any schooling that might have taught these people to embrace diversity and fairness in the first place. At the risk of verbally sinking to their crude level DeSantis seems to be “grooming” Florida’s kids ... to be stupid.

There is too much irony here to bear. For most of the last half-century Republicans and their handpicked judges have invested greatly in the idea that corporations like Disney have the full rights of personhood which includes First Amendment free speech rights — because that’s what got you to unlimited corporate campaign donations. Conservatives never anticipated the blowback of corporations using free speech to undermine their political agenda. As a result right wingers in the 2020s don’t just suddenly hate “woke corporations” but other institutions they also used to revere like the “woke military” or the “woke CIA.”

What has changed isn’t rocket science ... or maybe in a way it is. Institutions in the 21st century — not just Silicon Valley or Big Media but even corporations that manufacture widgets and also places like the U.S. military brass — need to hire the best people to compete. That means hiring top college graduates who increasingly arrive at the workplace with a high priority on a culture that promotes diversity. That’s not only the moral stance but it makes sense for a variety of reasons. For example diverse teams on company projects produce more diverse and smart ideas. In the case of Disney the price of not speaking out on the DeSantis GOP “Don’t Say Gay” bill regulating classrooms would have been offending the large numbers of LGBTQ+ tourists who descend on its Florida theme parks.

Republicans it turns out don’t actually worship free enterprise as any sort of moral value but just as part of a moral grand bargain in which unfettered profits fund large campaign contributions. The threatened loss of Disney’s donations was surely one reason why DeSantis was willing to toss the First Amendment onto the bonfire but the biggest threat was a challenge to the governor’s authority in a moment of rising authoritarianism. Florida Republicans were forced to choose between capitalism and anti-free speech fascism. They didn’t seem to think about it very long.

But I thought it was fitting that DeSantis announced his rapid-fire unconstitutional assault on Disney at a ceremony marking his signing of a different law — one that targets higher education at public universities in Florida. This law makes it harder for professors to gain tenure and also makes a mess of college accreditation (because accreditation agencies had criticized earlier DeSantis assaults on academic freedom). The governor and possible 2024 GOP presidential hopeful lashed out at “politicized” courses that “don’t prepare students for the real world” which in the mind of DeSantis is a place where young folks wouldn’t think to march for racial equality.

DeSantis’ latest cruise-missile strike against academic freedom didn’t get much notice — in part because it was overshadowed by the Disney flap but also because the shelling attacks against classroom learning in Florida have been carried out almost daily at Putin-esque levels. In addition to this higher ed bill and the “Don’t Say Gay” law about discussing sexuality in elementary schools Florida’s Republican government has sharply curtailed education around race through a law attacking “critical race theory” and passed other bills that will have a chilling effect on classroom learning or on what books are stocked in the school library. DeSantis’ Department of Education showed what this all means by banning dozens of math books some for mere mentions of race or related topics.

Although many on the far right would like to end public education altogether someday the more realistic step for now for the Ron DeSantises of the world is a classroom that teaches 2+2=4 but little more — on the level of what his fellow Republicans here in Pennsylvania admitted is “the McDonald’s track” but surely less than the critical thinking that comes with a liberal education. They are waging war today with Disney as a “woke corporation” but what they desperately want to stop is “woke people” who will challenge white supremacy and the patriarchy and the best place for them to destroy that is in the classroom before they reach employment age.

Not that they haven’t been trying. The right’s solution to young people challenging the status quo of racism and the Vietnam War during the 1960s and ‘70s was to end free or low public university tuition create a student loan regime that makes it harder for the indebted to challenge the system and to push “workforce development” over liberal education. Yet that still didn’t stop younger generations from on the whole embracing more tolerance — and so since those George Floyd marches the white gloves are completely off.

The true meaning of the Disney move is that today’s conservatives will do anything to maintain social control including dropping any last thin pretenses of supporting the Bill of Rights or the other pillars of American democracy. In 2022 they will throw away books destroy the lives of teachers and deliberately prevent your child from learning — anything to keep the arc of a moral universe from bending toward justice. They are embracing fascism not because they are winning but because modernity is winning and they are losing. This is no time to cede the high ground. There is no math textbook that can calculate the moral price of losing this fight.

What Governor DeSantis' new law means,"Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Legislature's actions to start the clock on dissolving a special self-governance district created for The Walt Disney Co. in 1967 could have dramatic impacts for two Orlando-area counties and their taxpayers.

The 38.5-square-mile Reedy Creek Improvement District gave Disney significant control of its property surrounding its Walt Disney World complex in Orange and Osceola counties. Reedy Creek for example oversees public safety for Disney as well as upkeep of roads and other infrastructure like water treatment and building inspections. Dissolving Reedy Creek is equivalent to dissolving a city.

What could this mean for taxpayers?

It could mean big tax increases for residents of Orange and Osceola counties as taxpayers would suddenly have to pick up the costs of everything from fire protection to road maintenance within Disney property.

Orange County Tax Collector Scott Randolph tweeted that if Reedy Creek is gone so is the $105 million Disney collects from itself annually to operate those services.

Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings says the financial impact on his county could be ""catastrophic.""

Randolph predicted in a WFTV-TV interview that it could mean a 20% to 25% increase in property taxes for Orange county residents.

Neighboring Osceola County said it is ""uncertain"" about its future financial responsibilities and is studying the issue.

How are Disney fans responding? Is the magic still there? Disney fans react to feud with DeSantis Florida lawmakers

What Disney said:Here's what Disney has said so far about the political storm surrounding it

The counties also likely would have to assume the debt obligations now held by Reedy Creek. Randolph said Reedy Creek has $53 million a year in debt obligations.

""Obviously it's going to affect a key part of the I-4 corridor but it affects the whole state"" said Susan MacManus a political science professor emeritus at the University of South Florida ""But in terms of exactly what the fallout will be I don't think we know yet. We don't have enough details to make an accurate assessment. But it sure has created shock waves across the country.""

How would counties pick up costs of public safety now paid by Disney?

Demings said that's a big concern if the county had to take over public safety costs now covered by Disney with no new revenue.

""We have a very unique situation with Reedy Creek and the Walt Disney conglomerate"" said Demings the former Orange County sheriff and former Orlando police chief. ""Reedy Creek paid 100% of the cost of the law enforcement services that are provided by the Orange County Sheriff's Office. They provide 100% of the calls of their own fire rescue and emergency response department. Their own 911 call center. They provide 100% of the cost.""

If Orange County had to assume all of those costs with no new revenue ""that would be catastrophic for our budget here within Orange County"" Demings said. ""It will put an undue burden on the rest of the taxpayers in Orange County to fill that gap. I don't know that that would happen but there certainly is a potential that it could happen.""

""That's a net-sum loss for the rest of the taxpayers of Orange County when we already have significant pressure on our county budget to provide for public safety and all of the other public health and social services that we have in the county that we pay for from ad-valorem (property) tax dollars"" Demings said.

Will Disney leave Florida? How the company might respond in feud over special status

What kind of money are we talking about?

The Reedy Creek Improvement District collects about $105 million a year to operate services inside Reedy Creek according to Randolph. So Disney in effect taxes itself for such things as operating its own power plant maintaining roads and providing fire protection.

""This is on top of other taxing authorities it sets in"" Randolph said as part of a series of tweets he posted on this issue. ""So Disney pays the same Orange County local and state school taxes etc. as all other properties inside Orange County. If Reedy Creek goes away the $105 million it collects to operate services goes away. That doesn’t just transfer to Orange County because it’s an independent taxing district. However Orange County then inherits all debt and obligations with no extra funds.""

Are officials in Osceola County worried too?

Osceola County issued a statement indicating that officials there are analyzing the matter.

""Now that the Legislature has passed a bill to dissolve the Reedy Creek Improvement District Osceola County government will begin an analysis to understand the impacts in preparation for this going into effect including evaluating any shifts in cost to Osceola as a result"" the statement said. ""As Disney and Reedy Creek have been self-contained we are uncertain of what fiscal responsibilities will be encumbered after June 2023.""

June 2023 is when this is set to take effect.

The statement added that ""over the many years Disney has been a strong community partner and we expect that relationship to continue as we work together for a transition plan.""

So what triggered the move to disband the Reedy Creek district in the first place?

DeSantis and members of the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature targeted Disney for the company's opposition to the ""Parental Rights in Education Act"" that legislators approved and DeSantis signed into law.

Among other provisions the law limits instruction about gender identity and sexual orientation in grades K-3. But critics of the measure — who term it the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill — contend it also will negatively affect members of the LGBTQ+ community.

The two-page bill affecting Reedy Creek doesn't specifically mention Disney or Reedy Creek. But it calls for dissolving independent special districts established before Nov. 5 1968 and ""not reestablished re-ratified or otherwise reconstituted by a special act or general law"" after then.

Reedy Creek — as well as development authorities in Bradford and Hamilton counties water districts in Broward and Franklin counties and a Marion County law library — would be affected according to a bill analysis by the staff of the Senate Committee on Community Affairs. That analysis said Florida's 1222 other independent special districts would not be affected.

It's clear that the bill was aimed at Disney.

Why is DeSantis fighting Disney? It's a warning to 'woke' big business to stay out of culture wars

Ron DeSantis' battle with Disney:DeSantis unchained: Disney fight shows a powerful governor emboldened and vengeful

In a Facebook post announcing the introduction of the bill Florida Rep. Randy Fine R-Palm Bay said: ""Disney is a guest in the state of Florida. Today we remind them of that fact. Governor DeSantis and I just announced that we are expanding the Special Session to hold Disney accountable.""

Fine described his bill as one to ""eliminate the Reedy Creek Improvement District a 50-year-old special statute that allows Disney to govern itself exempt from the laws faced by regular Floridians and its competitors.""

In another post Fine said he has no problem taking on ""woke corporations that wish to sexualize our children. I am not afraid to fight for what is right for my children — and yours.""

Disney had vowed to work to repeal the Parental Rights in Education Act and announced it was stopping all political contributions in Florida.

Florida Rep. Anna Eskamani D-Orlando called the law to repeal Disney's special district ""petty punitive politics at its worst. They're trying to cancel Disney and bully them into submission. It's undemocratic.""

Because of the bill's speedy introduction passage and signing into law ""it was also done in a way where the public didn't get to weigh in or for the ramifications (of the bill) to be thoroughly studied. Special sessions are supposed to be about urgent issues. This isn't one of them.""

Eskamani called it ""a telltale sign of one party rule drunk on power. This sends an unsettling message to anyone who challenges the governor.""

What is the business community saying?

Don Long president and chief executive officer of the 450-member Lake Nona Regional Chamber of Commerce in the Orlando area said it's difficult to tell what impact the legislation will have.

""There is a certain amount of concern about what happens if Reedy Creek (Improvement District) goes away"" Long said. ""Everyone visiting Disney's theme parks will still need services"" the special taxing district currently provides and Orange County's budget ""has not been established to meet that demand.""

Long said he is ""somewhat surprised"" that the affected counties and the local communities ""weren't consulted before this action was taken.""

""I would anticipate that local taxpayers both residents and businesses would in some way be impacted but that's just my own speculation"" Long said. ""This all moved so quickly. The problem is I don't think we're going to get any factual information for a while"" on what this will mean in terms of taxes on local residents and businesses.

Could Disney decide to scale back its Orlando-area operations in reaction to the action by the Florida Legislature?

University of Central Florida economist Sean Snaith director of the university's Institute for Economic Forecasting doesn't think that would happen.

Snaith said Disney is too heavily invested in its Orlando-area theme parks to pull out of Florida.

""However this Reedy Creek thing works out it's not like we're talking about a call center where a company could simply pull out"" Snaith said.

Snaith noted that Disney has no room to expand in Anaheim California where Disneyland is located whereas it has plenty of room for further expansion in Florida both where Disney World is located as well as the nearly 60 acres it bought last year in Lake Nona for its planned Parks Entertainment & Products Division.

""The future growth for the company in this country is Disney World"" Snaith said.

Disney did not respond to a request for comment.

What about Disney's plans to expand operations in the Lake Nona area of Orlando?

Disney is clearing land in Lake Nona for its planned Parks Entertainment and Products Division campus. The planned Disney campus is being built along Lake Nona Boulevard across from the new University of Central Florida Lake Nona Hospital.

""My understanding is that it's a $600 million investment"" Long said.

Disney ""imagineers"" recently staged a protest against the Parental Rights in Education Act bill demanding that the company scrap its plans to build the new corporate campus in Lake Nona.

But Snaith doubts Disney would scrap its Lake Nona plans.

Snaith also said he believes Disney's statement that it plans to create 2000 jobs at its planned Lake Nona campus is a low estimate and that the eventual number will be much higher given the enormous size of the future campus.

""You don't need that much land for just 2000 workers"" he said. ""I believe it could ultimately be more.""

How big a deal is Disney to Central Florida?

Very big. It has four theme parks two water parks and various hotels restaurants and shops in the Orlando area.

In addition the two largest Disney Cruise Line ships sail out of Port Canaveral in Brevard County which borders Orange and Osceola counties. Another Disney cruise ship also currently sails from Miami.

Disney employs more than 75000 and is the largest employer at a single location in Florida.

""What I can tell you is for the 50-plus years that Disney has been a part of this community they have been great community partners"" Orange County's Demings said. ""There are a myriad of jobs that have been created at Disney. I dare say that with the expansion of the other theme parks the expansion of business Disney has been part of that impetus to expand and grow our community in the manner that we see today.""

Demings said he believes Disney has been ""an instrumental part"" of spurring growth ""not only for our community but for the entire state of Florida. When you think about visiting Florida you can't help but think about visiting Disney and other theme parks as well.""

What about Reedy Creek's bond obligations?

On Friday the Fitch Ratings agency placed Reedy Creek Improvement District debt obligations on a ""watch"" list for possible downgrade of its ratings. Affected were about $766 million in outstanding ad-valorem tax bonds and $79 million in outstanding utilities bonds.

Fitch said placing Reedy Creek on its watch list after the Florida Legislature's action ""reflects the lack of clarity regarding the allocation of the RCID's assets and liabilities including the administration of revenues pledged to approximately $1 billion in outstanding debt following the dissolution of RCID or its re-ratification on or after June 1 2023. Fitch expects the title of all property owned by RCID including its indebtedness to be transferred to Orange County (and to a lesser extent Osceola County) or to a successor agency as prescribed under Florida law. Fitch believes the mechanics of implementation will be complicated increasing the probability of negative rating action.""

In a statement Reedy Creek said it ""expects to explore its options while continuing its present operations.""

It also pledged its bondholders that it will ""fulfill the terms of any agreement made with the holders of any bonds or other obligations of the district.""

Are there political ramifications to what's happening with Disney?

MacManus said ""there's both an economic and political side to this and when the two collide usually the political side wins. Right now both Democrats and Republicans are finding political value in attacking corporations. Democrats want more regulations and accuse corporations of making too much profit. On the Republican side you've got the anti-woke fight. A lot of people are scratching their heads and wondering: Why now? Of course it's happening now because it's an election year.""

Latest-available voter registration figures show that there are roughly an equal number of Republican and Democratic registered voters in Florida.

But Orange and Osceola counties both lean Democratic. In Orange 42.3% of voters are registered Democrats and 25.0% are Republicans with the remainder no party affiliation voters or members of minor political parties. Similarly in Osceola 40.2% of voters are Democrats and 23.2% are Republicans.

What would happen next?

Demings said his county likely would ""have to enter into the negotiations"" with Disney.

""There are some complex issues here that are not yet defined based upon the proposed language that I've seen"" Demings said. ""The devil is in the details and we quite simply today do not have the details.""

Demings said his staff is evaluating the language of the bill — in conjunction with the county's tax collector property appraiser comptroller and sheriff — ""to make certain that we understand the impact.""

""And so until we have all of the specifics it's hard to say what the specific answers or impacts would be"" Demings said. ""Just like everybody else we're trying to understand what the Legislature truly is trying to do in this case. But I believe they have not adequately contemplated the ramifications of what they have proposed at this point.""

In the meantime MacManus noted that ""the best news for all parties"" is that there is more than a year before the dissolution takes effect.

""It'll give all sides a chance to cool down"" MacManus said.

What's Disney likely to do?

James Clark a political analyst and senior lecturer with the University of Central Florida's history department said he doesn't think ""Disney will capitulate but they may use their army of 38 lobbyists in Florida to quietly work out a compromise which is probably already underway. But they may also go to court to fight this. In the long run I think they may work with Orange and Osceola counties as well as the state to try to soothe the waters.""

Can ban be selective?,"Mark Hinson

Guest columnist

Now that Disney executives are supposedly running a “woke” company thanks to the kerfuffle over Florida’s infamous ""Don’t Say Gay"" law some conservatives have called for a boycott of all things related to The House of Mouse.

Commentator Candace Owens who demands a ban called Disney “child groomers” and “pedophiles” because of the company’s opposition to Florida House Bill 1557 which was signed into law by the governor.

Well I will certainly look at Mary Poppins in a different light.

Disney governance:Senate votes to strip Disney of power to self govern its Florida empire

Ah but in a non-Disneyfied world there would be no more CGI-drunk clanging endless Marvel movies to endure since they are now owned by the “woke” rodent. “Star Wars” too. (Farewell problematic Jar Jar Binks and constipated Kylo Ren). And drum roll please so long “Dancing With the Stars” which should have been named “Hoofing With the Has-Beens” all along.

Yet keeping kids from watching any Pixar movies say “Turning Red” or “The Incredibles” is going to be tough. Same goes for Disney animated musical features such as “Encanto” or “Frozen.”

What parents of young’uns can’t sing every single pluperfect lyric of “Let it Go” after hearing it over and over 10000 times?

Detour at Disney World?

Numero uno on the boycott list though is Disney World easily the state of Florida’s biggest tourist trap. Er I meant to say tourist destination.

A few years ago my frazzled friend Wango told her young daughter they could not make the car trip 260 miles south to Central Florida because the Disney World theme park burned to the ground. A few days later the daughter stormed home from elementary school and said “That’s not true at all mom. Disney World didn’t go up like a kitchen match. All the kids at school said so. One just got back from Disney World.”

Got to admit it was a nice try Wango.

There are much better reasons to boycott Disney World than getting your panties in a bunch because The House of Mouse supports its gay lesbian bi non-binary and trans employees.

Now that nearly everyone has decided to ignore the pandemic and is headed back to Florida why not ban Uncle Walt’s playground for some actual reasons? Such as:

Sticker shock

It costs a fortune to buy admission tickets to Disney World. The base price to get in the front gate is $109 for adults and $104 for kids under 10. It cost $3.50 when the park opened in October 1971 (still too expensive if you ask me). Staying the night at the new Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser hotel on Disney World grounds starts at $1209 per guest. (At that price the room should come with a real Wookiee and Yoda as your personal housekeeper.)

Get ready to wait

The lines for the rides and attractions usually bog down to a crawl at peak park hours. The wait to meet Mickey Mouse at the Town Square Theater can drag on for 90 minutes which must be a joy with toddlers. An official “downloadable” photo of you your rug rat and the giant rodent will set you back somewhere in the neighborhood of $17. A basic pair of Mickey Mouse ears for your kid’s noggin go for around $15. Uncle Walt’s daycare sure is expensive.

Those yowling kids

My nephew when he lived in Orlando routinely flew as a business passenger as part of his job. He called the incoming and outgoing flights Kindergartens in The Sky. The Orlando-bound rides were packed with over-excited kids on their way to meet The Mouse.

On the way out the planes were full of sunbaked dehydrated ornery brats who didn’t want to leave Orlando. Now imagine they are at the theme park and multiply the din by 100. For added pleasure toss in meltdowns tantrums and angry conversations of one parent blaming the other. The House of Mouse should really post tables of divorce attorneys by the exit.

Welcome to the surface of the sun

The average summer temperature in Orlando is 94 degrees Fahrenheit. I am sure that is a little off. It feels more like 294 degrees.

I dare you to go to Disney World in August. Sizzling pavement. Unrelenting heat. Afternoon downpours. The worst rainstorm I have ever survived in Florida was on Interstate 4 in Orlando during the summer. I have been in car washes with better visibility. That is saying something coming from this fifth generation Floridian.

Talk about an actual swamp stomp

Face it visitors are basically walking around in a paved-over Florida swamp. As my staunch conservationist dad in North Florida always said of Disney World: “Why would anyone pay to visit a fake swamp that was built on top of a real swamp? Man can’t improve on nature. That’s hubris.” Disney Springs? Yeah right.

The clueless crowds

Why do some people feel the need to walk side by side and take up as much room as possible at Disney World? Why do they cluster at the entrance area and block the way into a ride? Why do they breathe down your neck while rubbernecking in line? Why do they yell at their kids in public? Why do they think you want to hear their inane cellphone calls? Why do they not believe in sunblock? Why does everyone look so (expletive) unhappy at The Happiest Place on Earth?

I can easily resist the hassles of Disney World but blocking Disney as a whole won’t be so easy.

Disney World according to one whack-a-doo conspiracy theory contains the cryogenically frozen head of creator Walt Disney (1901-1966). It’s stashed away in the labyrinth of secret tunnels beneath the park. One day Uncle Walt and his noodle will be reunited with a living body.

On that day I will call Disney a “woke” company.

Now if you’ll excuse me I have to solve problems in my “woke” math textbook.

Netflix took a nosedive on Tuesday with an earnings report that proved that it could not suspend the law of gravity forever. The steady upward climb of Netflix subscriber gains had to stop sometime and that sometime was Q1 2022.

The jolt that the news of six-figure losses in Q1 and a projected seven-figure loss for Q2 packed a wallop on Netflix stock price. It also dealt a blow to the Hollywood psyche about the long-term promise of streaming reminiscent of how the earth quaked in August 2015 when then-Disney CEO Bob Iger acknowledged that even the mighty ESPN had faced “some subscriber losses.”

That became the moment that Hollywood begrudgingly had to acknowledge that cord-cutting was a real threat. Will Netflix’s big miss become enshrined eventually as the moment the content bubble burst? Only time and content spend disclosures will tell.

The sense of relief in the AT&T CEO’s voice came in crystal clear even through the tinny webcast audio. The telco giant is glad to be seeing WarnerMedia in the rear-view mirror after closing the spinoff transaction with Discovery on April 8.

Popular on Variety

AT&T’s Q1 results message to Wall Street analysts took inspiration from the Shakers: ‘Tis a gift to be simple.

Stankey and AT&T chief financial officer Pascal Desroches used the words “simple” and “simplified” no less than eight times during the 70-minute call to describe the new-and-improved AT&T balance sheet. The company’s new growth focus even comes with handy built-in alliteration: 5G and fiber.

It’s not hard to understand why Stankey sounded happy to be talking about its direct stewardship of Warner Bros. HBO and the Turner networks in the past tense. With the streaming wars now being synonymous with the spending wars AT&T has just offloaded $55 billion in debt and a metric ton of competitive pressures and headwinds in media and entertainment. And it got a boatload of cash in return plus a majority of the equity in the successor company.

The responsibility for funding HBO Max‘s growth is now off of AT&T’s books (mostly). If David Zaslav Warner Bros. Discovery‘s intrepid new leader manages to make the enlarged company work on a global scale upside will flow to AT&T shareholders. And if not Stankey who is nothing if not an experienced dealmaker made the best of a bad situation to help mitigate the pain for AT&T shareholders after the telco’s wild ride in media.

“With the completion of the WarnerMedia transaction AT&T received $40.4 billion in cash and WarnerMedia’s retention of certain existing debt. Additionally AT&T shareholders received 1.7 billion shares of Warner Bros. Discovery representing 71% of the new company” Stankey intoned. “This transaction greatly strengthens our balance sheet and provides us with financial flexibility going forward. We now have a simplified capital allocation framework.”

Surely AT&T created a smoking crater in its balance sheet with ill-timed purchases of DirecTV (for $48 billion) in 2015 and Time Warner (for $84.5 billion) in 2018. There’s no totaling the lost opportunity costs for both sides of the AT&T/TW merger for the more than five years of unhappy marriage that began with the initial acquisition agreement in October 2016. (The final pricetag for AT&T also has to include the untold millions it spent to prevail against the Justice Department’s quixotic antitrust lawsuit.)

On Thursday Stankey presided over the disclosure of HBO Max’s subscriber figures for the last time — and they were credible with a 3 million gain over Q4 reaching a 76.8 million total worldwide. Hours after he spoke David Zaslav the new leader of Warner Bros. Discovery pulled the plug on niche streamer CNN+ less than 30 days after it was launched in the waning weeks of the previous WarnerMedia regime’s tenure. Chalk it up to merger mania.

HBO Max’s numbers looked downright strong compared to Netflix’s slump. So why did the AT&T chief sound even happier to be talking in granular terms regarding AT&T’s standing in telco and wireless “flow share” and the like? The answer seems pretty simple.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNici5jb20vd2FybmVyLWJyb3RoZXJzLWRpc2NvdmVyeS1hcnJvd3ZlcnNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will Warner Brothers Discovery End The Arrowverse?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNici5jb20vd2FybmVyLWJyb3RoZXJzLWRpc2NvdmVyeS1hcnJvd3ZlcnNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDQvMjQvYnVzaW5lc3MvbWVkaWEvY25uLXBsdXMtZGlzY292ZXJ5LXdhcm5lci5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inside the Implosion of CNN+,"David Zaslav had been chief executive of Warner Bros.

His team had just gotten its first look at data from CNN+ the much-promoted subscription streaming service started two weeks before and the news was grim. Fewer than 10000 viewers were watching at any given time despite a multimillion dollar ad campaign and big hires like Chris Wallace. They were recommending a cold-eyed review.

Discovery.

Less than a month after the launch of CNN+ — a subscription video streaming news service offshoot of CNN — Warner Bros. Discovery abruptly shut it down a “u-turn” that “was front-page news stunning news and painful news for everyone involved” Stelter said adding “Years of development possibly down the drain. Some of the shows may never be seen. Hundreds of staffers may be laid off though the company is trying to place many of them in new jobs.”

But he said the streaming service was “doomed” from the start.

“Amid these bruising headlines folks are trying to make sense of it. Some partisans are leading a predictable talking point that it’s about politics. But the truth is this was a corporate move” he said. “This CNN+ service was doomed because of the timing of a merger and clashing streaming strategies. The new owner Warner Brothers Discovery has big plans to combine multiple streaming platforms to make one big challenger for Netflix.”

Axios reporter Sara Fischer agreed with Stelter’s assumption that the new company assessed the streamer as a potential business loss after Jeff Zucker resigned in February.

“After CNN’s head Jeff Zucker exited…executives at Discovery were questioning whether CNN+ fit in within their strategy” Fischer began pointing out that those new execs wanted a large competitor for Netflix but that they saw CNN+ as just a small subscription service.

“They thought ‘this is too expensive; it might not ever get to profit on time and it doesn’t fit in with what we want to do’” she said. “’It’s better to cut it off now than to keep it lagging for months while they decide.’”

The merger placed AT&T’s Warner Bros. CNN Turner and Discovery’s stable of cable networks under one massive roof — as well as streaming services Discovery+ and HBO Max possibly giving the combined entity a fighting chance of moving into competition with Netflix and Disney+ among the leading streaming services.

The deal also combined WarnerMedia’s U.S. sports rights including those with the NBA MLB and March Madness with Discovery international sports giant Eurosport.

The new company headed up by CEO David Zaslav has an estimated worth of $130 billion.

“With our collective assets and diversified business model Warner Bros. Discovery offers the most differentiated and complete portfolio of content across film television and streaming” Zaslav said in a February statement about the merger. “We are confident that we can bring more choice to consumers around the globe while fostering creativity and creating value for shareholders.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDQvMjQvY25uLXBsdXMtd2hhdC13ZW50LXdyb25nLXdoeS1pdC13YXMtY2FuY2VsZWQuaHRtbNIBVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIyLzA0LzI0L2Nubi1wbHVzLXdoYXQtd2VudC13cm9uZy13aHktaXQtd2FzLWNhbmNlbGVkLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What doomed CNN+?

Chris Licht wasn't supposed to start his new job as CNN's chief until May. But on Thursday he found himself addressing about 400 full-time CNN+ staffers some in person and some through a remote video feed. Hundreds of other CNN employees had gotten hold of the remote link which was passed around from person to person to hear what their new boss had to say. Licht's introductory speech to many employees wasn't what he'd initially expected when he agreed to take over for Jeff Zucker earlier this year. Licht told employees the project they'd been working on for the past six to nine months the subscription streaming service CNN+ was ending April 30 about a month after its launch. He acknowledged that many would lose their jobs. Licht who officially starts May 2 quit his job as the executive producer of ""The Late Show With Stephen Colbert"" to run CNN. On Thursday he came across as passionate and empathetic according to people who listened to him speak.

The CNN+ debacle CNN+ will only end up lasting a few weeks. Several factors led to its demise. Here are some key takeaways: Before their merger Discovery and WarnerMedia executives couldn't discuss planning operations. Discovery's leaders were already skeptical of CNN+.

WarnerMedia executives expected CNN+ to reach 2 million subscribers after a year but the new leadership saw the service's early numbers as weak.

David Zaslav CEO of the new Warner Bros. Discovery has another streaming strategy in mind that focuses on bundling not standalones.

For some CNN+ employees it was the first time they'd heard from Licht. But awkwardly for scores of others it wasn't — they had met Licht just two days earlier when he toured CNN's New York headquarters. Licht made a point to stop by the 16th floor which had recently been converted from a Turner Broadcasting floor to the home of CNN+.

He shook hands with employees — whoever happened to be in the office that day — with no hint that two days later he'd tell them the standalone streaming service would be shuttered. CNN+ staffers will be allowed to reapply to other roles at CNN. Axios reported about half or 350 employees will likely be laid off. ""This is a uniquely shitty situation"" Licht said more than once on Thursday according to people in attendance. What led to CNN+'s launch on March 29 and its rapid demise is an unusual mix of corporate deal-making leadership disagreement unexpected resignations and legal restrictions. ""It will be a Harvard case study"" said one Warner Bros. Discovery executive. CNBC spoke with a dozen people directly involved with CNN+ about why it folded so quickly — and why it ever launched in the first place.

CNN+ is born

Zucker and deputy Andrew Morse CNN's head of global digital business who eventually became CNN+'s chief initially discussed launching a streaming service in early 2020 months before Jason Kilar joined WarnerMedia as chief executive according to people familiar with the matter.

Jason Kilar Phil McCarten | Reuters

In Kilar Zucker and Morse found a digital evangelist. He was brought on to transform WarnerMedia into a company that revolved around streaming video rather than one that centered around distributing content to cable networks and movie theaters. The CNN leadership envisioned CNN+ as something akin to The New York Times – a subscription news product that would eventually house video podcasts and all of CNN's interview and entertainment programming. CNN also felt it had a global branding advantage over the Times which is known more in the U.S. than abroad. Kilar believed CNN needed a digital subscription strategy having seen scores of advertising-based digital media properties suffer from low valuations and volatile ad markets. Over time as millions of households cancel their cable subscriptions each year CNN+ would become the landing spot for CNN's linear network. Similar to ESPN.com executives planned on CNN.com populating with more and more paywalled content and pushing CNN+ subscriptions. Executives researched potentially making all of CNN.com part of a subscription but decided the content wasn't strong enough to merit a full paywall. CNN.com is already profitable and is the most viewed news website frequently generating more than 200 million unique visitors globally each month. CNN hired consulting firm McKinsey to help with the operations of CNN+ but Kilar Zucker and Morse handled the strategy. Based on months of research they believed CNN+ would get to 2 million subscribers at the end of year one. Kilar believed that figure was a ""layup"" and a conservative estimate. The goal was to compete with The New York Times which crossed the 10 million subscriber mark this year after acquiring digital sports website The Athletic. WarnerMedia executives had a plan to meet their goal: They would use HBO Max CNN.com and CNN's linear channel as a constant marketing presence – a ""funnel"" – to push subscribers. The strategy was to launch CNN+ in the beginning of this year and then bundle it with HBO Max in September. This ""would you like fries with that"" approach for the millions of subscribers that sign up for HBO Max (HBO and HBO Max had 3 million new net adds last quarter) would ultimately lead to a robust globally scaled news service.

A series of unexpected events

Both Zucker and Kilar were caught off guard by AT&T's decision to spin off WarnerMedia and merge it with Discovery Communications — a deal announced in May 2021. Neither were involved in the merger discussions which were primarily held in secret between AT&T Chief Executive John Stankey and Discovery CEO David Zaslav. The merger gave Zucker a second wind. He was longtime friends with Zaslav who would be replacing Kilar as CEO of the new company. Instead of reporting to AT&T's suits Zucker seemed in line for a big role under Zaslav. As CNBC reported Zucker decided that summer he wouldn't leave at the end of the year after all. With a refreshed career outlook Zucker began digging into CNN+. Kilar entrusted him with setting its strategy and programming.

Zucker set a launch date in the first quarter of 2022 and began hiring hundreds of people as producers software engineers and marketing support. CNN Worldwide Chief Marketing Officer Allison Gollust was in charge of promoting the new service. Morse ran the day-to-day operations. Zucker had the greenlight from Kilar to spend hundreds of millions on the new service to give CNN a jumpstart into the digital era. ""We are going to take a pretty big swing here and the company's behind it"" Morse said in July 2021 when CNN formally announced it would build the new service. The plan was to premiere with eight to 12 hours of live programming a day on the service. Zucker began signing up outside talent to anchor shows including Kasie Hunt who departed NBC News to take the job and longtime Fox News anchor Chris Wallace. When the merger was announced AT&T said the deal would likely close in the middle of 2022. Given that timeline the CNN team set a launch date for CNN+ for the first quarter of 2022. That would give the service a few months of breathing space before Zaslav's leadership team took over for Kilar who already knew he wasn't staying on at the company post merger. Zucker wanted to launch the service in January but ran into technical trouble. CNN was making a product from scratch with a brand new tech stack rather than simply building on top of HBO Max. That took time and CNN didn't want to launch a buggy product. Zucker and Morse recalibrated to launch at the end of March. As the months passed regulators got through the approval process more quickly than initially expected. By February AT&T and Discovery were targeting a close date of around April 11 – months earlier than anticipated. That put the launch of CNN+ just weeks before the merger's close date. And then on February 2 Zucker suddenly resigned.

Impact of Zucker's resignation

Superficially Zucker's departure over an undisclosed relationship with Gollust didn't change the trajectory of the product. Staffers say the day-to-day activity around the division wasn't particularly interrupted by the sudden absences because Morse remained and continued to steer the ship forward. If anything CNN+ became a unifying mission for staffers. While CNN may have lacked a clear forward strategy with interim leadership and a merger about to happen launching CNN+ on time was a clear goal for employees. In that sense the primary effect of Zucker and Gollust's resignations wasn't necessarily harm for the CNN+ product. Rather their exits firmed the resolve of remaining employees to launch — even with the merger close weeks away. The CNN+ that launched on March 29 looked quite a bit like Zucker's vision. There were fewer live programming hours than the eight to 12 stated in July which may have hurt the product given demand for news and content regarding the war in Ukraine but it launched more or less as designed. But without Gollust internal sources said marketing of the product wasn't as strong in the key weeks before launch. Staffers said Morse was working overtime by that point trying to wear multiple hats by running the service and getting support from corporate — previously the jobs of Zucker and Gollust. As a result the internal marketing of CNN+ — how CNN executives viewed the product compared with Discovery's incoming leadership — helped lead to its demise.

Different strategies

By early this year Zaslav had settled on a streaming strategy for Warner Bros. Discovery. He wanted to push together HBO Max and Discovery+ and use news and live sports from WarnerMedia to make the streaming bundle even more attractive. The collection of assets he thought could take on Netflix as a global streaming behemoth. CNN will ultimately be a tab within the larger HBO Max-Discovery+ service.

David Zaslav President & CEO of Discovery Inc. Anjali Sundaram | CNBC

That made the existence of CNN+ antithetical to his strategy. If Warner Bros. Discovery was spending hundreds of millions of dollars making programming for CNN+ Zaslav felt the company was misallocating resources. Wall Street tends to judge media companies on their main streaming product. Disney largely trades on Disney+ subscriber numbers. The Warner Bros. Discovery share price will likely move on the bundled number of HBO Max-Discovery+ customers. CNN+ would be a sideshow niche product. Even if it showed growth taking subscribers away from the larger bundle with the promise of a cheaper option in CNN+ would hurt Warner Bros. Discovery and represent a waste of resources. One particularly irritating trait of CNN+'s pricing plan to Discovery executives was its ""Deal of a Lifetime"" plan — offering a 50% discount (initially $2.99 per month instead of $5.99) for as long a consumer remains a subscriber to CNN+. While that may be a great perk for a CNN+ subscriber it was a strategic misfit for Zaslav. For anyone who would have signed up to the larger bundle because of CNN content they now had a ""forever"" reason not to do so. Discovery had also already tried niche subscription streaming products having rolled out GolfTV cycling streaming network GCN+ and Food Network Kitchen in 2020 and 2021. None of those products moved the needle for Discovery. Zaslav and other members of the Discovery leadership including JB Perrette who was taking over as Warner Bros. Discovery 's head of streaming didn't want to waste time plowing ahead with a strategy they'd already decided didn't work. Kilar Zucker and Morse fundamentally disagreed with the strategy of using CNN as an HBO Max supporter. By giving CNN its own separate home consumers enter a world of news and don't leave when they see the variety of content CNN offers. If CNN is part of the larger HBO Max-Discovery+ world they feared viewers will decide they'd rather watch a reality TV show or HBO drama. The effect would be to substantially diminish the value of CNN over time. But Zaslav's team thought the New York Times comparison was silly. The New York Times turned digital users into paying subscribers by putting their content offering behind a paywall. CNN wasn't doing that. Instead CNN would be trying to convince an existing user base already getting content for free from CNN.com and watching CNN on cable TV to pay $6 more per month for programming Discovery saw as unnecessary. Instead Zaslav's team felt the correct comparison was Fox's streaming service Fox Nation which has reached 1.5 million subscribers since launching in 2018.

The launch

In the weeks before the launch Morse began begging Kilar and other AT&T executives to see if there was a way he could speak with the Discovery leaders. Staffers described it as Morse ""shouting from the rooftops"" for a meeting. CNBC reported the day after Zucker left in February that Discovery wasn't enamored with CNN+ and disagreed with the strategy. The next day Zaslav told CNBC he ""hadn't gotten a business review on what CNN+ is going to be and how it's going to be offered"" which was an ominous statement for its future. Morse wanted to find out directly from Discovery what Zaslav wanted. But AT&T told CNN's team it couldn't have any discussions with Discovery because of so-called gun-jumping laws which don't allow the two sides to discuss future strategy until a merger closes. Kilar never spoke with Zaslav about CNN+ and he wasn't going to make decisions about what he thought was best for CNN+ based on media reports. Zaslav did meet with CNN executives in early March in a so-called ""parlor"" meeting with Michael Bass Amy Entelis and Ken Jautz who were running CNN after Zucker left as first reported by Puck's Dylan Byers. In that meeting Zaslav inquired about CNN+ and its go-forward strategy but lawyers in attendance told him he wasn't allowed ask about it. So Morse pushed ahead. In the first two weeks after CNN+ launched 150000 subscribers paid for CNN+. Yet as CNBC reported fewer than 10000 watched on a daily basis. That number was actually closer to 4000 a source has since told CNBC. WarnerMedia executives were actually excited about the start. They viewed the daily active user or DAU statistic as pointless. The key metric for all digital services has always been number of subscribers. But Discovery executives felt the 150000 subscribers wasn't nearly enough of a foundation to reach 2 million within a year. They knew there wasn't a hit show coming to CNN+. They saw subscriber numbers declining day after day after an initial pop. And they viewed the daily active user number as significant. But they also weren't going to make a decision about CNN+ when its new leader Licht hadn't even started. So Discovery asked Licht to start work early behind the scenes so he could make a determination about what to do with the service. At 8 a.m. ET on April 11 — the first day Warner Bros. Discovery began trading as a combined company — Licht and Perrette told Morse and his team that CNN+'s marketing budget was immediately going to zero. It was Licht's first meeting at CNN. CNN+ staffers left that meeting knowing the product wasn't going to continue as is. They hoped it wouldn't be shut down completely although they feared a decision had already been made. Morse and his team argued the product was just 12 days old. They said DAUs were a silly statistic. They tried to make the point that Alex MacCallum CNN+'s head of product had come from The New York Times and The Washington Post. CNN was a news service and it shouldn't be judged against niche entertainment streaming services. They argued 150000 subscribers is far more than The New York Times The Washington Post or The Wall Street Journal got in their first two weeks after they launched their digital subscription products. But Discovery had never thought that comparison was relevant. The April 11 discussion never got heated but there was clear resignation from the CNN+ side. It was an hour-long meeting to go over two years of work. Ten days later Licht announced he'd decided to kill the product. Morse said last week he's leaving the company after a transition period.

CNN+'s legacy

CNN staffers roundly share frustration that Discovery didn't backchannel information to delay the CNN+ launch if they were that unhappy with the strategy. But both Discovery and AT&T didn't want to risk dooming an industry-altering deal over CNN which makes up less than 10% of WarnerMedia's annual revenue. They wonder whether the reason Discovery chose not to relay information in the months leading up to CNN+'s launch was so Discovery can count the hundreds of layoffs and saved operation costs from the service's shutdown as part of the $3 billion in synergies Zaslav has promised Wall Street as part of the merger rationale. CNN+ isn't part of the $3 billion promised by Zaslav according to two people familiar with the matter. Kilar has been very public about his belief in CNN+. On its launch day on March 29 he wrote a series of tweets touting its importance. ""In my opinion CNN+ is likely to be as important to the mission of CNN as the linear channel service has been these past 42 years. It would be hard to overstate how important this moment is for CNN"" he tweeted adding: ""CNN+ is also important b/c it is CNN unmistakably embracing a scalable robust paid digital business model."" Some at CNN wonder whether Zucker could have saved the product given his relationship with Zaslav. But it's also possible his surprise exit allowed the Warner Bros. Discovery CEO to dodge a bullet. He wouldn't have to tell his friend that the pet project he'd spent the past year on didn't have a home at Warner Bros. Discovery. Zucker and Zaslav haven't spoken since Zucker's resignation. Whoever is to blame for Zucker leaving his departure made CNN a less stable asset and one that has given Zaslav his first major headache as CEO of the combined company. Several past and present CNN staffers told CNBC they believe the CNN+ debacle may speak to a new era of CNN. While many WarnerMedia employees have complained about working under the ownership of a phone company that didn't understand entertainment AT&T largely left CNN and Zucker alone. Zucker wielded a lot of power at WarnerMedia and had full backing for his vision at CNN. Axios reported WarnerMedia planned to spend $1 billion on CNN+ in the next four years. Zaslav's swift ax to CNN+ in combination with Warner Bros. Discovery board member John Malone's comments to CNBC about returning CNN to hard news signal a more active corporate hand over the organization's future. From now on CNN's strategy will have to align with its parent company. There's fear among CNN staffers that if the news organization is only seen as a companion piece for a streaming bundle it won't be able to flourish as a brand as linear TV subscribers melt away. The ramifications of that shift are still unknown. But it will be a culture change for a cable news network whose executives had gotten used to getting what they asked for. With CNN+ they clearly didn't."
WM,Waste Management,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vYm9yZ2VucHJvamVjdC5vcmcvd2FzdGUtbWFuYWdlbWVudC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Laos’ Commitment to Waste Management,"

Laos known as the Lao People’s Democratic Republic is one of the most impoverished countries in Southeast Asia. However over the last 20 years its economy has been one of the fastest-growing in the region resulting in an increase in the amount of waste generated. Waste management systems struggle to keep up with this increased waste. Waste management in Laos is “limited to urban centers” and tends to be poorly managed with just 40%-60% of waste collected. Pollution affects the Lao people negatively resulting in around 10000 deaths per year according to a 2021 study by the World Bank. With waste management emerging as a dire issue the World Bank the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) are offering support to address the issue.

The Larger Part of the Issue

Around four million tonnes of plastic waste discharges into the world’s seas annually mostly originating from rivers in Asia such as the Mekong which goes through Vietnam Thailand Cambodia and Laos. About 70 million people rely on this river for food and resources especially in Laos though it is “one of the dirtiest in the world.” The Laotian lifestyle is transitioning from a “traditional and subsistence-based lifestyle” to a more urban lifestyle that focuses more on consumerism and imported goods.

The lack of waste dump sites and formal infrastructure significantly and directly impacts the health of citizens especially when resorting to disposal practices such as burning burying trash and discarding waste in rivers. Testing of the water sources across more than 3000 households in Laos shows that E.Coli in drinking water contaminated 86% of the household population. Furthermore even for homes using bottled water a staggering 85% of individuals had E. Coli in their bottled water.

Making the Effort

Laos citizens view plastics as a luxury item portraying a sign of economic progression. However this mindset also contributes to plastics becoming the second-largest type of waste accounting for up to 24% of total waste generated by Laos. But even as plastic and other wastes are prevalent cities such as Luang Prabang are making an effort to keep the area’s streets clean. With the locals taking action to actively keep the city clean these city-dwellers set the example for other city-dwellers in Laos. Responsibility is on communities and households especially as Laos has a small budget for addressing the waste management issue.

A World Bank 2022 Get CLEAN and GREEN – Solid waste and Plastic Management in Lao PDR report recommends strategies to resolve the waste management issue. One strategy is to move from a linear to a “circular economy.” This would reduce waste by “reusing repairing refurbishing and recycling existing materials and products.”

The UNDP’s Work

The UNDP gathered a focus group of around 30 university students from diverse economic backgrounds finding that close to 90% of students realize how poor waste management impacts the planet. The organization gave students suggestions for taking action such as establishing task forces in communities and using social media to share information on helping as green advocates.

The UNDP also found that students who learned to separate waste in schools were eager to follow waste separation procedures. An online UNDP survey shows that social media would influence the mindsets and behaviors of more than 80% of respondents. The UNDP considers the immediate banning of plastic as critical.

The GGGI is aiding in solid waste management in the capital city of Vientiane formulating a 10-year Strategy and Action Plan. It also has created four project activities:

Decentralized garbage collection services

A Waste Bank and the designation of the role of waste pickers

Organic waste segregation systems and private composting companies

Glass recycling involving 10 elementary schools to maximize waste disposal

Looking Ahead

While the Lao PDR transitions to a more urban economy and struggles with waste organizations have offered solutions to support a more sanitary Laos which will benefit the health and well-being of people. As education reaches citizens and offers them pathways out of poverty Laos can create a safer cleaner and more prosperous country for its populace. And if the country does lean more toward a “circular economy” Laos could be on its way to reaching a net carbon neutral status by 2040.

The law S.B. 1383 which took effect in January ""requires supermarkets and other big food providers to divert as much as a quarter of edible food now destined for dumps to food banks to feed the needy"" the Los Angeles Times reported in December. ""It tasks cities and counties with formulating local plans with a statewide goal of recovering 20% of edible food by 2025"" Reuters reported earlier this month. S.B. 1383 is the nation's first statewide law to require businesses to donate excess food to be eaten by hungry people. Compliance requirements which will ultimately include fines are being phased in. ""First large grocery stores and food wholesalers; later restaurants and cafeterias will have to comply or face fines"" ABC7 reported last week.

In addition to fighting hunger the law was also intended to combat food waste—which has an outsized contribution to greenhouse gas emissions as food sent to landfills belches methane a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. The massive scale of food waste is an enormous problem. As I detail in my book Biting the Hands that Feed Us: How Fewer Smarter Laws Would Make Our Food System More Sustainable nearly 40 percent of all our food—roughly 40 million tons of it—goes to waste in the field during processing in transit at the store and/or on the plate. The value of that lost food totals more than $165 billion every year. Ten percent of the money Americans spend on food goes to waste. The environmental costs of that waste are colossal. Food waste is the third-leading contributor to atmospheric greenhouse gasses. And food that's wasted still uses the same inputs to grow—water fertilizer pesticides fuel wages—as food that's eaten. ""Those resources are all used up whether a food is eaten or is left to rot in a field or landfill"" I note in the book.

Giddy supporters have been busy touting the upside of California law. ""This will reduce food waste and address food insecurity for millions of people"" Alhambra Mayor Sasha Renée Pérez tweeted earlier this year. ""California leads again!"" Last month San Diego's CBS affiliate reported the law had caused a dramatic jump in food donations there calling the law ""great news"" because it means ""more food going to residents of San Diego that might otherwise go hungry [and] that food won't have the opportunity to rot in a landfill and emit harmful greenhouse gasses in the process.""

Yet multiple reports now highlight the fact that complying with the law is ""proving easier said than done"" ABC7 in Los Angeles reports. That's because grocers restaurants food banks local governments and others haven't ""figure[d] out who is responsible for reclaiming [food] leftovers [under the law] and how to pay the costs of doing so."" Those costs have only skyrocketed due to record gas prices. Given these challenges it's ""been hard for local food banks and small towns to implement [the law] due to climbing fuel costs and uncertainty over who pays for food recovery"" Reuters notes.

While record fuel costs may have been difficult to predict other cost increases had been expected under the law. ""A survey by the League of California Cities found that most local governments expect refuse collection rates to increase less than 20% with 1 in 5 cities saying they expect charges to go up more"" the L.A. Times explained last year in a piece on the new law which also contains requirements for setting aside compostable food waste at home. ""Costa Mesa an early adopter of curbside green recycling estimates that over nine years monthly rates will have risen a total of $6.10 to $24.10 a month by 2023-24.""

Despite rumors to the contrary there are few barriers in place for businesses that want to donate leftover food to people in need and the organizations that aid them. The Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Act signed into law by Pres. Bill Clinton more than 25 years ago protects charitable individual and commercial food donors from most civil and criminal liability.

Mandatory government rules for reducing or eliminating food waste ignore the fact that the government bears a great deal of responsibility for creating food waste in the first place: like the federally-backed industry group that sets tart cherry quotas forcing farmers whose crops exceed the quota to trash the supposedly excess amount; or the terrible waste management contract Oakland signed in 2015 that made it cheaper for restaurants to throw food away rather than compost it.

I bet California lawmakers meant well in passing the measure to combat food waste and hunger but before they crafted yet another law that looks to be hurting the little guy—food banks struggling businesses small cities and towns in California and people in need in this case—they might've explored and addressed ways government itself causes or contributes to those same problems.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kb2hhLWhpYS1sYXVuY2hlcy1uZXctZW52aXJvbm1lbnRhbC1pbml0aWF0aXZlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Doha's HIA Launches New Environmental Initiative Amid Zero Landfill Ambitions,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kb2hhLWhpYS1sYXVuY2hlcy1uZXctZW52aXJvbm1lbnRhbC1pbml0aWF0aXZlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyaWJ1bmVpbmRpYS5jb20vbmV3cy9qYWxhbmRoYXIvd2FzdGUtbWFuYWdlbWVudC1wcm9qZWN0LWluLWphbGFuZGhhci1hLW5vbi1zdGFydGVyLTM4ODY1NtIBZGh0dHBzOi8vbS50cmlidW5laW5kaWEuY29tL25ld3MvamFsYW5kaGFyL3dhc3RlLW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtcHJvamVjdC1pbi1qYWxhbmRoYXItYS1ub24tc3RhcnRlci0zODg2NTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Waste management project in Jalandhar a non-starter,"Tribune News Service

Deepkamal Kaur

Jalandhar April 22

Even as a plan to implement Municipal Solid Waste Management Project for the city had been initiated way back in 2014 there has hardly been any headway even after the passage of over eight years.

Initially it was planned that the waste from not just Jalandhar city but also 20 urban local bodies falling in its periphery would land up at 75-acre site in Jamsher village where it would be used to generate energy but the project could not take off. There were reports that the power plant could generate some gases that could cause health issues. Also the residents of the area were averse to getting such a huge volume of waste loaded in several tippers landing up in their village daily.

Ever since it was planned that waste management would be done in smaller clusters and about 55 compost pits would be set up across the city so that the kitchen waste could be handled locally and be converted to manure. But even this project has so far not been successful as the residents have opposed to any waste pits coming up in their mohallas. Even the unions of safai karamcharis have not been forthcoming with the idea of waste segregation owing to their own vested interests the MC officials have alleged. While all developed urban cities leading in Swachhta Survekshan have been managing their waste well by ensuring segregation of wet and dry waste from every home collecting them in separate containers of the Municipal Corporation and disposing them off as manure or scrap nothing of the sort has happened in Jalandhar so far. The scheme to distribute blue and green bins had been initiated in some mohallas as a pilot project during the SAD-BJP government but the system could not sustain even for a month as the safai karamcharis had gone on strike against the move to hire private staff for the purpose.

Since the scheme could not pick up everything including recyclable stuff and compostable kitchen waste continues to be dumped in the MC’s landfill site at Wariana.

Says Congress councillor Jasleen Sethi “Waste management scheme is a total failure in Jalandhar. Neither the authorities nor the employees have shown any interest to execute it. Even if I segregate my kitchen waste and dry waste from my home and hand it over separately to the rag picker he will pour both bins in the same compartment of his cart making all effort go waste.”

Congress councillor Neerja Jain said “There was a proposal to set up a compost pit in my ward way back in 2018. By chance I was abroad those days. When I came back I was told that the mohalla people had opposed the plan and nothing has happened ever since”.

Karnesh Sharma MC chief said “We are working to get bio-mining project started in Wariana dumping site. The civil work which is on will get completed in 1.5 months. The processing will begin in the next 2.5 months and two years it should complete and we will be able to reclaim 22 acres land there. For fresh waste management I had recently attended a Smart City conference at Surat. I had met some people who had come up with start-up low cost proposals for fresh waste management. I expect a team to visit Jalandhar in the next 15 days and give a demonstration of their decentralised model of waste management”.

Sharma added: “We are also coming up with a new project of Kala Sanghian drain beautification. The DPR of the project will be ready in the next 10-15 days. We intend to beautify the site by lining the drain doing plantation along its 13 km length putting up inter-locking tiles and night lamps and creating a bio-diversity park there.”

The Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) had scheduled a public hearing in Ralol village of Limdi taluka Thursday for the treatment storage and disposal facility (TSDF) proposed by Row Gold Waste Management Pvt Limited (RGWMPL) a Rajkot-registered company.

As per the draft environment impact assessment (EIA) report submitted by the company to GPCB the company has acquired 4.85 hectare land in Ralol one kilometre off the National Highway 8 that connects Ahmedabad to Rajkot. The company proposes to set up a TSDF having the capacity to treat and store 2.75 lakh metric tonnes of hazardous industrial solid waste and dispose of it as landfilling material at the site. The company proposes to develop the facility at the cost Rs 30 crore of which Rs 2.74 crore will be earmarked for environment management scheme including prevention of pollution of land water and air.

“However people residing in Ralol and the nearby villages vehemently protested against the proposed project at the public hearing. They said they do not want this hazardous waste disposal facility in their vicinity. In the eye of the protests we accepted letters of objections submitted by six to seven village panchayats of nearby villages and wound up the proceedings” ND Zala resident additional collector (RAC) of Surendranagr told The Indian Express Friday.

The RAC was appointed as the presiding officer for the public hearing.

“As the locals are aggressively objecting to the proposed project it is for the project proponent to convince them and then approach GPCB again for rescheduling the public hearing” Zala added.

RGWMPL acquired the private land in the village for setting up the TSDF with an annual capacity to handle 204 metric tonnes of hazardous industrial waste. As per the draft EIA the facility will remain active for seven years and once its capacity of 2.75 lakh metric tonnes has been utilised it will be covered and that land water and air quality would be monitored in its vicinity for the next 30 years to prevent any leachate etc causing pollution. The project will generate employment for around 100 people during the construction phase and for around 20 persons during its operations.

The project proponent further claims in the EIA that besides member industries the proposed TSDF around 100 km away from Ahmedabad and 21 km east of Limbdi town will attract industries to the district.

“However the proposed project site is 3.5 kilometres away from the Bhogavo river. The project also envisaged drawing 30000 litres of water from Narmada canal which also passes by the project site. Given the poor record of monitoring of such TSDFs by the state government the dumping of hazardous industrial waste in the TSDF will pollute agricultural land aquifers and air in the area and make life difficult for the locals” said Mudita Vidrohi an activist with Gujarat Lok Samiti an NGO working for rights of people."

Domestic shipbuilder CSBC Corp delivered the second of four 4000-tonne patrol vessels ordered by the Coast Guard Administration (CGA) at a ceremony in Kaohsiung on Friday.

Christened the Hsinchu the vessel is to be dispatched to the northern branch of the CGA to protect the waters off Hsinchu.

The four frigates — the biggest patrol ships CSBC has ever manufactured — were commissioned by the government and are being built at a total cost of NT$11.74 billion (US$401.23 million) the CGA said.

The first of the series called the Chiayi was delivered on April 29 last year.

Designed based on the US Coast Guard’s Heritage-class offshore patrol cutter the ships are aimed at boosting Taiwan’s capability to carry out maritime patrols crack down on illicit activities on the open sea and conduct search and rescue missions.

Similar to the Chiayi the Hsinchu is equipped with three water cannons with a range of 120m has a range of 10000 nautical miles (18520km) and can travel at a maximum speed of 24 knots (44.4kph).

It also has a helipad and a hangar that can accommodate a UH-60 Black Hawk.

With built-in hospital-level medical centers equipped with operating theaters isolation wards negative pressure areas and X-ray facilities all frigates in the fleet can double as medical support vessels for humanitarian missions during peacetime and wartime.

CSBC said in a statement that the ship is emblazoned with the word “Taiwan” to distinguish it from Chinese vessels and display to the world Taiwan’s resolve to protect its territorial waters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vamFtYWljYS1nbGVhbmVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvMjAyMjA0MjMvZ29sZGluZy1ibGFtZXMtcG9vci1pbmZyYXN0cnVjdHVyZS10cmFnaWMtbW9iYXktZmxvb2Rz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Golding blames poor infrastructure for tragic MoBay floods,"WESTERN BUREAU:

Opposition Leader Mark Golding on Thursday blamed poor infrastructure and a lacklustre garbage-collection system for Tuesday’s devastating floods that caused the death of 12-year-old Jennel Walters whose grandmother 68-year-old Beryl Walters remains missing after also being washed away.

“The infrastructure of the city is really not adequate to address [torrential] rainfall and so we have regular flooding and now we’ve lost lives from this flooding” Golding said on Thursday as he visited the young girl’s Cornwall Courts family home in St James.

Reports are that Jennel Beryl and the child’s aunt Shannon Walters were passengers in a motor car being driven by Berris Walters Jennel’s grandfather when they were trapped by floodwaters along the Westgate main road on Tuesday.

The car was washed into the Montego River where Berris and Shannon were rescued by bystanders and emergency responders from the Montego Freeport Fire Station who braved the raging waters.

The body of Jennel a seventh-grader at Montego Bay High School was recovered near the cruise ship pier on Tuesday.

Golding comforted her grieving parents Christine Gilbert and Nicolas Walters reassuring them that the country was also mourning their loss.

“It’s a terrible tragedy for one family to lose a promising daughter in the first year of high school and her grandmother is still missing so they don’t really have closure yet” Golding told journalists.

He said Tuesday’s tragic death from the flooding is as a result of the ongoing problems of garbage collection in the country and the inadequate arrangement for drain cleaning.

“The municipal corporations are not getting the special allocation to manage the situation with drain cleaning and so there are a lot of problems with the overflow of water and the attendant damage and loss of lives” the opposition leader said.

He continued: “This is a serious issue which needs to be addressed and we are calling on the Government to look at the situation in Montego Bay in relation to how the drainage system is not working and what needs to be done.”

Golding argued that while the country has been building an excellent road network for decades “some of the basic infrastructure that are needed so that people can live and survive in their daily routines without danger is lacking and we need to see the Government responding to this”.

He called for the garbage-collection crisis in the country to be addressed noting that it was not unique to Montego Bay.

Sarah Szabo a Water Regulation/Zoning Specialist with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources said erosion occurs even when water levels are low.



But record-high water levels in 2020 the peak of a several-year stretch of elevated water levels on the Great Lakes produces larger waves that can move silt sand and gravel away from shore more quickly.



Stacy Hron a Water Resources Management Specialist with the Wisconsin DNR said the same type of erosion occurring on our state's Michigan coastline occurs along inland lakes and rivers as well.



""I don't think any one particular location is more impacted than others"" Hron said.



Szabo said the rising and falling of water levels in lakes and rivers is cyclical and depends heavily on precipitation.



She said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers works with NOAA to make predictions on weather roughly six months out. NOAA also consistently monitors the water levels of the Great Lakes.



But Szabo said beyond that it's difficult to know what to expect in regards to the water levels of Wisconsin's waterways and bodies of water.



She said climate change has changed precipitation patterns.



""All we know is the predictions say the highs will become more high and the lows will be lower"" Szabo said. ""That's a pretty common effect when you talk about climate change.""



Hron said people across the state from private property owners to local governments have used rocks or built structures to try and deflect erosion-causing waves from their respective shorelines.



She said those solutions can help - although they're not permanent.



People hoping to install erosion control structures do have to go through a permit process with the DNR.



Szabo said she's seen the price of such structures run from $100/ft. to $500/ft.



Szabo said there are no financial assistance programs through the state or federal government to help landowners with the cost.



Property owners concerned about losing shoreline can visit a resources page through seagrant.wisc.edu or else the DNR webpage on Great Lakes Shorelines. ​",,,,,,,,,,,,

But they had no intention of following other corporations in an exodus from the city’s business district.

While the city’s original business core has been hit by a wave of recent or planned corporate relocations some to newer digs elsewhere in the city Wells Fargo and a growing chorus of businesses are doubling down on downtown.

Wells Fargo said last week it will move from the Wells Fargo Tower on St. Paul later this year to one floor at 111 S. Calvert Street a renovated 28-story mixed-use tower at the Inner Harbor that also includes the 680-room Renaissance Hotel and the former Gallery at Harborplace mall.

Also on Friday the architecture firm Design Collective said it signed a 10-year-lease with room to grow at 100 E. Pratt St. the tower that is currently home to T. Rowe Price Group. Last fall Truist Bank formed through a merger between SunTrust and BB&T said it planned to keep its Maryland regional headquarters downtown at 120 E. Baltimore St. where SunTrust was located. And Alertus Technologies will be moving its headquarters from Beltsville to 10 N. Charles St. a building it bought citing downtown’s accessibility and amenities.

Additionally about 3300 workers at a dozen state agencies will be relocated to leased space downtown under a plan announced a year ago by Republican Gov. Larry Hogan.

While the leasing decisions stem from post-pandemic workplace evaluations and a desire to attract talent and encourage employees to return to offices full of upgrades and amenities the businesses say choosing the central business district shows a commitment and renewed confidence not only in those blocks but in the city as a whole.

Downtown Baltimore.

Wells Fargo has done business in Baltimore for more than a century entering the market in 1914. Relocating within the city’s central business district shows commitment to Baltimore and Maryland said John A. Allen Wells Fargo’s region bank executive for Maryland and Washington D.C.

“We want to be a dominant player in this market” and that means remaining downtown Allen said. “We want to be here.”

And many say they’ve been encouraged by momentum in key city projects such as the redevelopment of Lexington Market opening later this year and the renovation of Royal Farms Arena. Also Friday the city announced a new series of once-a-month one-day festivals at the Inner Harbor this summer.

Business leaders as well as leasing and city officials said they expect recently announced plans for new ownership and revitalization of Harborplace to further boost both the office market and downtown investment.

Baltimore developer P. David Bramble and his MCB Real Estate firm said earlier this month they have struck a deal to acquire Harborplace the struggling onetime centerpiece of Baltimore’s Inner Harbor redevelopment in the 1980s out of receivership. The deal would pave the way for what Bramble described as an extensive redevelopment effort to “completely re-imagine” the faded retail attraction and revitalize the city’s downtown waterfront.

“Having these businesses commit and recommit to downtown it gives the energy and momentum we need” said Shelonda Stokes president of the Downtown Partnership of Baltimore.

Such projects already are sparking more interest in downtown office leasing even from among businesses currently located outside the city said Bronwyn LeGette a senior director at real estate brokerage Cushman & Wakefield which helped Design Collective in its office search.

“A lot of people do realize that when you’re really competing for talent that’s really where the epicenter of the talent is and wants to be specifically because they can walk to work or bike to work or scooter to work” LeGette said. “There’s more density in downtown Baltimore for that type of lifestyle.”

The clock adorns the northwest corner of the current 24-story Wells Fargo Tower on Saint Paul Street. The building was formerly known as the First Union Signet Tower Wachovia Tower and Union Trust Building.

New investment downtown is expected to help counter a wave of recent or planned corporate relocations out of the central business district some of which has come as part of downsizing in response to increased remote work as a result of the pandemic.

Danish jeweler Pandora is seeking someone to sublease its office space at 250 W. Pratt St. downtown. Transamerica which now occupies the top nine floors of 100 Light St. plans to move to just one floor of the Wills Wharf office building in Harbor Point.

T. Rowe Price headquartered at 100 E. Pratt St. since 1975 broke ground last month on a future 550000-square-foot headquarters in Harbor Point. And Bank of America plans to move its Baltimore offices from downtown to the Legg Mason Tower in Harbor East.

Wells Fargo executives said they realize they are bucking a trend.

The bank said it plans to relocate all 108 corporate employees currently at St. Paul Street in retail banking and its commercial middle market banking group which serves business clients. The move likely will start before the St. Paul Street lease expires at the end of the year bank officials said. It is taking 17336 square feet and will have signage prominently displayed atop the Calvert Street building.

The bank also plans to close its branch in the current Wells Fargo Tower and is negotiating to open a new branch — likely by the end of the year — in the former Jos. A. Bank Clothiers store space at 100 E. Pratt St. which bank officials said offers prime ground-floor visibility.

After re-evaluating space needs based on changes in the workplace over the past 40 years and more recently during the pandemic Allen said bank officials decided to leave a building that was built and first occupied by Wells Fargo in 1980. For instance an entire floor used to be dedicated to training but now much of that work is done remotely. And the bank’s return-to-office policy now requires just three days a week in the office but even on designated days many workers spend more time out meeting with clients.

Derek Lynch Wells Fargo’s commercial banking leader in Baltimore who was involved in the new office search said it was important to stay within the central business district.

“We’re doubling down” he said. “Baltimore needs to succeed.”

He added that the bank is “bullish” on the Baltimore area’s economy. By midyear the bank expects to have doubled its loan commitments over 18 months to Maryland business clients in real estate health care technology manufacturing and port-related and other businesses.

Shelonda Stokes president of the Downtown Partnership of Baltimore talks in 2020 about the plan to relocate 3300 state employees to downtown Baltimore.

The head of Design Collective which now has an 85-employee office in Power Plant at the Inner Harbor said he thought it was important for the firm to remain downtown where it moved 30 years ago from Columbia. The lease for nearly two floors at 100 E. Pratt comes with building amenities such as a fitness center cafe and coffee shop harbor views and walkable amenities said Fred Marino the firm’s president and CEO.

“A lot of our employees live in the surrounding neighborhoods and so we wanted to be centrally located because a lot of them ride their bikes to work too” Marino said. “We looked all over the city but for a lot of reasons it seemed to make sense to stay in the downtown. We’re hoping to be a part of the new growth and revitalization that we’re hoping to see here in the downtown Baltimore area.”

The company will lease about the same amount of space nearly 27000 square feet with capacity to grow. Though employees have the option to work remotely two days a week the firm believes in the future of the office.

“In our profession there’s nothing like being in the office and being surrounded by other architects where you can learn from one another on a day-to-day basis” Marino said.

Brookfield Properties the owner of 111 S. Calvert said the 265000-square-feet of office space there will be 80% occupied with the addition of Wells Fargo and other new tenants announced last week. They include SIA Solutions an engineering and consulting firm and the law firm Evert Weathersby Houff Brookfield said. Current tenants include Ballard Spahr Cigna Health Lupin Pharmaceuticals and Niles Barton & Wilmer.

The building at Pratt and Calvert streets also includes the now shuttered Gallery mall and a five-level underground parking garage. Brookfield closed the mall at the end of the year and is continuing to explore plans for the multilevel space a Brookfield executive said.

The building’s leasing momentum follows the completion last fall of a $12 million revamp of the office space with upgrades such as health and wellness amenities said Robert Swennes executive vice president and head of the mid-Atlantic and southeast regions for Brookfield Properties.

“What they want is more of a hotel-like feel” Swennes said. “We’ve found as people come back to the office leadership wants something appealing to get their employees back. This is an engaging place to come to work.”

Renovations included several move-in-ready office suites a 24th floor lounge that includes a coffee bar and pantry a private wellness room for nursing parents a 45-person conference room and a 17th floor lounge with a terrace and a fitness center with locker rooms showers towel service and Peloton bikes.

Not all office tenants are downsizing in the wake of the pandemic and increased remote work Swennes said. As leases come due some tenants want more space and others have not changed requirements he said.

Some businesses may have reduced their space needs but are still out in the market seeking upgraded or more flexible space said Colin Tarbert president and CEO of the Baltimore Development Corp. Some are moving within downtown.

“A lot of businesses are re-thinking their office space in general” Tarbert said. “Generally businesses are creating more flexible workspaces for employees that might not be coming to the office five days a week.”

Many organizations looking downtown are re-imagining their space to be more about collaboration said Cushman & Wakefield’s LeGette.

“These spaces are more about connecting face-to-face collaboration technology … access to daylight walkable amenities” such as the harbor she said. “They can just walk right out the door and hit a promenade that has 7 1/2 miles of walkable waterfront.”

Swennes said Brookfield one of the nation’s largest owners of office real estate remains focused on downtowns such as Baltimore’s that offer both access and desirable views.

Downtown Baltimore “has had some challenges on the retail front” he said “but … we think it’s an incredibly dynamic place to come and work.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS93ZWxscy1mYXJnby12cC1rYXRoeS1vbHNvbi13aG8taGVscGVkLXRoZS1iYW5rLWdyb3ctZGllcy1hdC02MS82MDAxNjc0Mjcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wells Fargo VP Kathy Olson who helped the bank grow dies at 61,"As a kid Kathy Hensgens Olson crossed Linden Hills like a daredevil — climbing trees darting into woods and capsizing canoes on purpose on Lake Harriet.

As an adult she'd hone that energy bounding up Norwest Bank's corporate ladder and breaking protocol to get tough jobs done. She started as a Norwest teller in Uptown and ended 40 years later as Wells Fargo's senior vice president and technology manager in charge of 500 workers.

In between Olson headed human resources acquisitions built a service center in Bloomington and pulled off Wells Fargo's technology overhaul when COVID-19 forced employees home.

""She was a badass"" said daughter Kaitlyn who lost her mother to colon cancer on April 7. Olson was 61.

""She was one terrific lady. Funny. Smart witty and caring. Tough and fair"" said friend Marilyn Bix who hired Olson as a teller long ago.

The daughter of a Dutch immigrant and the oldest of four kids Olson embraced the ideals of sacrifice and hard work. As a youngster she lived in the basement of her grandmother's home. Her mom worked nights at the phone company putting Olson's dad through pharmacy school. He then worked three pharmacy jobs to put his wife through college. Then they bought their own home.

Growing up Olson sold newspapers popcorn and Wuollet's baked goods and she answered phones at the Prairie Motel. By her senior year at Regina Catholic High School she was enrolled both there and the University of Minnesota's Institute of Technology.

At 17 she joined Norwest Bank putting herself through college. Through dinners barbecues and job promotions the young professional melded her cohorts from grade school college bank and family.

""She was really good about being inclusive"" said her sister Marguerite Cutchey.

She met her husband Chris while skiing at Lutsen. Chris' brother was engaged to Kathy's sister Emily and the two families met. During a ski break Kathy surprised Chris with a beer. He jokingly asked her to marry him. She quipped ""Yes."" The real proposal came a year later and the couple settled in Bloomington. Kaitlyn was born two years later..

Charged with building Norwest's national call center in Bloomington Olson insisted new workers do the unheard of: field calls from home or chop up hours when they needed to care for kids. She silenced critics and took chances on people putting one outstanding worker in charge of training and another in charge of H.R. despite a lack of credentials. They flourished.

""She took a risk on me and that made me trust her even more"" said Sharon McCotter the former teller made HR chief. Olson quietly guided McCotter early on but sometimes corrected missteps publicly.

""She just told it like it was"" Chris Olson said. ""But everything she did was about being a mentor for people coming into the bank and into technology. [Caretaking] was a big thing for her.""

Before Olson's father died six years ago she promised to care for her ailing mom in his stead.

""Kathy became the matriarch of the family taking care of everyone"" Cutchey said. Even when dying herself Olson endured grueling treatments and ""did every thing in her power to last"" because she felt her responsibilities acutely.

With weeks left to live she finally entrusted her mom's care to her sister. With that worry gone Olson died one day after her daughter's birthday and on the same date her father passed.

Olson leaves behind Chris and Kaitlyn; her mother Kay; sisters Marguerite and Emily; and brother Nicolas.

ATLANTA — An hours-long standoff at a Wells Fargo bank in Marietta is the subject of the opening night film at this year's Atlanta Film Festival.

In 2017 Marine Veteran Brian Brown-Easley walked into the Marietta bank stated he had a bomb and began making demands largely - as portrayed in the film - stemming from frustrations toward the V.A.

Over the course of several hours Brown-Easley stayed inside the building with two female hostages all while negotiating with Cobb County Police.

By the time authorities managed to enter the building using a SWAT vehicle he was dead. Police at the time labeled the death as an ""officer-involved shooting.""

The movie now based on the incident ""892"" marks the feature debut of Abi Damaris Corbin a self-proclaimed Boston-bred writer/director currently working out of Los Angeles.

For her Brown-Easley's story was more than just the kind of ripped-from-the-headlines story that makes for an engaging crime picture.

""Brian's story is one that is deeply personal for me because my dad's a veteran"" Corbin explained. She added that after reading an article on Brown-Easley and the circumstances that drove him to holding up the bank she ""understood my dad better and had a lot more empathy.""

Corbin and her writing partner Kwame Kwei-Armah ultimately went through great detail to ensure the accuracy and truthfulness of their story listening to police recordings from the day 911 calls reading reports and even walking the path toward the bank itself.

""We really did our best to honor the truth of the story"" she added. The two even talked to Brown-Easley's wife to better understand the complicated man at the center of their story

But Corbin said it was ultimately the actors who took the time to get to know the real-life people they would be playing that would add the greatest authenticity; in particular John Boyega who portrays Brown-Easley.

Many will likely recognize Boyega from his role in the ""Star Wars"" franchise; however it was actually his part in a much smaller sci-fi flick that caught Corbin's eye.

""I'd seen him in 'Attack the Block' and am such a fan of his artistry and knew he had so much more to bring to the table"" she said. ""So when we talked it was just over the art of it. How can we do justice to this man's story? How can we make sure this story doesn't have to be told again in 20 years?""

Corbin went on to describe the young actor as ""hungry and ripe"" the kind of performer whose ""instrument was crafted to be able to give a performance that brought a humanity.""

Playing a hostage negotiator attempting to keep the situation inside the bank calm and under control Corbin cast the late Michael K. Williams who passed away last fall. The film marks one of his final on-screen performances.

Corbin spoke of the acclaimed actor and the effect he had not just on her but everyone around the set.

""When we first sat down together I said to him 'hey you're an elder statesman. This story is really important to me' and he said 'hey I got your back.' He respected the other artists he collaborated with so much and he did that with each person he interacted with"" she explained.

Recalling his time on set Corbin fondly spoke of Williams' willingness to be a part of scenes even when he was not on screen. With much of his dialogue with Boyega being over phone Corbin said Williams gladly sat out in 100-degree weather and even in a closet at one point to maintain the connection between him and his co-star.

""He took time to talk to all of the extras who were in scenes with him to give them career advice. He saw other people. He saw others"" she concluded.

That same humanity extends to Corbin's direction as well. For such a tense movie there's an unexpected amount of humanity in ""892.""

""For me it's about collaborating with really incredible artists that don't treat people as ideas we treat people as people who are imperfect. Even the person who has the best intentions makes mistakes"" Corbin said adding ""we wanted to be honest with who we really are as humans.""

Part of the way the movie is able to achieve this is through its thoughtful and precise scope. Corbin keeps the focus largely inside the bank for the movie's first half gradually broadening it to the outside world and adding flashbacks toward the end.

""When we first approached the script I think our first version was verbatim what happened that day. It was very long"" she said adding that her and her writing partner eventually decided to focus on ""snapshots"" small pieces that she described as being the ""hottest point in the fire.""

""In terms of starting smaller and then opening up it felt like it was a chamber piece at first where you have these few actors in the bank and then you open up into the world around them and you gradually see that wrap around this bank and so the tension ratchets up piece upon piece line upon line scene upon scene. Then you feel the humanity but you also feel the stakes that way"" Corbin said.

What always remains clear throughout the storytelling though is Corbin's perspective and desire not just to tell a true-crime thriller but one that hopefully sheds a light on other socioeconomic issues.

Corbin herself has worked with nonprofit organizations in urban areas concerned with social and economic change according to a release. It's a passion that also extends into her art.

""I think the thing that shapes our world is storytelling. The stories that you tell yourself the narratives that you know are what you can pursue. If you look back in history you are able to analyze a civilization by the stories that are told about it and I'm hopeful that if we tell stories now that are of flashpoints in our society that are reckoning they won't have to be told in 30 years by the next generation"" she said. ""Whatever the genre is for me doesn't matter as much it's more about - is this story going to be a narrative that moves people in a way that improves our culture and gives us better stories to tell in the future?""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9maW5hbmNlL2NyZWRpdC1jYXJkcy9iZXN0LXdlbGxzLWZhcmdvLWNyZWRpdC1jYXJkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 5 best Wells Fargo credit cards of 2022,"'ZDNET Recommends': What exactly does it mean?

Justin Bieber the Canadian-born pop star and teenage heartthrob greeted more than 12000 fans at Wells Fargo Arena Sunday night by mounting a flying rocket ship emblazoned with his ""Justice"" tour's logo.

Riding the floating rocket Bieber opened his fourth concert on the tour and his fourth appearance in Des Moines with ""Somebody"" off his sixth studio album ""Justice."" Bieber wasted no time addressing the screeching crowd jumping through three more tracks off his 2021 album including lead single ""Holy"" illuminated by background dancers and red luminescent crosses.

The show started earlier than expected with opening acts ¿Téo? Eddie Benjamin and Jaden — the son of Oscar and Grammy award winner Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith — taking the stage before Bieber's 8:30 p.m. showtime.

Bieber's nearly two-hour set featured synchronized color changing drones pyrotechnics and laser light shows that seemingly entertained the increasingly animated crowd.

Still there were moments the crowd's ear-piercing screams were dimmed. With two guitarists Bieber serenaded the arena with ""Hold Tight"" off 2014's ""Journals"" crowd-favorite ""Love Yourself"" from 2015's ""Purpose"" and ""Off My Face"" from his latest record.

Early in his performance Bieber donned a pink puffer jacket before going shirtless with light pink pants to match an oversized pearl necklace and a New York Yankees hat on backward. His face throughout the concert was partially hidden behind a pair of Balenciaga sunglasses ditching the pair only for the performance's 18th track ""Lonely.""

The climax of the show came with Bieber's throwback hits ""Boyfriend"" and ""Baby"" creating decibels that crowds inside the arena likely haven't heard since his performance in front of 14000 fans in 2016.

Bieber smartly delayed the introduction of ""Peaches"" playing piano with his band and riffing Bob Marley before launching into his track that landed him his seventh No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

Thousands cheered as Bieber reminded the crowd that ""Jesus loves you"" before he launched into ""Anyone"" to a sugary sweet backdrop of photos of his wife Hailey Bieber and of adoring fans. Iowa's Bieber drought has finally come to an end.

A long six years

Bieber's ""Justice"" World Tour was originally scheduled to begin and end in 2020 but was postponed twice to 2021 and then to 2022 after the coronavirus pandemic complicated tour schedules. Then in early February just two days after Bieber started the ""Justice"" tour he tested positive for COVID-19 delaying the tour by an additional few days.

Bieber's previous stops in Iowa's capital city can't compete with his ""Justice"" tour performance.

The claimed element presented for prosecution is pure function and not structure. This type of claiming is used often with software patents which recite function via a series of computer implemented steps to carry out a means.

In Nevro v. Boston Scientific decided in April 2020 Nevro appealed from a district court ruling that the following claim for a spinal cord modulation system was indefinite:

means for generating a paresthesia-free therapy signal with a signal frequency in a range from etc. etc.;

Nevro argued that its specification disclosed sufficient structure – a signal generator that accomplished the claimed function of generating a paresthesia-free therapy signal. The district court found Nevro’s argument unconvincing finding that since “signal generators” are already known in the prior art the signal generator in the disclosure wasn’t sufficient structure here. The Federal Circuit reversed. To the Federal Circuit the specification clearly recited a “signal or a pulse generator” not just a general-purpose computer to accomplish the claimed function. The Federal Circuit unlike the district court did not assess whether a signal generator is known or routine. Rather they looked at the term from a specificity standpoint asking whether the patentee disclosed a specific computer that is programmed for the function that is in the claim not just a general-purpose computer.

The test for definiteness under a means-plus-function context is whether there is sufficient corresponding structure in the specification that links the structure in the specification to the function in the claim.

In SPEX Technologies v. Western Digital Corp. decided in May 28 2021 the district court found the following claim term indefinite:

means for providing to a host computing device in response to a request from the host computing for information regarding the type of peripheral device information regarding the function of the target means.

The claimed function is providing specific information to a host computing device in response to a request from that host computing device. The issue came down to a “memory section 612a” which the patentee cited as being the structure for this claimed function. The district court found that the specification just did not support how the memory section 612a performed this claimed function. The Federal Circuit ended up reversing this case as well finding that the specification clearly linked how the memory 612a stored data and provided that data to the host computing device when the host computing device requested the information. In this case the structure was the memory 612a device that could store data and provide that data to the host computing device when the host computing device requested it (i.e. the function of the claim).

So what’s good patent practice? Make sure every one of your claims is in the specification! Start with the claims; have them be the groundwork for your application. And have an algorithm! Drawings are a good thing.

#MannKiBaat: From Calculus to Computers - all these scientific inventions are based on Zero

Mathematics has never been a difficult subject for us Indians. A big reason for this is our Vedic Mathematics: PM Modi during #MannKiBaat

My dear countrymen Namaskar.

With new topics with new inspirational examples gathering new messages I have come once again to express 'Mann Ki Baat' with you. Do you know about which topic I have received the maximum letters and messages this time? This subject is such that it is connected to past present and future; all three. I am talking about the country’s new Pradhanmantri Sangrahalaya. On this 14th April the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar the Pradhanmantri Sangrahalaya was dedicated to the nation. It has been opened for the citizens of the country. One such listener is Shrimaan Sarthak ji; Sarthak ji lives in Gurugram and has visited the Pradhanmantri Sangrahalaya at the very first opportunity. The message that Sarthak ji has written to me on Namo App is very interesting. He has written that for years he has been watching news channels reading newspapers along with being connected to social media so he used to think that his general knowledge was good enough… but when he visited the PM Museum he was very surprised he realized that he did not know much about his country and those who led the country. He has written about certain facets of the PM Museum which heightened his curiosity such as the spinning wheel of Lal Bahadur Shastri gifted to him by his in-laws that made Sarthak ji happy. He also saw Shastri ji's passbook noticing how little savings he had. Sarthak ji has written that he did not even know that Morarji Bhai Desai was Deputy Collector in Gujarat before joining the freedom struggle. He had a long career in the administrative service. On Chaudhary Charan Singh ji Sarthak ji writes that he was unaware of Chaudhary Charan Singh ji’s great contribution in the field of zamindari abolition. Not just that he further writes he saw that Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao ji took a very keen interest in the work of Land Reform. Sarthak ji also came to know only after coming to this museum that Chandrashekhar ji had undertaken the historic Bharat Yatra walking more than 4 thousand kilometers. In the museum when he saw the items that Atalji used listened to his speeches he was filled with pride. Sarthak ji also mentioned that this museum also provides very interesting information about Mahatma Gandhi Sardar Patel Dr. Ambedkar Jai Prakash Narayan and our Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.

Friends what can be a better time to remember the contribution of the Prime Ministers of the country than the Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav? It is a matter of pride for the country that the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav is taking the form of a mass movement. People's interest in history is increasing a lot and in such a situation the PM Museum is also becoming a centre of attraction for the youth connecting them with the precious heritage of the country.

By the way friends when so much is being discussed with you about the museum I felt that I should also ask you some questions. Let's see what your general knowledge says… how much information you have! Are you ready my young friends are you ready with your paper and pen? What I am going to ask you right now you can share the answers on NaMo App or social media with #MuseumQuiz… and do share. I urge you to answer all these questions. This will enhance interest in the museum among people all over the country. Do you know in which city of the country there is a famous Rail Museum where people have been getting a chance to see the heritage of Indian Railways for the last 45 years? Let me give you another clue. You can also find here from the Fairy Queen the Saloon of Prince of Wales to the Fireless Steam Locomotive. Do you know which museum is there in Mumbai where we get to see the evolution of currency in a very interesting way? Here coins of the sixth century BC are present; on the other hand e-Money is also present. The third question - 'Virasat-e-Khalsa' is related to this museum. Do you know in which city of Punjab is this museum located? All of you must be enjoying a lot in kite flying; the next question is related to this. Where is the country's one and only Kite Museum? Let me give you a clue the biggest kite displayed here is 22 by 16 feet in size. Did something come to mind – No? Let me tell you one more thing here - the city in which it is located has a special connection with Bapu. Who does not have the hobby of collecting postage stamps in childhood! But do you know where the National Museum related to postage stamps is in India? I ask you one more question. Which museum is housed in a building named Gulshan Mahal? The clue for you is that in this museum you can also become the director of a film you can also see the nuances of camera editing. Ok do you know of any museum that celebrates India's textile heritage? This museum has miniature paintings Jaina manuscripts sculptures -…many more. It is also known for its unique display.

Friends in this era of technology it is very easy for you to find answers to these. I asked these questions so that the curiosity in our new generation rises… they read more about them; go and visit them. Now because of the importance of museums many people themselves are coming forward and donating a lot to the museums. Many people are donating their old collections as well as historical artefacts to museums. When you do this in a way you share a cultural treasure with the entire society. In India too people are now coming forward for this. I also appreciate all such individual efforts. Today in the changing times and due to the covid protocols emphasis is being placed on adopting new methods in museums. The focus has also increased on digitization in museums. You must be aware that on the 18th of May International Museum Day will be celebrated all over the world. In view of this I have an idea for my young friends. Why not visit a local museum with your circle of friends during the upcoming holidays. Do share your experience with #MuseumMemories. By doing so you will also awaken curiosity about museums in the minds of others.

My dear countrymen you must be taking many resolves in your life and be you must be working hard to fulfill them. Friends recently I came to know about such a resolve which was really different very unique. That's why I thought that I must share it with the listeners of 'Mann Ki Baat'.

Friends can you imagine that someone could come out of one’s house with a resolve that one would roam the whole city for the whole day without doing any money transaction in cash – isn’t this an interesting resolve. Two daughters of Delhi Sagarika and Preksha experimented with Cashless Day Out like this. Wherever Sagarika and Preksha went in Delhi they got the facility of digital payment. Because of the UPI QR code they did not have to withdraw cash. Even at most of the street food and roadside vendors they got the facility of online transaction.

Friends one may think that it is Delhi a metro city it is easy to have all this here. But now it is not the case that this spread of UPI is limited only to big cities like Delhi. I have also received a message from Anandita Tripathi from Ghaziabad. Anandita had gone to the North East with her husband last week. She narrated me the experience of her journey from Assam to Meghalaya and Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh. You will also be pleasantly surprised to know that in this journey of spanning several days they did not need to withdraw cash even in remote areas. In places where there was no good internet facility till a few years ago now there is also the facility of payment through UPI. Looking at the experiences of Sagarika Preksha and Anandita I would also urge you to try the experiment of Cashless Day Out definitely do it.

Friends in the last few years BHIM UPI has rapidly become a part of our economy and habits. Now even in small towns and in most villages people are transacting through UPI itself. A culture is also evolving in the country throughS Digital Economy. In the small street shops digital payment has made it easy to serve more and more customers. Now they don't even have a problem of loose change. You must also feel the convenience of UPI in everyday life. Wherever you go… carrying cash going to the bank finding an ATM… the hassle is now over. All payments are made from mobile itself but have you ever thought that how big a digital economy has been created in the country due to these small online payments of yours. At present transactions worth about 20 thousand crore rupees are taking place in our country every day. Last March UPI transactions reached around Rs 10 lakh crores. Due to this convenience is also increasing in the country and an atmosphere of honesty is also being created. Now many new start-ups related to Fin-tech are also coming up in the country. I would like you to share any experiences related to this power of digital payment and start-up ecosystem. Your experiences can become an inspiration to many other countrymen.

My dear countrymen how the power of technology is changing the lives of ordinary people we are constantly seeing this around us. Technology has done another great job. It has served to bring the benefit of the extraordinary abilities of the Divyang friends to the country and the world. At the Tokyo Paralympics we have seen what our Divyang brothers and sisters can achieve. Just like in sports in arts academics and many other fields Divyang friends are doing wonders but when these friends get the power of technology they achieve even greater heights. That is why the country is constantly making efforts to make the resources and infrastructure accessible to the differently-abled. There are also many start-ups and organizations in the country which are doing inspirational work in this direction. There is one such organization – Voice of Specially Abled People this organization is promoting new opportunities in the field of assistive technology. An innovative beginning has also been made to take the work of Divyang artists to the world. Voice of Specially Abled People has prepared a digital art gallery of paintings of these artists. How Divyang friends are rich in extraordinary talents and what extraordinary abilities they have - this art gallery is an example of that. What are the challenges in the life of Divyang friends how far can they reach after overcoming them? You can feel many such facets in these paintings. If you also know a Divyang friend know their talent then with the help of digital technology you can bring them to the fore in front of the world. Divyang friends must also join such endeavours.

My dear countrymen summer heat is increasing very fast in most parts of the country. This rising heat equally increases our responsibility to save water. It is possible that there may be plenty of water available where you are now. But you also have to always remember the crores of people who live in water-stressed areas for whom every drop of water is like elixir.

Friends at this time in the 75th year of independence in the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav water conservation is one of the resolves with which the country is moving forward. During the Amrit Mahotsav 75 Amrit Sarovars will be built in every district of the country. You can imagine how big the campaign is. The day is not far when there will be 75 Amrit Sarovars in your own city. I would like all of you and especially the youth to know about this campaign and also bear responsibility for it. If there is any history related to freedom struggle in your area if there is a memory of a freedom fighter you can also connect it with Amrit Sarovar. By the way I like to learn that after taking the resolve of Amrit Sarovar work has started on it at many places at a rapid pace. I have come to know about Gram Panchayat Patwai of Rampur in UP. There was a pond on the land of the Gram Sabha but it was full of filth and heaps of garbage. With a lot of hard work with the help of local people with the help of local school children that dirty pond has been transformed in the last few weeks. Now many arrangements have been made on the banks of that lake like retaining wall boundary wall food court fountains and lighting. I congratulate the Patwai Gram Panchayat of Rampur the people of the village the children there for this effort.

Friends the availability of water and the scarcity of water these determine the progress and speed of any country. You must have also noticed that in 'Mann Ki Baat' I do talk about water conservation again and again along with topics like cleanliness. It is clearly stated in our scriptures –

Paniyam paramam loke jeevaanaam jeevanam samritam ||

That is in the world water is the basis of life of every living being and water is also the biggest resource that is why our ancestors gave so much emphasis on water conservation. From Vedas to Puranas to save water everywhere to build ponds lakes etc. has been termed as the social and spiritual duty of a person. In Valmiki Ramayana special emphasis has been laid on water conservation on connecting water sources. Similarly students of history would know how much engineering was developed in India regarding water even during the Indus-Saraswati and Harappan civilizations. In ancient times there was an interconnected system of water sources in many cities and this was the time when the population was not that much there was no shortage of natural resources there was a kind of abundance yet about water conservation the awareness was very high then. But today the situation is reverse. I urge all of you to know about such old ponds wells and lakes in your area. Due to the Amrit Sarovar Abhiyan along with water conservation a distinct identity of your area will also develop. With this local tourist places will also be developed in cities localities people will also get a place to walk around.

Friends every effort related to water is related to our tomorrow. It is the responsibility of the whole society. For this different societies have made various efforts continuously for centuries. For example 'Maldhari' a tribe of ""Rann of Kutch"" uses a method called ""Vridas"" for water conservation. Under this small wells are built and trees and plants are planted nearby to protect it. Similarly the Bhil tribe of Madhya Pradesh used their historical tradition ""Halma"" for water conservation. Under this tradition the people of this tribe gather at one place to find a solution to the problems related to water. Due to the suggestions received from the Halma tradition the water crisis in this area has reduced and the ground water level is also increasing.

Friends if the same sense of duty comes in everyone's mind the biggest of challenges related to water crisis can be solved. Come let us take a pledge to conserve water and save life in the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav of freedom. We will save water drop by drop and save every single life.

My dear countrymen you must have seen that a few days ago I held 'Pariksha Pe Charcha' with my young friends and students. During this discussion some students said that they are afraid of maths in the exam. A similar thought was also sent to me by many students in their messages. At that very moment I had decided that I would definitely discuss mathematics this time in 'Mann Ki Baat'. Friends Mathematics is such a subject about which we Indians should be most comfortable. After all the people of India have given the most research and contribution to the whole world regarding mathematics. You must have heard a lot about zero that is the discovery of zero and its importance. Often you will also hear that if zero was not discovered then perhaps we would not have been able to see so much scientific progress in the world. From Calculus to Computers - all these scientific inventions are based on Zero. Mathematicians and scholars of India have even written that –

यत किंचित वस्तु तत सर्वं गणितेन बिना नहि !

That is whatever is there in this entire universe everything is based on mathematics. If you remember the study of science you will understand its meaning. Every principle of science is expressed through a mathematical formula. Be it Newton's laws Einstein's famous equation all the science related to the universe is mathematics. Now scientists also discuss Theory of Everything that is a single formula that can express everything in the universe. Our sages have always imagined such an expansion of scientific understanding with the help of mathematics. If we invented zero we have also expressed infinityas well. In common parlance when we talk about numbers and numbers we speak and think till million billion and trillion but in Vedas and in Indian mathematics this calculation goes much further. We have a very old verse here -

एकं दशं शतं चैव सहस्रम् अयुतं तथा |

लक्षं च नियुतं चैव कोटि: अर्बुदम् एव च ||

वृन्दं खर्वो निखर्व: च शंख: पद्म: च सागर: |

अन्त्यं मध्यं परार्ध: च दश वृद्ध्या यथा क्रमम् ||

The order of numbers is given in this verse. such as -

One ten hundred thousand and ayut!

Lakh Niyut and Koti i.e. crores.

Similarly this number goes up to the shankh padma and saagar. One saagar means 10 to the power of 57. Not only this there are numbers like Ogh and Mahog even after this. There is a Mahogha –10 to the power of 62 that is 62 zeros next to one. Even if we imagine such a large number in the mind it is difficult but in Indian mathematics they have been used for thousands of years. Just a few days ago I met the CEO of Intel company. He had given me a painting in which one such Indian method of calculation or measurement was depicted through Vamana avatar. With reference to the name Intel the computer would have come automatically to your mind. You must have also heard about the binary system in the language of computer but

Do you know that in our country there were sages like Acharya Pingala who postulated the binary. Similarly from mathematicians Aryabhatta to Ramanujan there has been work on many principles of mathematics here.

Friends Mathematics has never been a difficult subject for us Indians a big reason for this is our Vedic Mathematics. The credit of Vedic mathematics in modern times goes to Shri Bharati Krishna Tirtha Ji Maharaj. He revived the ancient methods of calculation and named it Vedic Mathematics. The most important thing about Vedic Mathematics was that through it you can do even the most difficult calculations in your mind in the blink of an eye. You must have seen videos of many such youths learning and teaching Vedic maths on social media these days.

Friends today in 'Mann Ki Baat' a similar friend who teaches Vedic Mathematics is also joining us. This is Gaurav Tekriwal ji of Kolkata. And for the last two-and-a-half decades he has been taking this movement of Vedic mathematics forward with great dedication. Come let's talk to him.

Modi ji - Gaurav ji Namaste!

Gaurav – Namaste sir!

Modi ji - I have heard that you are very interested in Vedic Maths; you do a lot. So first I would like to know something about you and later how you are interested in this subject do tell me?

Gaurav - Sir when I was applying for business school twenty years ago it used to have a competitive exam called CAT. There were many maths questions in it which had to be done in little time. So my mother brought me a book called Vedic Mathematics. Swami Shri Bharatikrishna Tirtha Ji Maharaj had written that book. And in that he gave 16 sutras. In which mathematics used to be very simple and very fast. When I read that I was very inspired and then my interest was awakened in Mathematics. I understood that this subject which is a gift of India which is our heritage can be taken to every corner of the world. Since then I made it a mission to take Vedic Mathematics to every nook and corner of the world. Because the fear of mathematics haunts everyone. And what can be simpler than Vedic Mathematics!

Modi ji - Gaurav ji for how many years have you been working in this?

Gaurav – It has been almost 20 years sir. I am still at it.

Modi ji - And what do you do for awareness what experiments do you use how do you reach people?

Gaurav - We go to schools we give online education. The name of our organization is Vedic Maths Forum India. Under that organization we teach Vedic Maths 24 hours a day through the internet Sir!

Modi ji - Gaurav ji you know I also like to interact with children constantly and I keep looking for opportunities. And with exam warrior I have institutionalized it in a way and I have also experienced that when I talk to children they run away as soon as they hear the name of maths. And so my effort is that this fear which is without any reason should be removed this fear should be removed with basic techniques of mathematics which come from our traditions and which are not new to India. Perhaps among the ancient traditions in the world India has a tradition of mathematics. So if the exam warrior’s fear has to be dispelled what will you advise them?

Gaurav - Sir this is most useful for children because the fear of exams which has become a fobia in every home. Children take tuition for the exam parents are worried. Teachers also get upset. So all this gets dissipates with Vedic maths. Vedic maths is fifteen hundred percent faster than this simple maths and it gives a lot of confidence in the children and the mind also runs faster. As such we have also introduced Yoga with Vedic Mathematics. So that if the children want they can calculate even with their eyes closed by the method of Vedic mathematics.

Modi ji - Even in the tradition of dhyan doing mathematics in this way is also a primary course of meditation.

Gaurav - Right Sir!

Modi ji - Well Gaurav ji it is very nice that you and I have taken up this work in mission mode and especially your mother took you on this path as a good guru. And today you are taking millions of children on that path. My best wishes to you

Gaurav - Thank you sir! I thank you sir! That you gave importance to Vedic maths and chose me sir! So we are very thankful.

Modi ji - Thank you very much. Namaskar.

Gaurav - Namaste sir.

Friends Gaurav ji has very well explained how Vedic maths can transform mathematics from complex to fun. Not only this you can also solve big scientific problems with Vedic mathematics. I would like all parents to teach Vedic maths to their children. With this their confidence will not only increase; the analytical power of their brain will also increase and yes whatever little fear some children have about Mathematics that phobia will also end completely.

My dear countrymen today in 'Mann Ki Baat' many informative topics from museum to maths were discussed. All these topics become part of 'Mann Ki Baat' only because of your suggestions. Similarly keep sending me your suggestions in future also through Namo App and MyGov. In the coming days we will have the festival of Eid in the country. Akshaya Tritiya and the birth anniversary of Bhagwan Parashuram will also be celebrated on 3rd May. A few days later the festival of Vaishakh Budh Purnima will also come. All these festivals are festivals of restraint purity charity and harmony. Advance greetings to all of you on the occasion of these festivals. Celebrate these festivals with great gaiety and harmony. In the midst of all this you also have to be alert of Corona. Wearing a mask washing hands at regular intervals whatever are the necessary measures for prevention keep following them. Next time in 'Mann Ki Baat' we will meet again and discuss some more new topics sent by you - till then let's bid goodbye.

Thank you very much!

People from across the country have written letters and messages to PM @narendramodi about the Pradhanmantri Sangrahalaya.

Matt Reeves’ “The Batman” is a certified blockbuster and will be hard to top in 2022 that is until Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is released. However there are still some fans who believe Robert Pattinson was not the right choice to play Bruce Wayne / Batman but what if Adam West played the character in his prime? Visual effects masters Corridor Digital shows us just that.





Corridor didn’t just stop at replacing Robert Pattinson as they also swapped Paul Dano’s Riddler for actor Frank Gorshin and substitutes urgess Meredith for Colin Farrell’s Oswald Cobblepot / Penguin. The 1960s Batmobile also makes an appearance during infamous chase sequence with the Penguin as well as glimpses of Robin (Burt Ward) and the Batcopter. On the other hand Robert Pattinson’s Batman screen test shows exactly why he was chosen for the role.

I’m truly sorry.”

Bruce MacDonald the veteran broadcast colour commentator of Alberni Valley Bulldogs games in the B.C. Hockey League was expelled from the booth at the end of the second period Friday night for making a racist comment on air.

The Bulldogs won the second-round playoff game 2-1 but the result was overshadowed by the off-ice comment referring to Langley Riverman forward Owen Kim.

MacDonald has been barred from any future broadcasts of BCHL games. He has apologized for what he said.

David Michaud president and governor of the Bulldogs referred to the 70-foot banner on the wall of the concourse in Weyerhaeuser Arena in Port Alberni which reads: “There is no place in hockey for racism.” He said there was no other choice to be made if his club wants to live up to those words.

“It was a regrettable comment and we could not turn a blind eye to it” Michaud said Saturday as his club which has been in the Alberni Valley since 2002 was on the ferry travelling to play in Game 6 of the playoff series in Langley.

“How do we as a club take part in events such as Orange Shirt Day and other anti-racism initiatives all over the valley and then not react to something like this?”

Michaud was watching Game 5 live in the rink. He removed MacDonald from the broadcast booth at the end of the second period when informed of his comment which was made midway through the period during an incident of pushing and shoving between the teams on the ice.

The Bulldogs play-by-play announcer Evan Hammond instantly called out MacDonald on-air for his comment by saying: “OK come on that’s too far. No that’s too far.”

Rivermen rookie Kim 17 was born in North Vancouver and is committed to Holy Cross University of Worcester Massachusetts in the U.S. collegiate NCAA Division 1.

The BCHL released a statement apologizing to Kim and his family “as well as anyone else who may have heard the comment.”

“We have a zero tolerance for this type of behaviour and Mr. MacDonald is banned from any future broadcast involving the Bulldogs or any other BCHL team.”

Radio station 93.3 The Peak which broadcasts the Bulldogs games also apologized. Rob Bye general-manager Vancouver Island for Pattison Media Ltd. called MacDonald’s comments “extremely offensive” and “inappropriate.”

“Racism has no place in hockey. Racism has no place on our radio stations nor in our company” he said in a statement.

He added: “We stand with the BCHL and the Alberni Valley Bulldogs and would like to sincerely apologize to Owen Kim his family the Langley Rivermen the Alberni Valley Bulldogs the BCHL and our listeners.”

MacDonald in a statement said he emailed an apology to the Rivermen on Friday night.

“It was important to me to try and reach out to Owen Kim first privately” he said.

“No one should be made to feel that way and I take full responsibility for my racist words. I’m deeply sorry for the hurt I have caused Owen Kim his family and anyone else who was affected by what I said.”

He also offered an apology to the “fans and community” adding: “I am so sorry that I have let you down. The Bulldogs have been a part of my life since Day 1. I am heartbroken that I caused it to end this way. I will do whatever I can to make this right. Racism has no place in hockey or anywhere else in this world. I’m truly sorry.”

Michaud acknowledged MacDonald’s apology saying: “Sorry is good but words still have consequences.”

He also gave credit to the way Evan handled the incidident by speaking out and condemning the comment.

The Rivermen led the best-of-seven series 3-2 heading into Game 6 on Saturday night in Langley. Game 7 if required will be Monday evening in Port Alberni.

The wife mother radio host broadcaster and researcher has added consultant and entrepreneur to her large portfolio which also includes former sociology lecturer.

Today she is world renowned as the creator of LifeSavers Wipes – a personal care product for women that detects signs of diabetes.

Georgia exudes contagious energy and supreme confidence in conversation.

The young lady and her siblings were raised in a small lane off Hagley Park Road in St Andrew where the community looked after its residents; where you could be walking down the road to your house but detour to the home of whoever food scent hit you and get dinner.

On “Small Lane” everyone knew which house had a family member who was ill and people rallied around them nursing them back to health with love.

Georgia experienced the nurturing of grandmothers who provided grandchildren with a safe place pure love and wisdom. Encouraged by her father who was a labourer but who wanted better for his children he told them they could become kings and queens if they wanted and supported them to the place of learning.

She saw her mother rise from a vendor to postgraduate status. And the encouragement to think through the obvious created the roadmap for deep thinking.

COMMUNITY CARE AND DIABETES

It was that sense of community bond that sent Georgia into deep thought when a neighbour began to lose her sight. She was disturbed that this professional woman who had been working all her life was going blind.

When her mother took the neighbour to the FISH Medical Clinic in Papine it was there that they learnt that she was diabetic and her blood sugar level was so high that it impacted her sight.

“My mother told us that the doctor cried. She said this was something so preventable and it was sad that so many people were blind because of lack of knowledge” she recalled.

Diabetic retinopathy is caused when the blood sugar is so elevated that it damages the blood vessels of the retina. The damaged blood vessels can swell and leak resulting in blurry vision or stopping blood flow. It is said to be a common eye disease which is the leading cause of blindness in working-age adults.

Studies show that approximately 14 per cent of the Jamaican population is diabetic with a majority having type 2 the less deadly version of type 1. Diabetes more than road accidents causes most of the amputation of limbs in Jamaica.

For Georgia increased obesity among the population a leading cause of diabetes is a loud alarm bell.

“This is a professional woman who was working. And there is a huge difference between someone who was born blind and someone who becomes blind. My mother felt it deeply and when my mother feels something the family feels it. I didn’t start looking at wipes as a solution I just felt that there must be a simpler way for people to save their own lives” she explained.

Just as she was always encouraged to become a part of the solution and not a part of the problem she began the search for an answer to the diabetes crisis; something that would give an early warning signal.

Georgia wanted a product that would trigger an alarm leading to further action but something that would not cause the accustomed resistance to change. The sociologist in her knew very well that people do not like change so she wanted a product that maintained habit and specifically designed for women.

After much thought she was inspired to create a personal care product that would change colour after use – specifically after passing urine.

The COVID-19 pandemic presented the opportunity for her to delve deeper into research which gave birth to LifeSavers Wipes.

Georgia sought the expertise of Dr Peter Nelson who she believes is an “awesome scientist with a brilliant mind”. In the interim she filed a provisional patent for the product and the response was in the affirmative. A previous “very negative experience sometime before” caused her to act quickly on the patent.

When the idea was pitched among family members it was interrogated heavily and they pooled resources for its genesis.

Always the innovator raring to go she was profoundly disappointed when she travelled to the USA to purchase the expensive chemical needed for trial only for the bottle to break inside her house! Remembering the long hard and expensive process hampered by the lockdown she had to speak life into the process and wheel and come again.

The spilled chemical became the subject of Sunday dinner discussions with family including her husband Emile Williams and their children. In their home Sunday dinners are topical discussion events where each member must pull a topic from a container and debate.

The spilled chemical evoked topics of “disappointment and “clumsiness” but never giving up and she knew she had to wheel and come again.

“I went to Dr Nelson and told him what I had and what I wanted because I was sure that it would work. So he was able to do the things I wanted changed something that I had because he had more knowledge and along with another scientist that I hired it was based on that that we came up with the product” she explained in a sit-down interview with The Sunday Gleaner.

Lab trials worked as expected and in the anticipated time. Next was testing on individuals who she knew were diabetics which also worked as expected and with no adverse reaction.

Georgia was careful to point out that the wipes are not a medical product.

HOW FOOD RESCUED HER ONE-WOMAN DISPLAY IN GEORGIA

The next move was to the World of Wipes International Conference in Atlanta Georgia in July 2021 to introduce LifeSavers Wipes to the world.

Georgia told the amazing story of how she moved from a “one woman team empty space booth conference to scheduling demonstrations through the ingenuity of another Jamaican”.

The conference hosted representatives of companies from all over the United States and the world who were promoting new products.

She spotted a black man among the sea of white people. She approached him and asked if he “could give an eye on my number 302 spot so I could run to the nearby Walmart and get a few things for the space”.

Her accent triggered the unforgettable Jamaican identity. He devised a plan to help his countrywoman on realising that she was there alone with no company – just a one-woman team.

He said his name was Mark “but I am sure that it wasn’t true because he said he wasn’t straight” so I just left it at that.

“Everybody else had a big thing and I only had a small space. It turned out that Mark not only worked at the hotel but that day he was serving food. He helped me to get chairs table and tablecloth for my space. I had number 302 so I was way down from everybody. So Mark decided that in order to get traffic to my booth he would stand there and serve the food. So everybody who came for the food got to hear about my product. This is just Jamaican ingenuity” she shared with a smile.

A few hours later the traffic at her booth was so big that Georgia had to schedule demonstrations.

Despite the tiredness she did not come this far to fail and she was going to ensure that everyone who wanted to heard about her product and saw a demonstration. By the end of the day LifeSavers Wipes was not only mentioned in the guest speaker’s presentation but it was nominated among the top new products.

“I will never forget that experience. I cherish him. He doesn’t know me. This man was giving me the thumbs up when he saw the crowd at the stall. So no matter what happens there are two persons that I will never forget on this journey. This Jamaican waiter who couldn’t believe that I was there alone among the big companies with many people as part of their team. The other person is a young lady from Swipes Wipes who I called and asked if I could come see her set-up. She was home because of COVID-19 and everything that we learnt about wipes that was so critical to what we were doing we learnt from her. She was genuinely excited for us” Georgia stated.

“There are still many people out there just wanting to help people.”

It was from this exercise that one of the other participants nominated the LifeSavers Wipes for an award which she knew nothing about. With 1400 other nominations Georgia just said “well let’s see”. And that she did.

An email later notified her that she was nominated and specific information was required. The information was sent and forgotten. Then another later notified her that LifeSavers Wipes was shortlisted among the top-three global innovations of 2019-2021 in the International Design Excellence Awards (IDEA).

“I am like ‘look at that look at us’” she said telling The Sunday Gleaner that she was advised that the nomination entailed 40 per cent votes from participants and 60 per cent from industry professionals. Ticket and award costs were so prohibitive that she weighed against going to the ceremony that was held at the Miami Beach Convention Centre Florida on March 31. But she went alone … again.

I AM GEORGIA!

Georgia described as surreal the moment it was announced that LifeSavers Wipes won the IDEA prize for best new product.

A German at the awards videotaped the presentation and her acceptance speech.

“My brother (Damion) said ‘win lose or draw you get up there and you stand up as the person who has been identified as one of the three best’. And I said ‘you know what I am going to’. This is a networking conference where billion-dollar deals are done. And so I introduced myself and gave my card to everyone and many persons said they knew and they voted” she said.

“Winning the award was a very happy moment. I was happy for me my family and my country” she said.

Although no LifeSavers Wipes product is available on the shelves – for now a lot is happening behind the scenes … and they are coming.

“I got the award came home and went to work the next day went to my wholesale to buy groceries. It is very clear to me that we are nowhere near where we want to be and so no changes but we are here to maximise what is a global product” she said.

Georgia is now in an “exciting” period of partnership arrangements and she has enough suitors to be comfortable with the kind of interest being shown.

She still has a day job as LifeSavers Wipes is a baby that needs to be nurtured.

She is blessed with a very big family support system including her helper. A relative is always ready to pick up the children if they are late and they are fed until she comes home.

Jamaican children Georgia said no longer have the family support they had when she was growing up which to her is a big loss.

“I saw to women in particular who are increasingly depressed and suicidal that they need support. This idea about super women there are none. There is support and if you need help don’t be afraid to ask for it. When I was growing up I saw this support. There were some activities like washing day when all the women would gather together for wash day. These were therapeutic events. Even if they would chat about it after they were done they had an opportunity to just share their situation” Georgia explained.

ENCOURAGING OTHERS

Georgia is encouraging entrepreneurship in her family and already her teenage daughter is showing interest and her son “is the most confident person in the world who is going to sell everything”.

She is at a loss as to why children even with university education do not seek to take the entrepreneurial skills of their uneducated parents further. She does not understand why a father who works as a mechanic for someone sends his son to university yet that son does not own a garage.

“Entrepreneurship should be encouraged early. Much of the consternation about skills shortage training was lost in career counselling where young people were not properly guided to the options they have and so they were unable to maximise on the options. There is this thing about ‘dutty wuk’ where persons were not encouraged to become a chef and own a restaurant. Or a carpenter or a plumber” she said.

Disheartened by reports about the HEART/NSTA Trust training programme she described it as an excellent avenue for young people in spite of it being dogged by various problems. Also troublesome is low-waged jobs and some persons dependence on remittances which caused them to shy away from employment as family supported them.

“It’s a good and a bad thing. It creates a dependency culture that comes from a culture that says we have to look after people but it is also to our detriment. It’s easy to get bogged down with some of the negatives you hear but there are still a lot of good things happening in Jamaica” she said.

Georgia has refused to be put in any stereotypical box and is already looking towards the next innovation. She continues to defy the view that athletics and musical geniuses we are but ideas like hers do not come out of Jamaica.

“The next innovation is coming soon” she promised.

The company has already inked agreements with leading and cutting-edge brands in the medical field to advance and modernise healthcare here.

One of the companies on board is Brainlabs; they utilise software technology such as x-ray vision to diagnose patients and navigate through surgeries using a digital replica of the patient’s organs muscles and tissues. This helps to reduce blindness or paralysis during intricate procedures.

Another leading brand KLS Martin provides the world’s best implants for skull and facial surgery. KLS Martin also provides specialised patient solutions and has over 30000 surgical products and instruments.

The company also offers absorbable implants and devices to make bones grow inside the body. Other brands include Nexus which uses technology to detect and remove complicated tumors.

Kamini Persaud Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Salus Medical told the gathering that they will also facilitate the qualifying and certifying of the most brilliant minds in the medical field.

Persaud said they will equip them with modern and innovative medical technology to ensure the best medical care with state-of-the-art facilities.

“Salus has and will continue to partner with some of the most dynamic global and affordable brands in the field of medical technology” Persaud said.

Further “Salus Medical will be stepping up to play its part to contribute to the ultimate health of the nation.”

Meanwhile President Dr Irfaan Ali during brief remarks lauded Salus Medical as another positive move by Guyanese.

The Head of State reminded that health and education are the two sectors being targeted in Guyana to be among regional leaders.

“Hopefully we can make our mark and become global leaders” President Ali said.

The President revealed that the government will continue to support private specialised healthcare. He explained that the government is also cognisant of the necessary legislation needed to transform the sector and referenced the recently passed Human Organ Transplant Bill.

“We are building the sector not only on investment and physical facilities but ensuring that we have the legislative framework to support the macro vision to ensure health and health services become an important foreign currency earner for us” President Ali said.

Quality training of nurses and doctors is also paramount to the development of the health sector.

“Whether it is Mount Sinai or Northwell Health Care we are going to every single facility and every single group that is out there that can help us to achieve this” President Ali revealed.

The President said the government in recent weeks received several proposals for the establishment of modern home care facilities for the elderly.",,,

The creative if unconventional perk helped attract and keep younger tech talent but it was out of reach to all but a tiny slice of the U.S. workforce.

Now at a time when companies will do just about anything to recruit and retain workers fertility benefits have gone from novelty to a must-have for many companies.

Thanks to the pandemic which brought on today’s tight labor market corporations have had to find unusual ways to attract and keep prized employees said Rachael McCann senior director at Willis Towers Watson an insurance advisory and brokerage firm. The fertility benefit has become one of the more popular approaches she said. “It’s absolutely grown.""

In the U.S. demand for workers is far outstripping supply. There are currently about 1.8 open jobs for every unemployed worker well above the pre-Covid ratio of 1.2. As a result employers are ratcheting up pay and offering perks that were unheard of prior to 2020 -- including covering college tuition and paying bonuses to employees who don’t miss work.

Plusher Packages

Employers are also offering plusher health-care packages including providing expanded mental-health coverage to compete for talent.

Companies are finding that fertility benefits are increasingly popular among female employees -- particularly those between the ages of 25 and 40. The benefit is also important for couples with a diagnosis of infertility same-sex couples and single individuals as well as those who have been unable to conceive naturally or are starting families later in life.

“In the five years before the pandemic we saw a lot of interest but not a lot of buying"" said Kate Ryder chief executive officer of Maven Clinic a family planning provider whose clients include Snap Inc. BuzzFeed Inc. and Boston Scientific Corp. The loss of valuable staff in the so-called “Great Resignation"" the desire to provide more help to burnt-out parents and the push to have more-inclusive workplaces all led companies to consider fertility benefits she said. “Now everyone’s buying.""

The most prevalent type of fertility package caps benefits per employee. One example is a $25000 lifetime benefit which would cover about two rounds of in-vitro fertilization treatments or slightly more than one cycle of egg freezing.

But $25000 can run out quickly. Three IVF cycles for example are the most clinically effective approach for women under 40 according to some studies. Patients can also experience added costs including egg or embryo storage and medications needed for IVF.

Survey data from workforce consultant Mercer showed that as late as 2015 just under a quarter of large employers (500 or more employees) covered IVF. But in 2020 the figure rose to 27%. And last year it jumped to 36%.

The percentage of large employers covering egg-freezing benefits meanwhile climbed to 15% in 2021 from just 5% in 2015 the Mercer data show.

Beyond Tech

The breadth of companies offering fertility benefits has also spread far beyond tech. Carrot Fertility a global fertility-benefits provider mostly saw interest from companies also in financial services and consulting prior to the pandemic said Chief Executive Officer Tammy Sun.

In the last two years Carrot has added clients in the food and beverage retail automotive and manufacturing industries. They’re also working with labor unions and municipalities. Revenue has grown by about 400% in the last year Sun said. The closely held company declined to provide further financial details.

“This has been a huge part of our attraction campaign"" said Aja Harbert human resources director at B Capital Group a Los Angeles venture capital firm that started offering a fertility benefit through Carrot in 2021. She said it helped convince four candidates to accept job offers. “It kind of pushed them over the edge when they had competing offers"" she said.

Increased employer investment in fertility benefits has also helped vendors offer a more holistic approach to family planning. Two years ago many of the family-planning vendors “felt more like tech startups"" and have since “grown by leaps and bounds"" said McCann of Willis Towers Watson.

Maven Clinic for example offers fertility treatments and education as well as physical and mental support from preconception through postpartum.

When Priscilla Martinez a senior industry account manager at Microsoft Corp. in Chicago was having trouble conceiving she was able to get pregnant after using Maven Clinic’s nutrition and fertility counseling services. She had her first child in early 2021 and has continued to use Maven’s new-parent support classes.

Martinez said she didn’t put much thought into benefits when looking for jobs in the past. But now that she’d like to have a second child her mindset has changed. “It’s definitely something that has helped"" keep me in the job Martinez said.

Controlling Costs

In the past employers didn’t want to offer fertility benefits because of concerns about higher costs given how expensive treatments like IVF and egg freezing are said Samantha Purciello senior associate at Mercer. But 97% of employers surveyed by Mercer said that adding the benefit didn’t lead to a significant increase in their costs according to the company.

One way employers can keep costs down is by capping benefits and the vast majority do. The most common is a lifetime dollar maximum and of those $16250 is the median amount Mercer data show. About 13% of companies restrict the number of IVF and egg-freezing cycles to three.

Companies won’t bear the brunt of the costs unless employees take advantage of the benefits and very few actually do. Mercer estimates that less than 3% of women might need such treatments.

Still as more Americans postpone starting families fertility benefits have become “one of the most important talent retention and attraction tools on the table"" said Carrot Fertility’s Sun.

""Damn"" he said as a dancing 23-story Katy Perry beckoned us up the driveway of Resorts World a new Las Vegas hotel complex with a 100000-square-foot LED video screen on one of its glass flanks. So distracted was the driver by Katy's sci-fi sashaying that he dropped me at the wrong entrance. I was booked in at Crockfords an ultra-luxury hotel-within-a-hotel that joins Hilton and Conrad properties to make up this 3506-room $4.3 billion mega-resort. But instead I found myself on the casino floor — and promptly got lost in a space as cavernous as an airplane hangar.

Happily succumbing to the sensory overload I drifted from the chiming poker machines and roulette tables to an Asian street-food arcade where I used a digital kiosk to order Singapore noodles and a plate of South Indian roti from an array of spice-scented hawker stalls. Along the way I stopped to admire displays of sacred Vegas relics: an oil painting by Liberace and one of his limousines — a white Rolls-Royce covered with mirror tiles. When I did eventually find Crockfords I was whisked to my room on the 65th floor where floor-to-ceiling windows maximized my view of the mountains of the Nevada desert. Below me the electric Katy danced away in silence like something between ""Blade Runner"" and ""Attack of the 50-Foot Woman.""

Nobody goes to Las Vegas in search of subtlety or moderation. When it comes to over-the-top glitz the city has been outdoing itself ever since Brooklyn mobster Bugsy Siegel's Flamingo Hotel & Casino rose like a mirage from the desert in 1946. So it's not surprising that the city used the closures brought on by the pandemic to up the ante yet again. Large-scale resorts opened (Resorts World Circa Virgin) while landmarks like the Bellagio took the opportunity to refurbish or create new venues. And visitors — some 32.2 million in 2021 — have been flocking back pandemic be damned. At times during my stay in Vegas it almost felt as if COVID had never happened — not at least in the same way it did in the rest of the U.S.

Today travelers are looking for a break from reality more than ever and the high-tech razzmatazz of the new mega-resorts is just the latest take on the escapist tradition.

If I was surprised to find the city booming I shouldn't have been. Vegas has always been a place to live large whether it was the Rat Pack partying at the Sands and the Dunes in the 1960s or the lurid 21st-century Sin City of ""The Hangover."" Today travelers are looking for a break from reality more than ever and the high-tech razzmatazz of the new mega-resorts is just the latest take on the escapist tradition. At Resorts World I could kick back in the spanking-new 5000-capacity theater which has the largest and tallest stage in the city and 200 giant speakers powered by something called ""L-ISA Hyperreal Sound technology."" I could also loll at one of nine fifth-floor pools or visit the state-of-the-art Awana Spa with its six ""age-reversing"" pools and its team of Sauna-Meisters whose job it is to fan guests with reviving aromatherapy oils.

I could if I so desired even step back in time. As the neon lights began to blaze out on the Strip I made my way to the Wynn to catch a show at a new supper club called Delilah which is styled with all the sensual intimacy of a 1930s Hollywood nightclub. As I settled back into an Art Deco armchair with a flute of champagne a tuxedoed jazz trio performed beneath two enormous gilded palm trees.

Every generation it seems gets the Vegas it needs. The current rebound is a testament to the city's adaptability. ""It's been not so much an overnight recovery as a slow and dignified trek back up the hill"" explained Teller of Penn & Teller. The magician is a seasoned observer of the Vegas entertainment scene and when I met him at his favorite vegan café Squally's eight miles southwest of the Strip he explained the movement over golden almond lattes spiced with turmeric and coconut oil. Penn & Teller have been going strong at the Rio since 2001 making them the longest-running headline act in the city's history. The silent partner of the magical duo Teller surprises people offstage by being both taller than expected (he's five foot nine but his partner Penn Jillette is six foot six) and quite talkative.

""The shutdown in Vegas was disastrous for entertainers"" he told me. The pair made the best of the hiatus by refining their act and recording TV specials at home. And now this city that exists to amuse is hosting full houses once again. ""It's crazy when you think about it"" Teller said. ""We're in the middle of nowhere. We depend on an entirely manufactured industry. But the model works. This is one of the few places in the U.S. where you can run a live theater show under conditions that are not extortionate. On Broadway you either have a massive hit or it's a flop. There is no middle ground. In Las Vegas the economics are favorable thanks to tourism. We don't bring the carnival to your hometown. We bring you to the carnival.""

From Resorts World I jumped to the Cosmopolitan another 24-hour mega-resort in the throbbing heart of the Strip. Like many properties the Cosmopolitan was recently renovated completing theirs in 2019 just before the pandemic. In a city where fresh air can be hard to come by I was pleased to find my room had a balcony overlooking the Bellagio's dancing fountain. Downstairs the casino-resort's maze of interconnected lobbies lined with branches of hip restaurants like Momofuku was surging with crowds.

""Every weekend night has been as busy as New Year's Eve 2019"" said Bill McBeath the Cosmopolitan's Nevada-born and -bred CEO as he stood in the middle of the human flow. It wasn't just the gambling. ""People come here because they know they are going to have an amazing time."" As we passed a photograph of a scantily-clad siren he said: ""We're bringing some pre-COVID energy. It's luxury with a twist with a little decadence in there too.""

""I have to be honest COVID was great for off-Strip Vegas. The casinos and big resorts were closed but southern Californian tourists kept coming. It gave the rest of the city a huge boost.""

After dark the decadence reaches fever pitch. ""Opium"" the Cosmopolitan's adults-only cabaret show recently upped its game by pairing with a wild immersive restaurant called Superfrico which bills itself as ""a clusterflourish of art and amusements."" I took in the eye-popping neon and candy-colored décor then was handed a menu offering ""Italian-American Psychedelic"" cuisine — in other words hallucinogenic takes on traditional Italian dishes. While near-naked jugglers performed in the aisles and a contortionist swiveled above my head I tried to focus on my futuristic chicken Parm which was marinated in yuzu-based ponzu sauce and doused with Japanese panko and sourdough breadcrumbs. It all made the perfect aperitif for ""Opium"" — a raunchy satirical interpretation of sci-fi movie classics which I watched while savoring cocktails named Kiss My Asteroid and Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster.

In the city's hunger to entertain the Strip's outrageous theatricality is spilling out across Las Vegas. The most tantalizing example of this is Area 15 (the name is a play on Area 51 the U.S. Air Force's alien-research site north of the city). It's the home of Lost Spirits Distillery where whiskey and rum are made in a warehouse-size high-tech ""immersive playground"" a mile east of the Strip.

Everything about the place is overwhelming. At the main entrance two portals opened onto a giant skull glowing with hypnotic patterns and a massive electric tree with fluorescent leaves. Music boomed; neon walls pulsed; overhead riders ziplined through the darkness.

For a guide I contacted Bryan Davis cofounder of the distillery — a ""Disneyland for Liquor"" — where technology literature and expensive alcohol intersect with a flair often compared to Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. Its style was obvious when Davis ran up to me outside the sideshow-style ticket booth. ""Sorry I'm late. I had to find a snake dancer!"" he panted.

Davis started the experimental whiskey and rum distillery in California with cofounder Joanne Haruta. He developed an organic chemistry process using intense light to ""age"" spirits 20 years in just six days. During the pandemic they transferred their inventive distillery tour to this Vegas location. ""You have to realize the scale of Las Vegas"" Davis said. ""The potential audience numbers are mind-boggling.""

Davis ushered me through the laboratory where raw alcohol is rapid-aged in sleek metal pods then into a delirious series of sideshow-like tasting rooms including a faux-Victorian parlor where the replacement snake dancer gyrated with a python; a faux-Havana nightclub where a hologram salsa band performed; and a faux-medieval chapel presided over by a priestess. The trippiest of all was a ""submarine"" inspired by Jules Verne's ""20000 Leagues Under the Sea."" Surely the world's most surreal literary bar the steampunk homage to Captain Nemo's Nautilus included a dozen chandeliers which swayed to evoke the underwater currents. I sank into one of the sumptuous leather loungers and watched through the portholes as cutouts of fish with human faces floated by.

After a few days even I wanted more than hedonistic glitz. One of the more unexpected changes wrought by the pandemic was the boost it brought to the city's lesser-known neighborhoods. Many residents regard its neon-saturated Strip much the way New Yorkers like me view Times Square — as a bright but exhausting place to be visited only on special occasions. In other corners they say lie intimate restaurants hipster cafés art galleries and museums that delve into Vegas's quirky history even lovely slices of nature.

""I have to be honest COVID was great for off-Strip Vegas"" said James Trees the chef-owner at Esther's Kitchen an Italian restaurant in the Arts District. ""The casinos and big resorts were closed but southern Californian tourists kept coming. It gave the rest of the city a huge boost."" Esther's Kitchen was packed when I settled into a booth with plates of hand-rolled tortellini and cauliflower alla romana. Google Maps and Uber have also helped drive the change Trees added allowing adventurous visitors to easily leave the casinos and explore the rest of the city. ""If people hear about an interesting place off-Strip they can just hop in a car and go.""

Trees started Esther's Kitchen four years ago when Las Vegas's Arts District was little more than a name. He took a risk converting an abandoned 1920s structure in a forgotten part of town. ""Nobody wanted this place! Everyone said we were crazy to be opening up down here"" he said. But like Bugsy's reverie the dream took concrete shape and Esther's Kitchen is today an institution luring a crowd of fashionable locals many of them performers.

The chill L.A.-style vibe shouldn't be surprising: Trees spent years living in Venice Beach and working with chefs like Michael Mina and Akasha Richmond. But the more irreverent Vegas spirit is never far away: in the restaurant's back area the ""Walken Refrigerator"" plastered with photos of the actor Christopher Walken has become a beloved local attraction.

Vegas showbiz traditions have their place here too: Trees told me that the restaurants' forks came from the Dunes Hotel the once-beloved casino that opened in the 1950s and housed the Sultan's Table — at the time named ""America's finest and most beautiful restaurant"" by Diner's Club — where guests were entertained by Arturo Romero and His Magic Violins.

Many residents regard the neon-saturated Strip much the way New Yorkers like me view Times Square — as a bright but exhausting place to be visited only on special occasions. In other corners they say lie intimate restaurants hipster cafés art galleries and museums that delve into Vegas's quirky history.

""Las Vegas has a small-town feeling away from the Strip"" explained another fan of the Arts District New York transplant Hazel Honeysuckle a burlesque dancer who moved to the city in 2018. At Caesar's Palace she plays the Green Fairy in ""Absinthe"" an adult circus. ""There is a community of performers — you get to know everyone."" After a stop at the hip Vesta Coffee Roasters Honeysuckle and I strolled down Main Street — ""about the only street in Las Vegas that residents actually walk down"" she laughed. Over the past few years the Arts District has grown into its name with boutiques antiques stores and hip hangouts like ReBar. There are several contemporary galleries including the warehouse-like Arts Factory with its Gallery to Go vending machines that sell works by local painters.

As we walked Honeysuckle explained why the city inspires devotion among performers many of whom stayed on through the pandemic. Although she had worked in classic Manhattan venues like the Slipper Room she never looked back after moving to Vegas. ""Spiegelworld called me for an audition and said: Do you want a full-time job as a burlesque dancer? I didn't realize that was even possible."" Today her sequined image surrounded by a penumbra of emerald feathers is on billboards and the sides of taxis and buses all over town. ""It's cushy! I have a permanent changing room. I don't have to lug my outfits up and down stairs. Someone does my makeup."" Low real estate costs have also helped the performing arts thrive: Honeysuckle was able to buy a house with a yard and a swimming pool for what a studio would cost in Brooklyn.

On my last night I made a pilgrimage to the site that perhaps best captures the versatility of the city. The Neon Museum — also known as the Neon Boneyard — is where the city's iconic electric signs are taken after casinos and hotels are knocked down. I joined an after-dark tour of a space that felt a little like a Dadaist art gallery illuminated by electric cowboys an ""Indian chief"" and cacti from long-forgotten pleasure domes where millions of Americans went to forget their troubles in decades past.

The most striking attraction is the sign of the once-cherished Stardust Resort & Casino which stood on the site Resorts World now occupies until it was leveled in 2007. In its time the 180-foot-high behemoth was a Vegas marvel that evoked the goofy futuristic optimism of ""The Jetsons"" and catered to one of American travel's most peculiar trends. The Stardust opened in 1958 at the height of ""atomic tourism"" when curiosity-seekers flocked to Vegas to watch mushroom clouds appear over the testing site at Frenchman Flat 65 miles away. The hotel would publish schedules of the explosions and hand out protective goggles so guests could watch while partying at the rooftop bar.

Later that night I went back to the lobby of Resorts World and tracked down a scaled-down replica of the Stardust sign in a gift shop — a subtle nod to history but a nod nonetheless. Then I dashed back to Lost Spirits for a final glass of scientifically aged rum. I watched the snake dancer writhe away next to the mock-medieval chapel as I drank. I can't imagine what future generations will make of it but in 2022 it was a perfect escape.

At about 8:45 the St. Cloud Fire Department responded to the 3300 block of 14th Street North for a power pole on fire. They found a fire burning at the top of the pole. Firefighters isolated the area and called Xcel Energy. While they were waiting for them to respond the line came down and started several small grass fires in the backyards of the homes.

Once Xcel secured the power the fire on the pole was put out with a fire extinguisher. Firefighters checked the yards and put out any hot spots.

The power was out while the fire was put out and the lines were repaired.

Kirill Kaprizov had just become the Wild's first 100-point player and only the seventh NHLer this season to hit triple digits.

""A huge thank you to the fans my teammates the organization"" Kaprizov said in Russian through a translator. ""Obviously it's a huge accomplishment. I'm extremely thankful and happy.""

But that wasn't all the Wild celebrated.

Kevin Fiala set a single-game Wild record with five assists including a franchise-high four in a period during a 6-3 blitz of the expansion Kraken on Friday in front of an announced 19047 that lifted the Wild to the most victories (50) and points (107) in team history.

This was also the Wild's NHL-leading ninth multi-goal rally which is also a franchise record and the team now has a two-point lead over the No. 3 Blues in the battle for second place in the Central Division and home-ice advantage in these rivals' looming first-round playoff matchup. Both have four games left in the regular season.

But wait there's more.

The Wild picked up its seventh victory during a nine-game point streak while extending its point streak at home to 13 games (12-0-1) to tie the franchise record. Since March 16 no one in the league has more wins than the Wild (16-1-3).

And Kaprizov?

He actually finished the night with 101 points racking up four to match his career high for a game.

Aside from scoring his 45th goal he had three assists and currently boasts the most by a Wild player in a season at 56 — one more than his linemate Mats Zuccarello who left the game because of a lower-body injury that will sideline him for Sunday's game at Nashville.

""Obviously getting the team win was super important"" Kaprizov said ""and made everything that much more sweet.""

Believe it or not the Wild stumbled early against Seattle which built a two-goal head start in the first period on goals from Daniel Sprong (6 minutes 16 seconds) and Yanni Gourde (10:20).

But the Wild dominated after that.

BOXSCORE: Wild 6 Seattle 3

Tic-tac-toe passing between Fiala and Kaprizov led to Joel Eriksson Ek capitalizing on the power play at 16:01 the appetizer to a five-goal buffet in the second.

Eriksson Ek had the next goal too at 2:04 when he buried a Fiala pass. Matt Boldy also assisted on the play extending his career-high point streak to eight to surpass Marian Gaborik for the longest point streak by a Wild rookie. Boldy's 37 points are also the second most for a Wild rookie.

Back on the power play Kaprizov tipped in a Fiala shot at 6:52 and Eriksson Ek's assist was his third point to match his career high.

Then at 10:22 Ryan Hartman used a Kaprizov pass to notch his 33rd goal.

That point lifted Kaprizov to 100 but he didn't stay there for long.

""I want to continue to keep this momentum going continue to progress and get better"" Kaprizov said.

Another power play goal by the Wild this one from Zuccarello at 12:03 off Fiala and Kaprizov assists brought the 24-year-old winger to 101 points.

""I figured he really wanted to reach that number and it's really impressive to do so"" Eriksson Ek said. ""He's just a dynamic player and can do everything. It's really fun to see and really good for our team.""

Fiala supplied the encore registering his fifth assist after Nic Deslauriers buried his own rebound at 14:29 and Fiala's four points in a period is also a team record.

""Everything I touched it went in I felt like"" Fiala said.

During his nine-game point streak Fiala has nine goals and a jaw-dropping 21 points. The winger's 82 points are second on the team and third in Wild history for a season behind only Kaprizov and Gaborik (83).

The evening was also a boon for the power play which went 3-for-5. Seattle was 1-for-2 with that goal coming 5:16 into the third period off the stick of Matty Beniers. Marc-Andre Fleury totaled 25 saves while improving to 7-1 with the Wild and Philipp Grubauer had 29 stops for the Kraken.

As for Kaprizov and what could be next for him ""Just play"" he said in English. ""Fun.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWFyaWxsby5jb20vcGljdHVyZS1nYWxsZXJ5L25ld3MvMjAyMi8wNC8yNC9wb3R0ZXItY291bnR5LWdyYXNzLWZpcmUtYnVybnMtbm9ydGgtYW1hcmlsbG8tYXByaWwtMjMtMjAyMi83NDI4ODk0MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Potter County grass fire burns north of Amarillo April 23 2022,"NEWS

What does that mean for humans and birds?,"When visitors enter the Denver Zoo they’re typically greeted by the African penguin habitat which opened just last fall.

But in recent weeks that exhibit has been empty. In fact all exhibits featuring the zoo’s birds like the bald eagle and the great hornbill are vacant. Signs outside all of the habitats explain why: A new strain of bird flu or avian flu has spread quickly since Colorado identified its first case in February and the zoo is trying to keep its animals safe.

“They are coming out a couple times a day so they can get access to the pool” said the zoo’s senior vice president for life sciences Brian Aucone. “The staff stays here and monitors that the whole time to make sure we don't have waterfowl flying in make sure that the exhibit’s clean and we don't have any goose poop.”

Much like the influenza virus that infects humans the disease is highly contagious resulting in a wide variety of symptoms including sudden fatigue decreased egg production and nasal discharge. And because there’s no way to treat domestic poultry for the bird flu infection usually means death.

Paolo Zialcita A sign asking visitors not to feed the geese at the Denver Zoo on April 13 2022. Waterfowl like geese are one of the primary spreaders of the avian flu.

Experts say the virus is primarily being spread by wild waterfowl like geese and ducks that are currently migrating through the United States. Even if they don’t land near other birds their droppings could spread the virus just about anywhere.

The good news is that there is no evidence showing this strain of the avian flu can spread to humans.

USDA testing shows the flu’s presence in Colorado is relatively low so far. The most significant outbreak in the state has been at a farm in Montrose where 60000 chickens had to be euthanized to prevent the disease’s spread. There has yet to be a case at the Denver Zoo but birds are being isolated indoors with little to no outdoor exposure.

“Anybody who's walking around in the world has a potential to accidentally walk through goose poop or duck poop and bring [avian flu] in with them” Aucone said. “What we're doing for our staff is that they're required to put on what's called personal protective equipment. So covering their shoes covering their clothing and stuff. They have shoes that are specific to the zoo at the moment so they don't take it home.”

Commercial farmers are taking precautions to protect their flocks

Of course not every flock owner has the same resources as a zoo. Tyler Kuntz a chicken farmer in Hotchkiss said his operation has increased security precautions to protect egg shipments produced by its 20000 chickens.

“Stretching out the deliveries of feed and the egg pickup. And then the washing of personal vehicle tires and semi tires we didn't normally do that but that is something that we've decided that it's worth the extra time to do” Kuntz said.

In addition to limiting human contact Kuntz’s chickens can no longer go outdoors and have to stay under a roof to prevent contact with wild birds.

Kevin J. Beaty/Denverite Avian neighbors float around at Garfield Lake Park in Mar Lee. Oct. 15 2020.

Kuntz said if an infection hit his flock which produces about 17000 eggs a day it would be devastating.

“[If] you lose your flock you're looking at $200000 to replace it” Kuntz said.

If commercial flocks are affected it isn’t just farmers that are impacted. Massive flock casualties have the potential to slow supply chains according to Ragan Adams a veterinary specialist at Colorado State University’s extension office.

“[Chickens] are a big part of the food supply both in the production of eggs and in the meat” Adams said. “At the rate that this outbreak is occurring the food supply is probably not threatened but certainly the cost of eggs and meat in chicken is going up because they're slightly less available.”

Backyard chicken are most vulnerable

Backyard chicken owners are especially at risk because most of their flocks are raised with free access to the outdoors. Megan May who was convinced by her daughter to raise chicken during the pandemic said her free-range flock hates being locked in their run.

“They complain very loudly. They want out they wanna go scratch and run around” May said. “At this point we still let them free-range every day. We just consider it part of that calculated risk.”

May is prepared to lock her flock indoors but she’s worried about chickens getting bored and aggressive towards each other something they’ve avoided by keeping them free range.

According to Adams owners with small coops who let their birds freely roam outdoors need to get ready for sustained periods of keeping flocks indoors.

“Now would be a time to expand [coops] so you could keep your birds underneath a roof and away from wild birds” Adams said.

Even if owners don’t suspect the bird flu has hit their birds Adams urges people to call the state veterinary office at (303) 869 9130 and call CSU’s Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at (970) 297 4008 for free avian flu testing and a necropsy.

“It's important to know that you really should take action because we need to know where the virus is” Adams said. ""So much like when we were going through COVID we wanted to make sure the people around those that had it were aware and providing more biosecurity to defend their animals or birds.”

Some experts also advise people to remove bird feeders from their backyards or to have a designated pair of shoes just for yard work.

They say it’s difficult to predict when the avian flu epidemic will end. Testing right now mainly consists of vets analyzing bird carcasses. That coupled with ongoing bird migration means no one knows the full extent of the diseases' spread across the nation."

Available in 700 US grocery stores Flax Mylk’s shelf-stable products are also sold online through Thrive Market and malibumylk.com.

While established brands like Good Karma already offer flax-derived milk alternatives Malibu says its products are the first to preserve the entire flaxseed in the end product without straining. Rich in fiber flax is a 4000-year-old superfood that is a top source of vegan omega-3 fatty acids. The mighty seed is also believed to contain anti-inflammatory properties help lower cholesterol improve heart health and soothe digestive ailments.

Malibu’s Flax Mylk is completely allergen-friendly and made without gums oils or synthetic vitamins. Instead of refined sugar the brand’s sweetened varieties only contain dates. Flax Mylk also offers true sustainability benefits – unlike popular dairy-free ingredients like almonds flaxseeds are fully irrigated by natural rainfall.

Chef-created and perfected

Malibu was founded in 2019 by Brittany Fuisz a Le Cordon Bleu Graduate who trained at the Michelin-starred Le Bernardin in NYC. After discovering better health results from an elimination diet that cut out nuts gluten dairy and soy Fuisz began applying her advanced culinary knowledge to nutritious milk alternatives.

The brand has attracted a powerful lineup of investors and advisors including Jim Goetz of Casimir Holdings Tom long former CEO of MillerCoors and David Novak former CEO of YUM! Brands. In 2022 Malibu also added new single-serve coffee and matcha latte beverage cans to its lineup.

Leaving the goodness in

“When I was researching recipes for milk alternatives I noticed that traditional dairy-free options are made by blending and then straining the ingredients. The results are little more than non-dairy water with a majority of the nutrients from the plants discarded” says Fuisz. “With Malibu Mylk we blend whole organic flaxseed and leave all the goodness in so you reap the benefits of the entire plant. What’s more because flax is a natural emulsifier our product is naturally creamy and wholly satisfying.”",,,,,,,,,
