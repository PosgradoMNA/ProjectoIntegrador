This is excluding PPF & ceramic coating.

BHPian V.Narayan recently shared this with other enthusiasts.

All the 3M film has been removed. Thankfully (fingers crossed touch wood) no paint peeling took place. I've requested Lexus to search for tiny scratches and see if they can be touched up before the ceramic coating is laid over. The process of removing the 3M film took 2 working days (don't know how many man hours). Photos below of the car after the 3M film was peeled off. So far so good.

The 3M film Lexus' high quality of the original paintwork and careful driving has helped keep the paint in almost new condition 5+ years later.

Now they will start on the pre-treatment for the ceramic.

The 3M film has been fully removed. After that the surface needed to be treated to remove the residue of the glue. Pictures post that stage. Next the car will undergo a wash to get it ready for the ceramic treatment.

The pre-ceramic treatment is done. Over Saturday and Sunday they will finish the ceramic coating and deliver Bhageera on Monday. I'm relieved the original factory paint did not peel off - maybe it is a function of Lexus' original quality of factory painting and the skill of the workmen at their ASS shop. The original paintwork was examined carefully and did not need any touch-up paint either. Fingers crossed so far so good. If this comes off well then it shall give old faithful's good looks another 3 to 4 years of life hopefully.

Time permitting I'll do a photo shoot on Monday/Tuesday to show off Bhageera the purple panther.

Bagheera’s gets its 7th servicing and a shiny new ceramic coating

Bagheera is back. The experiment with removing the 3M film and then applying ceramic coating all over has proved to be a success. Even Toyota/Lexus were not sure about the original paint peeling off when the 3M was removed. In between the two there was a stage of cleaning and preparing the surface for the ceramic. Fortunately the car did not need any touch-up paint. I was surprised because I expected at least some touch-up work on the corners at the extreme. Credit to my driver for the care with which he drives. Maybe some credit to me too. The entire ceramic exercise cost Rs 79000 before tax. The Lexus ceramic job comes with a 3-year warranty. Interestingly the 3M job was around Rs 1.5 lakhs.

The car also underwent its 7th servicing as it was close to its 12-month time cycle. The main job that needed addressing was the replacement of the rear left shock absorber which had started giving a khat-khat sound. That replacement cost Rs 28000 plus tax. This is the first major component changed in the Lexus in 65 months. We also changed the carpets which set me back by another Rs 27000. Steep I thought but then I was reminded of today's generation's phrase YOLO.

Total expenditure on Lexus’ maintenance thus far is now Rs 295000 or Rs 5.26 per kms or Rs 4538 per month. This includes the change of all 4 tyres on completing 3.5 years. I’m not including the original 3M film or the ceramic coating as both those are non-engineering items unrelated to reliability. Including them the gross outflow thus far comes to ~Rs 525000.

My thanks to brother BHPians for their advice and suggestions - @Turbanator and @ Sagarpadaki.

All told I’m as happy as a kid in a candy store.

The next two minor jobs are to get the leather on the driver's seat restored or replaced and fit a new front number plate. The current one has curved up a bit and doesn't do justice to the car.

AFP TAIPEI





A colorful semiconductor tycoon yesterday unveiled plans to train more than 3 million “civilian warriors” to help defend the nation in the event of a Chinese invasion donating NT$1 billion (US$32.8 million) of his own money.

Robert Tsao (曹興誠) 75 is one of Taiwan’s most successful businessmen and founded major chipmaker United Microelectronics Corp (UMC 聯電). He has been increasingly outspoken against Beijing and his pledge came after Chinese troops put on a huge show of force near the nation after US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei last month.

For a week after Pelosi’s visit China sent warships missiles and fighter jets into the waters and skies around Taiwan its largest and most aggressive exercises since the mid-1990s.

Tsao warned it would be “an intentional slaughter and vicious war crime and crime against humanity” if China were to use force against Taiwan.

The tycoon said he would put NT$600 million toward training 3 million “black bear warriors” in the next three years adding that they could work alongside the military.

Another NT$400 million would be used to train 300000 “marksmen” with shooting skills he said.

Tsao who no longer holds any position or title at UMC said the risk posed by China is existential.

“The Chinese Communist Party’s threat to Taiwan is growing and the fight against [it] stands for freedom against slavery democracy against authoritarianism and civilized against barbaric” he said.

“If we can successfully resist China’s ambitions we not only will be able to safeguard our homeland but make a big contribution to the world situation and the development of civilization” he added.

Taiwan has spent decades living alongside China’s threats but the saber-rattling has become more pronounced under Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平).

China’s most authoritarian leader in a generation Xi is on the cusp of securing an unprecedented third term later this year and has made gaining Taiwan a key part of his “national rejuvenation” goals.

Taiwan remains massively outgunned with 88000 ground forces compared with China’s 1 million troops the US Department of Defense says.

Mandatory military service for Taiwanese men is just four months and Taiwanese and US strategists have increasingly pushed Taipei to adopt a “porcupine” strategy of asymmetric warfare which would include training civilians to fight.

Russia’s stalled invasion of Ukraine has also focused attention in Taiwan on the threats posed by a giant authoritarian neighbor and how huge armies can be resisted by a much smaller but determined defender.

Tsao yesterday also announced that he had regained Taiwanese citizenship.

Showing an enlarged copy of his Republic of China identification card Tsao told reporters that he had renounced his Singaporean citizenship which he obtained in 2011 and was “so excited” to have his original citizenship restored.

From now on he would stand with his “courageous compatriots” against any invasion by China and ensure that Taiwan remains “the land of the free and the home of the brave” he said likening Taiwan to the US.

Hotel Football the hospitality chain owned by Manchester United icons Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville has lost £3.2million over the last two years and owes more than £10m in loans.

Giggs started the business with Neville back in 2011 after retiring from football. Now annual accounts for the business - which were filed this week - show the hotel which is based near Manchester United's Old Trafford ground lost heaps of cash in 2020 and 2021 after suffering from the Covid pandemic.

The documents as first reported on by the Daily Star reveal the firm had pulled a restaurant from the National Museum of Football to save cash. Accounts show that the company behind the business – called Old Trafford Supporters Club Ltd – lost £1148879 in 2021 and £2042812 the previous year during the pandemic.

The company while unable to operate during the Covid pandemic continued to pay its workers throughout and opened up the building for the NHS to use free of charge.

Giggs' fellow director Neville said in comments attached to the figures that trading had not been 'normal' as the business had been 'hit drastically' by lockdown restrictions which had 'affected the financial figures' throughout the pandemic.

Neville also alluded to the fact that the business was still contending with issues in the wake of the pandemic with inflation costs rising rapidly. But he added: ""The directors have continued their policy of investing in the hotel to improve operational performance and to promote the Hotel Football brand even post the pandemic year.

""The directors feel that whatever the case the quality of the brand and of the property they manage cannot be sacrificed.’’

After stressing that the figures for 2022 were 'very encouraging' as life reverts back to normality Neville said the firm’s parent company Orchid Leisure Ltd had loaned the hotel business £10.2m to help it survive.

""Based on the above the directors are confident that the company will have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least the next 12 months’’ he added.

Neville set up the Old Trafford Supporters Club in 2012 before Giggs joined him as a fellow director four months later. The pair progressed through the ranks at Manchester United together as part of the group known as 'The Class of 92'.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmpvZS5jby51ay9uZXdzL2dhcnktbmV2aWxsZS1yZXZlYWxzLWhvdGVsLWZvb3RiYWxsLXNwZW50LTNtLWhvc3RpbmctbmhzLXN0YWZmLWZvci1mcmVlLWR1cmluZy1wYW5kZW1pYy0zNTY4MjPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gary Neville reveals Hotel Football spent £3m hosting NHS staff for free during pandemic,"The business paid out an eye-watering £3m over the course of two years

Hotel Football the business venture run by Gary Neville and his former Manchester United teammate Ryan Giggs has spent over £3 million in the past two years hosting NHS staff.

Two hotels both in Manchester closed to the public in March 2020 and were made available to health workers who were not able to live with their families during the covid pandemic free of charge.

Former England footballer Neville spoke out on Saturday after several media outlets reported that Hotel Football had lost a staggering £3m in two years and owes £10m in loans.

Many of the reports failed to mention just how much Neville and Giggs did during the pandemic to support their staff and the country’s medical staff.

Can i just sort your headline out for you 👇🏻 ‘ Hotel owners maintain and pay all staff 100% of their wages in a global pandemic  whilst also hosting 120 medical professionals and nurses  who were sheltering from vulnerable family members at no cost to the NHS for 9 months’ https://t.co/5a9cUOQ8EA — Gary Neville (@GNev2) September 3 2022

Speaking to PoliticsJOE Neville said: “We funded the £3m over 2 years with either our own cash or loans and paid our staff in full.

“We also looked after the NHS staff locally that couldn’t stay at home in the first wave of the pandemic.”

The luxurious Stock Exchange Hotel in Manchester had been open only five months before it closed its doors shortly after being named one of the World’s Best New Luxury Hotels for 2020.

“We look after our teams and we wanted to offer some support at a worrying time for everyone” said Neville.

“We’d also seen in Italy that doctors and nurses were struggling to find accommodation away from vulnerable family members so we partnered with the Manchester NHS foundation trust.

“We were the first to do it and we were pretty full for the whole first wave in Hotel Football and had 25-30 in the Stock Exchange hotel.”

Writing on twitter Cystic Fibrosis physiotherapist Nicole Petch said she had been one of the staff hosted in Hotel Football during the pandemic.

“I stayed at Hotel Football during the first wave of the pandemic” she said. “Thank you so much for your kindness generosity & allowing me to keep my family safe.”

Ashish Bhargava senior director of software engineering and his team of technologists harness electrophysiology data to deliver insights that shape present and future patient care.



With a background in computer science Ashish has spent his entire career in MedTech working with startups and global medical device manufacturers across technologies such as remote patient management cardiac monitoring wearables and neuromodulation.



Throughout his career Ashish sought to work on healthcare innovations that help improve people’s lives. In 2018 that quest brought him to Abbott’s electrophysiology business.



Seeing Inside the Heart in Real-Time



Ashish leads a team focused on the software that helps in the diagnosis and treatment of atrial fibrillation (AFib) a health condition that causes an irregular heartbeat and can increase the risk of stroke. The team develops cardiac mapping systems that use the electromagnetic signals from a patient’s heart to create 3D models showing the heart’s inner workings.



With this real-time visualization physicians can determine the origin of atrial fibrillation. Then they can precisely treat that area of the heart—using heat or cold – to scar or remove tissue in the heart wall and restore a regular heartbeat. These cardiac ablation procedures are sometimes required when a person with AFib doesn’t respond to medication.



Ashish’s team is constantly refining the data-driven software behind the cardiac mapping systems.



“Our technology can handle immense amounts of data in a short period” Ashish said. “Think of the computing power you’d need to build a video game—except that in these procedures you are working with the human heart. Getting to engineer such a vital product is what makes our work so challenging and fulfilling.”



The Next Evolution of Data



Now Ashish’s team is helping to make the devices smarter with every procedure and unlock a more precise approach to AFib treatment. These systems collect data from thousands of cases over time and within this data scientists and clinicians can find ways to better diagnose and treat patients to improve their outcomes.



“We aim to leverage this data to better understand the mechanism for atrial fibrillation and what happens within the heart tissue to cause an episode” Ashish said. “From there clinicians can precisely pinpoint where AFib originates.”



Ashish’s team hopes that one day doctors can use data from each patient’s heart to identify a personalized cure for AFib factoring in a person’s health history and other medical conditions.



From Ashish’s perspective the power of data is both personal and collective offering the opportunity to unlock precision medicine at scale.



“The impact of data in healthcare can't be overestimated” he said. “We’re uncovering the secrets in the data—why diseases happen what causes certain symptoms why people respond differently to the same condition. We still have a long way to go to understand why these things happen and data gives us the ability to start moving diagnosis and treatment closer to the science.”



A Need for Technologists



Ashish’s team is working on a cloud-connected system that will transfer anonymized data from within hospitals to a cloud-based environment for analysis. In the future applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to these data sets could further refine the diagnosis and treatment process.



“Building smarter more intelligent systems will depend on our ability to do artificial intelligence and machine learning in the cloud and then feed those learnings back to the hospital systems before the procedure starts” Ashish said.



As Abbott continues to invest in digital technologies and builds its data science capability the company has many opportunities for people to help lead the evolution of data. Ashish’s team is continuing to grow. They need people who can analyze and interpret data. With that in mind they’re recruiting cloud infrastructure technologists.



“We’re looking for people in every discipline associated with cloud infrastructure artificial intelligence and machine learning—data scientists data architects cybersecurity specialists engineers architects and full-stack developers” Ashish said.



Ashish and his peers recognize they’re competing for talent and that Abbott’s mission sets it apart.



“We hire people who are interested in truly making a difference with their careers and knowing that everything they do directly impacts patients for the better” Ashish said.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said this week that rape victims in his state can take Plan B a pregnancy-preventing emergency contraceptive known as a “morning-after pill.”

“We want to support those victims but also those victims can access health care immediately as well as to report it” Abbott said in a pre-recorded interview with KXAS-TV and The Dallas Morning News slated to air on Sunday the newspaper reported.

“By accessing health care immediately they can get the Plan B pill that can prevent a pregnancy from occurring in the first place. With regard to reporting it to law enforcement that will ensure that the rapist will be arrested and prosecuted” Abbott added according to the Morning News.

CNN has reached out to Abbott’s office for comment.

Texas’ abortion trigger-law which passed in 2021 in anticipation of the repeal of Roe v. Wade went into effect last month putting in place new criminal penalties for abortion and offering an exemption only for certain health emergencies.

The Lone Star State bars abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy which is one of the strictest in the nation and prohibits abortion before many people know they are pregnant. Under the Texas law abortion is prohibited when a fetal heartbeat is detected.

In developed countries where abortion is legal none have set a gestation limit as early as six weeks according to the Center for Reproductive Rights which campaigns for improved access to abortion.

The US Food and Drug Administration approved Plan B in 1999. The key ingredient in the pill is a synthetic hormone called levonorgestrel. This drug stops an egg from being released from the ovary or preventing fertilization of the egg by sperm.

If there has been fertilization Plan B may prevent a fertilized egg from embedding in the uterus. But if the egg has already been implanted in the uterus the morning-after pill will not work.

Emergency contraceptives are intended for use within 72 hours after sex but are most effective if taken within 24 hours.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3BvbGl0aWNzLzIwMjIvMDkvMDIvcmFwZS12aWN0aW1zLWNhbi10YWtlLXBsYW4tYi1pbnN0ZWFkLW9mLWhhdmluZy1hYm9ydGlvbnMtdGV4YXMtZ292LWdyZWctYWJib3R0LXNheXMv0gGXAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvcG9saXRpY3MvMjAyMi8wOS8wMi9yYXBlLXZpY3RpbXMtY2FuLXRha2UtcGxhbi1iLWluc3RlYWQtb2YtaGF2aW5nLWFib3J0aW9ucy10ZXhhcy1nb3YtZ3JlZy1hYmJvdHQtc2F5cy8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Abbott defends Texas abortion ban: Rape victims can use Plan B,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said this week that although the state’s abortion ban makes no exception for rape or incest victims of these crimes can take emergency contraception and call the police.

“We want to support those victims but also those victims can access health care immediately as well as to report it” Abbott said during a segment that will air Sunday on Lone Star Politics a show produced by KXAS-TV (NBC 5) and The Dallas Morning News. “By accessing health care immediately they can get the Plan B pill that can prevent a pregnancy from occurring in the first place. With regard to reporting it to law enforcement that will ensure that the rapist will be arrested and prosecuted.”

Democratic nominee for governor Beto O’Rourke’s campaign criticized Abbott’s comments and his record on crime.

“Greg Abbott signed the most extreme abortion ban in the nation with no exception for rape or incest” O’Rourke campaign spokesman Chris Evans said. “Meanwhile Texas leads the nation in rape offenses on his watch and the arrest rate for rape has fallen by nearly half since he took office as he allows over 3000 untested rape kits to collect dust in his state crime labs.”

Texas does have a rape kit testing backlog and led the nation in rape offenses in 2020 but Alaska and other states had more rapes per capita. Experts also note that clearance rates on all major crimes have been declining for years.

In the past Abbott has said he would help victims by “eliminating rape in Texas.” During the interview this week he reiterated the need to stop such crimes.

“We support and have an obligation to aid victims of rape and incest and we as a state we should all agree that it’s something that we need to work toward ending” he said.

Experts however point to Department of Justice statistics that show the difficulty in arresting and prosecuting perpetrators of sexual assault and to the reasons the crimes are less likely to be reported.

Health care advocates also say Abbott’s call for rape victims to rely on the Plan B pill is flawed.

Many women who suffer such trauma don’t immediately realize they could be pregnant and victims who want to use Plan B may not be able to access the medication which has been in demand since the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe vs. Wade in June.

Advocates are also concerned that the decision could lead to a ban on contraceptives. In a concurring opinion Justice Clarence Thomas said the court should reconsider other past rulings including one codifying the right to contraception access.

Julie Ross a longtime health care advocate from Dallas said some doctors may not want to discuss Plan B with patients for fear of breaking the new Texas law. She added that Abbott’s refusal to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act which requires insurance companies to cover women’s contraceptives could result in Plan B not being available to low-income patients.

“There’s so many false assumptions baked into that statement including their presumptions on when pregnancy awareness occurs and what health care options are available to pregnant people” Ross said of Abbott’s remarks. “Sometimes a pregnant person doesn’t even know they’re pregnant.”

When asked directly about exceptions for rape and incest not being part of Texas’ abortion ban Abbott said “That was voted on both during the regular and during the special session.”

The trigger law Texas passed in 2021 in anticipation of the Roe decision bans all abortions with the only exception being medical emergencies to save the life of the mother.

Throughout the campaign O’Rourke and Abbott have sparred over the abortion issue.

Abbott criticized his challenger during the Lone Star Politics interview saying O’Rourke stands for “abortion on demand at taxpayer expense.”

“When the public learns about Beto’s position on abortion they will be repelled by it” Abbott said. “He not only believes in abortion to the very last minute before a fully developed child is given birth but he was even against a law that would require a doctor to provide medical care to a baby who survives abortion. That’s appalling.”

Evans the O’Rourke campaign spokesman said Abbott’s characterization of his abortion stance is not true.

“Like the vast majority of Texans Beto has long supported the standard set by Roe v. Wade which for half a century prohibited states from outlawing abortion in cases where the pregnancy threatened the life of the pregnant woman” Evans said. “That standard allowed for women and their doctors to make this personal and often painful decision later in the pregnancy if the abortion was necessary to save the woman’s life.”

Since enacting Senate Bill 8 last year which effectively banned abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy Texas has been at the center of the debate over reproductive rights.

Most Texas conservatives have stood firm in supporting anti-abortion laws pointing out alternatives for women who don’t want to keep their children such as adoption.

“Texas is leading the way with regard to alternatives for abortion” Abbott said Thursday. “It’s an all-time record high and it’s grown 800% since I’ve been governor.”

He continued: “We want to make adoptions easier and cheaper. We’ve added funding for things like prenatal care postpartum care for women. The Women’s Health program today has more money in it than ever before and Texas leads the nation with regard to crisis pregnancy centers that will provide care and treatment for pregnant women so Texas is stepping up and doing more than any state to help out pregnant women.”

However a Texas plan to extend Medicaid coverage for new mothers will likely be rejected by the federal government state lawmakers say because the benefits are too restrictive. Women who terminate their pregnancies even in medical emergencies are ineligible for the extra months of health insurance under the law.

Advocates say coverage shouldn’t be dependent on how a pregnancy ends and they worry that Texas’ abortion ban will discourage women from being honest about their health status.

Abbott said a goal of his campaign is to clarify Texas procedures related to curbing abortions.

“We need to provide more clarity of what we are doing to protect the life of the mother” he said. “There seems to be ambiguity out there about protecting the life of the mother. That’s of paramount importance whether it be what’s called an ectopic pregnancy or it could be some other issues that mothers are having. Doctors need to be aware of all the different things they can do to save the life of the mother.”

According to a recent study by Parkland Health and UT Southwestern Medical Center Texas abortion restrictions required doctors to delay abortions until women developed complications that posed an “immediate threat” to their lives.

The court made clear that simply having a large number of patents on a single product is not in itself a violation of US antitrust laws as the patent laws set no limit on the number of patents an entity can hold.

The court likewise noted that technology companies such as Apple Intel and Microsoft routinely make products with many more patents than Humira.

First Impression

The Humira case presents an issue of first impression and could now pose a serious hurdle going forward for generic manufacturers especially in the biologics space. In a climate of heavy antitrust scrutiny pharmaceutical and biologics companies have been counseled to proceed with caution in how aggressively they seek layered patent protection on single products.

Up to this point there is a real possibility that pharmaceutical and biologics manufacturers have refrained from acquiring a thick patent protection like AbbVie did for Humira. Now that conduct carries substantially less risk.

This decision also recognizes patents as an achievement for innovation and embraces the view that more patents on a particular product represent greater innovation. On the heels of this decision we should expect to see more products especially biologics driving for more patents.

Of note there was no dispute in this case that Humira’s defense posed a significant obstacle to the generic manufacturers—but that is the result of patents and not disturbed by antitrust.

‘Patent Thicket’

For many years Humira was the world’s top-selling drug but the principal US patent expired in 2016. AbbVie obtained an additional 132 patents related to ancillary uses such manufacturing methods and administering Humira. These actions extended the patent out to 2034.

In 2019 indirect purchasers of Humira claimed that AbbVie’s vast portfolio of patents covering Humira and settlements over those patents violated US antitrust law. The attack on the Humira patent estate for the sheer numerosity of its patents was the first of a kind.



The plaintiffs argued that this so-called “patent thicket” where AbbVie obtained and asserted large swaths of patents against biosimilar manufacturers violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.

At the core of the Seventh Circuit’s discussion was this question: “If AbbVie made 132 inventions why can’t it hold 132 patents?”

The Seventh Circuit noted that the plaintiffs “abjured” any reliance on Walker Process Equipment Inc. v. Food Machinery & Chemical Corp. or sham litigation one of which may be a prerequisite to challenging the sheer numerosity of patents protecting a single product.

Under the Walker Process doctrine a party that knowingly asserts a fraudulently procured patent in an attempt to monopolize a market may be liable under the antitrust laws.

Antitrust laws also prohibit sham litigation which involves objectively baseless lawsuits to interfere with a competitor’s business. While a specific Walker Process claim might not have been available to the plaintiffs here the absence of sham litigation and/or fraud charges left no allegation that AbbVie engaged in misconduct.

To the extent patents are directed to technological advancements “too marginal to justify legal protection” those patents should be individually challenged at the US Patent and Trademark Office where it turns out AbbVie has successfully defended the validity of its patents before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board.

The Seventh Circuit also noted that AbbVie had been successful at obtaining patents before the PTO finding AbbVie’s “batting average” of 0.534 to be “stellar in patent practice and unheard-of in baseball.”

AbbVie’s success before the PTO and the lack of evidence that AbbVie asserted an unreasonable number of possibly irrelevant patents against biosimilar manufacturers militated against a finding of anticompetitive conduct to support a Section 2 claim.

Were Patent Settlements Quid Pro Quo?

The settlements AbbVie entered into were also a focus of the lawsuit. AbbVie settled with various US competitors to allow the entry of Humira biosimilars into the US market in 2023 while settlements in Europe allowed for an earlier entry date in 2018.

This earlier entry date in Europe was quid pro quo for delaying competitive entry in the US according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs claimed these settlements amounted to a reverse payment from AbbVie to biosimilar manufacturers a potential violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act which prohibits contracts that unreasonably restrain competition.

While contemporaneous uneven settlement of a separate litigation may constitute a payment under FTC v. Actavis plausible allegations cannot simply point to a different date to suggest that the settlement at issue includes a payment.

A single product may have different patent terms in different jurisdictions and reasonable settlement terms in each jurisdiction will depend on the strength of the patent claims at issue in each.

This can result in different generic or biosimilar entry dates for different countries even when the same exact products are involved. Absent a large payment from the brand to the follow-on manufacturer the settlement at issue is lawful.

Different laws and patent expiration dates govern across the two continents and no biosimilar manufacturer was paid to postpone market entry despite lacking a plausible monetary claim against AbbVie.

Since AbbVie negotiated normal settlements without payment to U.S. biosimilar competitors to delay entry and struck “the same kind of deal” across Europe—allowing competitive entry before the last patents expired—the combination of two permissible patent litigation settlement schemes could not amount to a reverse payment.

Proper Venue for Claims

Antitrust suits should not be invoked as a backdoor to attacking patent claims that are supposedly weak. The proper venues for invalidating weak or marginal patents remain patent suits in the federal district courts and the Patent Trial and Appeal Board.

What’s clear from the Seventh Circuit’s opinion is that the value of a strong patent portfolio cannot be understated and prescription drug manufacturers may legitimately strive to obtain as many patents as possible without fear of antitrust liability.

But Thursday the world’s largest privately owned pharma became the first company to score an FDA approval to treat generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) a rare and life-threatening skin condition that causes eruptions of painful blisters. These GPP flares are so disruptive to the system that they can trigger heart failure renal failure or sepsis.

The nod is for BI’s antibody drug Spevigo. The IL-36 receptor inhibitor is also under review in Europe and a decision is expected before the end of this year. It is the first dermatology approval for the German firm.

With the FDA blessing BI beat AnaptysBio to the punch in GPP. The San Diego company also has an IL-36 drug imsidolimab in development and phase 3 results are due by the end of next year.

BI also is conducting a trial of Spevigo as a maintenance treatment to prevent flares. In addition the company is investigating its effectiveness against other skin diseases such as palmoplantar pustulosis and hidradenitis suppurativa.

Supporting the GPP approval was a phase 2 trial of 53 patients with flares. Of those treated with Spevigo 54% were clear of their skin pustules compared to 6% for placebo. Spevigo's protection sustained for 12 weeks.

GPP is caused by an accumulation of neutrophils a type of white blood cell in the skin. It causes eruptions of pustules and red inflamed skin all over the body. Because it is so rare the condition is under-diagnosed and often mistaken for other skin disorders.

Doctors have typically treated GPP off-label with drugs such as AbbVie’s Skyrizi Novartis’ Cosentyx Amgen’s Enbrel Johnson & Johnson’s Tremfya and a host of others.

“The approval of Spevigo is a turning point for dermatologists and clinicians” Mark Lebwohl M.D. the lead investigator and dean for clinical therapeutics Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Kimberly and Eric J.

Fosun Pharma's Shanghai Henlius Biotech is looking for a U.S. partner for its PD-1 inhibitor as the company shifts focus from biosimilars to innovative drugs. Takeda has returned two microbiome-based inflammatory bowel disease projects to Finch Therapeutics. And more.

1. FDA slaps Biocon following inspections of biosimilar production sites in India Malaysia

Just as Biocon touted its biosimilar manufacturing capabilities in a proposed acquisition of partner Viatris’ biosimilar portfolio the Indian company was hit with multiple Forms 483. Its two biologics plants in India got 11 observations each and its Malaysian site received six observations. They followed preapproval inspections of a biosimilar to Roche’s Avastin and two insulins.

2. Henlius CEO scouts for US PD-1 partner amid Fosun unit's pivot to innovative drugs from biosimilars

Shanghai Henlius Biotech a unit of Fosun Pharma is looking for a U.S. partner for its China-approved PD-1 inhibitor serplulimab CEO Wenjie Zhang said. The company is initially targeting small cell lung cancer where Bristol Myers Squibb’s Opdivo and Merck’s Keytruda have chalked up failures. Zhang also believed that the expected inclusion of biologics and biosimilars in China’s volume-based procurement won’t hurt Henlius’ anchor biosimilar business too much.

3. Takeda returns 2 inflammatory bowel prospects back to Finch's nest

Takeda decided to end its inflammatory bowel disease collaboration with Finch Therapeutics which included two preclinical microbiome-based candidates. The news came a year after Takeda decided to accelerate the transition of development responsibility for one asset ahead of the originally planned first-in-human study. In the deal Takeda has paid $44 million in total including for R&D expense reimbursement.

Everest Medicines CEO Kerry Blanchard resigned shortly after the Chinese biotech handed rights to Trodelvy in China and certain other Asian markets to Gilead Sciences. Everest has “identified a finalist among a short list of CEO candidates” following “an extensive search in the past few months” its chairman Wei Fu said.

6. After setbacks in AbbVie’s CD47 deal I-Mab sharpens focus to 5 drugs (release)

I-Mab has decided to prioritize five assets out of 20 because “they are value drivers” CEO Jingwu Zang told investors during the company’s second-quarter earnings call. The move comes as AbbVie capped two trials of I-Mab’s CD47 drug lemzoparlimab and revised their partnership with reduced milestone potential.

For hospital administrators tornadoes present a unique challenge. In addition to a spike in acute injuries hospital operations will potentially be disrupted by evacuations power outages infrastructure damage road closures and other ancillary effects. To best prepare their facilities for the threat of tornadoes hospital administrators should work with a supply chain partner with the data and experience to handle any adverse situation.

Supply chain considerations during tornado season

The primary priority of a hospital’s staff during a disaster is patient care. Supply chain concerns tend to take a backseat until supplies run low. At that point it may be too late to replenish supplies quickly especially if local infrastructure is damaged in a storm. Supply chain preparedness should be a top priority for any hospital administrator to ensure that patient care can be kept at a high standard.

The importance of an experienced supply partner

With the ongoing supply chain problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic margins are already thin. Some medical supplies are still in high demand and infrastructure hasn’t completely bounced back to pre-pandemic levels. It’s more important than ever to plan ahead for what your hospital might need.

One of the most useful tools at our disposal is the data from previous disasters in similar facilities and similar geographical areas. By collecting data from all over the country hospital administrators and suppliers can better anticipate which supplies will be needed and when.

In 2017 when Hurricane Harvey hit Houston TRIOSE was heavily involved in helping Houston hospitals to both prepare for the storm and maintain their standard of patient care throughout the worst weather. This effort involves both careful planning and adaptability.

Many hospitals in hurricane-stricken regions have flood doors that can be closed to keep water out but when those doors are closed supplies can no longer enter or leave the hospital. In anticipation of significant flooding administrators will order extra supplies but we don’t recommend stockpiling as such. With the help of careful data collection a good supply chain partner can help ensure your hospital can receive exactly what you need without wasting resources on unnecessary extra supplies or being caught short during a weather event.

Once a storm hits adaptability is crucial. It’s difficult to anticipate exactly what kinds of injuries and illnesses will result from a storm and the supplies needed to provide adequate care will vary depending on the nature of care required. In an unpredictable situation like this it’s essential to work with a supply chain partner who can help source and deliver the supplies you need.

Choosing the right carriers for your hospital

One consideration that many administrators might not think of is the specific carriers that will operate in storm conditions. Carriers in different zip codes will have different transportation options at their disposal and different policies for when those carriers can operate. Some won’t operate in storm conditions at all out of concern for the safety of their drivers while others will only operate smaller vehicles that may not be able to carry enough supplies to replenish what a hospital needs. In any case keeping your hospital well-stocked in bad weather may not be as simple as picking up the phone.

Administrators will also need to keep in mind that different supplies need different treatment. During the initial rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines which required strict refrigeration practices many carriers found that they didn’t have the means to store or transport large quantities of refrigerated goods. Finding a carrier that can handle sensitive medical supplies and equipment is crucial to keeping your hospital prepared.

An experienced supply chain partner like TRIOSE can take on the difficult work of finding carriers who are capable of moving the right supplies in the right quantities and under the right conditions even in inclement weather.

Advice for hospitals during tornado season

The most important thing that hospital administration can do to prepare is to plan ahead. Leave the daily job of patient care to the doctors and look at the bigger picture including supply lines vendors and carriers. Try to think about contingencies that might come up in a disaster:

If nearby roads are blocked are there other carriers who can get us supplies faster?

How long can we go without a resupply?

How much extra capacity can we hold?

What do we do in the event that we can’t get more supplies?

Do we have the means to move high-risk patients to other facilities?

Which vendors will still deliver to us in storm conditions?

Assess your disaster readiness including both your capabilities and needs and put protocols and procedures in place. Find effective partners who can help you navigate the intricacies of keeping your supply lines running. Hopefully you won’t need to use these plans anytime soon but if the worst should happen you’ll be as ready as you can be.

The last bits of ash and greenhouse gases from Hawaii's only remaining coal-fired power plant slipped into the environment this week when the state's dirtiest source of electricity burned its final pieces of fuel.

The last coal shipment arrived in the islands at the end of July and the AES Corporation coal plant closed Thursday after 30 years in operation. The facility produced up to one-fifth of the electricity on Oahu — the most populous island in a state of nearly 1.5 million people.

""It really is about reducing greenhouse gases"" Hawaii Gov. David Ige said in an interview with The Associated Press. ""And this coal facility is one of the largest emitters. Taking it offline means that we'll stop the 1.5 million metric tons of greenhouse gases that were emitted annually.""

Like other Pacific islands the Hawaiian chain has suffered the cascading impacts of climate change. The state is experiencing the destruction of coral reefs from bleaching associated with increased ocean temperatures rapid sea level rise more intense storms and drought that is increasing the state's wildfire risk.

In 2020 Hawaii's Legislature passed a law banning the use of coal for energy production at the start of 2023. Hawaii has mandated a transition to 100% renewable energy by 2045 and was the first state to set such a goal.

But critics say that while ending the state's dirtiest source of energy is ultimately a good move doing so now is not. Renewable sources meant to replace coal energy are not yet on line because of permitting delays contract issues and pandemic-related supply-chain problems. So the state will instead burn more costly oil that is only slightly less polluting than coal.

""If you are a believer that climate change is going to end because we shut down this coal plant this is a great day for you"" said Democratic state Sen. Glenn Wakai chair of the Committee on Economic Development Tourism and Technology. ""But if you pay an electricity bill this is a disastrous day for you.""

The end of coal and the additional cost of oil will translate to an increase in electricity bills for consumers who already face the nation's highest energy and living costs. Hawaiian Electric Company had projected ratepayers would see a 7% spike in their bills but Thursday revised that to 4% because of a drop in oil prices.

""What we're doing ... is transitioning from the cheapest fossil fuel to the most expensive fossil fuel"" Wakai said. ""And we're going to be subjected to geopolitical issues on pricing for oil as well as access to oil. ""

The AES coal plant closure means Hawaii joins 10 other states with no major coal-fired power facilities according to data from Global Energy Monitor a nonprofit advocating for a global transition to clean energy. Rhode Island and Vermont never had any coal-fired power plants.

While Hawaii is the first state to fully implement a ban on coal a handful of others previously passed laws. The 2015 law in Oregon the first state to pass a ban isn't effective until 2035. Washington state's 2020 coal ban starts in 2025. California Maine and Texas are among states that have restricted construction of new coal-fired plants.

The number of coal-burning units in the United States peaked in 2001 at about 1100. More than half have stopped operating since then with most switching to more cost-effective natural gas.

U.S. Energy Information Administration data shows oil generated about two-thirds of Hawaii's electricity in 2021. That makes Hawaii the most petroleum-dependent state even as it tries to make a rapid transition to renewables.

Hawaii already gets about 40% of its power from sustainable sources including wind solar hydroelectric and geothermal.

State Sen. Kurt Fevella a Republican and the Senate Minority Leader suggested that Hawaiian Electric Company and other energy corporations should absorb the additional cost of shifting to renewables.

""The fact that Hawaii's families are already doing what is necessary to reduce their energy uses while still paying the most in the nation for household electricity is unsustainable"" said Fevella. ""While I believe utility companies like HECO can do more to reduce the energy burden passed on to Hawaii's ratepayers I also believe developers of renewal energy projects should also bear a greater portion of the transmission costs.""

Hawaiian Electric Company the primary distributor of electricity for the state said it can do little to change the prices to consumers.

""We're a regulated monopoly"" said Vice President of Government and Community Relations and Corporate Communications Jim Kelly. ""So we don't set the prices. We don't make any money on the fuels that we use to generate electricity.""

AES the operator of Hawaii's last coal plant has transitioned to creating clean energy and is working on large solar farms across the state including one in West Oahu that will replace some lost coal energy when completed next year.

""Renewables are getting cheaper by the day"" said Leonardo Moreno president of AES Corporation's clean energy division. ""I envision a future where energy is very very cheap abundant and renewable.""

Sustainable energy experts say getting rid of coal is critical in curbing climate change. While the current renewable landscape is not perfect they say technologies are improving.

""This is the decade of climate action that we really need to be moving on right now"" said Makena Coffman University of Hawaii professor and director for the Institute for Sustainability and Resilience. ""And so these are available technologies and they might get incrementally better but let's not wait 10 years to do it.""

Profits from the increased electricity costs to Hawaii consumers will go mostly to overseas oil producers said Hawaii's Chief Energy Officer Scott Glenn.

Hawaii's petroleum is distributed by Par Pacific a Houston-based company which has traditionally sourced the state's oil from Libya and Russia. But after the invasion of Ukraine Hawaii halted oil shipments from Russia and replaced it with products from Argentina.

Extending the coal plant's operation would be complicated and costly Glenn said noting that the plant has been planning decommissioning for years and would now have to buy coal at market price.

""Coal is going up. It's getting more expensive"" he said of the supply Hawaii gets from clearcut rainforests in Indonesia. ""If we were using U.S. coal it would not be the cheapest energy source on the grid.""

Why would Hawaii a small U.S. state in the middle of the Pacific try to lead the way in moving to sustainable energy?

""We are already feeling the effects of climate change'"" Glenn said. ""It's not fair or right to ask other nations or states to act on our behalf if we are not willing and able to do it ourselves. If we don't we drown.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the role of Yap1 and Taz (Wwtr1) in aging HSPCs we analyzed their expression in LK (Linneg Sca-1neg c-Kitpos) and LSK (Linneg Sca-1pos c-Kitpos) cells from young and old mice (for exemplary flow cytometry profiles see Supplementary Fig. 1). Wwtr1 mRNA as well as the Taz Protein were both strikingly induced in old LSK (oLSK) whereas Yap1 expression remained unchanged (Fig. 1a–c).

Fig. 1: TAZ (Wwtr1) is strongly induced in oLT-HSCs. a Representative flow cytometry plots of LK (Lineageneg Sca-1neg c-Kitpos) and LSK (Lineageneg Sca-1pos c-Kitpos) cells of young and old mice. b qRT-PCRs of Wwtr1 and Yap1 expression in LK and LSK isolated from young and old mice (n = 4 per age group one-way ANOVA with Tukey HSD post hoc test). c Immunoblot analysis of TAZ in LK and LSK of young and old mice. d Representative flow cytometry plots of LT-HSCs ST-HSCs and MPP in the LSK compartment of young and old mice. e Overview of the samples that were analyzed by RNA-Seq (n = 3 per group). f Principal component analysis of the RNA-Seq of the indicated populations (n = 3 per group). g Summary of gene expression changes (old vs. young) of Hippo pathway core components. h Volcano plot encompassing all transcriptional regulators (KEGG database) that were analyzed in the LT-HSC dataset old vs. young.

To analyze gene expression changes in the LSK compartment in greater detail we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) from long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs: LSK CD34neg CD135neg) short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs: LSK CD34pos CD135neg) and multipotent progenitors (MPPs: LSK CD34pos CD135pos) from young and old mice (Fig. 1d e). As expected the number of immunophenotypic LT-HSCs was strongly increased in old mice (Supplementary Fig. 2a).

ST-HSCs and MPPs showed a weaker age-dependent separation in principal component analyses whereas old LT-HSCs (oLT-HSCs) were more clearly separable from young LT-HSCs (yLT-HSCs) and showed the highest number of differentially expressed genes between old and young (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 2b). Although most Hippo core components showed only weak or no age-dependent changes Wwtr1 was strongly increased specifically in LT-HSCs and old human HSPCs (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 2c). Yap1 on the other hand was barely expressed in LT-HSCs demonstrating that Wwtr1 is the predominant transcriptional Hippo effector in these cells (Supplementary Fig. 2d).

Strikingly Wwtr1 was the most potently induced transcriptional regulator when comparing oLT-HSCs vs. yLT-HSCs (Fig. 1h).

To identify TAZ-dependent target genes in HSPCs we lentivirally overexpressed the constitutively active TAZ S89A point mutant in freshly isolated LSKs and subsequently performed RNA-Seq (Fig. 1i j). A TAZ-induced gene set consisting of 169 genes was then used to probe TAZ activity in HSCs (Fig. 1k and Supplementary Table 1). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) demonstrated that Taz-induced genes were upregulated in oLT-HSCs compared to oST-HSCs and in oLT-HSCs compared to yLT-HSCs (Fig. 1k). These results show that Taz is active in oLT-HSCs and contributes to aging-dependent gene expression changes.

Clca3a1 is induced by Taz and marks oLT-HSCs

To filter for TAZ-induced genes specific of oLT-HSCs we intersected the Taz overexpression RNA-Seq performed in LSKs with the previous RNA-Seq of young and old HSPCs (Fig. 2a). We obtained a relatively concise set of 24 genes that is also strongly induced in independent datasets (Supplementary Fig. 3a) which we refer to as aged LT-HSC-Taz signature (aLT-Taz signature). In the aLT-Taz signature Calcium-activated chloride channel regulator 1 (Clca3a1) coding an accessory protein for calcium-activated chloride channels demonstrated one of the most striking aging-dependent change in LT-HSCs (Fig. 2b). Clca3a1 expression just like the TAZ target gene Amotl2 strictly followed Wwtr1 expression in the different HSPC populations suggesting that CLCA3A1 may be used to trace TAZ activity in vivo (Fig. 2c). Remarkably Wwtr1 Amotl2 and Clca3a1 were all part of an aging HSC (aHSC) signature (Supplementary Table 1) generated by a meta-analysis of sixteen transcriptomic datasets of aged HSCs17 underlining the robustness of our results.

CLCA3A1 was barely detectable by flow cytometry in young LSK populations but specifically induced in old LT-HSCs (Fig. 2d e and Supplementary Fig. 1). CLCA3A1low HSCs purified from old animals were less quiescent than yHSCs. It took them significantly shorter to complete their first cell division in vitro18 (Fig. 2f) a typical phenotype of oHSCs19. CLCA3A1low cells demonstrated a significantly higher Ki67 positivity potentially because they showed a ~3x higher Cdk6 expression and thus were more Cdk6-dependent for cell division (Supplementary Fig. 3b–e).

RNA-Seq analysis of sorted CLCA3A1high and CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs (Fig. 2g) identified a high number of DEGs: 1169 upregulated (FDR < 0.01) and 1489 downregulated (FDR < 0.01) in CLCA3A1high vs CLCA3A1low.

Notably the aLT-Taz signature was significantly upregulated (p = 1.2e−7) in CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs (Fig. 2g) showing that CLCA3A1 is a proxy for TAZ activity.

To analyze the relative contribution of the aging-dependent increase in the frequency of CLCA3A1high cells to the overall transcriptome changes during HSCs aging we compared the CLCA3A1 RNA-Seq with the old vs. young LT-HSCs RNA-Seq (Fig. 2g). Strikingly the vast majority of genes that were upregulated in CLCA3A1high cells were also upregulated in old vs. young LT-HSCs not only in our data but also in an independent RNA-Seq study7 comparing old and young LT-HSCs (Supplementary Fig. 3f). The same was true for the downregulated genes. Thus the up- and downregulated genes in CLCA3A1high cells significantly overlap with the genes up- and downregulated in oLT-HSCs (Fig. 2h). When Clca3a1 is knocked out in yHSCs in vivo20 Clca3a1 seemed to be required to maintain the HSC pool suggesting that this TAZ-induced gene also has a function in young HSCs (Supplementary Fig. 4). However we focus here on the upstream coactivator Taz because it regulates a variety of different genes that can affect the ageing phenotype.

CLCA3A1high/TAZhigh HSCs mark a specific oHSC subpopulation

To investigate the heterogeneity of Taz-dependent transcription programs in HSPCs at the single-cell level independently of any surface marker we analyzed the transcriptome of young LSK (yLSK) and oLSK by Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-Seq)21. We labeled LSKs with antibody-derived tags (ADTs) for the SLAM marker panel CD150 and CD48 as well as CLCA3A1 to validate our findings with an independent set of HSC surface markers. Based on the activity of specific gene sets (Supplementary Table 1) we were able to identify individual cells with different activities for LT-HSCs ST-HSCs and MPPs (Fig. 2i).

Graph-based clustering identified six clusters (clusters 0–5) in the single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) dataset from young and old LSK cells (Fig. 2j). With the help of the SLAM ADTs and gene set activities22 we identified cluster 1 as a cluster enriched for LT-HSC (Fig. 2j–m and Supplementary Fig. 3g h). Since functional studies would be required to demonstrate their functionality as LT-HSCs we refer to this cluster as ‘HSC-like cluster’. It contained cells expressing high Taz on mRNA level (Fig. 2k) high CLCA3A1 on protein level (Fig. 2l) and showing high activity for a CLCA3A1high gene set (Fig. 2m). CLCA3A1high were much more abundant in the aged population (Fig. 2k l) within the HSC-like cluster’. Only very few scattered yLSKs demonstrated high CLCA3A1 protein level or a high Clca3a1 gene set activity (Fig. 2l m and Supplementary Fig. 3i) suggesting that CLCA3A1high cells also exist to a minor extent in young animals. TAZ activity just like CLCA3A1 activity was largely limited to the HSC-like cluster and was strongly induced in old cells within this cluster (Fig. 2n).

The CLCA3A1high gene set activity strongly correlated with the activity of two independent LT-HSC-specific gene sets (Fig. 2o) one based on our own RNA-Seq data and one previously published23.

In summary CLCA3A1high/TAZhigh HSCs represent a specific and highly abundant population within the oHSC compartment. They are characterized by high expression of genes that qualify them as LT-HSCs but are transcriptionally distinct from yHSCs.

Old CLCA3A1low HSCs show features of “young-like” HSCs

To test whether the surface marker CLCA3A1 is sufficient to isolate a pure fraction of oHSCs and “young-like” HSCs from old mice we compared our CLCA3A1high signature with the aHSC signature. Both signatures nearly perfectly correlated at the single-cell level indicating that CLCA3A1 is an excellent marker to isolate oHSCs (Fig. 3a b). Remarkably a substantial number of old cells with low CLCA3A1high gene set activity were present in the HSC-like cluster (Fig. 3c) suggesting that a CLCA3A1low immunophenotype marks individual “young-like” HSCs within the pool of oHSCs.

The activity of the aged HSC (aHSC) signature is colored based on the gene set activity. b Scatter plots of CLCA3A1high gene set activity plotted against the activity of an HSC aging signature from the CITE-Seq dataset (R = Pearson correlation coefficient linear regression t-test). c Violin plots of CLCA3A1high (left) and aHSC (right) gene set activity in clusters 0 and 1 from the CITE-Seq (two-sided Wilcox test). d Heatmap of Z-score normalized expression values for a gene set for myeloid-biased LT-HSCs (MyLT-HSCs) (n = 3 per group). e Representative flow cytometry plots for CD150 and CLCA3A1 of oHSCs.

Data in f g are presented as mean values +/− SEM. Source data are provided as a Source data file. Full size image

In accordance with the aged phenotype of CLCA3A1high HSCs CLCA3A1 induction also correlated with a gene expression profile of myeloid-biased LT-HSCs (MyLT-HSCs)24 at the single-cell level (Supplementary Fig. 5a) and in the bulk RNA-Seq dataset (Fig. 3d). Consistently Clca3a1 expression clearly correlated with the expression of CD150 a marker of MyLT-HSC in flow cytometry analyses (Fig. 3e).

Given the fundamental differences between CLCA3A1low and CLCA3A1high HSCs at multiple levels we next tested whether these two cell populations also differ functionally. To this end we analyzed their long-term repopulating capacity and their long-term multilineage reconstitution potential in competitive repopulation assays. Two expected hallmarks of oLT-HSCs in this assay are functional decline in long-term repopulation and myeloid skewing of peripheral blood (PB) cells. We transplanted CD45.2-expressing CLCA3A1high or CLCA3A1ow LT-HSCs together with CD45.1/2 competitor cells into lethally irradiated CD45.1 (Ly5.1) recipient mice. PB chimerism was investigated monthly over a period of 4 months. One month post-transplantation chimerism in the blood of CLCA3A1high recipients was comparable to those who received CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs (Fig. 3f). Over time however recipients of CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs showed a gradual decline of donor contribution to the PB (Fig. 3f g) demonstrating a defect in long-term repopulating activity of the CLCA3A1high population. The frequency of CLCA3A1low-derived leukocytes in contrast remained stable compared to the young and age-matched competitor cells (Fig. 3f). In addition CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs produced significantly more myeloid cells in the PB and fewer B and T cells (Fig. 3g). Four months after transplantation spleen and bone marrow (BM) chimerism appeared strongly decreased in recipients receiving CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs (Supplementary Fig. 5b c). Within the donor-derived compartment Clca3a1high- and CLCA3A1low-derived cells generated a similar frequency of myeloid progenitors but the CLCA3A1low samples showed a higher frequency of common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs)—a typical characteristic of yHSCs3 (Supplementary Fig. 5d). Irrespective of the donor status (CLCA3A1high or CLCA3A1low) CLCA3A1 expression was lost in the BM 4 months after transplantation and the two different cell populations showed similar behavior in secondary transplantations.

Old HSCs induce Taz to keep a minimal regenerative potential

Next we tested whether Taz actively contributes to the functional decline of CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs or whether it gets induced to counteract defects in CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs. Intriguingly Clusterin (gene name Clu) was potently induced in CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Previous studies showed that Clu expression is YAP1-dependent and is induced in stressed cells to trigger a regenerative response25. To test whether TAZ has a similar function in oHSCs we depleted TAZ in CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs using two potent shRNAs (shTAZ#1 and shTAZ#2) shTAZ#2 being more potent than shTAZ#1 and a control shRNA (shRen) targeting Renilla (Fig. 4a). We isolated CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs infected them ex vivo with lentiviral shRNA constructs and transplanted these cells into lethally irradiated recipients. Transplanted CLCA3A1high populations contained ~60–80% infected (GFP-positive) and ~20–40% uninfected (GFP-negative) cells in order to use the GFP-negative fraction as a competitor against the GFP-positive fraction from the same donor and follow the frequency of GFP-positive cells within the CD45.2 donor fraction over time (Supplementary Fig. 6b). In the PB shTAZ-transduced donor cells rapidly lost the GFP signal demonstrating that uninfected cells outcompeted TAZ-depleted cells whereas shRen cells maintained a stable frequency of GFP-positive cells (Fig. 4b).

The experiment was independently repeated three times. b PB analysis after transplantation of CLCA3A1high HSCs transduced with the indicated shRNAs.

TAZ-depleted HSCs showed a tendency to produce increased numbers of myeloid cells and decreased numbers of B and T cells (Supplementary Fig. 6c). The effects appeared subtler when compared to those observed for competitive repopulation although both Taz shRNAs showed similar trends. The inferior fitness of shTAZ progeny was also reflected in the BM where TAZ depletion led to a significantly reduced GFPpos fraction in lineage-negative (Linneg) precursor cells (Fig. 4c). The percentage of CD34neg LSK cells in the GFP-positive compartment however remained largely unchanged (Supplementary Fig. 6d) indicating that HSCs were not lost due to Taz depletion. The RNA-Seq analysis of donor-derived LSK CD34neg cells 4 months after transplantation revealed that TAZ-depleted cells were transcriptionally distinct from shRen cells (Fig. 4d e) and that TAZ depletion led to a downregulation of the top 200 genes that were induced in old LT-HSCs (Fig. 4f). These transcriptional profiling analyses in conjunction with our transplantation studies of TAZ-depleted HSCs demonstrate that TAZ sustains a transcriptional program that protects aged HSCs from functional decline.

Clca3a1low HSCs resemble yHSCs at the chromatin level

Given the fundamental changes that occur at the epigenomic level in oHSCs7 we analyzed the chromatin changes in CLCA3A1high and CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs. To this end we profiled the global chromatin accessibility of these cells as well as yHSCs and oHSCs by FAST-ATAC-Seq (Fig. 5a b)26.

Fig. 5: CLCA3A1low HSCs resemble yHSCs on chromatin level. a Heatmaps for FAST-ATAC data of CLCA3A1high CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs oHSCs and yHSCs (n = 3 for CLCA3A1low CLCA3A1high and HSC old; n = 6 for HSC young).

We identified 43031 peaks that were shared between all four samples (Fig. 5b). Strikingly CLCA3A1high HSCs and oHSCs demonstrated many additional peaks of these 22023 were shared between these two samples. The functional GO term analysis of those additional peaks demonstrated a clear enrichment for pathways involved in direct or indirect regulation of TAZ e.g. Hippo and Wnt signaling pathways (Fig. 5c)27. Also the Wwtr1 locus itself showed changes in chromatin accessibility specifically in candidate enhancer regions which are hypomethylated in oHSCs7 (Supplementary Fig. 7). Differential peak analysis of CLCA3A1high vs. CLCA3A1low HSCs corroborated the trend toward more peaks in CLCA3A1high HSCs (Fig. 5d–f). Increased accessibility also led to greater expression of the associated genes at the mRNA level (Fig. 5e f) which shows that chromatin changes can impact on gene expression.

To identify changes in TF accessibility indicative of altered TF activity which could explain the functional differences we performed a chromVAR analysis28. In accordance with our transcriptomic profiling of CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs and yLT-HSCs CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs clustered together with yLT-HSCs whereas CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs clustered with oLT-HSCs (Fig. 5g h). Furthermore the accessibility of the TEAD motifs was much higher in CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs than in yLT-HSCs indicating that TEAD/TAZ is more active in these cells (Fig. 5i).

Collectively our data demonstrate that old CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs have lower TEAD/TAZ activity than CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs and resemble yLT-HSCs at the transcriptional chromatin and functional level.

Low PU.1 expression is associated with aging phenotypes

To understand chromatin accessibility changes in aging HSCs at the single-cell level we performed single-cell ATAC-Seq (scATAC-Seq) of young and old LT HSCs and of CLCA3A1high and CLCA3A1low LT HSCs (Fig. 6a d). Analysis of differentially accessible TF motifs showed a striking correlation when comparing changes in old vs. young and CLCA3A1high vs. CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs (Fig. 6g). Here DNA sequences bound by ETS transcription factors (SPI1 and SPIC) were identified as the most differentially accessible sites in both comparisons as well in our bulk ATAC-Seq data (Fig. 6g and Supplementary Fig. 8a b). While the accessibility of Spi1 motifs progressively decreased from young to old and from CLCA3A1low to CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs the accessibility of a Tead motif showed an opposite behavior when we analyzed the behavior of these motifs in pseudotime analyses (Fig. 6h i). oLT-HSCs are thus a heterogeneous pool of cells where opposed activities of PU.1 and TEAD/TAZ define functionally distinct populations which can be separated based on CLCA3A1. Remarkably Spi1 encodes the transcription factor PU.1 a key regulator of HSC function29 suggesting that the activity of this critical regulator is decreased during HSC aging. Consistently Spi1 expression demonstrated a sharp drop specifically in the HSC-like cluster 1 but not the adjacent cluster 0 in our scRNA-Seq data (Fig. 6j). To investigate whether decreased Spi1 expression in CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs also affects PU.1 target gene expression we generated PU.1-dependent gene sets from hematopoietic progenitor cells. For that we depleted PU.1 in the HSC-like cell line BM-HPC#530 using two potent shRNAs and performed RNA-Seq (Fig. 6k l). We identified 667 genes which were downregulated (log2FC < (−1) padj<0.05: shPU1.down) and 899 genes that were upregulated (log2FC > 1 padj < 0.05: shPU1.up) upon PU.1 depletion (Fig. 6l). Consistent with low PU.1 expression in CLCA3A1high HSCs HSC-like cluster 1 contained significantly more cells with high shPU1.up AUC from old vs young a trend which could not be observed in the adjacent cluster 0 (Fig. 6m). Furthermore the shPU1.up gene set was significantly upregulated when comparing CLCA3A1high vs. CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs while the shPU1.down gene set showed opposite regulation (Fig. 6n). We noticed that many genes encoding surface markers commonly used to isolate HSCs (Cd34 Flt3 (CD135) Cd48 Procr (EPCR)) were affected by PU.1 depletion in BM-HPC#5 and were also downregulated in CLCA3A1high vs. CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs (Fig. 6l o). Low Spi1 expression in oHSCs could hence explain the increased frequency of immunophenotypic HSCs commonly observed in aged individuals. We confirmed this by flow cytometry comparing young and old LSK since the frequency of immunophenotypic LT-HSCs in old Clca3a1low LSK resembled that of yLSK cells (Fig. 6p q).

These data demonstrate that HSC aging is associated with a gradual depletion of PU.1 which correlates with specific features of oHSCs at the transcriptional and immunophenotypic level.

Decreased Spi1 expression in yHSC drives features of aging

To test whether decreased PU.1 levels in yHSCs is sufficient to induce an “old-like” HSC phenotype we depleted PU.1 in yHSCs from 14- to 17-week-old by two independent shRNAs. We analyzed the PB and BM only 2 months after transplantation as PU.1-deficient HSCs are lost shortly after transplantation31. PU.1-depleted HSCs rapidly lost their ability to contribute to the production of PB cells but had mostly weaker effects on other parameters in BM and PB (Supplementary Fig. 9a–d). Due to the critical role of PU.1 in progenitors downstream of the HSC compartment we consequently focused on PU.1’s role in HSCs. Therefore we performed scRNA-Seq of the LSK compartment from control- (shRen) and PU.1-depleted (shPU1 #1 and shPU1 #2) HSPCs 2 months after transplantation (Fig. 7a–d Supplementary Fig. 9e). Graph-based clustering revealed seven clusters (Fig. 7a). We used a previously defined stringent HSC vs. MPP1 gene set23 (LT-HSC #2 Fig. 2i) to identify “HSC-like cells” in our scRNA-Seq data. In this way we identified two populations consisting mainly of HSC-like cells (Fig. 7b). One population located in clusters 2 and 5 contained almost exclusively PU.1-depleted HSC-like cells while shRen HSC-like cells were mainly found in cluster 0 (Fig. 7c d). Just as in BM-HPC#5 cells PU.1 depletion in young HSC-like cells resulted in drastic gene expression changes with Cd34 as well as Flt3 being potently downregulated (Fig. 7e). Consistent with the previously described role of PU.1 in maintaining HSC quiescence genes induced after PU.1 depletion in HSC-like cells showed highly significant enrichment for E2F-dependent target genes (Supplementary Fig. 9f g). Noteworthy Taz mRNA was undetectable in the scRNA-Seq dataset suggesting that PU.1 depletion alone does not lead to Taz induction. The shPU1.up gene set showed high activity exclusively in clusters 2 and 5 which contained shPU1 HSC-like cells (Fig. 7f). Strikingly PU.1 depletion alone was sufficient to induce an “aged-like” transcriptome in young HSC-like cells without inducing a myeloid-biased LT-HSC gene expression program (Fig. 7g h) suggesting that decreased PU.1 expression in oHSCs does not contribute to this phenotype or that it takes longer to establish. However the aHSC gene set showed high activity specifically in PU.1-depleted HSC-like cells with low PU.1 activity—equivalent to high sh.PU1.up activity (Fig. 7i).

Given the partially overlapping phenotype that depletion of TAZ and PU.1 had on the regenerative potential of HSCs and their opposite activities in our scATAC analyses we hypothesized that Taz is induced during aging to compensate for the decreased PU.1 expression in oHSCs—possibly because TAZ can act as a coactivator for PU.1. Consistent with this hypothesis PU.1 and TAZ depletion showed a convergent transcriptional response upon depletion (Fig. 7j). Moreover PU.1 and TAZ physically interacted in GST pulldown assays and TAZ was able to act as a potent PU.1 coactivator in transient luciferase reporter assays in a strictly PU.1-dependent manner (Fig. 7k l). Since we were not able to obtain high-quality genomic binding data for PU.1 or TAZ from freshly sorted HSCs we performed Cut&Run for PU.1 in BM-HPC#5 cells to identify genes that are directly regulated by PU.1. The 3163 PU.1 Cut&Run peaks were highly enriched for ETS-motifs and were almost exclusively located in promoter regions (Fig. 7m–p). To identify direct PU.1 target genes that are induced in a TAZ-dependent manner we intersected the PU.1 peaks with the genes that are significantly downregulated in transplanted old CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs (Fig. 4e) upon TAZ depletion (Fig. 7q). We identified here 60 genes that were potently downregulated (with a median log2 fold change of −4.8) upon TAZ depletion (Supplementary Table 1). Here the two gene ontology terms centrosome and microtubule organization which play a critical role in mitosis and symmetric vs. asymmetric cell division were highly enriched in these 60 genes (Fig. 7r). Thus our data show that age-dependent loss of PU.1 activity in HSCs is sufficient to induce aging phenotypes and that Taz can counteract them at least in part by acting as a PU.1 coactivator for specific genes (Fig. 7s t).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNDY3LTAyMi0zMjkyMS130gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Expanding the terpene biosynthetic code with non-canonical 16 carbon atom building blocks,"Chemicals and enzymes

Gene cloning and expression in yeast

All primers used for cloning purposes are listed in the Supplementary Table 2. Yeast codon optimized versions of S. plymuthica sodorifen methyltransferase (SpSodMT) (GenBank WP_004943917.1) A. grandis γ-humulene synthase (AbHumS; GenBank U92267) K. griseola terpentetriene synthase (Cyc2; GenBank AB048795.1) and H. aurantiacus kolavelool synthase (HaKS GenBank ABX04786) were obtained by gene synthesis bearing flanking regions containing specific restriction sites and a generic sequence compatible for USER cloning. Using the generic primes USER-Gen-FP and USER-Gen-RP the above genes were amplified and cloned by USER cloning into a generic backbone introducing BamHI and EcoRI sites at the 5’ end and NotI BglII and XhoI sites at the 3’ end. The constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Subsequently the genes of interest were excised from the generic USER vector by BamHI and XhoI digestion and ligated into pESC vector (Agilent Technologies Cat. #217453) of different selection (TRP for SpSodMT HIS for TPSs) linearized with BamHI and XhoI restriction enzymes. This approach enabled subcloning of the genes of interest under P GAL1 promoter and resulted into construction of the following plasmids: pESC-TRP/SpSodMT pESC-HIS/AbHumS pESC-HIS/CYC2 and pESC-HIS/HaKS. Genes encoding the different other TPSs involved in this study (full list available in Supplementary Table 5) were available from previous work as compatible parts for subcloning in pESC-HIS linearized with BamHI and XhoI21313233.

pESC-Leu/CPR2 vector carrying the cDNA encoding a cytochrome P450 reductase from poplar (CPR2)39 was previously modified46 to enable standardized CYPs cloning under the P GAL10 promoter into the EcoRI and NotI restriction sites. Yeast codon optimized versions of CYP71AV1 (GenBank DQ318192) CYP706M1 (GenBank JX518290) and CYP76AK1 (GenBank KR140169) were obtained by gene synthesis carrying flanking regions containing EcoRI and NotI restriction sites. The rest of CYPs (full list available in Supplementary Table 5) were available from previous work144647. All CYPs involved in this study were digested with EcoRI and NotI and subcloned in pESC-Leu/CPR2 linearized with the same restriction enzymes to obtain bifunctional constructs for simultaneous expression of one CYP and CPR2.

For protein expression in E. coli a bacterial codon optimized version of SpSodMT was obtained and cloned into pRSETa (Invitrogen) applying the USER technology described above to generate the corresponding bacterial expression construct pRSETa/SpSodMT. Selective mutations were introduced by USER mutagenesis48.

Strain AM109

In S. cerevisiae heterozygous deletions lead to 50% decrease in the level of the corresponding protein in the majority of yeast genes tested49. Strain AM109 (Mat a/α P GAL1 -HMG2(K6R)::HOx2 ura3 trp1 his3 P TDH3 -HMG2(K6R)x2-::leu2 ERG9/erg9 UBC7/ubc7 SSM4/ssm4 PHO86/pho86) the basis strain used in this study is a diploid strain that contains a heterozygous deletion in the squalene synthase gene ERG9 which is essential for sterol biosynthesis. This deletion helps reduce the drain of FPP substrate and boost the heterologous production of C 16 terpenoids21.

Small-scale C 16 production and quantification in yeast

Selected S. cerevisiae strains were cultivated in 10 mL CM liquid media. Liquid-liquid extraction of 1 mL culture using hexane was applied for measuring the C 16 compounds produced in yeast cells after 48 h of culturing followed by GC-MS and GC-qTOF analysis (see details in the corresponding section below). For quantification 0.01% isopropyl myristate was used as internal standard. Samples were analyzed in triplicates and the error calculated as the mean absolute deviation (MAD) around the mean. Purified C 16 compounds obtained from yeast were used as standards when available to quantify the titer of specific compounds. Titers of compounds 1d and 2d were calculated using the corresponding standards while the average signal peak area of 1d and 2d standards was calculated and used for quantification of the titers of compounds 3d and 4d. Titers of compounds 1b-5b and 7b-10b were calculated using their corresponding standards. Titer of compounds 13OH-1b and 9OH-3b produced by PtAO were calculated based on the purified 13OH-1b and 9OH-3b standards respectively. The average signal of 13OH-1b and 9OH-3b was used for quantification of compounds 11-15. Titers of total C 16 products were calculated using the average of standards corresponding to the most representative products in the profile of each individual mutants.

Shake flask large scale cultivation

For the extraction of C 16 olefins 1% (w/v) Diaion HP20 (Supelco Bellefonte PA) was used as adsorbent resin. The HP20 beads were activated by ethanol and washed by Milli-Q water before use. A two liter culture of yeast cells in Gal/Raff-CM medium together with 2 g HP20 beads were incubated in shake-flasks at 30 °C for 3 days. The medium and beads were subsequently extracted with hexane (3 × 1 L) at room temperature. The resulting hexane phase was evaporated to dryness by rotary evaporator.

Fed-batch fermentation

Seed cultures were prepared by inoculating 5 mL of overnight cell culture into 500 mL selective CM glucose media and cultivated at 30 °C and 150 rpm. After 6 h of growth the seed cultures were washed 3 times with water and added to a 5 L bioreactor (Sartorius benchtop bioreactor with BIOSTAT B Plus controller) containing two liter of CM galactose/raffinose media. Fermentation was carried out at 30 °C with the pH maintained at 4.2 by automatic addition of 4 M NaOH. Airflow was maintained at 1 L/min for the first 24 h increased to 2 L/min from 24 h to 48 h and finally set to 10 L/min after 48 h for the remainder of the fermentation. The dissolved oxygen concentration was controlled at above 20% saturation by agitation cascade between 100-500 rpm. 200 mL of 15× concentrated media (30% galactose 15% raffinose 10% YNB 2% dropout mix) was manually fed into the culture at 48 h with subsequent daily feedings of 400 mL 15× media. Fermentations were terminated after 7–9 days and the cultures extracted.

Briefly bacterial cells carrying the corresponding plasmids were grown at 23 °C until OD 600 reached 0.5–0.7 then induced with 0.1 mM isopropylthio-β-galactoside (IPTG) after which cell growth was continued for 20 h at 19 °C. The His-tagged proteins were then purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography and eluted with 60 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) 0.5 M NaCl 250 mM imidazole and 8% glycerol. The enzymatic activity of SpSodMT was assayed in 0.2 mL reaction containing 10 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0) 20 mM MgCl 2  0.2 mM MnCl 2  10 mM DTT and using as co-substrates 120 µM SAM and 70 µM of GPP FPP or GGPP. The reactions were incubated for 18 h at 30 °C and terminated by addition of 0.2 mL 2 N HCl in 83% ethanol and 0.2 mL hexane. Acid hydrolysis of the diphosphates was carried for 20 min at 37 °C and the reactions were neutralized with 10% (w/v) NaOH and analyzed by GC-MS. All enzymatic assays were carried out in triplicates.

In vitro assays using yeast-expressed SpSodMT variants

S. cerevisiae strains containing plasmids for expression of SpSodMT wild-type and mutants in combination with empty vector or terpene synthases Cyc2 or HaKS were cultivated in 50 mL of liquid media to a OD 600 of 1. Cells were harvested by centrifugation washed once with water and resuspended in 2 mL Eppendorf tubes using 500 µL of 50 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0) containing protease inhibitor (cOmplete™ Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Sigma-Aldrich 11697498001). 500 µL glass beads (G8772; Sigma-Aldrich) were added to each tube and the cells broken by alternating 1 min of vortexing and 1 min of cooling on ice for a total of 10 cycles. The broken cells centrifuged 21000 xg for 5 min and the clarified lysate used as enzyme source. The enzymatic activity was assayed in 250 µL reactions containing 95 µL yeast lysate 4 mM SAM 100 µM FPP 30 mM DTT 20 mM MgCl 2  0.5 mM MnCl 2  10% (w/v) glycerol and 50 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0). The reactions were incubated for 3 h at 30 °C and terminated by addition of 250 µL 2 N HCl in 83% ethanol and 125 µL hexane. Acid hydrolysis of the diphosphates was carried for 20 min at 37 °C and the reactions were neutralized with 10% (w/v) NaOH and the hexane analyzed by GC-MS analysis method 1 as specified below under subheading “GC analysis conditions”.

Yeast growth assay

The engineered yeast strains were grown in glucose-based media until OD 600 ~0.5–0.7 washed twice with sterile water and resuspended in galactose/raffinose-based media for induction of protein expression. The obtained cultures were diluted to OD 600 ~0.1 (time 0) in a final volume of 25 mL and were incubated at 30 °C with 150 rpm shaking. Measurements of OD 600 were taken every 2 h to monitor the curve of yeast growth (Supplementary Fig. 3). For OD 600 values higher than 1 samples were diluted accordingly.

Analysis of yeast sterols and squalene

A volume of 4 mL yeast cultures induced to express SpSodMT (or containing the empty pESC-TRP vector) was used to collect yeast cells. The obtained pellet was treated with butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) in a ratio of 2:1 (v/w) resuspended in 500 µL 10% KOH in 80% EtOH solution and incubated at 70 °C for 2 h. Samples were cooled at room temperature and overlaid with 300 µL of hexane followed by vigorous vortexing prior to collecting the hexane phase. The extraction was repeated three times and the collected hexane phase (~0.9 mL) was initially washed with water (equal volume) three times and then evaporated down to 100 µL and derivatized with 50 µL trimethylsilyl cyanide (Sigma Cat. #212849) for 30 min at 60 °C prior to GC-MS analysis46.

GC analysis conditions

GC-MS analysis method 1 was performed on a Shimadzu GC-2010 system equipped with a GCMS-QP2010 Plus mass spectrometer and was carried on a HP-5ms UI column (30 m x 0.25 mm ID x 0.25 µm film thickness) using helium as a carrier gas with a linear velocity of 30 cm/sec and the following temperature program: initial temperature 60 °C ramp to 300 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min hold for 3.5 min. This method was used for analysis of samples resulting from: incubation of the SPME fiber for 30 min over the head-space of 2-10 mL yeast cultures 2 μL of the hexane phase overlaying the E. coli enzyme sourced purified in vitro enzymatic reactions and 1 µL injections of hexane from the hexane extractions of non-saponifiable lipid and acid hydrolyzed in vitro enzymatic reactions using S. cerevisiae expressed SpSodMT wild-type and mutants.

GC-MS analysis method 2 was performed on a Shimadzu Nexis GC-2030 system equipped with a GCMS-QP2020 NX mass spectrometer and an HP-5ms column (30 m x 0.25 mm ID x 0.25 µm film thickness). He carrier gas was helium with a linear velocity of 30 cm/sec and the following temperature program was used: initial temperature 60 °C ramp to 170 °C at 10 °C/min ramp to 210 at 2 °C/min ramp to 300 °C at 20 °C/min hold for 5 min. This method was used for analysis of samples resulting from hexane extractions of S. cerevisiae grown in buffered media expressing SpSodMT together with Cyc2 or HaKS and SPME fiber sampling of the head-space of in vitro enzymatic reactions using S. cerevisiae expressed SpSodMT together with Cyc2 or HaKS.

GC-APCI-QqToF experiments were performed on a Scion 456 GC system (Bruker Daltonics) with a micrOTOF-Q II (QqToF) mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) using an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source (APCI). Samples (1 µL) were injected at 250 °C in splitless mode using a BR-5ms capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm ID x 0.25 µm film thickness; Bruker Daltonics). The carrier gas was helium with a constant flow of 1.0 mL min−1. The temperature program was: 50 °C for 1 min ramp to 280 °C at 15 °C min−1 and hold for 3.67 min. The transfer line was maintained at 280 °C and the temperature of the APCI source was 280 °C and of the APCI heater 200 °C. The charging voltage was 2000 V. The mass spectrometer was operated in full scan positive ion mode with the following settings: m/z 80 − 310: nebulizer gas (nitrogen) 3.5 bar; drying gas (nitrogen) 2.5 L min−1; drying gas temperature 240 °C; capillary voltage 3000 V; spectra acquisition rate 5 Hz. Calibration for accurate mass was performed at the beginning of each chromatographic run using perfluorotributylamine vapour (PFTBA; Sigma Aldrich). Data acquisition was performed using Compass CDS (Version 3.0.1; Bruker Daltonics) Compass oTOF Control (Version 3.4 Bruker Daltonics) and Hystar (Version 3.2 SR4 Bruker Daltonics). Data analysis was performed using Compass DataAnalysis software (Version 4.3 Bruker Daltonics).

GC-MS-olfactometry

Samples containing 100–300 μg of each of the isolated compounds were directly injected on Tenax-TA traps (200 mg of Tenax-TA mesh size 60/80 Markes International Llantrisant UK). The trapped volatiles were thermally desorbed (TurboMatrix 300 Perkin Elmer Shelton USA) using a two-step procedure: Primary desorption was at 250 °C with a 50 mL min−1 flow of carrier gas for 15.0 min. The stripped volatiles were trapped in a Tenax-TA cold trap (30 mg held at 5 °C) which was subsequently heated at 300 °C for 4 min (secondary desorption outlet split 1:10). This allowed for rapid transfer of volatiles to a GC-MS (6890 N GC interfaced with a 5973 MSD from Agilent Technologies Palo Alto California) through a heated (225 °C) transfer line. Separation of volatiles was carried out on a ZB-Wax capillary column 30 m long x 0.25 mm internal diameter 0.50 µm film thickness. The column pressure was held constant at 2.3 psi resulting in an initial flow rate of 1.4 mL min−1 using hydrogen as carrier gas. The column temperature program was: 10 min at 30 °C from 30 °C to 240 °C at 8 °C min−1 and finally 5 min at 240 °C. The effluent of the column was split in a ratio of 1:2:2 between the mass spectrometer (electron ionisation mode at 70 eV scanning m/z ratios between 15 and 300) and two olfactory detector ports (ODP-2 Gerstel Mülheim an der Ruhr). Agilent Chemstation (E.02.02.1431) was used for data acquisition and data analysis.

Construction of the SpSodMT structural model

The structural model of SpSodMT was constructed using the SWISS-MODEL server51 and 5kok29 as template scoring a GMQE of 0.52 and a QMEAN of −2.70 and covering amino acids 31-325. S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) was imported into the model from 5kok and FPP was chosen as a ligand from the ZINC database (ID: ZINC12494625). Using the SwissDock program FPP was not found to dock next to SAH in the expected pocket. VegaZZ AMMP edition was used to optimize SpSodMT model by selecting the Conjugate Gradient (CG) algorithm for energy optimization and the CHARMM force field for fast docking. A total of 645 steps were run. The docking results using the optimized SpSodMT model demonstrated that FPP was placed next to SAH as expected. To obtain a more accurate model the optimization process was repeated following conversion of SAH into S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). The final model displayed a deeper cavity for FPP than the initial model and 4 Å distance from SAM to FPP as expected for a methyl transfer5253. Subsequently a refined SpSodMT model was obtained using Molecular mechanics (MM2) algorithm54. The energy optimization was performed with the software Chem3D (v. 16.0) from CSC Cambridge (USA). Residues F56 Q57 F58 G187 I189 S190 N219 V273 W276 L302 and W306 were identified within 5 Å of the isoprene unit tail and were selected as potential mutagenesis targets for modifying product specificity.

Water depths in the HMB range from 20 m in the north to 110 m in the south. This study used marine sediment from the deep-drilled cores HMB-103 (34°43.50'N 125°37.51'E; water depth of 48 m) and HMB-102 (34°7.96’N 125°40.94’E water depth: 57 m). The HMB is characterised by high sedimentation rates (approximately 0.2 cm/yr) allowing for the reconstruction of the SST record at a high resolution. To investigate changes of monthly mean SST at the study area in situ SST data from Chilbaldo buoy station (dataset from the Korea Meteorological Administration KMA) for the period 1998–2018 was examined (Fig. 1b)24. The lowest SST (5.4 °C) occurs in February whereas the highest (22.4 °C) occurs in August. The annual mean SST is 13.7 °C.

SST at the study area is strongly influenced by the seasonality of two atmospheric circulation systems: the mid-latitude Westerly Jet (WJ) and the East Asian monsoon. During winter the main route of the WJ lies in the south of the Himalayas (< 30°N)2526 and the dry and cold terrestrial air mass anchored in Siberia expands southward27. Conversely during summer the WJ moves to the north of the Tibetan Plateau (> 42°N). The wet and warm subtropical air mass from the Northwest Pacific overarches the East Asian marginal sea areas. Change in atmospheric heat flux associated with seasonality of the two-circulation system is the primary cause of SST variations in this shallow area28. The extended winter regime with both dry and cold air and stronger wind speed accompanied by the southward shift of the WJ can maintain the vertical contrast between the local ocean and the atmosphere and cause excessive heat loss to the atmosphere thereby decreased the SST272930. In the meantime the persisting summer regime associated with the northward migration of Westerly Jet would reduce the heat loss to the atmosphere thereby increases the SST.

Radiocarbon dating of ten samples from cores HMB-102 (six samples) and -103 (four samples) has been previously measured using benthic foraminifera and bivalve shell in Holocene muddy sediments31. The age-depth model for each core was constructed using the Bacon 2.5 package in R32 with the Marine20 radiocarbon calibration curve and the ΔR value of 284 ± 39 years (Fig. 2). The Bacon method simulates the accumulation rates of core sediments based on Bayesian statistics and calculates the ages and uncertainties (1σ) of sediment deposits. Core HMB-103 covers the last 6.5 cal kyr B.P.; while core HMB-102 covers the period between 6.9 and 10 cal kyr B.P.. The results of the 210Pb dating of the HMB-103 and other core-top sediments collected near the HMB-103 were examined. The 210Pb and 226Ra activities were measured at the Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI). The observed excess 210Pb activities in the box cores indicate that the core-top surface sediments near the HMB-103 are modern-day sediments which is in line with previous findings33. However the 210Pb dating of HMB-103 indicates that the upper most sediment appears to be at least 111 years older than the sampling year of 2013 (see “Method”). According to the age model the core HMB-103 and -102 have a high sedimentation rate (approximately 0.2 cm/yr) which allows for the SST reconstruction at a high resolution (approximately 10–20 years) for the Holocene.

A new high-resolution alkenone SST composite covering the Holocene was constructed by combining records from cores HMB-103 and -102. For the SST reconstruction of HMB-103 newly analysed alkenone data (269 samples) were added to the previously published temperature data (80 samples)24 hence a total of 349 samples were used in this study. For the HMB-102 188 new samples were added to the previous 41 samples24. Since we collected sediment samples at 3 cm interval there could be bioturbation effects. In this case the temperature signal would be smoothed and/or reduced by mixing of the sediments. The error range of the alkenone temperature assessment for replicate samples of the two kinds of homogeneous laboratory-standard marine sediments exhibited less than ± 0.05 °C (n = 90) and ± 0.07 °C (n = 7) at 95% confidence level respectively. The alkenone SST estimates obtained from the 31 core-top sediments collected near HMB-103 were compared with in situ temperatures24. The results indicated that the alkenone unsaturation index effectively represented the averaged SST from April to October in this area (Fig. 1b).

Figure 3ab shows the resulting high-resolution SST record reconstructed from alkenone analysis of the HMB-102 and -103 cores. The 10-year interpolated alkenone SSTs are listed in Supplementary Table S1. The essential observed characteristic was the periodic SST fluctuations on a multidecadal- to millennial-scale. Although the amplitude of variations often range within ± 1 °C (Fig. 3a) these periodic fluctuations were distinct considering the error range of SST reconstructions from homogeneous marine sediment (< ± 0.1 °C). SSTs were relatively warm during the early Holocene (8–10 cal kyr B.P.) then cooled during the period of 6.5–8 cal kyr B.P. then warm again between 5 and 6.5 cal kyr B.P. (Fig. 3a). There were several distinct and rapid cooling events with a large amplitude up to 3 °C during the period of 7–9 cal kyr B.P. (Fig. 3a). In a previous study on the reconstruction of low-resolution (~ 50 years) alkenone SSTs from cores HMB-102 and -103 Bae et al.24 demonstrated that the cold period dropped by 2 °C for the period of 3–5 cal kyr B.P. was a regional pattern in the mid-latitudes of East Asia via comparison with other regional temperature records. Two cooling periods (3–5 cal kyr B.P. and ~ 7–8 cal kyr B.P.) were possibly associated with millennial variations. To remove the cooling patterns on a millennial scale and investigate centennial variations we extracted 50–2000 years periodicities from the raw dataset by applying a band-pass filter (Fig. 3b). The spectral analysis of band-pass filtered SSTs revealed significant (> 90% confidence level) periodicities of 544 414 190 135 102 and 89 years (Fig. 4a). In addition 1034-year cycle variability seems to exist (Fig. 4a). We also conducted wavelet analysis on the Holocene alkenone SSTs (Fig. 5a). The cycles of 544 414 190 135 102 89 and 78 years were significant for the interval of 7–9 cal kyr B.P. (Fig. 5a). Another characteristic of the wavelet analysis results is that 1034-year cycles predominated during the early to mid- Holocene (Fig. 5a). The periodic centennial-scale fluctuations of alkenone SSTs with the periodicities of 190 135 102 and 89 years have been strengthened after 2 cal kyr B.P. (Fig. 5a). Overall the composite SST record indicated the occurrence of centennial-scale variability over the last 10000 years.

We used the Holocene total solar irradiance (TSI) data obtained by Steinhilber et al.19 (Fig. 3c) for comparison with our composite SST record. TSI data have been reconstructed based on the principal component analysis of production rates of 14C in tree ring and 10Be obtained from ice cores collected in Greenland and Antarctica. Variations in TSI during the Holocene exhibit periodic fluctuations on multidecadal to millennial scales although the magnitudes were less than 1 W/m2 (Fig. 3c). The spectral analysis on band-pass filtered (50–2000 years) TSI data revealed that the periodicities of 353 206 150 130 104 and 87 years were significant (> 90% confidence level) (Fig. 4a). The wavelet analysis of the TSI data demonstrated that the periodic centennial-scale fluctuations of solar activity have been strengthened for the periods of 0–3 4.5–6 and 7–9 cal kyr B.P. (Fig. 5b).

The composite SST record was compared to the variations in solar activity over the Holocene (Fig. 3) showing a good agreement at the centennial scale. Periods of low SST corresponded approximately to those of low TSI within the estimated age error (± 60–90 years). In particular the periods of minimum solar activity known as Dalton (~ 1820 CE) Maunder (~ 1680 CE) and Spörer (~ 1470 CE) which have been previously recognised from sunspot observation data covering the last 500 years correspond to cold intervals in our SST composite. We compared the cross spectrum analysis results obtained from these two datasets (Fig. 4b). Cycles of 89 and 102 years in the SST record could have been associated with those of 87 and 104 years in the TSI record (i.e. Gleissberg cycles). Additionally the 190-year cycles observed in HMB-103 were similar to the 206-year TSI cycles (i.e. Suess/de Vries cycles). Finally the 414-year cycle may reflect 353-year TSI cycles (unnamed cycles). The results of the coherence calculation between the SSTs and the TSI confirm the correspondence of the periodicities between them (Fig. 4b). The periodicities of 88 102 130 247 and 927 years are highly coherent between SST and TSI (> 99% Monte Carlo false alarm level) (Fig. 4b). The simultaneous occurrence of cold SSTs and low TSI combined with their similar cyclicity indicates that the solar activity may have influenced the centennial-scale SST variability in the study area.",,,,,,

MIKAL SCHLOSSER

The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked newfound interest in indoor air quality. People are now thinking about how virus particles can spread indoors but the hazards of indoor environments go beyond pandemic-causing pathogens. Air pollution is the world’s largest environmental health threat according to the World Health Organization (WHO) but a majority of people likely don’t think of their own bodies as part of the problem especially within their own homes.

Now an interdisciplinary collaboration between atmospheric chemists and engineers in Germany Denmark France and the US has shown that oil from human skin reacts with ozone to generate potent free radicals that can further react with most organic compounds present in the indoor environment to in turn produce dangerous pollutants.

This reactive pathway detailed in a study published yesterday (September 1) in Science helps explain how the human body directly influences the chemistry of indoor environments. It may also aid research into the adverse health effects of breathing in toxic compounds that are produced in part by us experts say.

“People are aware of outdoor pollution but when we come inside we think “Oh now we’re safe.” And it’s not really true” says study coauthor Jonathan Williams an atmospheric chemist at the Cyprus Institute and the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Germany. “It’s a surprising discovery that ozone reacts on our skin and that releases more chemicals into the atmosphere around us.”

See “Study Looks for Effects of Fetal Exposure to Air Pollution”

In the study Williams and his colleagues asked three different groups of four adult participants to sit in a climate-controlled stainless-steel chamber about the size of a small bedroom on separate days for as long as five hours. Then using highly sensitive instruments they had developed the researchers measured the concentration of organic compounds and hydroxyl radicals in the air inside the chamber. They also looked at the chemical composition of the participants’ breath by asking them to breathe into a special mask to make sure that it wasn’t their breath that was altering the room’s air composition.

After obtaining these measurements the researchers repeated the experiment this time introducing 35 parts per billion (ppb) of ozone into the chamber which is comparable to the level of ozone exposure one gets riding on an airplane. Williams says he was surprised to find that the skin oil squalene reacts with ozone to produce compounds that then react with the ozone again to produce powerful oxidants called hydroxyl radicals. These can then react with other molecules found in indoor environments—such as those emitting from furniture household cleaners and even a freshly cooked meal Williams says—to produce toxic compounds.

The hydroxyl radicals are not harmful in and of themselves and are also present in the outdoor environment. They are produced when sunlight breaks down ozone into oxygen atoms which attack water to make hydroxyl radicals. They are sometimes called “scrubbers” says Tara Kahan an atmospheric chemist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada who was not involved in the new work because they go on to react with hydrocarbon pollutants in the air to scrub the atmosphere clean. But their presence indoors is dangerous because they can also oxidize organic compounds in the air into products that cause respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.

The mechanism of hydroxyl production revealed in the study helps answer how we influence the chemistry of the air around us Kahan says by showing that “even just having humans present can change what’s in the air.”

To validate their findings Williams’ team collaborated with researchers at University of California Irvine and Penn State University. These two groups used the measurements of chemicals in the chamber air to develop and run computational fluid dynamics models and chemical models which simulated the 3D distribution of chemicals in the air including hydroxyl radicals that form a reactive field around the human body.

“If you talk about indoor chemistry what I would have thought before reading this article would be that ozone is the most important oxidant” says Thomas Berkemeier an atmospheric chemist at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry who studies health effects of outdoor air particles and was not involved the study. “It struck me that it was hydroxyl radicals which makes everything difficult.” While ozone reacts more selectively explains Berkemeier hydroxyl radicals are so reactive that it is very challenging to predict all the types of chemicals they produce.

There are a lot of factors like temperature moisture and extent of skin exposure that can influence the generation of these radicals says Williams. He and his colleagues from around the world are currently taking a deeper look at how humidity in the air can affect the generation of hydroxyl radicals.

These findings according to Berkemeier raise questions regarding the potential long-term health effects of oxidation of chemicals in household items such as perfumes deodorants and cleaners. Kahan echoes this and says she looks forward to seeing researcher test at a wide variety of ozone levels in their experiments to see how they affect the production of hydroxyl radicals particularly because ozone concentration in a house on a sunny day with open windows is only about 20 ppb. With further experiments scientists can perhaps gauge the amount of adverse oxidation reactions that may take place in a typical home environment potentially answering some of those health questions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1wZy5kZS8xOTE1NzA2MS8wOTAyLWNoZW0tb3hpZGF0aW9uLWZpZWxkLTE1Mjk5MC140gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rethinking indoor air chemistry,"Rethinking indoor air chemistry

People generate their own oxidation field and change the indoor air chemistry around them

People typically spend 90 percent of their lives inside at home at work or in transport. Within these enclosed spaces occupants are exposed to a multitude of chemicals from various sources including outdoor pollutants penetrating indoors gaseous emissions from building materials and furnishings and products of our own activities such as cooking and cleaning. In addition we are potent mobile emission sources of chemicals that enter the indoor air from our breath and skin.

But how do the chemicals disappear again? In the atmosphere outdoors this happens to a certain extent naturally by itself when it rains and through chemical oxidation. Hydroxyl (OH) radicals are largely responsible for this chemical cleaning. These very reactive molecules are also called the detergents of the atmosphere and they are primarily formed when UV light from the sun interacts with ozone and water vapour.

Indoors on the other hand the air is of course far less affected by direct sunlight and rain. Since UV rays are largely filtered out by glass windows it has been generally assumed that the concentration of OH radicals is substantially lower indoors than outdoors and that ozone leaking in from outdoors is the major oxidant of indoor airborne chemical pollutants.

OH radicals are formed from ozone and skin oils

However now it has been discovered that high levels of OH radicals can be generated indoors simply due to the presence of people and ozone. This has been shown by a team led by the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in cooperation with researchers from the USA and Denmark.

""The discovery that we humans are not only a source of reactive chemicals but we are also able to transform these chemicals ourselves was very surprising to us"" says Nora Zannoni first author of the study published in the research magazine Science and now at the Institute of Atmospheric Sciences and Climate in Bologna Italy. ""The strength and shape of the oxidation field is determined by how much ozone is present where it infiltrates and how the ventilation of the indoor space is configured"" adds the scientist from Jonathan Williams' team. The levels the scientists found were even comparable to outside daytime OH concentrations levels.

The oxidation field is generated by the reaction of ozone with oils and fats on our skin especially the unsaturated triterpene squalene which constitutes about 10 percent of the skin lipids that protect our skin and keep it supple. The reaction releases a host of gas phase chemicals containing double bonds that react further in the air with ozone to generate substantial levels of OH radicals. These squalene degradation products were characterized and quantified individually using Proton Transfer reaction Mass Spectrometry and fast gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry systems. In addition the total OH reactivity was determined in parallel enabling the OH levels to be quantified empirically.

The experiments were conducted at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) in Copenhagen. Four test subjects stayed in a special climate controlled chamber under standardized conditions. Ozone was added to the chamber air inflow in a quantity that was not harmful for humans but representative of higher indoor levels. The team determined the OH values before and during the volunteers' stay both with and without ozone present.

In order to understand how the human generated OH field looked like in space and time during the experiments results from a detailed multiphase chemical kinetic model from the University California Irvine were combined with a computational fluid dynamics model from Pennsylvania State University both based in the USA. After validating the models against the experimental results the modelling team examined how the human-generated OH field varied under different conditions of ventilation and ozone beyond those tested in the laboratory. From the results it was clear that the OH radicals were present abundant and forming strong spatial gradients.

“Our modeling team is the first and currently the only group that can integrate chemical processes between skin and indoor air from molecular scales to room scales” said Manabu Shiraiwa a professor at UC Irvine who led the modeling part of the new work. “The model makes sense of the measurements — why OH is generated from the reaction with skin.”

Shiraiwa added that there remain unanswered questions like the way humidity levels impact the reactions the team traced. “I think this study opens up a new avenue for indoor air research” he said.

Adapt test methods for furniture and building materials

""We need to rethink indoor chemistry in occupied spaces because the oxidation field we create will transform many of the chemicals in our immediate vicinity. OH can oxidize many more species than ozone creating a multitude of products directly in our breathing zone with as yet unknown health impacts”. This oxidation field will also impact the chemical signals we emit and receive"" says project leader Jonathan Williams “and possibly help explain the recent finding that our sense of smell is generally more sensitive to molecules that react faster with OH.”

The new finding also has implications for our health: Currently chemical emissions of many materials and furnishings are being tested in isolation before they are approved for sale. However it would be advisable to also conduct tests in the presence of people and ozone says atmospheric chemist Williams. This is because oxidation processes can lead to the generation of respiratory irritants such as 4-oxopentanal (4-OPA) and other OH radical generated oxygenated species and small particles in the immediate vicinity of the respiratory tract. These can have adverse effects especially in children and the sick people.

ABNB,Airbnb,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA5LzAyL2JldHRlci1idXktYWlyYm5iLXZzLW1hcnJpb3R0LWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: Airbnb vs Marriott International,"The trend toward long-term stays plays to Airbnb's strengths.

The travel industry has rebounded much faster than investors might have expected. While the share prices of Airbnb (ABNB -6.87%) and Marriott International (MAR 0.93%) have lagged that recovery the recent underperformance could set up market-beating returns over the next few years.

Marriott has been the better performer over the last two years up 17% beating Airbnb's share price which is down 21%.

Given the travel industry is expected to grow 8.5% per year through 2026 both stocks offer long-term upside but I would go with Airbnb. The tech-driven rental platform offers many advantages over traditional hotel chains. Here are three reasons I believe Airbnb is a superior investment.

1. Airbnb has greater supply available to meet growing demand

Marriott is the leading brand in the North American hotel industry. It had 1.5 million rooms across its brands in the second quarter. That gives Marriott a 16% share of the U.S. hotel market based on lodging industry data at the end of 2021.

However Airbnb offered 6 million listings on its website at the end of 2021. This gives Airbnb a significant advantage over large hotel chains in being able meet surges in demand especially during special events in major cities that cause hotels to fill up.

Airbnb can expand supply quickly as demand increases in a location. Hosts will see the demand as an opportunity to earn income off their unused property which expands Airbnb's capacity without any expenditure by the company.

It's clear the skyrocketing growth of Airbnb over the last decade has forced Marriott to respond. In May 2019 the company launched Homes & Villas by Marriott which allows Marriott Bonvoy members to rent private homes. But Airbnb's faster rate of growth over the last few years suggest Marriott isn't much competition for the tech-savvy travel platform.

2. Airbnb is growing faster than Marriott

The advantage in supply might explain why Airbnb has experienced a faster rate of recovery since the end of 2020 than Marriott. Over the last few years Airbnb's revenue growth has nearly doubled the rate of increase of Marriott.

Since Airbnb is a technology platform that doesn't require massive amounts of money to be spent on real estate and maintenance it can generate a much higher free cash flow margin relative to revenue.

Over the last four quarters Airbnb generated $1.5 billion in free cash flow on $7.4 billion in revenue which comes from service fees charged to hosts. Marriott produced $1.9 billion in free cash flow but most importantly the larger amount represents a lower margin against nearly $18 billion in revenue.

3. Long-term industry trends favor Airbnb

Another win for Airbnb is how it is meeting the growing demand for long-term stays. Even before the pandemic long-term stays of one month or longer were Airbnb's fastest-growing category.

One advantage for Marriott is its brand and large hotel footprint and the company has leveraged that advantage well with its Bonvoy loyalty program. Marriott had over 160 million members at the end of 2021.

However Airbnb is building an iconic brand of its own. More guests are using Airbnb to rent places for longer periods even as more people return to the office. In fact stays of 28 days or longer account for a fifth of Airbnb's business.

Airbnb checks all the boxes

Marriott has a large hotel footprint with brands ranging from affordable hotels to luxury experiences like St. Regis and Bulgari. But Airbnb's open platform where anyone with an in-demand property can list it for rent and earn extra money is driving incredible growth for the company.

The only downside for Airbnb is its expensive-looking stock price. At the time of writing Airbnb traded at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 38 compared to Marriott's multiple of 24. But Airbnb's competitive advantages in capacity and ability to scale up to meet demand from the millions of hosts on the platform are worth paying up for.

Investors should expect Airbnb's faster rate of growth to deliver better returns than Marriott's over the next 10 years. Airbnb just might be the best travel stock to buy in 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vamFjb2Jpbi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS9saXNib24tcG9ydHVnYWwtcmVudHMtc3BlY3VsYXRpb24tYWlyYm5i0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Real Estate Speculation Has Made Lisbon One of the World's Most Unlivable Cities,"It’s Tuesday morning and Manuela a second-year student at the University of Lisbon (ULisboa) wakes up on her friends’ floor in the city center gets ready and walks to class. But she’s not crashing after a night out: she tells me she’s “been living on the floor Monday-Friday after nearly two months of searching for a room.” Manuela’s story is not unique. Leston a Portuguese-Angolan resident told me that his cousin “struggled to move to Lisbon from South Africa after being asked to provide three months’ rent upfront.” This March Lisbon ranked the world’s third-least viable city to live in based on local wages and rents. To rent a flat geographer Agustín Cocola-Gant tells me residents of the city — known as Lisboetas — “have to dedicate 50-60 percent of their salary to rent if they have a well-paid job. If you earn the minimum wage you can forget about renting.” This March Lisbon ranked the world’s third-least viable city to live in based on local wages and rents. Its housing market seems far more stressed than larger cities’ such as Paris and New York. Although prices have risen the population has fallen. In the 1980s the neighborhood of Alfama had 20000 residents. Today it houses one thousand. Elderly residents have been forced out of districts they’ve spent their whole lives in. This exodus “prevents us from establishing communal neighborhood life” says Ana Gago a ULisboa researcher who conducted qualitative research in Alfama. “And that I think is violent.” Less than fifty years ago Lisbon revolted against a right-wing dictatorship and chose people power in its Carnation Revolution. Then the Right and conservativism were so unpalatable that the new major parties called themselves the Social Democrats (center-right) and Socialists (center to center-left). So how did Lisbon get from that to a situation where it squeezes its people so harshly?

Boom and Squeeze According to Luís Mendes a geographer at ULisboa and housing consultant at the local council Lisboetas were hit by a perfect storm of poor policies. After democratizing and decolonializing Portugal came into the mid-1970s with “a weak base for developing” explains Simone Tulumello also a ULisboa geographer. He argues that subsequent governments focused on development “activities with low added value of which tourism is the golden egg.” Portuguese tourism boomed even into the Great Recession when the European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund bailed Portugal out of its debt on the condition it implement austerity measures and deregulation for investment. Portugal ran with this developing the visto gold (Golden Visa) which granted European Union residency to investors who paid in such as by buying property worth €500000 and a nonpermanent resident program incentivizing European property investors. Both proved popular. It also intensified its focus on tourism to regrow incoming investment and jobs. Although this still had low fixed costs the jobs created were often low paying. Locally City Hall attempted to renovate Lisbon’s decaying buildings by promoting further investment and entering the global housing market. Sales tax was cut on renovations from 21 to 5 percent. “This” explains Mendes “is when this neoliberal turn began to flourish.” Lisbon trumpeted its many merits adorning the covers of several magazines and topping several rankings. It became the it-girl city for tourists digital nomads and start-ups. Madonna and Michael Fassbender moved in. Local property owners and foreign investors took notice. Lisbon became the it-girl city for tourists digital nomads and start-ups. Madonna and Michael Fassbender moved in. Local property owners and foreign investors took notice. “With the boom of Lisbon and the change in its self-perception” says Tulumello “people clicked that: ‘OK now rent is about making lots of money.’” Several landlords used a new national rental law that facilitated evictions and converted their properties into lucrative holiday rentals mainly through Airbnb. As Lisbon became more desirable prices rose and speculators arrived. Despite acute demand renovations and new builds recent figures show that Lisbon lost six thousand homes in a decade. The consensus is that most became tourist accommodation. “The neoliberal justification for the rental law was that if you give more flexibility to landlords they will put more housing into the market” responds Cocola-Gant when I reveal this figure to him “and now we have fewer homes.” The situation today he says is one where “prices correspond to global not local consumption power.” Not everyone agrees that this tourism-speculation phenomenon is hurting residents. If too many properties were going to tourism Lisbon shouldn’t have empty homes suggests Filipa Roseta the Social Democratic (center-right) councilor for housing. “If you really look at the numbers the big figure is 48000 empty homes [excluding tourist rentals]. So that is the number we’re worried about right now.” While 14 percent vacant housing stock is an outrageously high percentage Gago believes the council uses it to detract from legitimate issues regarding holiday rentals. “It’s important to acknowledge that they are both a problem. The problem of Airbnb is huge.” No one including the council is sure why so many dwellings are empty. Some need renovation but many may be abandoned by speculators and visa-seekers. Of Lisbon’s 320000 dwellings 48000 are vacant 20000 are Airbnb units and with unremitting demand it’s no wonder that prices have skyrocketed when left to the market. When combined with Portugal’s lack of a public housing program on the scale of the UK or even the United States they push the masses beyond precarity. There are now six thousand households on the city’s waiting list. This is why so many evictees have been forced to leave with some neighborhoods shrinking by a quarter since 2011. “[The council] is both renovating and losing people” argues Tulumello. “It is totally failing.”

Capital Captures the Capital The situation has created winners as well as losers in Lisbon. While some are evicted other locals profit through rentals. However everyone knows someone who’s been adversely affected by the transformation. So why haven’t elected officials taken measures to end this? The evidence suggests that both Socialist and Social Democrat administrations have acted in capital’s interests. Their dominant ideology is that a market with the space to act as it is “meant to” will ensure a happy equilibrium between supply and demand. This has meant giving the private sector incentives (slashing taxes) flexibility (facilitating evictions) and even public land which the new housing minister Roseta is planning: “We’re designing policies which mix public and private: the city provides the land and we ask somebody to build. So by definition this is more affordable when people rent because the investor didn’t pay for the land.” Although a third of these homes must be rented at an “affordable” level the clear actor for whom the scheme is “more affordable” is the private investor. Two things motivate maintaining this ideology. First the number of voters who keep their money in housing is now significant enough that the council is desperate to keep prices rising as unsustainable as that may be. And more extreme scandals have shown the incestuous link between capital and the parties. Additionally the political culture of treating Lisbon as a breeding ground for national office prevents the autonomous municipalism visible in Barcelona (which has curbed Airbnb rentals) and New York (which has sued oil companies).

Cleaning Up Accordingly the measures City Hall has taken have not dared interfere with rising prices and landlord power. The Programa Renda Acessível (Affordable Rent Program) was supposed to create seven thousand affordable rentals through public-private cooperation. Seven years in it has only created hundreds. The private sector has instead done its own thing building profit-maximizing luxury apartments for international elites speculators and digital nomads. During the pandemic the only sector that didn’t lose money was landlordism. In 2020 Mayor Fernando Medina launched a “bold plan” to bring Airbnbs back into the longer-term market. The Programa Renda Segura (PRS Secure Rent Program) received international attention for its approach to “Airbnbification.” Airbnb landlords missing tourists could lease to the council for up to €1000 a month for five years with the council paying everything up front. The council would rent these homes affordably to longer-term tenants. The effect of this says Gago was to help ensure that “during the pandemic the only sector that didn’t lose money was the landlord.” Landlords now had a minimum floor — funded by the taxpayer — they could rent at should they struggle to find short-term tenants. And many didn’t struggle. Tourism halved during the pandemic but it didn’t evaporate. Despite the early fanfare PRS brought less than two hundred homes into the longer-term market. Because tourist revenue was so lucrative the vast majority of Airbnb landlords believed they would make higher profits waiting for tourists’ return than renting to the council for five years. They were right: tourism has already rebounded to prepandemic levels a year earlier than analysts predicted. With PRS the council “chose not to use the stick but the carrot” explains Tulumello. “That failed because the other carrot [holding out for short-term rentals] is far more appealing.” In fact new evidence suggests that the housing submitted to the program was disproportionately poor quality. Councilor Roseta claims that one home the council acquired through PRS was refused by thirty-seven families. She believes that to save face once the program appeared unpopular the prior Medina administration: tried to acquire as many homes as possible . . . accepting almost all applicants. Some landlords applied because they couldn’t let through the market. . . . Now we have bad houses that need renovating and we can’t find anyone who wants to live in them.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL2ZvcnR1bmUuY29tL2VkdWNhdGlvbi9hcnRpY2xlcy9ob3ctdG8tYmVjb21lLWEtZGF0YS1zY2llbnRpc3QtYXQtYS1zdGFydHVwLWFjY29yZGluZy10by1vbmUtb2YtYWlyYm5icy1maXJzdC1kYXRhLXNjaWVudGlzdHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to become a data scientist at a startup according to one of Airbnb's first data scientists,"As data-driven strategies became more and more focal to businesses in the past decade Big Tech companies’ demand for data scientists has sky-rocketed.

In 2012 Airbnb was one such data science-hungry startup in Silicon Valley and Chetan Sharma was among the first people to help meet this demand. He was one of the first data scientists hired at Airbnb—the fourth member of the team to be exact. Sharma since left to work at other startups and found his company Eppo a product experimentation platform where he is also the CEO.

By the time Sharma left Airbnb in 2017 the data team had grown tremendously—he estimates there were about 100 employees at the end of his stint. Before landing the job at Airbnb he earned a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering and a master’s degree in statistics from Stanford University. Sharma worked in health care policy before beginning his role at Airbnb marking the beginning of his career in data science.

Fortune spoke with Sharma about what startups are seeking in their data science teams and how data science graduates can set themselves apart.

The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.

Experimentation is key to becoming a successful data scientist

Fortune: How does a data science team operate at a startup?

Sharma: In contrast with companies like Facebook or Amazon the founders of startups are not typically data people. Startup leaders tend to lean into intuition and celebration idolizing a Steve Jobs or Walt Disney approach—without heavy consideration of data and metrics. So we had to win a culture war in addition to setting up infrastructure and we did that through experimentation.

The defining traits of the first 10 data scientists at Airbnb were they were very product-oriented great communicators and able to be autonomous. Data scientists have to introduce fresh new ways of understanding business. When we were hiring at Airbnb there was this kind of arbitrage—which was that there were a whole bunch of really smart Ph.D.s who didn’t have clear options in the job market especially tech companies so we hired all these physics Ph.D.s and social science Ph.D.s. What these people had in common is that they were credible thinkers and able to self-operate.

Experimentation is a really core part of that toolkit. Machine learning gets so much attention when like 2% of data science teams actually do any machine learning but a very large share use experimentation.

As a data scientist at a startup you are literally going to be teaching people a new way of thinking to guide consequential decisions for company strategy careers and promotions. There’s a lot of trust that goes into a metrics-oriented point of view so we really need people who can communicate to instill that trust. These are people who can take complicated topics and make them understandable and compelling to the audience.

3 tracks for data science hires

Fortune: What are startups looking for in their data scientists?

Sharma: By and large there are three types of data science tracks for those looking to get hired.

The first one is a data engineer these people are defined by their ability to basically build reliable pipelines to model data. So if a company is early in its foundation—or at really any scale—then they usually prioritize building up reliable reporting. Data engineers don’t actually need great soft skills to do that part of the job and this track is very employable because everyone needs reliable infrastructure.

The second track is analytics. So this is someone who would look for opportunities in this funnel. There’s a lot of taking metrics and slicing them by segmentations. building these reports and presenting them to people. The analytics data science role is primarily a role of persuasion and you are driving decisions so communication skills matter a lot. This track is the most competitive and I would argue that some analysts drive the most impact of anyone on the data team. However you can come into analytics from pretty much anything and you do not need as much technical expertise.

The third track is what I call inference. This role tries to interpret and explain what’s going on in the data in a way that’s more rigorous than a bar chart and experimentation falls into this world. These data scientists run statistical tests on top of data sets to see if it’s just random noise or if there are useful inferences. A lot of times people in this track use econometrics so when you see an economist going into tech companies it tends to be this inference track.

If I was the hiring manager of those teams I would recommend against specialization in one of these three tracks early on. I think your first 10 to 15 data team members need to be what I call “full-stack data scientists.” These are data scientists who can perform the tasks associated with all three of these tracks: data engineering analytics and inference.

Without a doubt the track that will get you a job the fastest is the inference track. It’s very specialized knowledge so there are just not that many people with the skill set. So the inference track is most employable if you have technical data skills and you also have kind of an economist imprint skill set.

You need to be familiar with R and Python toolkits and you definitely need to know SQL very well. You don’t really learn SQL much in college but if you are even two or three years into your experience you’re going to need to be an expert in SQL.

How to navigate data science careers at startups

Fortune: What types of startups should entry-level data scientists work for?

Sharma: Data scientists who are early in their career should try to work at a company that is highly leveraged by data. And while it’s obviously very hard to figure out what is and what is not leveraged by data from the outside one thing to know is that many consumer businesses that are post-product market fit have enough data available to make meaningful conclusions and have an impact.

Some companies are focused on developing completely emergent technology. In those cases it is going to be hard to contribute as a data person because for something that never existed before you don’t have a history to pull data from.

You will also want to make sure you understand the company’s strategy. For instance at Airbnb during most of the years I was there I was very focused on growth—I was not focused on revenue. If we had chased after a revenue goal then we would have focused on only America and Western Europe where people are wealthier. But since we focused on growth we cared about the number of bookings not how cheap or expensive they were. That was important to know because once you know the strategy and your key metrics that is something you can use to experiment with the products and marketing and it becomes a very data-driven process.

In a recession every piece of a company is gonna get scrutinized for revenue ROI. I think for the past five to 10 years data teams have not really had to answer what exactly is the marginal value of an additional data scientist. If you’re a person fresh out of college this can be problematic. If you get put on a team that doesn’t have this clear ROI equation because the data leader never had to pass that scrutiny—that’s ultimately detrimental to your career.

A certain amount of data team members can be justified as essential infrastructure because the board needs numbers to understand how the business is doing—that usually takes three or four data scientists. So larger data teams will have to very visibly and tangibly show how their work affects decision-making.

For one thing there's her mini empire of themed short-term vacation rentals including the Pink Castle and the Goth Castle. Then there's her pink Mercedes G550 SUV. And her pink-painted BB Makeup Cosmetic Bar located in historic downtown Hudson. Her tens of thousands of social media fans get routine updates on her glamorous pink-washed lifestyle that feels more Real Housewives than Upper Midwest.

Fleetwood has fewer fans inside City Hall where she's viewed as a pink pariah who's upsetting civic order via flashy paint jobs and regulatory noncompliance.

“I decided to create the life I wanted to live which was: I love the color pink my dream was to own a pink house a pink car but I never thought I’d actually get there. Because that’s just a dream"" she says. ""To make that dream a reality I just worked hard and as I got the money I started making my empire.”

For crash-course on Brooke Fleetwood's empire scroll through her lavish Instagram feed. You'll find surplus steamy selfies; over-the-top salon offerings; occasional MAGA nods; jetsetting trips to Abu Dhabi; property portfolio highlights; and snapshots from her kid- and animal-packed life in the St. Croix River valley.

Fleetwood's life wasn't always so glamorous. Her dad was the ""top guy"" at Andersen Windows and moved his family from Seymour Indiana to Hudson in 2006. At first his teenage daughter made no friends—""It was quite horrible actually!"" she remembers. After Fleetwood enrolled in the Aveda Institute the young esthetician discovered things to enjoy in the Twin Cities including the Mall of America and the downtown party scene. Fleetwood would relocate 27 miles east where she'd launch her salon/spa marry her husband John and have two kids.

They lived in a ""normal house"" before Fleetwood unannounced to John purchased the 130-year-old Victorian at 904 Vine St. for $427500 in 2015 according to county records.

“I bought it immediately painted my house pink; it was amazing it was the talk of the town..."" she says with obvious pride. ""And that’s when the craziness started.”

Shortly thereafter Fleetwood acquired her salon at 512 Third St. about seven blocks from the Pink Castle. It would soon become the pink salon to the delight of some townspeople and to the horror of others.

“My neighbor to my store said ‘Why haven't you painted this facility pink yet?’ I was like 'Oh my god I don’t know… because people are going to hate me even more!"" Fleetwood says. ""We started painting it at like 5 in the morning and it was like: Ta da it’s pink too! What’s going to happen next?”

The city was displeased. To preserve the character of the historic river town buildings must stay within a range of ""suggested color tones"" Fleetwood says—browns whites beiges etc. City officials sent Fleetwood a notice demanding that she paint the storefront back within 28 days. The obstinate business owner refused and ""within 15 minutes"" a media feeding frenzy began. Fleetwood eagerly vented through reporters and her own Facebook live feed.

""'Pink Girl' Fights City Over Business' Vibrant Paint Job"" screamed a CBS News headline. Almost 7000 supporters signed an online petition as City Hall scrambled to find a solution.

“We were just explaining: There’s nothing wrong with the color pink"" she explains. ""The city tried and they tried and they tried to get me to paint it back. They dropped it but since then I’ve not been on the city’s good side.”

When Super Bowl LII came to Minneapolis in 2018 Fleetwood discovered a new way to poke the municipal government bear. A friend told her about the gleeful price-gouging that abounded around the metro and Fleetwood quickly listed the Pink Castle on Airbnb. She didn't attract any Patriots or Eagles fans though a different partying demographic gravitated toward the listing: bachelorette parties. During the first year around 10 of 'em. That number would double the following year. “I was like 'I need to buy a different property because we’re basically homeless'"" she says.

Until recently Fleetwood owned a constellation of short-term rentals around the St. Croix River valley: The Pink Castle the Goth Castle and the Afton Farm though she just unloaded the latter estate and the Goth Castle hit the market last month.

""Now I wouldn’t ever sell the Pink Castle because that is my brand"" Fleetwood says noting that the Goth Castle's ""darker sexier deeper feel"" draws bachelor parties. ""But the Goth Castle if I can double my money why not? It’s a business move I’m a business woman.""

(Fleetwood's entrepreneurial zeal extends to OnlyFans where ""nasty fuckers"" can buy $50 bottles of her ""boob sweat."" We're not kidding.)

In 2020 when the City of Hudson passed short-term rental ordinances Fleetwood yet again went to war with City Hall. She claims she was the first resident to send in an application; the city claims that the application was ""incomplete."" Complicating everything: How to designate the pools and hot tubs at each property which city officials claim do not meet commercial standards. The city and St. Croix County sued Fleetwood last year over noncompliance as Bring Me the New reported in great detail.

Yet again media hubbub accompanied ""The Pink Girl"" and her fight over regulations.

“I’m the one that started Airbnbs in Hudson. There were no rules with short-term rentals. They wanted to make a rule about it"" says Fleetwood noting that all of her properties are currently licensed. ""OK fine! I was the first one to apply the first one to send in my money and they 'didn’t receive it.' But they cashed my check! So they completely fucked up.”

She hints at possibly filing a retaliatory lawsuit against the city in the coming months.

While re-litigating her battles with Racket Fleetwood maintains the peppy demeanor of an online influencer. She uses words like ""manifest"" and teases a large-scale expansion that's coming at the Pink Castle. She recently added another Pink Castle rental in her hometown as well as a satellite ""beauty resort."" The ultimate goal? To acquire a third Pink Castle in Nashville ""where the bachelorette parties thrive.""

“People ask me how I’ve done this and the biggest thing I tell them is: Work your ass off but have fun doing it"" she says clearly relishing the role of motivational guru. ""I love pink sparkle anything happy and positive even through all this shit—and I want to live that daily. The universe will work for you.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtiemsuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9ib3plbWFuLWJlZ2lubmluZy1wcm9jZXNzLXRvLXVwZGF0ZS1zaG9ydC10ZXJtLXJlbnRhbC1wb2xpY3nSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bozeman beginning process to update short-term rental policy,"Tourism is a big driver of Bozeman’s economy. The city of Bozeman is now looking to tackle its short-term rental policies as many homes throughout the valley sit empty. The city wants to change that.

“I think right now we're in the middle of a housing affordability crisis” says Bozeman Economic Development Manager David Fine.

As prices of homes soar in Bozeman and houses sit empty the city wants to know if supply can be added to the scarce market.

“Whether converting more of those short-term rentals convert to longer-term rentals would do something for housing affordability” says Fine.

According to Airbnb data there are 425 active listings in the 59718 zip code and 506 in the 59715 zip code. Some of these numbers do take into account the properties outside city limits.

“Finding ways to get better data and better reporting are the first step to getting a better handle on our short-term policy situation” says Fine

The Economic Development Office’s biggest recommendation to the city commission is to collaborate and communicate more with the platforms.

“There are options to put more of that burden on platforms like Airbnb VRBO-for them to report to us that the listings on their platforms are in compliance” says Fine.

The policy the city produces is still unknown as it gathers information from the services.

“The very beginning” says Fine. ""As our policy options get more concrete were going to more specifically engage about those.”

The process of formalizing a concrete policy is still early in the process. The city says they are still looking for public comment and input as they move along."

In case you missed it there’s a malware threat vector that’s on the rise: file uploads to web applications. With web interactions becoming increasingly central to virtually every business file uploads via web forms and APIs are ubiquitous. Job applicants uploading resumes to career sites insurance claims loan applications mobile check deposits wholesale orders to vendors—the list of possible file uploads is endless. And every file carries the potential risk of delivering a malware payload that can detonate within your mission-critical systems. How big a problem are file upload attacks? According to one source an estimated 20 percent of malware exploits are dropped from a web application or API. While some exploits are caused by innocent parties unknowingly passing along malware from an infected device others are the work of malicious actors taking advantage of this crack in the online armor.

Many businesses are taking notice of the threat. According to one report 87 percent of organizations that use web applications for file uploads are very concerned about secure file transfers— and 82 percent report that their concern has increased over the past year. Failing to address the threat posed by file upload exploits could expose businesses to all manner of cyber-attacks including ransomware or theft of critical consumer data. How can organizations mitigate the risk posed by malicious file uploads? There are a few possible approaches. Spoiler alert: The third option offers significant advantages both in terms of simplicity and effectiveness. But let’s review all three.

Three Options Against Upload Attacks

Option 1: ICAP virus scanning

This approach typically involves a web application firewall (WAF) communicating with a separate antivirus scanner integrated using an Internet Content Adaptation Protocol (ICAP) interface in order to scan incoming files before they reach the destination server.

This is an old-school approach with a number of drawbacks. It requires multiple pieces of technology from different vendors that must be installed configured integrated and managed. To be effective it must be set up to serve all of your applications—that’s a lot of infrastructures to deploy and maintain including keeping virus definitions up to date. Most importantly because this solution resides on your own network any malware uploaded still lands on your infrastructure— a potential security weakness.

Option 2: Cloud-based scanning

This approach is a bit less labor-intensive than option 1 with less upfront capital cost. However it requires some work to get the uploaded file to the cloud-based scanner. This likely involves writing a script that uploads files to an API for scanning with additional scripting to dictate how suspect files are handled. More work for your application development and IT teams.

Ongoing maintenance of the scanning functionality would be provided by the cloud vendor as a service. However uploaded files would still land on the application server prior to being forwarded to the cloud creating a potential point of vulnerability as in option 1.

Option 3: Protection at the Edge

The third option is using an edge-based solution to block malware closer to its origin—and further from your web application. This represents a modern approach to protection inspecting uploaded files and detecting and blocking malware at the edge before it enters your infrastructure.

Scanning functionality is hosted on the edge network so there is nothing for you to install and no changes to the application code are required. This makes it easier to deploy and maintain than the ICAP-based or cloud-based approaches discussed. Most importantly it isolates threats from the targeted applications providing greater security.

Choosing the Right Edge Network

The edge-based option offers clear advantages for mitigating the risk of malicious file uploads. But not all edge networks are optimized for this critical task. When formulating your edge security strategy consider the following key factors:

The risk of adding latency. Ensure the edge network has many points of presence in the regions where your end-users are located so that file scanning occurs as close to the user as possible.

Ensure the edge network has many points of presence in the regions where your end-users are located so that file scanning occurs as close to the user as possible. Broad file support. Ensure that the edge scanning solution provides support for a wide range of file types able to scan .zip files PDFs and other file formats. It should also have the ability to validate file types to sniff out spoofed files and return a customized response to suspect files.

Ensure that the edge scanning solution provides support for a wide range of file types able to scan .zip files PDFs and other file formats. It should also have the ability to validate file types to sniff out spoofed files and return a customized response to suspect files. Reporting and analytics. The solution should provide the information needed to help you effectively monitor activity and take action. It should provide important context about the client that uploaded the malware and the type of malware sent to help guide the security team’s response.

The solution should provide the information needed to help you effectively monitor activity and take action. It should provide important context about the client that uploaded the malware and the type of malware sent to help guide the security team’s response. SIEM integration. An edge-based scanning solution that integrates with your security information and event manager (SIEM) can provide critical information to your “single pane of glass” security tool improving your ability to proactively spot potential vulnerabilities and threat patterns.

As web applications rapidly take a leading role in how business is done—from B2C and B2B businesses to nonprofit organizations and public institutions—the volume of file uploads will undoubtedly continue to grow. And so will the threat of malware piggybacking on some of those files. Using a modern approach to block those threats at the network edge can provide added assurance that your online assets are protected while continuing to make it easy for your customers to do business with you.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vYXV0b21hdG9uLW1lZGlhLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzLzIwMjIwOTAzLTE1Mzk3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Japanese railway company to release official train sim JR EAST Train Simulator on Steam,"



East Japan Railway Company (JR East) has launched the Steam store page for JR EAST Train Simulator. The game is expected to be released in early access on September 20 (JST).



JR EAST Train Simulator is a train driving simulation game that is being published by Japanese train company JR East and developed by Ongakukan a company that creates professional simulators for business use. Players will be able to experience what it is like to drive trains on the real-life JR East lines. The game will first be available in early access and will include the following route segments:

– Hachiko Line (Kiha 110 Series) Upbound Takasaki – Kuragano (approx. 4 min. 4.4km)

– Keihin Tohoku Line (Series E233-1000) Southbound between Omiya and Yono (about 5 min. 2.7km)

When playing the game you first choose a line and train model before selecting which station along the route that you would like to begin from. There are three difficulty modes in the game and the Beginner difficulty displays an operation guide driving instructions and other helpful information that will make the game easier to enjoy for those who have never played a train driving sim before.





The game is being developed based on the professional simulator that is actually used by JR East drivers for training purposes. The visual scenery that is shown while driving is high-definition live action footage recorded on the JR East lines and the sounds heard from the trains running on the tracks use audio that was recorded using real-life trains. The instrument panel is a faithful replica that responds just like the real thing and there are a number of other meticulous details.

In April of this year four hotels in Japan were offering accommodation packages that included the ability to experience JR EAST Train Simulators that were set up within the hotels. It is unclear what connection these simulators have to the new game but both are developed by the same company: Ongakukan.

The game is expected to stay in early access for 2-3 months and while it will initially only include two routes as mentioned above in the full release “you will be able to change the routes you can drive and purchase DLC to drive longer distance sections.” The full release of the game is also expected to include support for external controllers.

Milewise is currently available in 22 states and US territories:

Arizona

Delaware

Florida

Idaho

Illinois

New automobiles start to depreciate in value the moment your car leaves the lot. If you sell your car even after owning it for just a year its resale value is typically as much as 20% less than its original value according to the Insurance Information Institute or Triple-I. While supply chain issues in the US are shaking up this calculus (meaning in some cases you could make a profit on a used car right now) it’s still an accurate rule of thumb.

That sudden depreciation means that if you’re financing or leasing your new vehicle there may be a time where the amount you owe on the car is greater than the market value of the car itself. For example you may owe $9000 on your car loan but find your car’s depreciated value is now only $7000. In this case if your car gets totaled you’re on the hook for paying more than the car is actually worth to cover your auto loan.

What about car insurance? Although your auto insurance policy would likely kick in if this happened the standard insurance policy would only pay for your vehicle’s current value which means there’s still a sum of money -- a gap -- you’d be obliged to pay. Gap insurance can protect you in this situation.

What is gap insurance and when do you need it?

Sometimes referred to as loan or lease payoff insurance gap insurance can cover the difference between your vehicle’s market value and the amount you owe on it in the event of an accident that totals your car.

If you’re leasing your vehicle this coverage is typically required according to Mark Friedlander director of corporate communications at Triple-I. But if you’re financing your vehicle it’s voluntary. So how do you decide whether you should get it?

Here’s a good rule:

“If you put down less than a 20% payment on your car and you’re financing the rest of it -- at least 80% -- throughout four or five years or longer that’s criteria for gap insurance” Friedlander said. “Additionally our recommendation is that you purchase gap insurance through your auto insurer versus buying it from the car dealer or leasing company. The latter is more expensive.”

Buying gap insurance through your current auto insurance company may be difficult however because not all carriers offer gap insurance. In fact many major national insurers like Geico USAA and State Farm don’t.

If you’re financing or leasing a new car here’s a list of major insurers that offer gap insurance coverage.

Allstate View Rates Allstate is one of the oldest and largest car insurers in the US founded in 1937 and ranks fourth in total market share in the US according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. This insurance giant includes gap insurance in its robust list of coverage options though this coverage tends to come at a pricier premium compared to other insurers. While it services all 50 states and Washington D.C. it doesn’t offer gap insurance in New York. Progressive View Rates Progressive offers something similar to gap insurance called “loan/lease payoff insurance.” It works in much the same way as gap insurance covering the difference between your vehicle’s market value and the amount you owe on it. The main difference is that Progressive’s payoff coverage is limited to no more than 25% of your vehicle’s actual cash value though the limit varies by state. For example if your car is worth $5000 and is totaled in an accident and you owe $7000 Progressive would cover $1250. Progressive offers middle-of-the-line rates generally making it potentially a good option to include in your search if you’re looking for a carrier with gap insurance (or something similar enough). Amica View Rates Amica is another major US insurer operating in every state except Hawaii. Amica is known for its high customer satisfaction scores with residents in New England noting particularly positive experiences with the carrier’s service. The insurer provides more than just car insurance policies; it also offers flood condo life home and small business insurance. If you buy gap insurance at Amica it will show up on your bill as “auto loan/lease coverage.” This coverage isn’t available in all states. Nationwide View Rates Nationwide’s gap coverage costs approximately 5% of the total cost between both comprehensive and collision on the customer’s policy according to a Nationwide spokesperson. This carrier sells gap coverage in all states except New York and it operates in all states except Alaska Hawaii and Louisiana. To purchase this coverage you must request it within six months of buying or leasing your new vehicle and hold both comprehensive and collision coverage. Gap insurance at Nationwide is available until the vehicle turns six years old. Liberty Mutual View Rates Liberty Mutual headquartered in Boston Massachusetts is another major carrier that provides gap insurance. The carrier offers auto home and life insurance policies in all 50 states plus Washington D.C. making Liberty Mutual’s gap coverage one of the most accessible across the country. That noted the carrier receives a high number of complaints nationally filed with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and below average scores in J.D. Power customer satisfaction surveys. The Hartford View Rates The Hartford offers a list of car insurance coverage that includes gap insurance. But this carrier isn’t for all drivers. The Hartford’s auto policy is geared towards drivers over the age of 50 who are members of the American Association of Retired Persons. Along with gap insurance Hartford also offers car replacement coverage which will give you money for a new car of the same make and model if your car is totaled instead of paying out the depreciated value of your car.

Gap Insurance FAQs

FAQs

Can you get gap insurance from a different company than your main insurance provider? Yes but it’s much more expensive. The other option if you’re not getting it through an insurer is to buy gap insurance through the lender or dealership you bought the car with. Again this is more expensive than getting it through your main insurance provider as an add-on to your policy.

Do I need gap insurance if I have full coverage? Yes. If you want to insure the gap between your car’s market value and the amount you owe on it you’ll need gap insurance. Full coverage won’t cover that gap on its own.

Can you add gap insurance to your policy at any time? No. More often than not you’ll need to add gap insurance immediately or soon after buying your new car. For example Nationwide requires that you buy gap insurance within six months of getting a new car.

LSU is scheduled to play this Sunday in the Caesars Superdome for the Allstate Louisiana Kickoff Game and some are already talking about the halftime show.

In a recent Tweet the Florida State marching band said that they plan to pay tribute to the city of New Orleans and to the quarterback of the New Orleans Saints.

Yes Jameis Winston who played for Florida State is not the QB for the city hosting this weekend's marquee matchup.

Winston who came over from Tampa played his college football for Florida State and won the Heisman Trophy in 2013.

Thus he has roots in Tallahassee and the marching band plans to salute him Sunday night in his home stadium by spelling out his first name while on the field.

The marching band also plans to get into formation for halftime and salute the city of New Orleans by creating a Fleur de Lis for halftime. According to their Tweet the band may even play ""When The Saints Come Marching In"".

The LSU/Florida State game will air on ABC and I hope that the network shows a portion of the halftime show so that we can witness this performance.

Sundar Pichai the CEO of Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc. gave a vote of confidence to New York City’s economic prospects and its commercial real estate market.

“I’m personally long-term bullish on our growth in New York as a company” Pichai told Crain’s New York Business.

“And we would do that only if we’re optimistic to access to tech talent and being able to scale up.”

Pichai has put his money where his mouth is. Last year Google announced it was buying the St. John’s Terminal building at West Houston Street near the Hudson River for a whopping $2.1 billion.

Pichai told Crain’s that Google plans to open offices at the location by the middle of next year.

Pichai said Google plans to expand its New York City footprint in the coming years. Levine-Roberts/Sipa USA

Google is also developing two other sites in the Hudson Square section of Manhattan. Altogether the three buildings will comprise a campus totaling 1.7 million square feet.

Earlier this year Google unveiled a new campus on Pier 57 that will include office space in three buildings.

As of last September Google employed 12000 people in the city. The company said it aims to increase that number by 2000 employees in the coming years.

Pichai told Crain’s that the city’s tech environment which includes more than 1000 fintech startups was a big lure for Google.

At least 20 of those companies have attained “unicorn status” — meaning their private valuation is worth at least $1 billion.

“When I looked at specific sectors like fintech I was surprised at the scale and number of startups in New York” Pichai said.

The CEO cited the city’s diversity as another main draw. Pichai’s interview with Crain’s coincided with an announcement that Google would launch a round of grants totaling $4 million toward computer science education and teacher training in the city.

While Google plans to expand its New York footprint other tech giants are more hesitant.

Meta Platforms Inc. the parent company of Facebook and Instagram halted its planned expansions earlier this year amid uncertainty and slowing growth in the tech sector.

Amazon also put on hold its plans to grow its presence in New York according to Crain’s.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA5LzAyL2FtYXpvbi1taWNyb3NvZnQtYWxwaGFiZXQtcGFydG5lcmVkLWFpLXN0b2NrLWJ1eS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Microsoft and Alphabet Have Partnered With This AI Stock.

Is It a Buy?,"Artificial intelligence will likely be a driving force behind productivity for companies in the future.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly advancing technology and thanks to companies like C3.ai (AI -0.49%) it's gradually becoming accessible to all businesses in all industries. The company is blazing a trail in a brand-new sector it calls enterprise AI where it sells ready-made and customizable AI applications to customers wanting to supercharge their operations.

Estimates suggest that by 2030 up to 70% of all organizations will be implementing AI in one way or another adding $13 trillion in output to the global economy. It's a sizable opportunity for a company like C3.ai and it already has a leadership position in the industry.

The largest technology companies in the world have established partnerships with C3.ai including Amazon Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet validating the quality of what the company is building. It's one reason investors should consider owning C3.ai stock especially since it's attractively priced right now after declining 90% from its all-time high.

C3.ai is expanding access to artificial intelligence

C3.ai just reported its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 (ended July 31) and during the period it grew its customer base by 27% year over year to 228 companies. Those companies operate within at least 11 different industries from tech to finance manufacturing which highlights the diversity of C3.ai's AI applications.

As a prime example C3.ai's technology is incredibly popular with oil and gas giants which are seeking advanced AI to help them run cleaner operations. C3.ai helps them reduce carbon emissions and predict critical equipment failures to prevent catastrophic environmental disasters. Global oil behemoth Shell monitors over 13000 pieces of equipment through C3.ai with 1.2 million daily data streams.

Technology leaders Amazon Microsoft and Alphabet are all collaborating with C3.ai to build upon their expansive cloud services segments. Given the rapid shift to online operations for many businesses the cloud has become a critical facilitator and there's a race among providers to deliver the most impactful solutions. With Google Cloud specifically one of C3.ai's roles is to help small businesses more quickly adopt AI and draw maximum value from their AI applications.

At this time last year C3.ai and Microsoft had closed over $200 million in deals together for the Azure cloud platform. Their partnership continues to grow and they signed 16 new joint sales in the first quarter.

C3.ai stock is cheap right now

After reporting its financial results for the first quarter investors sent C3.ai stock down 15% in after-hours trading. They appeared disappointed by the company's forward guidance for the full fiscal 2023 year which suggested revenue might only grow by 7% compared to fiscal 2022. C3.ai says the challenging economic environment at the moment is causing customers to be more stringent when committing to large contracts.

Still the company managed to grow its quarterly revenue by 25% year over year to $65 million. Additionally it's transitioning from subscription-based pricing to a consumption-based pricing model and tweaking its sales and partnership models in moves designed to accelerate growth. It says this will boost adoption and increase C3.ai's market share over time.

The company isn't profitable yet because it's still investing heavily in expansion which is the right thing to do considering its revenue and customer base are still growing quickly in the short term -- although this kind of strategy is generally unpopular with investors right now as risk appetite is low. It lost $71.8 million in the first quarter which followed a $192 million net loss for the fiscal 2022 year. But C3.ai has over $900 million in cash equivalents and short-term investments on its balance sheet so it can afford to spend aggressively for the time being.

C3.ai's market capitalization stands at just $1.65 billion at the moment which means investors are only valuing the business at $750 million net of cash. That's a paltry 3 times fiscal 2022 sales. Given the company estimates its opportunity could be worth $596 billion by 2025 plus considering the blockbuster partnerships and customer relationships C3.ai has already accumulated this might be a golden opportunity for investors to take a long-term position."
MO,Altria,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cG9zZWRieWNtZC5vcmcvMjAyMi8wOS8wMi9rb2NoLXN1YnNpZGlhcnktc3VwcGxpZXItb2YtanV1bC12YXBpbmctcHJvZHVjdHMtYW5ub3VuY2VzLWxheW9mZnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Koch Subsidiary Supplier of JUUL Vaping Products Announces Layoffs,"Phillips-Medisize a subsidiary of the Koch Industries company Molex has laid off 99 workers at its Hudson Wisconsin factory which produces plastic cartridges for JUUL e-cigarettes. The layoffs were triggered by a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) order denying JUUL the right to continue selling its device and four of its pod products in the U.S.

Koch Industries supports several advocacy groups that carry water for Big Tobacco but its direct financial interest in the vaping business is not widely known.

The Phillips-Medisize factory announced the layoff of approximately 25% of its employees in a July 1 letter to the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development as it is required to do under federal law. In the letter the company added that if “a complete cessation of production is necessary…we anticipate a permanent layoff of approximately 225 additional employees which would likely take place in phases [through] October 12 2022.”

The Hudson location is one of 26 Phillips-Medisize facilities around the world including three others in Wisconsin that have not downsized. After Koch Industries bought Molex in 2013 Molex bought Phillips-Medisize in 2017.

JUUL long the most popular e-cigarette brand in the U.S. is partially owned by the tobacco giant Altria which—like Koch Industries itself— is a longstanding board member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) a secretive pay-to-play corporate bill mill and lobbying group.

In reviewing the Koch Molex and Phillips-Medisize websites the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) did not find any mention of the JUUL device or cartridges as products of the Koch conglomerate.

“Well-known parts of Koch Industries include his cash machine of a Canadian crude processing plant in Minnesota and the paper mills of Georgia Pacific” notes Lisa Graves a nationally recognized Koch expert and critic. “Then there are the less well known [parts] like his methane-producing fertilizer plants or the asphalt he sells for roads.”

Graves president of the CMD Board and a former deputy assistant attorney general in the Department of Justice during the Clinton Administration added “But even I didn’t know that his business involved filters for vaping with Altria’s JUUL. I suppose [it’s] unsurprising that Koch has financial ties to Big Tobacco since his political operations like Citizens for a Sound Economy/Americans for Prosperity (AFP) have long relied on funding from the carcinogenic industry profiting from tobacco.”

ALEC and AFP have served as front groups for the tobacco industry in a number of state policy battles over the past two decades including opposing increases to cigarette taxes and smoke-free workplace and plain packaging requirements promoting smokeless tobacco and pushing preemption laws that prevent local governments from more strongly regulating tobacco products.

After the FDA announced its ban of JUUL products on June 23 a federal appeals court stayed the ban a few weeks later and on July 5 the FDA said that it had put its ban on hold pending an additional review of the company’s application. Unless the ban is ultimately rescinded JUUL will require fewer plastic cartridges from Phillips-Medisize.

Vaping companies are required to seek FDA authorization in order to sell their products in the U.S. Although the federal agency has approved a handful of vaping devices this year it has “denied more than a million applications” according to the New York Times.

The ALEC tie between Altria and Koch Industries isn’t the only political connection between Koch and the e-cigarette industry. The Koch-connected Consumer Choice Center (CCC) has worked closely with the industry-backed World Vapers’ Alliance on a series of ads pushing for weaker regulations of vaping products in Europe according to investigations by the Daily Beast and the French newspaper Le Monde.

First surfacing in 2017 the CCC is a spin-off of Students for Liberty (SFL) which was founded by a Koch Summer Fellow at the Reason Foundation in the summer of 2007. Between 2009 and 2020 (the most recent filing date available) it received $776898 from the Charles G. Koch Foundation and another $215413 (2015–20) from the Charles Koch Institute (CKI) now known as Stand Together Fellowships. CKI/Stand Together recruits students at SFL events. But in speaking to Le Monde a CCC spokesperson denied any direct association with Koch while remaining silent on its connection to SFL.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It sounds fanciful in a country where people die waiting to see a doctor but Amazon believed it could do for health care what it had done for shopping. Hailed as “the future of medicine” the Amazon Care telehealth and house-call service was pitched to employers as “high-quality care convenience and peace of mind.”

Last week though the company announced it would shut down Amazon Care at the end of this year. For the second time in two years Amazon has had to concede failure in an effort to take on the American health care system. It might be possible to deliver a spatula to someone’s apartment in 24 hours but applying the same approach to health care seems a taller order.

Yet Amazon is not giving up: It plans to purchase One Medical a membership-based primary care provider with in-person and telehealth services in 19 cities. One Medical could prove a better business bet but there’s no grand fix for the health care system to be achieved here.

Any company claiming its innovation will revolutionize American health care by itself is selling a fantasy. There is no technological miracle waiting around the corner that will solve problems caused by decades of neglectful policy decisions and rampant fraud. And a fix aimed at just the upper crust of employer-sponsored health coverage has no hope of making health care more accessible to those who are truly being left behind.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdGlnYXRpdmVwb3N0Lm9yZy8yMDIyLzA5LzAyL2luc2lkZS1hbWF6b25zLW1hc3NpdmUtc3Vic2lkeS1pbi1uaWFnYXJhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inside Amazon's massive subsidy in Niagara - Investigative Post,"The online retailing giant is a master at wrestling subsidies out of communities. Few have doled out more than Niagara County — $124 million and counting — to land a warehouse whose jobs won't pay much above the minimum wage.

Share on









Robert Taylor a lifelong Niagara County resident is thinking about moving south. Probably Florida.

But Taylor isn’t chasing the warm weather and low property taxes that have drawn tens of thousands of other Northerners to the South.

Rather he’s running away from something.

Amazon.

The online retail giant plans to open a 3-million-square-foot warehouse less than a mile from his Packard Road home in the Town of Niagara. Amazon plans to employ 1000 people at the warehouse and hundreds of cars and trucks will travel to and from the facility daily.

The warehouse will be a “first mile” distribution center where bulk shipments of goods will arrive and be sorted and packed for shipment to other Amazon facilities. The goods will make their way to customers from those other facilities.

The Niagara County warehouse will be Amazon’s fourth in Western New York joining warehouses in Tonawanda Lancaster and Hamburg. The Niagara County facility comes after Amazon pulled plans to build a similar facility on Grand Island two years ago.

Local officials have rolled out the red carpet offering Amazon tax breaks totaling $124 million. That works out to $124000 per job most of which will pay $15 an hour not much above the minimum wage of $13.20.

That’s in addition to subsidies from the state. Company and state officials refused to discuss possible assistance but at a minimum Amazon appears eligible for an estimated $22.4 million in tax credits over 10 years. Other tax credits and possibly grants could push that figure higher.

“This will probably go on record as one of the worst decisions that’s ever been made in this town in the end” Taylor 59 said. “And why? Why would a county and a town bring in a multi-billion company that wants $124 million in tax breaks. That is just absurd.”

The Niagara County Industrial Development Agency on Aug. 10 approved — without discussion — Amazon’s ask for $124 million in tax breaks. IDA and town officials said those subsidies are worthwhile providing the area both jobs and tax revenue.

“By Amazon coming to the Town of Niagara alone we’ll generate somewhere between $800000 and $1 million in additional property tax revenue. That is about a 30 to 35 percent increase in what we currently have” Town of Niagara Supervisor Lee Wallace said in July. “We can’t raise that kind of money anywhere else.”

Experts who study development and tax subsidies though say officials here have bent the rules to lure Amazon. In its application Amazon claimed it could not afford to build the warehouse without the subsidies.

John Kaehny the executive director of Reinvent Albany a good government group called the subsidies “absurd and crazy.”

“This is money that’s not going to go to schools fire protection parks clean water etc. in Niagara County” he said. “And the fact the county is so blithe about handing such gigantic amounts of money out is pretty appalling.”

Besides the subsidies officials opted not to subject the project to a full environmental review. That means the project will not be fully scrutinized for its potential impact on roads and traffic air quality stormwater infrastructure and wetlands.

Another concern: research suggests Amazon’s growing presence in Western New York may harm the local retail sector. In the case of Niagara County that could include Factory Outlet Mall currently the county’s largest taxpayer.

Bending the rules

The standard for providing tax subsidies in New York is what’s called the “but for clause.” In other words a company’s project must be deemed not be viable “but for” the tax incentives it requests.

Experts say it’s highly unlikely Amazon would be unable to build the Niagara warehouse without the tax breaks. Amazon is currently valued at more than $1.2 trillion. Last year it earned $197 billion in profits. The company’s founder Jeff Bezos is ranked by Forbes as the world’s second-richest person with a net worth of $171 billion.

“If ever there was a glaring example of a company that doesn’t need to be subsidized because it already has rapidly growing market share and has been profitable for many years [and] is wreaking havoc among its competitors it’s Amazon” said Greg LeRoy the executive director of Good Jobs First a subsidy watchdog organization based in Washington D.C.

According to its application for financial assistance Amazon checked the box saying the company couldn’t afford to build its 3-million-square-foot warehouse unless it received $124 million in subsidies. Those break down into a $94 million property tax break a $26 million sales tax exemption and a $3.5 million mortgage tax exemption. The subsidies amount to 23 percent of the $550 million construction costs.

An Amazon spokesperson in an email declined to answer questions about the subsidy deal. But the company noted that governments across the country hand out subsidies and many companies including Amazon take advantage of them.

Amazon will pay property taxes via a payment-in-lieu-of-taxes agreement or PILOT. The company will pay 10 percent of its total property tax bill for seven years and then step that amount up by 10 percent each year over the following eight years.

Only after the warehouse has been open 16 years will Amazon pay 100 percent of its property tax bill.

Over the life of the subsidies Amazon will pay $49 million out of what would otherwise have been a $173 million local tax bill.

Kaehny of Reinvent Albany said proving that Amazon violated the “but for” test is difficult in part because it would take a full accounting of company finances to do so. But he said the tax subsidies the Niagara County IDA is providing Amazon are almost certainly unnecessary.

“It's an exploitation by Amazon of the IDA system which is massively flawed to begin with” he said. “It would be very hard for the IDA to defend a decision like this in a spreadsheet where you got to see honest accounting numbers.”

Kaehny added that Amazon has made clear in public statements that it locates its warehouses based on logistics and infrastructure not subsidies.

“The subsidies are just a freebie that they get” he said. “The subsidy is just pure profit they're extorting from the local government.”

Niagara County IDA Board Chairman Mark Onesi defended the subsidies arguing that even the steeply discounted property taxes would be a big boost to the area.

“Doing business in New York is expensive and a lot of companies won't come without those inducements” he told reporters after the board approved the tax break.

While the company will pay reduced property taxes the $49 million it will pay over 15 years is considerably more than the $24000 a year the property yields he said.

“We want [these] 1000 jobs” Onesi said.

Those jobs though won’t pay much above minimum wage. Of the 1000 jobs Amazon plans to bring 950 will pay $31200 per year the company said. That’s $15 per hour. An additional 50 management jobs will pay $60000 per year.

LeRoy’s group Good Jobs First tracks subsidies given to Amazon. They total $4.7 billion over the past two decades. Amazon has received subsidies to build 283 of its warehouses distribution centers and other projects nationally: the Niagara package of tax breaks rank as the sixth richest.

“[Local officials] should be driving a harder bargain they should be playing a smarter poker hand” LeRoy said. “They should realize that the company wants to come that the bargain on the table isn't the jobs it's the access to market share.”

Onesi said if the town bargained harder with companies like Amazon they’d walk away.

“Maybe if we held a better hand maybe they wouldn't come and that's what we have to look at” he said. “We have to weigh those factors.”

State subsidies likely

Amazon appears eligible to receive Excelsior corporate tax credits for the 1000 jobs it intends to create. Investigative Post estimates those tax credits at $22.4 million over 10 years based on Amazon’s payroll figures and a formula Empire State Development publishes on its website.

The project may also be eligible for an investment tax credit and state grants. Discounted hydropower from the New York Power Authority is apparently not part of the mix as an authority spokesman said Amazon has not applied for the program.

Pamm Lent a spokesperson for Empire State Development refused to comment on any potential subsidies for Amazon.

Wallace the Niagara Town Supervisor and Kim Nason a Phillips Lytle attorney working for Amazon and the developer Atlanta-based JB2 Partners did not respond to interview requests.

No environmental study

Amazon is poised to set up shop without a full review of how its warehouse will impact the environment. Large projects are typically subject to review under the State Environmental Quality Review Act or SEQRA.

The “negative declaration” it received also means the public had no opportunity to weigh in on those issues said attorney Arthur Giacalone who specializes in cases related to SEQRA.

“The intent of SEQRA is that any project that has even one aspect … that possibly could lead to a significant environmental impact should get not a negative declaration but a positive declaration” said Giacalone. “The larger the project the more sensitive the surroundings the more important it is to issue a positive declaration.”

Giacalone said Niagara’s “negative declaration” means Amazon and the town don’t have to detail how much traffic the warehouse will add to local roads; how it will affect air quality; and how it will affect the town’s stormwater infrastructure among other effects.

Such a large project — Amazon will impact 111 acres for its facility — receiving a negative declaration is “stunning” Giacalone said.

Under state law all projects larger than 10 acres are supposed to undergo a full review.

“[Amazon’s facility] is more than 30 times the threshold for when there's a presumption that you're going to have a significant adverse impact” Giacalone said referencing the facility's total three million square foot size.

The warehouse will have a 650000-square-foot footprint and will be 107 feet tall. That means the warehouse will be bigger than 11 football fields put together and stand as tall as a five-story building.

Part of the reasoning for the negative declaration was that Empire State Development completed an environmental impact statement a decade ago and deemed the site “shovel ready.” Nason the Phillips Lytle attorney for Amazon told The Buffalo News in April that designation made the site attractive for the company.

Nason wrote a letter to the Town of Niagara earlier this year urging leaders to pass a negative declaration. The town did as she asked.

Change in the offing

Up until World War II the Town of Niagara was largely a farming community. When the war ended soldiers taking advantage of the GI Bill found jobs in Niagara Falls or Buffalo and bought homes in the rapidly growing suburbs.

Many worked in factories in nearby Niagara Falls and once they started shedding jobs town historian Pete Ames said the town was left in the lurch.

“Any of these service jobs government jobs the air base those are the only things that keep people around here” Ames said. “Otherwise there's really not a lot they can make a career out of or pay the bills.”

And then comes Amazon.

The full impact of the tech giant is yet to be seen but Ames and others see it as a big deal for the town. Like other residents Ames isn’t thrilled about the company’s new warehouse but also understands that the town’s budget isn’t big enough to provide all the services — like garbage pickup — that residents want. He sees the town in a tough spot.

“You're playing a big player so consequently if you don't play their game you don't play” he said. “It's sort of 'between a rock and a hard place.' ”

At its July 19 meeting Wallace the town supervisor explained that the town was balancing its budget by borrowing from fund reserves. He argued that Niagara needed Amazon to boost the budget.

But an Investigative Post review of town budgets showed the deficit was less than $100000 and shrunk substantially each year. The town has nearly fully recovered.

Still Wallace said the town needs a boost because COVID-19 prevented Canadian shoppers from visiting Fashion Outlet Mall.

Studies show that the presence of an Amazon facility impacts sales at nearby stores however.

Economist Matt Cunningham of Civic Economics a firm that assesses how Amazon affects retail businesses said the company generally reduces sales from retail outlets but that a warehouse in Niagara likely wouldn’t kill the outlet mall.

For mom-and-pop stores Amazon can be devastating Cunningham’s research has found.

“Amazon is replacing hundreds of thousands of jobs and storefronts around the country according to our research cited in the study” Cunningham said in an email.



And as for the jobs Amazon will bring to the county?

Amazon could prove to be a benefit if workers at the warehouse unionize and win higher pay LeRoy said. The company however has waged aggressive campaigns to convince its workers not to join labor unions.

For Taylor who worked as a union carpenter and built his Packard Road home by hand Amazon is a slap in the face. The company in his view will ruin the place he’s called home all to bring hundreds of grueling low-paying jobs.

“My whole life I spent building this home everything. It’s 28 years of hard work this entire place all for naught because of something of this magnitude that's just so out of touch with our town” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9kYy1tZC12YS8yMDIyLzA5LzAyL2FybGluZ3Rvbi1hbWF6b24taHEyLWluY2VudGl2ZXMtY292aWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Arlington offered $23M for Amazon HQ2.

While the details of each death are still forthcoming the fatalities shine an even stronger spotlight on a common complaint about Amazon: that it requires a brutal pace of work and puts employees at risk of injury and overheating.

A range of circumstances surround the deaths. Rafael Reynaldo Mota Frias 42 reportedly died of a heart attack in Carteret New Jersey as Prime Day was underway on July 13. Another worker Rodger Boland died after falling from a short ladder and hitting his head in Robbinsville New Jersey. Alex Carillo 22 died six days after an Aug. 1 forklift crash in Carlisle Pennsylvania.

A fourth worker Eric Vadinsky died after a workplace incident in Monroe Township New Jersey on Aug. 4. The deaths are all under investigation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration which has six months to release its findings.

Amazon expressed condolences to all the families of the deceased. ""Each of these tragic incidents have affected our teams greatly and we are providing resources for families and employees who need them"" said Amazon spokesman Sam Stephenson. ""Our investigations are ongoing and we're cooperating with OSHA which is conducting its own reviews of the events as it often does in these situations.""

The investigations come at a time when Amazon already faces probes from federal and state regulators on workplace safety as well as worker pushback against what they say are dangerously hot work spaces. OSHA opened a broad investigation that will examine working conditions at Amazon warehouses in three US cities: Chicago Orlando and New York City. Additionally a group of workers walked off the job at an Amazon air hub in San Bernardino California in August protesting hot working conditions and pay.

The deaths also come as people reexamine the role of Amazon in their lives in light of dangerous working conditions reported by news outlets advocates and workers themselves. A group of 70 TikTok influencers signed onto a pledge in August promising to close down their Amazon storefronts and wish lists and to avoid entering into new agreements with Amazon to monetize their videos when users click through to Amazon's marketplace.

Called out by the TikTokers: reports of excessive heat in warehouses and in trucks that workers must load and unload in the sun in addition to Amazon's response to union efforts in its warehouses. A photo shared by More Perfect Union a workers' rights group shows the cargo area of an Amazon truck registering an internal temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius).

""Amazon is treating its workers like crap"" TikToker @asianlefty said in a video pointing out worker complaints of hot work spaces and limited water adding that he was joining the People Over Prime Pledge.

Amazon spokesman Stephenson pointed out that the company's warehouses have climate control. ""Our teams are trained to follow robust safety procedures when operating during warmer weather and our policies meet or exceed industry standards and OSHA guidance"" he said.

Preventing future deaths in warehouses

It's hard to draw broad conclusions from four deaths said Eric Frumin director of health and safety at the union-affiliated Strategic Organizing Center adding that warehouse deaths are statistically rare throughout the industry.

Still workplace safety experts say the deaths raise questions.

""One workplace fatality is too many"" said Marissa Baker assistant professor at the University of Washington's department of environmental and occupational health sciences.

These are also not the first fatalities Amazon has seen in the last 12 months. While it's unclear exactly how many Amazon workers have died in the company's warehouses over the years five employees and a delivery driver employed by Amazon's contractor died in a collapsed warehouse during a tornado in December.

While OSHA investigated the incident and required Amazon to review its severe weather policies the deaths don't appear in two OSHA datasets that collect information on fatalities. When asked by CNET OSHA didn't provide information for why the deaths weren't recorded in its datasets. In a statement Amazon said it reports all deaths to OSHA in accordance with the law.

In general both fatalities and injuries are undercounted Baker said. ""It doesn't mean that the data we do have should be ignored or can't be relied on"" she said. But she added there needs to be more standardization in recording injuries and deaths at work.

Frumin the health and safety director at the Strategic Organizing Center added that OSHA investigations must be thorough to create prevention plans for the future.

When looking into Boland's death in Robbinsville he said investigators have to ask why someone fell off a three-foot ladder in the first place. Even if a similar fall doesn't lead to someone's death in the future it could still cause serious injury. Regulators in the state of Washington have said Amazon workers often skip using tools like step stools or use them unsafely because they fear they'll be penalized if they slow down enough to use them correctly.

For Mota Frias who died of cardiac arrest on Prime Day investigators will have to look at whether heat and the pace of work made his medical emergency worse.

Amazon has denied responsibility for his death. Company spokesman Stephenson said the death ""was related to a personal medical condition."" Amazon workers told the Daily Beast that the area where Mota Frias worked was dangerously hot but Stephenson said claims that heat was a factor are false. OSHA will also make a determination on the question Stephenson said adding ""we fully expect that it will reach the same conclusion.""

A heart attack on the job can be work-related even if it stems from an underlying health condition Frumin said. Additionally he said workers who fear losing their jobs will often work through health scares.

Frumin also believes it's worth looking into the fact that the death happened on Prime Day when advocates say increased production demands lead to higher injury rates.

""That is a big alarm"" Frumin said.

According to Pekin City Manager Mark Rothert Sunny Pasture will lease about 29 acres of city-owned property south of Hanna Drive where the company intends to construct and operate a commercial solar energy system.

The terms include a due diligence period of one year with up to four additional one-year diligence periods; an initial 25-year lease that will commence when the system becomes operational; and two successive five-year lease renewals. The Pekin City Council unanimously approved the lease agreement Monday.

Rothert said the city will see revenue from the project in the form of $1000 per acre in rent for the first year and annual increases of 2.5% as well as an estimated $15684 annually in property taxes.

“There will (also) be utility savings that the city can subscribe to as this is a community project and save on its energy costs” he added. “There will be savings estimated to be around $54800 in the first year. That’s quite substantial for the city and those will be ongoing from year to year.”

According to Trajectory co-founder and partner James Svenstrup a community solar energy system saves subscribers money by producing community solar energy credits that lower utility bills. He believes that the Hanna Drive parcel is suitable for a 2-megawatt AC project which will equate to about 400 residential subscriptions. The community solar energy system will use a single-access tracker system where solar panels are placed on a controller that follows the sun’s course throughout the day providing more energy than stationary panels.

“We think this is a really exciting opportunity” Svenstrup added.

Trajectory will zone the project with the city and submit a Community Driven Solar Program application with the state of Illinois this fall to obtain project incentives. Svenstrup expressed confidence that the Pekin solar energy system will be among the projects selected next March.

“(Applying for the program) is a competitive process” he noted. “But we have a strong track record of being successful in these projects. We have projects that have been (completed) in Kankakee and Rockford already and we have projects that are going into construction both in Peoria County and Marshall County later this year.”

Svenstrup added that he hopes construction will commence in the fall of 2023 or the spring of 2024.

Trajectory has undertaken 16 other community solar projects throughout Illinois including Cornwell Solar in unincorporated Peoria County and Bunker Solar in Tazewell County near Marquette Heights.

The project was built on a former General Motors Powertrain Division Plant turned brownfield site. Greenbacker Renewable Energy Company an independent power producer and green energy investment company is the owner of the installation.

The 2.62 MW system consists of over 6600 solar modules and is connected to the Ameren utility grid. The completed project is expected to generate over 3600000 kWh of electricity and offset over 1500 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually or the equivalent to powering 350 Illinois homes and removing approximately 480 cars from the road.

“We can turn a serious problem into a tremendous opportunity by siting solar on closed landfills” said Tyler Kanczuzewski vice president of sustainability at Inovateus. “The Danville Solar project is making productive use of land that might otherwise lie dormant while avoiding construction in more pristine areas. We’re proud to partner with Ameresco on this project and to help the state of Illinois achieve its clean energy goals.”

This project contributes to Illinois’ Future Energy Jobs Act which requires that 2700 MW of solar to be installed in Illinois by 2030 and that 2% of those projects come from brownfield sites. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association Illinois has a strong and growing solar market due in part to its renewable portfolio standard that requires that 25% of its energy comes from renewable sources by 2025. The amount of solar capacity installed in Illinois currently at 1.5 GW is expected to grow by more than 1700% over the next five years. Illinois ranks 17th in the country for installed solar.

“We’re proud to have been a partner on this project designed to help meet sustainability goals and offer clean resilient energy to the surrounding community” said Louis P. Maltezos executive vice president Ameresco. “This installation is a prime example of using innovative cleantech solutions to identify clean energy uses for public land.”

The Danville solar project began construction in November of 2020 and reached completion in May of 2022.",,,,,,,,,
AAL,American Airlines Group,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL2d1aWRlcy9hbWVyaWNhbi1qZXRibHVlLWVsaXRlLXBlcmtzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American & JetBlue Reciprocal Elite Perks Explained,"This short-lived partnership ended mid-2023.

In early 2021 American Airlines and JetBlue Airways launched a strategic alliance in the Northeast. The concept behind this partnership is that JetBlue has amazing connectivity in the Northeast and American wants to grow its long haul presence out of New York but needs connecting traffic.

As part of this collaboration the two airlines offer reciprocal perks for frequent flyers. This includes the ability to earn and redeem points as well as take advantage of elite perks when flying with the other airline. In this post I wanted to take an updated look at how those reciprocal elite perks work (and in a separate post I’ll cover reciprocal points earning and redemptions).

American AAdvantage elite benefits on JetBlue

American AAdvantage elite members receive select perks when flying with JetBlue. To take advantage of these perks just make sure you add your AAdvantage number to your reservation with JetBlue. It’s fine if you booked directly with JetBlue as long as your AAdvantage number is attached to the reservation.

AAdvantage elite members receive the following perks when flying with JetBlue (this applies to all elite tiers — Gold Platinum Platinum Pro and Executive Platinum — unless otherwise explicitly noted):

Priority check-in at the JetBlue Mosaic counter

Priority security with JetBlue’s Even More Speed feature

Priority boarding with JetBlue Mosaic members

Priority baggage handling (not for AAdvantage Gold members)

Two free checked bags weighing up to 50 pounds each (one free checked bag for AAdvantage Gold members)

Complimentary Even More Space seats within 24 hours of departure; these can be selected during the online check-in process or at the airport

Complimentary same-day switch flight change when your flight is marketed and operated by JetBlue (not for AAdvantage Gold and AAdvantage Platinum members)

Admirals Club members can access Admirals Clubs when flying JetBlue the same day

AAdvantage elites get Even More Space seats on JetBlue

JetBlue TrueBlue Mosaic benefits on American

JetBlue TrueBlue Mosaic members receive select perks when flying with American. To take advantage of these perks just make sure you add your TrueBlue number to your reservation with American. It’s fine if you booked directly with American as long as your TrueBlue number is attached to the reservation.

TrueBlue Mosaic elite members receive the following perks when flying with American:

Priority check-in with AAdvantage Gold members and/or business class

Priority security

Priority boarding (with Group 4)

Priority baggage handling

Two free checked bags weighing up to 50 pounds each

Complimentary Main Cabin Extra seats within 24 hours of departure; these can be selected during the online check-in process or at the airport

Complimentary same-day flight changes

JetBlue Mosaics get Main Cabin Extra seats on American

My take on the American & JetBlue partnership

Personally I’ve found the reciprocal elite perks between American and JetBlue to be extremely useful. As someone who usually flies with American the reality is that there are many routes where the airlines don’t overlap.

In the past I probably wouldn’t have flown JetBlue due to not having status but I’m happy to fly JetBlue when I can get free checked bags priority boarding complimentary Even More Space seats etc. I’d say this partnership is well executed in terms of the elite perks being offered.

Should we expect any further elite perks between the two airlines? At this point the only reciprocal elite perks potentially missing are the following:

JetBlue Mosaic members and American Executive Platinum members receive a free alcoholic drink in economy so perhaps that could be reciprocal on the other airline as well (though American offers complimentary alcohol in Main Cabin Extra while JetBlue doesn’t in Even More Space)

While I suppose anything is possible I highly doubt we’ll see reciprocal first class or Mint upgrades; JetBlue doesn’t offer Mosaic members Mint upgrades as an elite perk (well except as a temporary perk for those who overqualify) and I can’t imagine American would offer first class upgrades without reciprocity

The one potential upgrade perk I could see would be some systemwide upgrades for Mosaic members; I think this would be offered in a limited capacity and would be intended to encourage JetBlue Mosaic members to fly American long haul though there’s not much that JetBlue could offer reciprocally

I wouldn’t expect JetBlue Mint upgrades as part of this collaboration

Bottom line

American and JetBlue have a partnership and as part of that they offer reciprocal elite perks when flying with the other airline. This doesn’t just apply when you’re traveling on a multi-carrier or codeshare itinerary but also applies if you just directly book travel with the other airline.

With this you can expect perks like a free checked bag priority boarding extra legroom seating and much more. Personally I’m quite impressed by the execution of this partnership.

If you’ve taken advantage of the American and JetBlue partnership what was your experience with reciprocal elite perks?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vYWRhZ2UuY29tL2FydGljbGUvYWdlbmN5LW5ld3MvYWdlbmN5LW5ld3MteW91LW5lZWQta25vdy13ZWVrLXNlcHQtMi0yMDIyLzI0MjgwMjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Agency news you need to know week of Sept. 2 2022,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://adage.com/article/agency-news/agency-news-you-need-know-week-sept-2-2022/2428021 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vYWRhZ2UuY29tL2FydGljbGUvYWdlbmN5LW5ld3MvYWdlbmN5LW5ld3MteW91LW5lZWQta25vdy13ZWVrLXNlcHQtMi0yMDIyLzI0MjgwMjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1zdGFmZi1kaWRudC1sZXQtMDkwNTQxNTgyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines staff didn't let an unaccompanied minor buy food during a layover,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.yahoo.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/american-airlines-staff-didnt-let-090541582.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016711424B20>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1zdGFmZi1kaWRudC1sZXQtMDkwNTQxNTgyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vNmFiYy5jb20vYW1lcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMtc3RyYW5kZWQtaW4tYXJ1YmEtcGhpbGFkZWxwaGlhLWFpcnBvcnQtZmxpZ2h0cy8xMjE4NjgyMS_SAV9odHRwczovLzZhYmMuY29tL2FtcC9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1zdHJhbmRlZC1pbi1hcnViYS1waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEtYWlycG9ydC1mbGlnaHRzLzEyMTg2ODIxLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Philadelphians get stranded in Aruba for 3 days due to American Airline delays,"Right now there's only one flight daily to and from Aruba and Philadelphia International Airport.

PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- One hundred thirty-two passengers finally arrived in Philadelphia on Thursday after three days of delays in Aruba.

From mechanical problems to pilot shifts to malfunctioning air conditioning an entire American Airlines flight full of people have been trying to get home since Tuesday.

""We were just sitting at the gate every day"" explains Nicole Angelo from Washington Township. ""It would seem like we were about to board but then they would keep delaying us and delaying us until they canceled the flight. We've been stuck here stranded. There's nothing we could do. We've been totally in the hands of the airline.""

Nicole and Robert Angelo were in Aruba on their honeymoon.

Right now there's only one flight daily to and from Aruba at Philadelphia International Airport.

American Airlines tells Action News besides the accommodations and meal vouchers it provided it will also be giving all passengers ""good will compensation.""

Robert is a science teacher at Buena Regional High School. He was supposed to be teaching classes right now.

So many passengers were displaced and inconvenienced but spirits were high.

""I will tell you this much the group that we're with we're Philadelphians and we're figuring it out and we're coming together"" Robert says.

On Thursday the Department of Transportation debuted a brand new dashboard where you can find out what you are entitled to if your flight is delayed or canceled.

Each airline lists its rebooking options vouchers and hotel options to help passengers navigate the downside of travel.

Once again the root of the problem is communication.

American Airlines Mechanical Delay Made Far Worse By Lack Of Communication

On August 30 2022 AA957 set to take passengers from Miami (MIA) to Santiago (SCL) encountered a mechanical delay. The flight was operated by a Boeing 787-8. Passengers sat for hours onboard waiting for an update before the announcement was made that the flight would operate the following afternoon.

But the following afternoon even after passengers boarded the flight once again the mechanical issue on the same aircraft had not been resolved. A further delay ensued but this time it was even worse. Why? According to passenger accounts American Airlines totally kept them in the dark concerning the expected duration of the delay. To make matters worse the air conditioning was not turned up onboard causing extreme heat and even fainting onboard:

El avión quedó sin aire acondicionado y los pasajeros comenzaron a desmayarse cancelaron el vuelo nuevamente y sin solución y sin información @AmericanAir #miami #santiago pic.twitter.com/JdfE43smSn — Aventura de a dos (@aventuradeados_) August 31 2022

The flight ultimately took off more than 21 hours late.

We see a familiar theme with American Airlines namely a lack of communication. Delays are rarely pleasant but become far worse when passengers are not given the courtesy and respect of frequent updates even if there is no update. In the video above we do hear an update from the captain but it may be a bit late when passengers are already fainting.

Here we also have passengers sitting on a hot plane in the midst of summer in Miami. Was there no auxiliary power hooked up? How did the plane become so hot?

American Airlines has a lot of explaining to do but more importantly should look at this incident and the recent incident in Bermuda and realize it has a huge communication problem. It’s time to start being clear to passengers about the reason for delays.

CONCLUSION

Communication is key in any relationship. A lack of timely communication indicates a lack of respect. Here American Airlines made a mechanical delay much worse by failing to communicate with its passengers far more frequently even if it was simply “Folks sorry for the continued delay. Our mechanics are still working on the problem. We don’t know yet how long it will take.”

And amid the neighborhood pool parties and backyard barbeques residents are wondering what will break first: the heat or their power supply.

Extreme prolonged heat waves strain electric grids because everyone cranks their power-slurping air conditioners at the same time driving up energy demand. Meanwhile coal natural gas and nuclear power plants run less efficiently and have less capacity when temperatures are high. The strain on the electric grid this weekend is so worrying that the California Independent System Operator (ISO) which oversees the state’s power system is asking residents to not charge electric vehicles to set thermostats to 78°F or higher and to reduce overall energy use. The goal it says is to prevent energy shortages.

One thing that’s certainly not helping this situation is the region’s vanishing hydropower which makes up nearly a quarter of the region’s electric generation. While the whole Western U.S. is experiencing dry conditions the Southwest and California in particular is experiencing a two-decade megadrought that has severely crimped the state’s hydroelectric sources. As the below chart shows hydropower has dropped from about 15%-20% of California’s electricity in the early 2000s to only 7.5% last year.

Hydropower is generated by dammed reservoirs and when the reservoirs fall below a threshold the plant can no longer generate power. This can exacerbate the stress on the energy grid during extreme weather. “If you’re in the middle of a terrible drought and you have way less hydropower than normal that makes it harder to meet demand” says Jordan Kern an assistant professor in the College of Natural Resources at North Carolina State University. “But usually system operators have replacements. There’s going to be electricity that’s produced at natural gas plants. It’s dirtier it’s more expensive but it keeps the lights on.”

In California solar and other renewable sources have taken off in the last decade filling hydropower’s generation void. But renewables don’t have all the benefits of hydropower. A 2021 Department of Energy (DOE) report found that hydropower is a key contributor to overall grid reliability because it operates at all times of the day and can offer larger and longer-term storage than batteries. What’s more hydropower can very rapidly reboot the power grid after a blackout.

A 2019 DOE analysis found that hydropower—despite being only 10% of the country’s total generating capacity—provides about 40% of the country’s so-called “black start” resources that jump-start grid transmission and help switch on other generators following an outage. Solar photovoltaic and wind generators the report found “cannot be relied upon” to deliver in that way.

A U.S. government map of the U.S. from late August 2022 showing extreme and exceptional drought conditions in the Western half of the country. Drought.gov

Because of dry conditions that “threaten the availability” of hydropower the North American Electric Reliability Corporation said in May all U.S. areas that are part of the Western grid system are “at risk of energy emergencies.” That grid serves 80 million people across 14 states two Canadian provinces and a small area of northern Mexico.

Last summer Lake Oroville the second largest reservoir in California fell to minimum levels required for hydropower forcing the Hyatt Power Plant to stop running. It was the first time that happened since the plant became operational in 1967. What happened there could happen to other major reservoirs in the coming years. There’s a 10% chance that Lake Powell could fall below operational levels as soon as next year and a 30% chance by 2024 according to August projections from the Bureau of Reclamation. That reservoir straddles Arizona and Utah holding water for Glen Canyon Dam and typically supplies power to customers across Wyoming Utah Colorado New Mexico Arizona Nevada and Nebraska. Right now it is only about 25% full—its lowest-ever level since it was first filled.

Lake Mead another massive reservoir that sits further down the Colorado River system on the Nevada-Arizona border is 28% full. According to the same Bureau of Reclamation projections there’s a 23% chance its levels drop to 1000 feet by 2024 and a 7% chance that they drop to 950 feet by 2026—the point at which water would be too low to flow through the Hoover Dam’s pipes that intake water from the reservoir. The Hoover Dam’s power which is enough to serve 1.3 million people is allocated mostly to California but also Nevada and Arizona. “They may stop being able to produce electricity” says Kern of the two iconic dam structures. “That is something that people are increasingly concerned about.”

The below chart shows water levels across the Western reservoirs. Notably Lake Mead and Lake Powell are significantly below full and also well below where they’ve been for this time of year based on a 30-year average but many others are in similar conditions.

As summers grow longer and hotter due to climate change the U.S. grid will become more stressed. And in many states losing hydropower means relying more on fossil fuels which are contributing to climate change and worsening the dry conditions—a vicious paradoxical cycle.

Other countries plagued by drought are in a similar boat. Dry conditions in Sichuan Province China for example have hampered hydropower generation—accounting for 80% of the region’s electricity—and caused blackouts. Similar power strains have occurred across Europe this summer where low water levels have reduced hydropower along with making it harder to cool nuclear reactors and transport coal on rivers.

But conditions aren’t that dire in the U.S. this year. And experts like Jack Schmidt director of the Center for Colorado River Studies at Utah State University believes that hydropower shouldn’t be the focus of the wider drought problem. His perspective is that the country will find ways to fill the energy gaps. But there’s no easy solution if drinking water and irrigation water for agriculture are scarce.

The Jornada Se Acabaron Las Promesas social movement which organized the protest also demanded the withdrawal of the island’s Financial Oversight Board and the resignation of Governor Pedro Rafael Pierluisi.

Early Wednesday morning Jornada organized a peaceful roadblock with tires on a section of Luis Muñoz Rivera Avenue in front of the Seaborne building where the offices of the Financial Oversight Board (JCF) and the Energy Bureau (NEPR) are located. They shouted slogans such as “Get out LUMA get out Pierluisi get out the Board.” A few hours later the police moved in to clear the protesters from the road violently arresting twelve of them.

The arrested protesters were taken to the Hato Rey West police station. The movement through its Facebook account claimed that the lawyers of the arrested members were barred from meeting with their clients and condemned the police for violating the right to legal representation. The group called on Puerto Ricans to mobilize against the illegal arrests.

That evening dozens of people gathered outside the Hato Rey West police station and demonstrated until late. Demonstrators refused to leave the police station until their fellow comrades were released. After a few hours of peaceful picketing the arrested members were released.

The protest was the latest in the series of demonstrations that began last week against LUMA Energy. On August 25 26 and 27 thousands of Puerto Ricans took to the streets of San Juan demanding termination of the contract signed between the state Electric Power Authority (PREPA) and LUMA Energy over constant power blackouts and repeated increases in the electricity bill.

Protesters argued that since LUMA began operating in Puerto Rico on June 1 2021 the electricity services have worsened and outages have increased due to lack of maintenance while power rates have hiked at least seven times in a year.

Reportedly in recent weeks Puerto Ricans have been experiencing prolonged power outages at least twice a week in addition to voltage dips multiple times a week. The blackouts have damaged appliances that in turn have sparked fires which destroyed homes. A family recently lost their home after a generator exploded as they attempted to start it during a blackout. Multiple hospitals have been left in darkness after their generators malfunctioned.

People on the streets have demanded that the PREPA re-assume full control of the electric power system and gradually move toward a renewable electricity system.

In addition the protesters also demanded dissolution of the Financial Oversight Board in the wake of the implementation of numerous anti-people policies since its establishment six years ago. They also called for Governor Pierluisi’s resignation arguing that he has been supporting the neoliberal measures ignoring the urgent needs of the citizens since his election last year. They also condemned him for repeatedly defending LUMA.

Citizens denounced that since the establishment of the board in 2016 under the US federal law PROMESA (Puerto Rico Oversight Management and Economic Stability Act) the cost of water food and tolls have risen sharply. The people decried the privatization of the University of Puerto Rico highways beaches and other assets of the country. They also criticized the housing shortage due to overvaluation and displacement of communities to favor tourism. Puerto Ricans condemned the increase in corruption under the Pierluisi administration.

Slogans chanted since on the streets include “the contract is a robbery it is the people who pay for the robbery” “get out LUMA get out Pierluisi” “LUMA is the worst for the working class people” and “there will be no peace if LUMA doesn’t leave.”

“We hold the governor the Financial Oversight Board the Energy Bureau and the US government accountable for the energy crisis that the island is going through. More than a year ago it was warned that the LUMA contract would trigger a terrible social humanitarian and economic crisis. Today the blackouts and the incapacity of this company are our daily bread” said Jocelyn Velázquez the spokesperson of Jornada.

Velázquez called on the people to continue mobilizing. “We must take to the streets en masse so that the system understands that it is time to back down. That contract must be canceled and the displaced PREPA employees must return to their jobs to repair the mess caused by LUMA” he said.

On August 27 a group of 30 people associated with Jornada organized a cacerolazo against the private energy consortium in the Plaza Las Américas shopping center. A cacerolazo is a kind of protest in which people call attention by banging pots pans and other utensils. In the afternoon over two hundred citizens gathered on Fortaleza street to continue the peaceful protests demanding better electricity service and corruption-free governance. In the late evening protesters held another cacerolazo. At around 10 pm the situation had become tense when the police arrested a 16-year-old minor violently dragging him by his legs after he jumped past the barricades they had erected.

On August 25 the police violently repressed the protesters who marched to the governor’s office La Fortaleza to express their rejection of the inconveniences caused due to the chronic interruptions in the electricity service. The agents fired tear gas and pepper spray at the protesters and attacked them with batons in order to disperse them.

According to reports from Latino Rebels on the night of August 25 in addition to several protesters at least four other journalists were also attacked by police despite being duly identified as press. According to a police press conference on Friday four people were arrested at the protest.

On August 25 thousands of citizens including famous artists environmentalists political leaders social activists students teachers and workers from across sectors peacefully demonstrated on Fortaleza street in old San Juan. They held a cacerolazo sang and danced calling on the government to heed their demands.

Despite the repression on Thursday night hundreds of people continued demonstrating on Fortaleza street for the next two days."

Last night the Greatest of All Time lost to Ajla Tomljanović in the third round at the US Open.

Throughout the three-hour match the adoring New York City crowd roared in cheers for Williams as she showed again and again why she is the GOAT. But at the end Tomljanović who is considered 46th in the world beat Williams 7-6 6-7 6-1 in what would instantly become an iconic and bittersweet defeat.

In the last minute Williams hit a ball to the net giving Tomljanović her winning point. With tears streaming down her face the tennis pro put her hand over her heart and took in the crowd. In the stands fans including Bella Hadid Ciara Gayle King and Spike Lee clapped cheered and cried with her while giving her a standing ovation. Williams twirled her signature twirl and gave a final wave before stepping off the court to Tina Turner's ""Simply the Best.""

Harper's BAZAAR was among the attendees last night at the stadium's American Express Center Court Club where screens zoomed in on Williams as she gave an emotional post-match interview on the court.

""Oh my god thank you so much you guys were amazing today"" she said. ""Thank you Daddy I know you're watching. Thanks Mom. Thank you everyone that's here that's been on my side—so many years literally decades. But it all started with my parents and they deserve everything. So I'm really grateful for them.""

""These are happy tears I guess. I don't know"" she continued. ""And I wouldn't be Serena if there wasn't Venus so thank you Venus. She's the only reason Serena Williams ever existed ... It's been a fun ride. It's been the most incredible ride and journey I've ever been on.""

In her court interview Tomljanovic too praised Williams.

""I'm feeling really sorry just because I love Serena just as much as you guys do. And what she's done for me for the sport of tennis is incredible"" she said calling the moment—her first time passing the quarterfinals at any major—""surreal.""

""I just thought she would beat me. ... She's Serena. That's that's just who she is: She's the greatest of all time. Period"" Tomljanovic added.

American Express who is offering immersive tennis experiences and fine dining throughout the US Open for members in their Centurion suite spoke to BAZAAR about what it was like hosting fans for Williams's final match. ""Our Card Members know when they're with Amex they have access to life’s unforgettable and epic moments like last night’s history-making match. The energy in Arthur Ashe was off-the-charts and will certainly go down as a 'member when' experience for our Card Members"" they said.

Williams announced her retirement from tennis last month in an emotional essay published on Vogue in which she wrote candidly about the point she is at in her life—and the balancing act she plays every day trying to be both the world-renowned star athlete she is on the tennis court and the mom and wife her family needs her to be. She said that though it was not an easy choice to make she is ready for the next phase and looking forward to expanding her family.

""I don't want it to be over but at the same time I'm ready for what's next"" she wrote. ""I don't know how I'm going to be able to look at this magazine when it comes out knowing that this is it the end of a story that started in Compton California with a little Black girl who just wanted to play tennis. This sport has given me so much.""

""But I'm not looking for some ceremonial final on-court moment"" she added. ""I'm terrible at goodbyes the world's worst. But please know that I am more grateful for you than I can ever express in words. You have carried me to so many wins and so many trophies. I'm going to miss that version of me that girl who played tennis. And I'm going to miss you.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vbWlsZXNvcGVkaWEuY29tL2VuL2d1aWRlL2VsZWN0cm9uaWMtbXVzaWMtZmVzdGl2YWxzLXVzZS1yZXdhcmQtcG9pbnRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Electronic music festivals: How to save money with reward points,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='milesopedia.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /en/guide/electronic-music-festivals-use-reward-points/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016710FCE0E0>, 'Connection to milesopedia.com timed out.

The crowding is apparently so bad at the Terminal 4 Delta SkyClub in New York (JFK) that passengers are being fed while waiting in line to get in.

Delta Feeding Passengers As They Brave Long Lines To Enter Delta SkyClub Lounge (Hilarious Crowding…)

As usual the lines to get into the Terminal 4 Delta SkyClub at JFK are horrible:

Wowza – just leaving but this is the current line to get into the @delta #SkyClub at JFK. pic.twitter.com/33eNx56zi4 — Jonathan Jacobs (@JonEJacobs) September 2 2022

But this caught my eye…apparently Delta is bringing snacks outside the club while people are waiting.

I had a similar experience on Sunday. It moved pretty quickly though and they brought some snacks from the club while we were waiting. I was surprised how easy it was to find a seat once I got inside tbh — Zach Wichter (@zlwichter) September 2 2022

I’m not so sure that’s a great idea since it might encourage even more people to get in line including some who will indulge in the snacks knowing they will be turned away when they reach the front of the line. It seems like almost every time I use an airport lounge I see people being turned away. Airlines like Delta should do a better job of having a “line monitor” letting people know that domestic first class tickets or American Express Gold cards do not include lounge access.

There is no ultimate end in sight to this lounge crowding as both Delta and American Express continue to market co-branded cards that come with lounge access and of course the American Express Platinum card also comes with SkyClub access when flying on Delta.

The good news for crowding is that after Labor Day we should see a drop in travel which will result in fewer travelers at airports across the nation. Flights might not feel any different because carriers will offer reduced schedules during the winter season but I do not expect airports and lounges to be quite as crowded.

That said the bottlenecks will continue at certain lounges like the JFK SkyClub in Terminal 4. This daily occurrence of long lines is a clear sign that Delta must find more to expand its lounge operations.

CONCLUSION

Poor Delta poor us…the lounge crowding is so bad that apparently the airline is feeding passengers while they are waiting to get in! As we enter the shoulder season let’s hope this problem becomes less prevalent. But if you’re looking for a “free” snack at JFK well…

""The inception of the height idea came about when we were shooting Final Score at a stadium in the UK"" he explains during an exclusive interview with RadioTimes.com. ""We were filming at height and off camera we got into this interesting conversation about height and the fear of falling and how that's inside of all of us really and how that can be a great device for a movie.

""I think the key to it was finding these actual towers that exist in America that exist in the desert there it was just like that is the perfect location the perfect kind of character to be at the centre of this nutty thing.""

More like this

The first port of call for the team was choosing a specific location to be the centerpiece of the film and after much consideration they eventually opted for the abandoned B67 TV tower in California – the fourth-highest structure in the US.

""We looked at buildings we looked at different things and mountains and whatnot and ultimately we came across the tower"" Mann explains. ""And we just realised there was so many of them out there – and the height of these things they're all 2000 ft and above. And it got us excited it genuinely did.""

But of course while they could use the real tower itself for establishing shots the bulk of production would have to take place elsewhere – and Mann and his team spent several weeks researching how best to shoot the movie.

During this process they went through various options – including briefly toying with the idea of using the same techniques used in Disney Plus Star Wars series The Mandalorian which makes use of a ground-breaking curved LED screen backdrop on which digital environments are displayed. Ultimately though Mann was determined to do things practically.

""I knew from the start I didn't want to do it green screen"" he said. ""And then that led us down the Mandalorian route because that's a much more immersive way to shoot people in a studio. But even then when it comes down to it to put people in these conditions – like height has a certain kind of air light wind and all these elements going on that are very hard to fake.

""And I think if we'd shot it in a studio it'd be like a $50 to $100 million movie – and that movie just doesn't exist today with non-IP characters. So it was a case of stripping right back and saying 'Okay well how do we do this for real?' And it was [producer] James Harris who was really pushing and saying you need to shoot this for real Mac the DP also loved the idea.""

And so in the end they decided to build the upper portion of the tower on top of a mountain – which due to its height and positioning would mean that the actors would really appear to be thousands of feet in the air.

""It became a mission to find the right location at height – and that was quite drawn out"" Mann says of the next steps. ""We scoured all around California and it was during COVID so we'd just drive and drive and drive to these random remote locations to try and get access. A lot of them had kind of radio masts and things at the top of these mountains and you're just finding the right kind of top of a mountain with the right cliff and the right sunlight positioning.""

In the end though it was thanks to the wonders of modern technology that the team found their eventual spot with the location manager finding what looked to be the ideal place while searching on Google Maps.

""So we went up this rickety road"" Mann explains. ""James is scared of heights and was screaming at me because he was afraid of even the journey up there – but we got up there and saw this huge drop-off and it was just stunning.

""And then from there we basically had to do logistical work of widening out the roads so cars and things could get access. And then getting the tower – the guys who built the actual tower out in Arizona also built our tower.

""They built these 100-foot sections at the top of this mountain cliff thing. And so basically we were actually above 2000 ft so all the kinds of camera work and things to capture the movie [stars] Virginia [Gardner] and Grace [Caroline Curry] were really immersed into what it was like to be up there – because they really were up there!""

It's no surprise that shooting in such a remote location – and at such a towering height – brought up all sorts of other problems. But Mann says he was taken aback at the ""biblical"" proportions of some of the issues they faced and he hopes that some behind-the-scenes clips will soon surface showing just how difficult the shoot was.

Grace Fulton in Fall Signature Entertainment

""I've made a few films and it's always hard"" he says. ""I would say it's a struggle to make a film at the best of times. But this one it was like just getting to set every day was like a Bear Grylls Adventure. And then we had all these things happen to us with lightning hurricanes – we had our set blown down one time.""

And there was one incident in particular that stood out to Mann – one which makes it easy to see where the biblical comparison was coming from.

""It was raining hot rain and melting the set dressing"" he said. ""And then that caused the locusts or ants whatever they are that were in the mountain to kind of come up and hide somewhere inside the tubing of our set. So when Virginia and Grace got there the next day the thing wobbled and suddenly this cloud of flying ants came about – and we just couldn't film because there was this huge cloud of flying ants for hours.

""And they would then settle back in the tube and you'd try and climb up and they'd release again. And it was this cycle. And you're out in the middle of nowhere so like how do you deal with that kind of problem you know? In the end I had to strap a leaf blower backwards and hoover into a bag to get rid of like 8 million of these things!""

Virginia Gardner & Grace Fulton in Fall Signature Entertainment

Although conditions like these might have prompted some people to curse their luck Mann and his team took a different tack – instead deciding to use them to their advantage.

""When you end up leaning into them a little bit like the weather and all these things that's what we learned to do"" he says. ""It was like the rhythm of nature you can either fight it or go with it. And I think we went with it and at whatever point we went with it it paid off for us.

""And we just said let's not try and get it the way we thought we wanted it. Let's just get it. And like whatever is happening let's just play into it for the movie – and I'm glad we did because it kind of gives a different flavour to the different parts of the movie.""

Hanzman’s Miami courtroom this summer the judge’s aides would stock the judge’s bench the lawyers’ tables and the witness stand with boxes of tissues. At some point they knew almost everyone would cry and each excruciating presentation would end with Judge Hanzman offering people hugs.

The hearings in the civil case over the deadly collapse last year of a beachfront condominium tower in Surfside Fla. gave survivors and victims’ families a chance to seek financial compensation for their enormous losses. But those involved in the proceedings also describe them as far more meaningful — something akin to catharsis — which they credit to the extraordinary handling of a case born out of calamity.

After five weeks of lengthy and emotional hearings the court issued letters in late August informing survivors and victims’ families of how much they would receive in damages from a settlement of more than $1 billion with insurance companies the developers of an adjacent building and other defendants. Individual awards ranged from $50000 for some post-traumatic stress disorder claims to more than $30 million for some wrongful death claims Judge Hanzman said in an interview this week.

“I don’t think I have shed as many tears in my 61 years as much as I have throughout the last five weeks” he said."

Although the combination improved median progression-free survival (PFS) by almost 6 months (14.3 vs 8.5 months) the difference did not achieve statistical significance (P=0.13). Median overall survival (OS) had yet to be reached in the combination arm as compared with a median of 49.2 months with pembrolizumab and placebo (P=0.74).

Analyses involving three prespecified subgroups -- U.S. patients patients with lower baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and those with smaller baseline tumor volume -- all favored the combination Jason A. Chesney MD PhD of the University of Louisville Brown Cancer Center in Kentucky and colleagues wrote in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

""Although the combination of T-VEC-pembrolizumab did not result in OS benefit compared with placebo-pembrolizumab in the frontline treatment of advanced melanoma this combination is still under active investigation in patients who are refractory to anti-PD-1 inhibitor therapy for melanoma and other tumor types"" the authors noted in their concluding comments.

The MASTERKEY-265 trial included a phase Ib single-arm study that evaluated the pembrolizumab-T-VEC combination in 21 patients with advanced melanoma. The results showed an objective response rate (ORR) of 62% including complete responses (CRs) in 43% of the patients. The results supported the decision to proceed with a phase III randomized trial to compare pembrolizumab plus T-VEC versus pembrolizumab and placebo.

MASTERKEY-265 probably provided a patient population more similar to real-world clinical practice said Jeffrey Weber MD PhD of NYU Langone Health in New York City who wasn't involved with the study.

""As they say in the U.K. 'there's been many a slip twixt cup and lip' and the phase III population was a better assessment of a real world population in which there was likely a higher disease burden and thus less chance for an inflamed tumor to have an impact on the remaining disease"" Weber told MedPage Today via email.

The finding that lower-risk patients -- lower baseline LDH and disease burden -- benefited more from the combination support that viewpoint he added.

The phase III trial limited enrollment to patients with previously untreated histologically confirmed stage IIIB-IV M1c unresectable melanoma. Investigators in 21 countries randomized 692 patients 1:1 to the two treatment arms which had well-balanced baseline characteristics.

The trial had dual primary endpoints of PFS and OS. Median follow-up to the primary PFS analysis was 25.58 months and 31 months for the primary OS analysis.

The 5.8-month difference in median PFS in favor of the combination represented a 14% reduction in the risk for progression or death (95% CI 0.71-1.04).

About 23% of patients were enrolled in the U.S. A prespecified analysis of that subgroup revealed a 41% reduction in the hazard in favor of the combination (95% CI 0.37-0.92). Results also favored the combination for patients with baseline LDH at or below the upper limit of normal (HR 0.76 95% CI 0.59-0.99) and patients with baseline sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of target lesions at or below the median value (HR 0.70 95% CI 0.51-0.96).

The OS analysis yielded a hazard ratio of 0.96 for the combination versus placebo (95% CI 0.76-1.22). In contrast to the PFS results analysis of the prespecified subgroups did not show improvement in OS with the combination.

Tumor response to treatment was a secondary endpoint. The ORR CR and durable response rate were 48.6% 17.9% and 42.2% with the combination respectively and 41.3% 11.6% and 34.1% with pembrolizumab-placebo.

Adverse events were consistent with the know side effects of T-VEC and pembrolizumab. Grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in 20.7% of patients in the combination arm and 19.5% of patients in the placebo group.

In their discussion the authors reviewed several possible explanations for the lack of significant benefit with pembrolizumab-T-VEC. They suggested that the pivotal trial that led to FDA approval of T-VEC probably included patients with less aggressive disease characteristics. Additionally the administration schedule for T-VEC was modified in MASTERKEY-265 to align with pembrolizumab dosing.

The difference in PFS among U.S.-enrolled patients probably reflected the larger number of U.S. patients with LDH ≤ the upper limit of normal and lower SLD as compared with non-U.S. patients.

MASTERKEY-265 had a low incidence of pseudoprogression as compared with the pivotal trial that led to T-VEC approval. The lower rate of pseudoprogression approximated the rate observed with single-agent pembrolizumab.

The authors also noted that the control arm performed better as compared with historical data with single-agent pembrolizumab. For example the 2-year OS for pembrolizumab-placebo was 66% as compared with 58% and 60% respectively in the KEYNOTE-006 and KEYNOTE-001 trials.

The results of MASTERKEY-265 should be sufficient to end the evaluation of T-VEC with immune checkpoint inhibitors said Weber.

""I thought it was a well done study. They definitively answered the question of whether T-VEC added to the benefit of PD-1 blockade"" he said. ""Not that it's a limitation but pembro is a very effective drug so doing better set a high bar.""

But Thursday the world’s largest privately owned pharma became the first company to score an FDA approval to treat generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) a rare and life-threatening skin condition that causes eruptions of painful blisters. These GPP flares are so disruptive to the system that they can trigger heart failure renal failure or sepsis.

The nod is for BI’s antibody drug Spevigo. The IL-36 receptor inhibitor is also under review in Europe and a decision is expected before the end of this year. It is the first dermatology approval for the German firm.

With the FDA blessing BI beat AnaptysBio to the punch in GPP. The San Diego company also has an IL-36 drug imsidolimab in development and phase 3 results are due by the end of next year.

BI also is conducting a trial of Spevigo as a maintenance treatment to prevent flares. In addition the company is investigating its effectiveness against other skin diseases such as palmoplantar pustulosis and hidradenitis suppurativa.

Supporting the GPP approval was a phase 2 trial of 53 patients with flares. Of those treated with Spevigo 54% were clear of their skin pustules compared to 6% for placebo. Spevigo's protection sustained for 12 weeks.

GPP is caused by an accumulation of neutrophils a type of white blood cell in the skin. It causes eruptions of pustules and red inflamed skin all over the body. Because it is so rare the condition is under-diagnosed and often mistaken for other skin disorders.

Doctors have typically treated GPP off-label with drugs such as AbbVie’s Skyrizi Novartis’ Cosentyx Amgen’s Enbrel Johnson & Johnson’s Tremfya and a host of others.

This is largely due to numerous factors that could contribute to errors and thus poor DPD performance. Even after hardware is set up properly it may still be challenging to pinpoint the correct parameters to fine-tune DPD and obtain the optimal solution.

This article aims to help engineers who use the DPD option in the ADRV9002. It also includes some typical issues often encountered by a user as well as providing some general strategies on fine-tuning a DPD model with the available parameters to obtain optimal DPD performance.

The device also includes a MATLAB tool to help users analyze DPD. This should help eliminate many common mistakes and provide some insights on the internal DPD operations. What’s presented here will help users get started with DPD and provide useful information on both theoretical concepts and resolving practical issues.

The ADRV9002 offers up to 20-MHz signal bandwidth when enabling the DPD option. This is due to the receiving bandwidth being limited to 100 MHz. Typically DPD will operate with a receiving bandwidth 5X the transmitter bandwidth so that the third and fifth intermodulation signals can be seen and corrected.

The highest PA peak power signal supported by the ADRV9002 is around the 1-dB (commonly known as P-1dB) compression region. This metric indicates the severity of PA compression. If the PA is compressed beyond the P-1dB point it’s not guaranteed that DPD will work properly. However this isn’t a strict requirement. As we have seen in many cases DPD works over the P-1dB point and still provides very good ACPR. It’s going to be a case-by-case investigation though.

In general if the compression is too severe DPD can potentially run into instability and crash issues. We will discuss more about the compression region in later sections including how to observe the current PA compression status using the MATLAB tool.

More details on DPD can be found in Analog Devices’ UG-1828 User Guide in the “Digital Predistortion” chapter.

Architecture

There are two basic approaches to perform the DPD function. The first is called an indirect DPD where a signal is captured before and after the PA. This differs from the direct DPD approach in which a signal is taken before the DPD block and after the PA. The advantages and disadvantages of each are beyond the scope of this article.

Indirect DPD looks at the signal before and after the PA to learn its nonlinear behavior and does the reverse on the DPD block. Direct DPD looks at the signal before DPD and after the PA and eliminates the error between the two by applying predistortion on the DPD block. Users should know that the ADRV9002 uses the indirect approach and the implications that are associated with it. It’s also important to know when using the MATLAB tool capture data also refers to the indirect approach.

Figure 2 shows a high-level DPD operation block diagram for the ADRV9002. Input signal u(n) goes into the DPD block. DPD will predistort the signal and generate x(n). Here we call this transmit capture although it’s really the predistorted version of the transmit signal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2RhcS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvbmV3LWZ1dHVyZXMtY29udHJhY3QtZW1wb3dlcnMtaW52ZXN0b3JzLXRvLWdhaW4tb3ItaGVkZ2UtZXhwb3N1cmUtdG8tc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3RvctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Futures Contract Empowers Investors to Gain or Hedge Exposure to Semiconductor Subsector,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.nasdaq.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/new-futures-contract-empowers-investors-to-gain-or-hedge-exposure-to-semiconductor (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000167120EBC40>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2RhcS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvbmV3LWZ1dHVyZXMtY29udHJhY3QtZW1wb3dlcnMtaW52ZXN0b3JzLXRvLWdhaW4tb3ItaGVkZ2UtZXhwb3N1cmUtdG8tc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3RvctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8wMi9sYXRlci1jYW0tYnJpbmdzLXRoZS1ub3N0YWxnaWEtb2YtYW5hbG9nLXBob3RvZ3JhcGh5LXRvLXlvdXItc21hcnRwaG9uZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bring the nostalgia of analog photography to your smartphone,"Photo-sharing app Dispo brought back the nostalgia of an analog camera by letting people see the images they snap a day later. Now a new company called Later Cam wants to create similar magic by not just offering an analog-like photo-taking experience but also by delivering prints of those one-take photos.

The idea is simple: Users can pick a “disposable camera” style in the Later Cam app through the “Digital Disposable” mode then take up to 27 photos. Like an old-school camera you don’t get to see previews after snapping or edit those images. However users will have the option to use the old-school or full-screen viewfinder (as shown in the image below) and can switch between different lenses or turn the flash on and off.

Users can also invite their friends through the “party cam” feature by sending them a link to the shared camera. Friends can install the app through that link and take photos of an event with a collective limit of 27 photos.

As users snap photos the Later Cam app will display the number of photos you have left through a counter on the camera interface just like a disposable camera would offer. But you can’t see the “developed” digital images until three days after you’ve snapped all 27 photos. People can opt to use the “Develop early” option to see the photos before they finish the reel but then they will lose the unused slots in that camera. If they are trying out the digital disposable camera mode — the free option where you don’t pay upfront — that doesn’t really matter.

Paying users can get the photos they like printed and shipped to their homes. This could be ideal for a birthday party or a reunion where everyone wants to have physical memories of the event.

The company charges $3.99 for five photos $5.99 for 10 $8.99 for 17 and $12.99 for all 27 photos to be printed. Later Cam also offers a wedding package of 270 photos for $149 which allows attendees to scan QR codes from wedding invites and take photos of the event which are shipped to the people getting married at a later date. Shipping is free in the U.S. and the company said it’s exploring different models to send the photos overseas. Users can also choose to download photos on their phones but where’s the fun in that?

The startup was founded by Alex Cook who got this idea from his other startup called NanaGram. That service let you and your family members send photos over text messages which the firm later prints out and then sends to the elderly members in the family who may not have smartphones. He was inspired to build Later Cam after noticing that many supermarkets were still selling disposable cameras at $25 a pop and thought it would be fun to bring that experience to users’ phones at a cheaper price.

After interviewing some early users of Later Cam during testing Cook added an O.G. Print Disposable mode — where you pay the price for a set of 5 10 17 or 27 photos upfront and see them the first time directly when they arrive in prints arrive in the email — before the public launch.

Currently the app has only one film filter that gives photos a slightly vintage grainy look. Cook said that he’s exploring different filters for when you’re snapping a picture.

“Our camera phones are obviously far more convenient and since our phones are pretty much always with us we take more photos. We used to have to wait in anticipation now we snap ten photos of the same thing to get the perfect one. As we’ve made the transition from analog to digital we’ve sacrificed magic for the sake of convenience. Later Cam is bringing back some of the magic” Cook said in an email conversation with TechCrunch.

The Later Cam app is available on both iOS and Android. While the company is aiming to push more customers to print their photos it will definitely draw a comparison with Dispo whose founder David Dobrik faced sexual assault allegations last year and then exited the company.

Dobrik played a huge role in marketing Dispo to the masses and without him the company’s path to becoming a mainstream social media app is blurry. With new social networks like BeReal finding success Dispo’s numbers are already on a downward curve. According to data by analytics firm Apptopia Dispo has been downloaded 1.64 million times this year till August — a 26% drop from the same time period year-on-year; the app has 7.32 million lifetime downloads.",,,,,,

“When I transplant seedlings they die out. The salt is still in the soil” said the farmer from Slab Ta Aon village a riverside settlement roughly 150 kilometers southwest of Cambodia’s capital Phnom Penh and 4 kilometers from the green mangrove-lined coast of Kampot province.

The farmer said that saltwater has destroyed rice paddies in Slab Ta Aon village for the past two years. Prak Nhorn 55 doubts that he and the other villagers will be able grow rice in the future.

Slab Ta Aon’s problem is no environmental fluke. It is an omen of a global environmental crisis that has been brewing for decades destabilizing food systems that feed millions.

Around the world saltwater is seeping further and further inland from the coasts tainting soils and fresh water with salt. A complicated interplay between groundwater extraction river damming for hydropower and riverbed mining is sinking shorelines as climate change raises the seas drawing seawater inland.

River deltas are especially vulnerable. Fan-shaped plains that form where rivers spill into the sea deltas often boast fertile soils thanks to nutrient-rich sediments delivered from upstream. Increasing salinity puts these special agricultural regions at risk.

The threat is perhaps most grave in Asia where vast “megadeltas” are vital for growing the continent’s staple crop — rice. High salinity can make it impossible to grow rice.

“You really see a solid layer … a white layer on the soil from where saltwater was” said Bjoern Ole Sander of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). Rice plants growing in saline soil “look like straw” he continued. “If you touch them they’re hollow. There’s nothing.”

Food drinking water at risk

In Southeast Asia saltwater threatens rice paddies in the Mekong River and Red River deltas in Vietnam and the deltas of the Chao Phraya River in Thailand and the Ayeyarwady River in Myanmar.

In South Asia it degrades soils and taints drinking water in the densely populated Ganges–Brahmaputra Delta of Bangladesh and India and the Indus Delta of Pakistan.

China’s Yangtze River Delta also faces rising salinity.

Beyond Asia saltwater intrusion affects the Nile Delta in Egypt and the Mississippi Delta in the United States — both important agricultural regions.

For subsistence farmers like Prak Nhorn rising salinity directly threatens food security and access to drinking water. About 76% of Cambodians live in rural areas and many depend on natural resources for food. This makes many of the country’s 17.2 million inhabitants vulnerable to changes in the environment. Undernutrition rates in Cambodia hover around 15%.

Cambodian farmers have reported issues with salinity for years and “there is saltwater intrusion” in the country said Hak Mao director of Cambodia’s Climate Change Department at the Ministry of Environment. But “limited technical capacity” means the true extent of the problem in Cambodia is not known he said.

In neighboring Vietnam however the costs of saltwater intrusion have been clear for decades.

“If there’s fresh water we can grow rice all year round” said farmer Khau Van Ngoan of Vietnam’s Long An province. “If there’s none nothing can be grown.”

Vietnam grows more than half of its rice in one region — the Mekong River Delta.

There salinity has “really been on the rise” said hydrologist Gijs Simons of FutureWater a consultancy that uses satellite data to assess salinity for the Mekong River Commission (MCR). The area affected by severe salinity which makes it nearly impossible to grow rice has roughly “doubled since the '90s or even almost tripled for some years” he said.

In the past saltwater would seep about 30-50 kilometers inland. Now it can reach areas more than 100 kilometers inward from the coast said hydrologist Binh Doan Van of the Vietnamese-German University who studies saltwater intrusions in the Mekong River Delta. One particularly severe salinity intrusion in 2016 affected 270000 hectares of rice said Andrew Wyatt who oversees projects in Southeast Asia for the environmental organization International Union for Conservation of Nature or IUCN. The damage totaled an estimated $455 million or 1.5% percent of Vietnam’s annual rice yield.

Shrimp alternative

But it’s possible to see rising salinity as an opportunity rather than a disaster.

Rice can’t tolerate salty water but shrimp can — and shrimp fetch a better price than the rice Vietnam produces for export to low- and middle-income countries.

“Shrimp is better business than rice. It’s more lucrative” said Dang Thi Vich a shrimp farmer from Ben Tre province.

Some farmers in the Mekong River Delta took advantage of this as salinity rose growing shrimp instead of rice during the dry season when conditions are most saline. The Vietnamese government and NGOs later launched programs to help more farmers adopt this rice-shrimp rotation system.

“Shrimp farming began about some 20 years ago and it’s become very popular” said Vich. “Everyone grew rice before that.”

Things are changing fast. In 2018 15% of farmers in the delta gave up rice farming for something else usually shrimp farming said Bradford Mills an economist at Virginia Tech who studied the switch. The next year another 10% stopped growing rice. Simons noted that the shift from rice paddies to shrimp ponds is visible in his satellite data.

Experts say the Vietnamese government plans to scale back rice farming and diversify the Mekong River Delta’s economy. This will mean upping shrimp and other aquaculture along the coast and growing “high quality” rice for export to rich countries. This diversification “is in line with Vietnam's move from a low-income country to a middle-low-income country” said Wyatt.

But researchers have expressed concerns that adaptions to rising salinity in Vietnam are coming at a social cost widening the gap between rich and poor.

“For the country scale [shrimp farming] may be good” said Binh. “But for [the] local scale for individuals that's I think [it] still has some problems.”

Ben Tre province farmer Nguyen Thi Be Lieu said she tried shrimp farming a couple of years ago “but business didn’t take off. We spent more than we earned so we stopped.”

Switching from rice to shrimp aquaculture is risky. Not everyone can afford to. Those who can’t — and who don’t receive aid — can have no choice but to sell or lease their land and migrate to find work.

There’s also evidence that shrimp aquaculture isn’t always environmentally sustainable. While Wyatt noted that rice-shrimp rotation is more sustainable than farming rice or shrimp exclusively for lands at the mouth of the Mekong it isn’t a good solution everywhere it is being adopted. If there’s not enough freshwater flow from upstream dry-season shrimp ponds can leave salt in the soil which over time makes it hard to grow rice at all in the wet season. Ponds can get so salty that even shrimp can’t survive.

“Saline soil is bad for business even shrimp farming” said Long An province farmer Pham Van Bay. “There’s absolutely nothing you can do with saline soil.”

Aquaculture can also pollute waterways a problem Binh says should be managed to ensure that it stays sustainable and profitable for the future.

Still if these challenges can be overcome sating wealthy countries’ appetites for shrimp and high-quality rice could pay off for many farmers and the Vietnamese economy as a whole said Binh and Wyatt.

‘How can we have rice to eat?’

The question said Sander “is of course: where do you produce the rice instead? Because demand is still there. And shrimp cannot replace rice on people's plates.”

Vietnam is the third-biggest rice exporter worldwide and more than 90% of its exports come from the Mekong River Delta. Countries that are “big rice importers … are hit also by climate change impacts and salinity impacts in the Mekong Delta” said Sander. For instance the Philippines imports nearly 80% of its rice from Vietnam.

Demand for rice is increasing as the world population grows. IRRI estimates that rice production globally needs to increase by 1% to 1.2% every year to keep rice prices low enough to be affordable for billions of people who depend on the grain.

For the Mekong River Delta Binh said that adapting to rising salinity involves a combination of pricey infrastructure to keep saltwater out — which can come with its own environmental problems — and changes to how people live and work like adopting rice-shrimp systems. Other agricultural deltas face similar choices.

Countries that import a lot of rice from salinity-affected regions will need to find new sources to meet their growing demand for rice or consumers will simply pay more for it. Many farmers will need to adapt. And some will just need to find a way to survive.

Suos Sovann lives just a stone’s throw away from Prak Nhorn’s farm in Slab Ta Aon village. She is a rice farmer — or was. Saltwater now floods her 7000-square-meter farm every year making her soil infertile.

Unable to grow rice for herself and her family Suos Sovann now depends on money sent by two of her children who work in a nearby garment factory. Combined they send her about $50 every month. She will spend $30 of it on rice.

She wonders if perhaps her children could send more money but she doesn’t dare ask. There’s nothing to do but bear with it she says.

""If we don’t farm"" asked Suos Sovann ""how can we have rice to eat?”

The iPhone 14 lineup is expected to include four models: a standard and Pro version at 6.1 inches and a Max and Pro Max version at 6.7 inches each. The higher-end models are expected to cost $100 more than 2021's lineup. The standard iPhone 13 started at $799 while the iPhone 13 Pro Max started at $1099.

Although macroeconomic issues that have gripped the tech world are expected to weigh on Apple as well analysts believe that there is enough pent-up demand from consumers to upgrade their devices to pave the way for the iPhone 14 to become yet another smashing success for the company.

""Apple's growth story remains well intact with clear momentum around iPhone 14 around the corner despite the shaky macro"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a research note.

Anticipation around the phone has impacted Apple's stock which is up more than 15% in the last two months. The company's shares year-to-date have consistently outperformed the tech-heavy Nasdaq index.

Changes for iPhone 14

The new iPhone 14 line is expected to ditch the notch at the top of the display in favor of a punch-hole for the front camera and Face ID system. This change would allow for a more useful status bar at the top of the display said Ken Hyers director for emerging device strategies at Strategy Analytics.

However the most significant move Apple is anticipated to make with the iPhone 14 line is including the current-generation A15 Bionic chipset in the base model of the phone while reserving the new A16 chip for the high-end Pro models Hyers said.

While not upgrading the processor of a new iPhone would be a first for Apple the move would allow the company to alleviate supply chain issues while keeping the bill of material costs down.

""This is a very smart decision by Apple as retaining the A15 chip should smooth out supply issues that typically impact the company in the latter half of the year when they introduce a new iPhone model"" Hyers said.

Apple is likely to skip a mini version of the iPhone 14 due to anemic sales of previous models said Angelo Zino a senior equity analyst at CFRA Research.

""After absolutely dismal sales of previous mini versions Apple is placing increasing emphasis on larger screens that possess higher price points"" Zino said. ""Dropping the mini from the iPhone lineup in favor of the Max will naturally increase the average selling price across Apple's platform.""

Softening sales

The second quarter was rife with issues that took a toll on device sales around the globe. Component shortages continued to linger while macroeconomic factors such as currency exchange headwinds led to lower overall consumer demand.

Despite its market dominance Apple was not immune to the pressures and saw its total second-quarter product shipments decline 1.1% year over year according to estimates by Kagan a media research group within S&P Global Market Intelligence.

While every Apple product segment tracked by Kagan was either flat or down year over year iPhone shipments still managed to grow 5% to 47.5 million in the second quarter.

Apple reported iPhone net sales of $40.67 billion in the June quarter up 2.8% year over year. However the growth rate was significantly lower than the 49.8% reported in the prior-year quarter.

Looking forward

Wedbush projected that Apple placed an initial order of 90 million iPhone 14 units out of the gate roughly flat compared to the iPhone 13.

""While the softer macro will clearly play a role in the demand story we believe the baseline for 220 million iPhone units in FY23 is likely a low bar given the pent-up demand story that we are seeing globally for Apple"" Ives said.

CFRA forecast sales growth of between 0% and 3% for iPhones in the fiscal-year period ending September 2023 mainly due to macro uncertainty and headwinds that are weighing on the smartphone space. However the firm also estimated the average selling price for the next cycle would increase about 3% driven by expected price increases for the higher-end phones.

""We do see a possibility for Apple to increase the price of its two higher-end Pro devices given the greater upgrade capabilities that this device offers versus prior generations coupled with the natural inflationary environment that would make such a move acceptable by consumers"" Zino said.

Given the more challenging macroeconomic backdrop Zino thinks that Apple increasing the price of its standard iPhone is unlikely.

Apple Watch

Apple is also expected to unveil new Apple Watch models at the Sept. 7 event. The new Series 8 watch will have no major changes to the aesthetics but will have minor updates to the internals including a new ""S8"" chip Zino said.

At the low end Apple will provide minor updates to the Apple Watch SE and the company is likely to announce that it will no longer sell the lower-priced Series 3 watch according to the analyst.

""This natural move should help boost the average selling price for the Apple Watch along with the company's intent to unveil a new high-end watch"" Zino said.

The new higher-end model will likely target extreme sports enthusiasts with an expected larger display longer battery life and a more shatter-resistant screen.

""Under the assumption that this device will go on sale for $800 or more we expect unit sales and demand for the product to be minimal"" Zino said.

New versions of the iPad tablet are expected to be announced in October. Apple's new augmented and virtual reality headsets are not expected to show up at the September event.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA5LTAyL3NlbGYtZHJpdmluZy1jZW8tZmxvYXRzLXBvc3NpYmxlLXNhbGUtdG8tYXBwbGUtb3ItbWljcm9zb2Z00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Self-Driving Tech Company Floats Possible Sale to Apple or Microsoft,"Why did this happen?

Strategic Vision just released the results of an annual study that this year reached 200000 new-vehicle owners. For the first time the consulting firm included Apple among the more than 45 brands it surveyed consumers about.

The findings: 26 percent said they would ""definitely consider"" buying a set of wheels from the iPhone maker behind only Toyota and Honda. And 24 percent ticked the top box (""I love it"") when asked their impression of the brand's quality beating all others by a wide margin.

That's serious brand power and suggests there would be significant appetite for autos alongside all those phones computers watches and television boxes.

Whether Tim Cook will actually green-light a product for all these prospective buyers is still unclear.

""We'll see what Apple does"" the tech giant's CEO told the New York Times last year. ""We investigate so many things internally. Many of them never see the light of day.""

Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has reported Apple is shooting for a fully autonomous electric car and aims to have one ready around 2025. Many companies working on self-driving technology have been unable to deploy robotaxis on the timelines they targeted and only a handful are offering ride services in select cities.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration keeps having to remind Americans that no vehicle available for purchase today is capable of driving itself.

Autonomous or not an Apple car could be a formidable force especially given how much tech consumers want in their new vehicles and the challenges incumbents have had meeting those expectations.

Cook employs legions of coders capable of developing the brains a modern electric vehicle needs to manage battery power and navigate traffic. The company also owns all sorts of content that could be piped into dashboard screens assuming passengers are able to safely avert their eyes from the road.

For the time being at least Apple lacks an industrial partner. But one company it knows best -- iPhone assembler Foxconn -- recently acquired a former General Motors assembly plant in Ohio from struggling startup Lordstown Motors. That factory is big enough to easily make 400000 vehicles a year.

While there are already plans to make Endurance pickups for Lordstown and an EV called the Pear for Fisker both those companies are unproven startups. There might be plenty of space for Apple in that factory's future.

Strategic Vision's study indicates automakers already having issues responding to the competitive threat Tesla poses could be in for another menace. But Elon Musk also ought to take notice: More than 50 percent of Tesla owners said they would definitely consider a future Apple vehicle. ""Everyone should be prepared"" Strategic Vision President Alexander Edwards says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3RlY2gvc2VydmljZXMtYW5kLXNvZnR3YXJlL2FwcGxlLWNvdWxkLXRyYWluLXlvdS1mb3IteW91ci1uZXh0LWNhcmVlci1tb3ZlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple Could Train You For Your Next Career Move,"Thinking about changing careers? Apple could train you. The company offers two professional training and certification programs to better prepare people for a career in IT. The courses focus on how to deploy manage and support various Apple devices in the workplace. You can sign up for the courses here.

The courses are called Apple Device Support and Apple Deployment and Management. Both use a combination of articles and exercises and they are sequential.

The Apple Device Support course is a mix of articles and exercises that cover tools and services -- like troubleshooting and system administration -- used to support Apple device users. The company said the course covers about 14 hours of content. Once it's completed you'll take an exam to earn certification and to advance to the next course.

The Apple Deployment and Management course will show you how to configure manage and secure Apple products using mobile device management. This course also covers how to develop your own deployment strategy and how to use Apple Business Manager and Apple School Manager. Apple estimates there is about 13 hours of content in this course. Once the course is complete you can take the certification exam.

Each exam costs $149 and recertification exams for unexpired certificates cost $49. Apple said it will offer scholarships covering the cost of the exams to students in its Community Education Initiative. Anyone with financial difficulties can also apply for vouchers from the Mac Admins Foundation to help pay for the cost of the exams.

People who pass the certification exams receive a digital certificate that can be displayed on resumes online profiles and job boards. Apple

""Apple Professional Training helps anyone with an interest in technology ... pursue high-paying IT jobs with certifications that will stand out to potential employers"" Susan Prescott Apple's vice president of enterprise and education marketing said in a release. ""The new courses are self-paced and freely available and we are working to ensure ability to pay isn't a barrier to earning Apple certification.""

Apple is also offering in-person preparatory courses at community colleges and universities. A version of these courses was offered at Austin Community College in Texas in 2020. Maricopa Community Colleges in Chandler and Mesa Arizona and Ed Farm an education nonprofit based in Birmingham Alabama will offer the courses soon.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics found the number of jobs in the computer and information technology field is expected to grow by 13% by 2030 and there are about 42400 openings in this field each year. The median yearly wage for these careers is about $97430 which is much higher than the median yearly wage for all other jobs at $45760."

Sundar Pichai was born on 10 June 1972 in Madurai India to a middle-class family. His mother was a stenographer and his father worked as an electrical engineer for GEC the British conglomerate. He also owned a manufacturing plant where he produced electrical components.

After completing his schooling at Jawahar Vidyalaya a CBSE-affiliated school in Chennai and doing his final year at Vana Vani school in IIT Madras Pichai embarked on a metallurgical engineering degree at IIT Kharagpur Kolkata. Things took a turn when he moved to the US after getting accepted into Stanford University for a master’s degree in Material Science and Engineering.

Pichai also holds an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania where he was named a Siebel Scholar and a Palmer Scholar.

Living the American Dream

Freshly graduated Sundar Pichai began his professional career at Applied Materials working in engineering and product management and at McKinsey & Company working in management consulting. He joined Google in 2004 and began work on the tech company’s client software products which include Google Chrome and Google OS.

He worked on Google’s client software products and also focussed a big portion of his work on developing and growing Google Drive.

Chrome’s massive rise after its launch in 2008 to become the most used browser in the world helped Pichai’s reputation and he began overseeing applications like Gmail and Google Maps. He also played a pivotal role in the launch of the Chromebook which was officially released in 2012. He was instrumental in the open sourcing of the new video codec VP8 by Google and introduced the new video format WebM in 2010.

In 2013 Pichai took the reins of Android Google’s mobile-phone OS too and two years later as part of Google’s major overhaul of its operating structure and the creation of its new holding company Alphabet he was appointed CEO of Google.

In 2019 following the resignation of co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page Pichai assumed the role of CEO of both Google and Alphabet. He remained a member of Alphabet’s Board of Directors and is currently responsible for leading Google and managing Alphabet’s investments.

Sundar Pichai’s dedication and genius paired with the phenomenal success of the products he’s developed and closely worked on make him a true visionary and one of the most inspiring disruptors in the world of tech. From growing up in a modest family in India to being one of the highest-paid CEOs today Pichai’s story is an apt example that hard work always pays off.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxMzc3LTAyMi0wMDk1Ni050gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Special Issue: Rare earth luminescent materials | Light: Science & Applications,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxMzc3LTAyMi0wMDk1Ni050gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000167126B2050>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxMzc3LTAyMi0wMDk1Ni050gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF6b25hbm8uY29tL25ld3MuYXNweD9uZXdzSUQ9Mzk2MjTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lightweight Graphene Filter to Block Airborne Nanoparticles,"The primary function of personal protection equipment (PPE) including facemasks and gloves is to filter out nanoparticulate aerosols which are present in the air.

​​​​​​​Study: Nanoporous Atomically Thin Graphene Filters for Nanoscale Aerosols. Image Credit: Mopic/Shutterstock.com

PPE is widely used in medical research law enforcement healthcare and military applications. Conventional PPEs can only filter nanoparticles whose size is above 300 nm and fails to block harmful nanoparticulate aerosols (e.g. virus) which are around 20-300 nm in size.

Recently scientists developed a lightweight and ultra-compact atomically thin graphene-based filter that can block aerosolized nanoparticles of size in the sub-20 nm range. This study is available in ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces.

Conventional System of Filtering Airborne Nanoparticles

Nanoparticulate aerosols contain toxins pollutants and harmful viruses e.g. influenza virus coronavirus and rhinovirus whose size varies between 20 and 300 nm in diameter. Although conventional air filters such as 95% efficiency filter (N95) and the high-efficiency particulate air filter (HEPA) exhibit superior air flow rates they are unable to inhibit nanoparticulate aerosols whose size is less than 300 nm.

Facemasks that can block nanoparticulate aerosols of size below 300 nm are bulky and develop thermal stress due to low breathability. To improve the applicability of PPEs several strategies are implemented that focus on making porous polymers with greater thickness which can filter out nanoparticulate aerosol toxins pathogens and pollutants. Two of the major disadvantages of this approach are the inability to provide long-term protection due to inevitable leakages and low breathability owing to the high thickness.

The breathability of conventional polymeric materials has been improved via the introduction of porosity and the development of reactive organic or inorganic composite materials that can inactivate pathogens and degrade harmful substances. Some of the other techniques implemented to improve breathability are the introduction of non-woven materials and the development of hollow fiber membranes via spinning polymer methods.

Nanomaterial Based Filters with Improved Breathability and Filtering Capacity

Fabrication of membranes using nanomaterials such as vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has led to improved breathability and blockage of nanoparticulate aerosols with a diameter of less than 3 nm. Nevertheless scientists face challenges in tuning CNT diameters to target specific aerosolized nanoparticulates.

Graphene is an allotrope of carbon with atomic thinness chemical robustness superior mechanical strength and high nanopore density. This material aids in size-selective separation owing to greater tunability. Recently scientists demonstrated a new strategy to fabricate atomically thin nanoporous graphene membranes for filtering airborne nanoparticulate of size between 5 and 20 nm with greater airflow i.e. around 7.12 × 10−5 mol m−2 s −1 Pa−1.

The newly synthesized monolayer graphene on copper (Cu) foil via the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method was transferred onto polycarbonate track-etch (PCTE) membrane support containing pores of approximately 200 nm in size. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed that synthesized graphene on Cu foil was wrinkled indicating a continuous graphene layer. Raman spectroscopy with characteristic graphene peak confirms the synthesis of high-quality monolayer graphene film. Analysis of graphene placed on PCTE support via SEM showed that most PCTE pores contained graphene.

Large tears that appeared were mended through the interfacial polymerization (IP) technique. The PCTE support with well-defined cylindrical geometry could seal tears in the graphene layer. It also sealed other macroscopic defects. Post IP nanopores were introduced through the facile plasma etch of the graphene lattice. These nanopores were characterized to estimate the diffusion-driven flow of ions and molecules whose sizes ranged between 0.66 nm and 4 nm.

Finally graphene membranes were mounted in the specially designed setup to determine their performance in filtering aerosol nanoparticles using the silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) nanoparticle model. The mechanical stability of the membrane was provided by a perforated steel plate. The current study strongly emphasized that a higher air permeability can be offered through an increment in the support pore diameter and support porosity along with a decrease in the support thickness.

Experimental findings revealed that single-layer graphene on PCTE supports could withstand a pressure difference of up to 100 bars. Nanopore introduced via facile oxygen plasma etch facilitated an increase in the rate of change of pressure values to 3.50 mTorr/s (60 seconds of etch time) and 8.78 mTorr/s (90 seconds of etch times). Further increase in the oxygen plasma time elevated the rate of pressure change until it reached 13.11 mTorr/s in 180 seconds of etch time.

Utilization of SiO2 Nanoparticles Model to Determine the Efficacy of Graphene Filter

Silica aerosols were selected because they are solid spheres with a narrow size distribution. A low concentration of SiO 2 nanoparticles was used to exclude the formation of a coating on the graphene filter. Importantly the rate of change of pressure remained unchanged before and after testing with 5 nm SiO 2 nanoparticles.

The graphene filter subjected to 60 seconds of etching showed a distinct change in the rate of pressure which could be due to the formation of blockage by the nanoparticles. This finding suggested the filtering of aerosolized nanoparticles whose sizes were around 5 nm.

The newly developed compact lightweight atomically thin graphene filter can block smaller nanoparticles more effectively and can be applied in medical research space healthcare and beyond.

However an active catastrophe environment could weigh on the upside.



The P&C insurers continue to witness better pricing though the magnitude has slowed down. Global commercial insurance prices for the last reported quarter increased 9% per Marsh Global Insurance Market Index but marked a slowdown in pace for the sixth straight quarter.



Per Willis Towers Watson’s 2022 Insurance Marketplace Realities report rates will continue to rise but by a small margin. Better pricing ensures improved premiums and prudent claims payment. Per Deloitte insights global non-life premiums are estimated to grow 3.7% in 2022.



With Fed raising rates four times already this year and indicating more hikes in the future insurers being the direct beneficiaries of an improving rate environment are poised to benefit.



P&C insurers’ profitability is inversely related to catastrophic events. Colorado State University (CSU) expects an active Atlantic hurricane season this year with 18 named storms. These include eight hurricanes and four major hurricanes. This year’s hurricane season could be about 120% of the average season per CSU.



Nonetheless the insurance industry continues to witness accelerated digitalization and players are investing heavily in technology to improve scale and efficiencies. Per Deloitte Insights the technology budget is projected to increase 13.7% in 2022.



Solid policyholders’ surplus will help the industry absorb losses. Also given the solid capital level insurers are actively pursuing strategic mergers and acquisitions and investing in growth initiatives apart from engaging in share buybacks increasing dividends or paying out special dividends.



The industry has lost 5.2% year to date compared with the Finance sector’s decrease of 14.6% and the Zacks S&P 500 composite’s decline of 17.7%.



Here we focus on two property and casualty insurers namely W.R. Berkley Corporation WRB and Arch Capital Group Ltd. ACGL. W.R. Berkley is one of the nation’s largest commercial lines property casualty insurance providers. Arch Capital Group offers insurance reinsurance and mortgage insurance across the world.

Two California men have been charged in connection with the alleged theft of US$4.8 million worth of canola used in cattle feed according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of California.

A federal grand jury returned a multiple-count indictment against Richard Best 68 of Fresno California and Shawn Sawa 46 formerly of Clovis California charging them with conspiracy and wire fraud.

According to court documents from 2015 through 2017 Best and Sawa stole US$4.8 million worth of canola from international food processors which they then sold for a windfall.

Best and Sawa carried out the scheme through Best’s now defunct train-to-truck transloading company Richard Best Transfer Inc. (RBT). The victims sent hundreds of thousands of tons of their canola and other commodities to RBT for delivery to their customers. Sawa was the manager of one of the victim’s branch offices in Fresno and had a close relationship with Best.

Best and Sawa sold the stolen canola through an acquaintance in Texas who used to work in the livestock feed industry. The acquaintance sold the stolen canola to farms and dairies and distributed the proceeds according to Best’s instructions. This included wire transfers to RBT Best and Sawa’s bank accounts. The account that Sawa used was opened in his spouse’s name to try to conceal the scheme.

Throughout the scheme Best and Sawa caused RBT to send fraudulent inventory reports to the victims representing that RBT had certain amounts of their canola in stock when in fact RBT had significantly lesser amounts. Whenever the victims began to make inquiries about missing canola Best and Sawa told them it had been destroyed by bad weather when it had actually been stolen.

Best and Sawa used the proceeds from the scheme to cover RBT’s operating expenses purchase luxury homes and multiple vehicles take trips and hire private karate teachers among other expenses.

This case is the product of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Barton is prosecuting the case.

If convicted Best and Sawa face maximum statutory penalties of 20 years in prison and a US$250000 fine for each of the conspiracy and wire fraud counts.

The Fresno Bee reported that Best denies the allegations and says he was a victim of extortion from Sawa who threatened to cut off future business dealings with his employer Archer Daniels Midland. The same report said Best has filed a lawsuit against ADM and Sawa alleging fraud breach of contract and negligent interference with contract among others.",,,,,,,,,

The wearable features the Black Panther design and the African nation of Wakanda. It also allows kids to avail Marvel Avengers app adventures and participate in competitions.

With this special edition watch kids can track their sleep steps and other activities for up to one year without recharging the battery. Moreover the watch is swim-friendly to let kids track water activities.

Parents can monitor their child’s daily activities on their smartphones by using the Garmin Jr. app.

With the Black Panther fitness watch Garmin aims to provide kids with an enhanced health and wellness tracking experience. This is expected to boost the adoption rate of the wearable.

Growing Wearable Offerings

In addition to the Black Panther watch Garmin unveiled the Venu Sq 2 and Venu Sq 2 – Music Edition GPS smartwatches. The smartwatches come with all-day health monitoring fitness and wellbeing features on-device music storage for phone-free listening and an extended battery life of 11 days.

Last month GRMN launched the Enduro 2 multisport GPS smartwatch featuring LED flashlight music enhanced positioning precision and battery life of up to 150 hours in GPS mode.

In June Garmin introduced the Forerunner 955 Solar smartwatch featuring solar charging longer battery life multi-satellite system tracking and health and wellness tracking.

In April 2022 GRMN released the smart fitness tracker the vivosmart 5 with advanced sleep features and health and wellbeing monitoring capabilities.

Garmin’s expanding fitness wearable offerings are expected to help it expand its presence in the booming fitness tracker market.

Per a Straits Research report the underlined market is likely to reach $192 billion by 2030 witnessing a CAGR of 17.5% between 2022 and 2030.

Strengthening Fitness Segment

With the recent launch of the Black Panther watch Garmin widened its fitness portfolio.

Apart from wearables in August Garmin introduced a premium heart rate strap named HRM-Pro Plus to help athletes keep track of pace and distance during indoor runs thereby improving their performance.

It also released Edge Explore 2 and Edge Explore 2 Power Mount Bundle GPS cycling computers featuring an improved battery life and high-contrast maps of popular roads and high-traffic areas to avoid thus guiding cyclists to take a more convenient option.

The consistent introduction of fitness offerings is expected to help Garmin gain momentum among fitness enthusiasts. This in turn will improve its fitness segment’s performance in the days ahead.

However the segment is currently suffering from weak demand for advanced wearables and cycling products due to the normalization of demand from the pandemic-induced hike. This remains a negative.

It generated sales of $272.1 million in second-quarter 2022 accounting for 21.9% of total sales which decreased 34% year over year.

Shares of GRMN have been down 34.3% in the year-to-date period lagging the Computer and Technology sector’s decline of 28.6%.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

(1:02)

Open Extended Reactions

Bill Belichick and Robert Kraft were front and center Sunday in what appeared to be a happy reunion during the live roast of Tom Brady.

But according to two former players who attended the roast the former New England Patriots coach and the longtime team owner also shared some awkward moments offstage.

Julian Edelman and Drew Bledsoe discussed the three-hour roast during the latest episode of Edelman's ""Games with Names"" podcast and described the scene in the green room before the event.

""Preshow we're in the green room -- remember that? Were you in there?"" Edelman asked Bledsoe. ""Bill's opening up. He's having fun he's talking war stories talking rookie skits talking fun s--- doing s--- we know what Bill's all about but it was like amplified because he was excited to see you guys because he doesn't have a job anymore.""

Edelman and Bledsoe said they were both in the green room with Belichick along with former Patriots stars Rob Gronkowski and Randy Moss when Kraft arrived.

""Then Kraft walks in ... Belichick's kind of holding court"" Bledsoe recalled. ""As he's in the middle of the story Kraft walks in and so you guys all go over to say hi to Kraft.""

""The tension in that room though could cut f---ing glass"" Edelman said.

Edelman said he tried to give Belichick a ""head's up"" when he saw Kraft walk into the green room but that Belichick did not pick up on the cue.

""[Kraft] came in and I was like 'Oh s--- there's gonna be some fireworks'"" Edelman said. ""I just walked away. I didn't want to get in there.""

Bledsoe added that Belichick and Kraft did at one point ""break it down and got together for I don't know 10 minutes at least."" But the former Patriots quarterback agreed with Edelman's assessment about the tension in the room saying ""it was very real it was very real.""

Belichick and Kraft drank a shot together on stage at one point with some coaxing from comedian Kevin Hart during Sunday's made-for-streaming live comedy show on Netflix titled ""The Greatest Roast of All Time.""

Belichick left the Patriots in January after 24 seasons with the team and there has been reported friction between the six-time Super Bowl-winning coach and Kraft over the past couple of years.

As part of an ESPN report published last month that detailed Belichick's departure from the Patriots and his inability to land the Atlanta Falcons' head-coaching job a source said Kraft called Falcons owner Arthur Blank ""to warn him not to trust Bill.""

The Falcons interviewed Belichick twice this offseason for their vacant head-coaching position before ultimately hiring Raheem Morris for the job.

After joking about the event being like a reunion and that ""unlike many family reunions there are some people I am desperately trying to avoid"" Kraft praised Belichick for what the two accomplished.

""I want to say this is the greatest coach in the history of the game that did what no one else has done. And having Tom Brady and him was the greatest honor the good Lord gave me"" Kraft said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbGlzaC5jb20vZm9vZC1uZXdzL2E2MDc0NDU5NS90cmF2aXMta2VsY2UtY2xhaW1zLWFsd2F5cy1kcnVuay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Travis Kelce Is Clapping Back At Claims He's 'Always Drunk',"Earlier this week country singer and actor Jana Kramer took to her podcast to well slander Travis Kelce's name. The iHeart Radio host dissed the Kansas City Chiefs tight end for his drinking habits and claimed he's ""always drunk."" Now Kelce is hitting back via multiple insiders.

""He was taken aback as he’s never met her and is just living his life"" the source told Page Six while ""emphatically"" denying any suggestion the athlete has a drinking problem. ""That guy is under a microscope basically being watched everywhere he goes. Of course you're going to see him drinking"" the source said.

Kramer even took aim at Kelce's influence on his girlfriend Taylor Swift arguing that he has encouraged the singer's consumption habits.

""I see her drinking more now. Like the company you keep"" Kramer alleged while also calling Kelce out for his ""aggression"" with coach Andy Reid during the Super Bowl. It ""rubbed [her] the wrong way.""

The same insider went on to argue that if Kelce did have a drinking problem it would be impossible to hide given his status and constant

""It’s not like he’s passed out somewhere. If he was passed out somewhere I would totally understand but that’s not the case whatsoever"" the source adds while noting that he's just a ""normal human being"" who is ""doing the same thing"" as everyone else...only ""in the public eye.""

The three-time Super Bowl champ is reportedly ""in training right now"" to prepare for another season with the Chiefs. ""If he was drunk it would be a bigger problem"" the source said.

This isn't the first time Kelce has come under fire for drinking. During his honorary graduation ceremony for his ""New Heights"" podcast Travis accepted the diploma he never picked up in the first place before chugging a beer in celebration. However big brother Jason was quick to his defense.

""I know it looks like a graduation from the video but this was actually at the end of a New Heights Live podcast that we put on to raise money for the University’s NIL"" the older Kelce said according to People Magazine. ""The university did this to poke fun at my brother and I for never really picking up our diplomas.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvYm9laW5nLWpldC1za2lkcy1vZmYtcnVud2F5LWluanVyaW5nLWF0LWxlYXN0LTEw0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9ib2VpbmctamV0LXNraWRzLW9mZi1ydW53YXktaW5qdXJpbmctYXQtbGVhc3QtMTAuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing jet skids off runway injuring at least 10,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvYm9laW5nLWpldC1za2lkcy1vZmYtcnVud2F5LWluanVyaW5nLWF0LWxlYXN0LTEw0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9ib2VpbmctamV0LXNraWRzLW9mZi1ydW53YXktaW5qdXJpbmctYXQtbGVhc3QtMTAuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016710A5F3D0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvYm9laW5nLWpldC1za2lkcy1vZmYtcnVud2F5LWluanVyaW5nLWF0LWxlYXN0LTEw0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9ib2VpbmctamV0LXNraWRzLW9mZi1ydW53YXktaW5qdXJpbmctYXQtbGVhc3QtMTAuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvYXJ0cy9kZXNpZ24vZmFzaGlvbi1tZXQtZ2FsYS1jb3N0dW1lLWluc3RpdHV0ZS1yZXZpZXcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,At the Met Sleeping Beauty Wakes Up in the Chemistry Lab,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.nytimes.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2024/05/09/arts/design/fashion-met-gala-costume-institute-review.html (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016710A5CF40>, 'Connection to www.nytimes.com timed out.

Pro-Palestinian protesters returned to the George Washington University and pitched tents on campus Thursday night just one day after police cleared an encampment on the D.C. campus arresting dozens of people.

A group of around 100 pro-Palestinian protesters linked arms and encircled several tents along F Street in Foggy Bottom on Thursday night. Demonstrators chanted for around five hours at times in heavy rain.

Around 11:30 p.m. D.C. Police gave its first warning to the demonstrators to disperse from the area or face arrests for unlawful entry and trespassing on campus property. Many protesters could be seen collecting their signs and packing up tents and leaving the area.

After the sixth warning MPD officers linked arms and began advancing on the protesters until 19th and F streets according to 7News’ Christian Flores who was on the scene and told WTOP. He said many of the organizers and protesters decided to leave on their own.

“We haven’t seen any [response from university officials] late this evening. It is pretty calm” Flores said as protestors were leaving the area of the university. “So it does appear that there was a plan in place by MPD to not only disperse the protesters but also to make sure there wasn’t any sort of second gathering after that dispersal order.”

Police confirmed to WTOP that one arrest was made for assault on an officer.

As the campus encampment crossed the two-week mark overnight Wednesday D.C. police broke up the gathering and arrested 33 pro-Palestinian demonstrators. Six of those arrested are current students the university said in a statement Thursday.

After that clearing of the tents dozens of protesters came back to campus and gathered at the intersection of 21st and H Street early Thursday evening before marching to F Street at around 8 p.m.

Seemingly peaceful

The group carried signs that read “We are not leaving” and chanted “Free free Palestine.” Marchers paused in front of the residence that’s traditionally occupied by the university’s president and chanted outside the home.

Then they marched down F Street where several administrative offices are also located — including the office of university President Ellen Granberg.

That’s where protesters put up several tents — the university’s student newspaper The Hatchet reported saying nine tents were pitched. Some participants also climbed the brick entrance to a university building nearby the tents.

WTOP's Scott Gelman reports from George Washington University as pro-Palestinian protesters return to campus.

Dozens of D.C. police officers some on bikes gathered on F Street and the surrounding area.

WTOP’s Scott Gelman reported a brief moment of pushing and shoving earlier in the evening when police on bicycles appeared to be attempting to control a sidewalk in front of a university building.

Outside of that scuffle the protest appeared to have remained peaceful.

WTOP has reached out to the university for comment. D.C. police told WTOP the department is monitoring the First Amendment activity.

All roads are open as of 1 a.m.

Protesters are back. Here’s how students are reacting

Among those in the crowd on H Street was GW student Reem Lababdi who told WTOP she was pepper sprayed in the back by D.C. police but not arrested Wednesday.

“We said we weren’t leaving and we meant it” Lababdi said in reference to the encampment. “We will not be pushed aside when our administration is funding the genocide of our people.”

The encampment which had been in place for 13 days was cleared early Wednesday morning by officers that deployed pepper spray and arrested 33 protesters who police said refused to vacate after six warnings.

Students from other nearby colleges including American University George Mason and the University of Maryland took part in the protests on GW’s campus.

Lababdi said protesters are there to send a message to Mayor Muriel Bowser congressional lawmakers and Granberg whom she criticized for allegedly declining to meet with student protesters.

“She would sooner brutalize her own students than come to the negotiating table with them” Lababdi said.

But there’s division among GW students about the protests.

David Delarosa a GW student told WTOP he encountered protesters on H Street while returning home from work Thursday.

“We have students here who just want to go to work want to go finish their finals go home enjoy their summer” he said. “It’s ridiculous.”

Protest organizers have called accusations that the demonstrations are antisemitic “baseless.” But some Jewish students have said they feel intimidated by the protests.

“Jews like myself feel threatened they feel scared and we just want to live our lives” he said.

Barriers around site of former encampment

The events Thursday come after fencing was installed around the GW’s University Yard. The fence barriers standing over 10 feet tall resemble those put in place around the Capitol building after the Jan. 6 2021 insurrection — and are now blocking all entrances of University Yard.

It is unclear how long the fences are expected to remain around the area.

When asked at a Wednesday news conference whether the encampment clearing meant there would be no more protests on GW’s campus D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith said it was Granberg’s decision “to determine if she will allow protests in other areas of the campus.”

Smith said that no protests will take place in the now-secured area.

Smith said there were many indicators that the protests were becoming more volatile outlining intelligence that officers had been collecting over the days leading up to Wednesday. One of the concerning indicators Smith mentioned was that non-students were joining the protests on campus and had been found in secure campus buildings.

Granberg also said in a statement over the weekend that the protest had “been co-opted by individuals who are largely unaffiliated with our community and do not have our community’s best interest in mind.”

Arrest records show that the 33 arrested protesters ranged in age from 18 to 33 years old with most of them college-age.

Tensions have continued to ratchet up in standoffs with protesters on campuses across the U.S. — and increasingly in Europe — nearly three weeks into a movement launched by a protest at Columbia University in New York.

Some colleges cracked down immediately on protests against the Israel-Hamas war. Among those that have tolerated the tent encampments some universities have begun to lose patience and call in police over concerns about disruptions to campus life safety and the involvement of nonstudents.

Since April 18 just over 2600 people have been arrested on 50 campuses according to figures based on reporting by The Associated Press and statements from universities and law enforcement agencies.

The design software company one of Marin’s most successful startups notified the state Employment Development Department of its plans “as a courtesy and in an abundance of caution” in an Aug. 15 letter.

The letter stated that Autodesk’s San Rafael office at 111 McInnis Parkway will be closing for good effective Oct. 14.

“All 578 employees who are currently assigned to the San Rafael office will have their assigned office transferred to our office at the Landmark at One Market Street San Francisco” said Autodesk executive Rebecca Pearce.

The letter stated that most of these employees are now designated as hybrid workers and therefore do not have mandatory weekly in-office days. Only five employees are office based and will be required to work in the San Francisco office.

Autodesk spokeswoman Mary Garofalo said the company has “ramped up” a new workplace model that divides employees into three groups: office based hybrid or home based.

“The majority of our global team falls within the hybrid category meaning they split their time between their homes and local commutable Autodesk offices” Garofalo said. “At this time Autodesk is not requiring employees to come into an office on any fixed or mandatory weekly schedule.”

Garofalo said Autodesk has 12600 employees worldwide but she declined to disclose how many of those employees work in the United States.

Reacting to the news of Autodesk’s move Mike Blakeley chief executive officer of the Marin Economic Forum said “It’s always a big deal if you lose a name brand business that has been an important part of the community.”

“Autodesk started here grew up here became a billion-dollar company here” he said. “That is significant in terms of establishing that kind of business can start and grow in Marin County. It’s like losing a good neighbor.”

Autodesk was launched in 1982 by 13 programmers who pooled about $60000 of their own money and worked out of co-founder John Walker’s two-bedroom home in Mill Valley.

The founders initially concentrated on developing a text editing program with spreadsheets before shifting their focus to a computer drawing program that was an instant hit at the COMEX trade show that November. The program would later become AutoCAD the company’s flagship product and cash cow.

In the 2021 fiscal year Autodesk reported a net profit of $497 million on revenue of $4.39 billion. Its software is used by a broad range of industries including the manufacturing architecture building construction media and entertainment sectors. The software has aided in the development of new technologies such as virtual reality robotics and 3D printing.

Autodesk’s decision to close its San Rafael headquarters comes on the heels of the company’s disclosure in January that it was giving up leases at 3900 Civic Center Drive in northern San Rafael and at 300 Mission St. in San Francisco. Autodesk’s lease of 46000 square feet at 3900 Civic Center Drive began in early 2020 and the company opened the 116000-square-foot office at 300 Mission St. last year.

Autodesk stated in its 2022 annual report that “the COVID-19 pandemic has spurred changes in the way we work as we move to a more hybrid workforce resulting in an evaluation of our office space needs.”

Accordingly the report said Autodesk planned to reduce its facilities portfolio worldwide and had incurred “impairment and accelerated depreciation charges of $103.7 million to assets associated with its operating leases for real estate during the fiscal year ended January 31 2022.” In finance an impairment is defined as a permanent reduction in the value of a company asset.

Autodesk also said it expects to incur additional impairments over the next several quarters amounting to as much as $25 million.

Between its annual reports in 2021 and 2022 the company shed 270000 square feet of leased office space leaving it with 1.83 million square feet at 101 sites in the United States and internationally.

Autodesk’s 2022 annual report indicated that its lease on the space at 111 McInnis Parkway extends until December 2024. It said the company has 284000 square feet of space in San Francisco under leases that have expiration dates ranging from December 2022 to June 2026.

Regarding the 162000 square feet of space that Autodesk has exited in Marin recently Haden Ongaro a North Bay executive for the Newmark real estate services firm said “I’m confident we’ll be able to lease those spaces but I hate to see a major employer leave Marin.”

Ongaro noted that Autodesk moved from Sausalito to the new building at 111 McInnis Parkway in 1994.

“Those buildings leased up pretty quickly” he said.

Ongaro said office space left behind when Lucasfilm Ltd. moved to the Presidio in 2005 and Glassdoor exited Mill Valley for San Francisco last year has also been filled.

According to Newmark’s most recent report on the Marin office market the vacancy rate was 18.5% at the end of June down from 19.4% during the second quarter of 2021. By comparison the San Francisco office market ended the second quarter of 2022 with a vacancy rate of 24.2% according to the Coldwell Banker Richard Ellis Group. Marin had an office vacancy rate of 16.3% in the second quarter of 2020.

Blakeley said the fact that a number of very successful companies have started in Marin and then moved away is not necessarily a bad thing.

“We look at it in a very positive light” he said. “You can start a billion-dollar publicly traded company in Marin County not many regions can say that.”

Blakeley said more recent success stories such as Restoration Hardware in Corte Madera Ultragenyx in Novato and BioMarin Pharmaceutical in San Rafael demonstrate that Marin retains its mojo for entrepreneurs.

“Obviously the conditions exist to start and grow a company here” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9kZXNrLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy9mdXNpb24tMzYwL2Jsb2cvaW10cy0yMDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 Things You Don't Want To Miss at IMTS 2022 - Fusion Blog,"IMTS 2022 is back bigger than ever before and — drum roll — in person again for the first time in four years!

Businesses whether big or small know that understanding data is essential to making informed decisions that impact the organization’s bottom line. The emergence of new data from embedded devices mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) is accelerating and complicating insights. Here’s what Statista said in the recent reports “In 2021 it was projected that the overall amount of data created worldwide would reach 79 zettabytes and would more than double by 2025 with no end in sight.” (Reference as illustrated below)

Image Source: https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/

The same report also states the factors contributing to the rapid growth of data traffic. “It is the Internet of Things (IoT) which already connects the digital and physical worlds through a network of sensors. The data volume created by global IoT connections reached 13.6 zettabytes in 2019 and is forecast to amount to over 79 zettabytes by 2025.”

Apart from this the proliferation of business intelligence tools growing diversity of machine and human-generated data Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning Blockchain etc. are opening

more ways for information management and interpretation. But accessing this data poses a challenge for many organizations.

Harnessing data for informed decision-making gets difficult especially when reporting and utilities are across multiple vendors or paper-based. As a result manual data entry and collection limits an organization’s ability to understand its data usage on a granular level. Advanced technological solutions address such challenges effectively; however several companies have been slow to adapt their workflows and processes to take advantage of more scalable data collection options.

Confronting Data Collection Challenges with Automation

Though data-driven decision-making is crucial for creating values and driving businesses in the right direction it needs a mix of capabilities and actions—some technical some not. Automated data collection solutions combine human intelligence with RPA AI and ML. Whether proprietary or public data organizations can transform their raw unstructured data into tagged and schema-compliant XML fit for data products analytics AI/ML applications etc.

Listed here are the leading-edge tools and software for data capture and collection processes:

● Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

One of the well-established and proven technologies is Optical Character Recognition. Even after disrupting the traditional approach to document management once this technology remains as relevant as ever.

It is perfect for digitizing huge piles of electronic and paper documents and is widely used across healthcare logistics banking finance governing and more. Multipurpose OCR systems not only reduce the costs of capturing data but also help in automating routine manual tasks. This helps in freeing human resources from doing mundane repetitive tasks. In short the OCR solution is a prerequisite for cost-efficient document management.

● Optical Mark Recognition (OMR)

Optical Mark Recognition is another approach to managing documents. It is used to capture and speed up human-marked data. For example multiple-choice tests the results of polls surveys consumer feedback and so on. After scanning the documents the Machine Learning algorithms detect the location. It can recognize hand-written marks much faster than human employees. Hence businesses can complete routine tasks time- and resource-efficiently and foster workflow automation.

● Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR)

Intelligent character recognition aims at solving more sophisticated challenges. Using this technology machines can easily process raw hand-written documents. The level of accuracy varies from 50% to 70%—depending on cursive handwriting block letters fonts styles etc. Bonus point this level of accuracy can be improved via further training the Machine Learning algorithm on rich datasets of specific data.

● Intelligent Document Recognition (IDR)

Volumes of unstructured documents are produced in complex business processes taking the case of the logistics and finance industry. Intelligent Document Recognition can extract data from any document part including meta description. It not only incorporates the capabilities of OCR but also enhances it. IDR technology can interpret tables patterns and content in electronic and paper formats by recognizing the beginning and end of documents and categorizing them. Any required data can be extracted whether stored in a database or used in business apps.

● QR Code Recognition

As data occurs in different formats for instance being encrypted in QR codes automated data capture can be conducted via different systems. This scan-and-go system has transformed the traditional way of shopping by facilitating hassle-free payments check-out-free stores self-servicing etc. QR code recognition has become a novel solution for many industry giants like Walmart Amazon Starbucks and the likes of the same for capturing data on merchandise and making payments.

● Voice Recognition

Voice assistants like Siri Cortona Alexa and Google Assistant are powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology. Simply say “Hey Siri” or “Google” to awaken the system dictate the command and get your answer.

NLP approaches based on deep learning algorithms are used in different areas such as marketing interpreting security support services etc. NLP embedded in electronic data capture systems helps collect clinical trial data or patient data that can be entered manually or via voice.

Final Words

Decisions processes and actions that use data can be automated in a variety of ways as stated but fall somewhere between mostly human-based and completely automated. In the age of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence companies that embrace some degree of automation in their core processes such as data collection and capture processes are more likely to gain a competitive advantage—through rapid granular and more sophisticated decision-making. Gartner also predicts that by 2025 “95% of decisions that currently use data will be at least partially automated.” Hence leaders can efficiently create decision intelligence with organizational competency.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNTk4LTAyMi0xOTE3My130gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cloud-enabled Biodepot workflow builder integrates image processing using Fiji with reproducible data analysis using ...,"We describe our effort extending the Biodepot-workflow-builder (Bwb) platform to support Fiji in “Supporting graphical applications such as Fiji with software containers”. With this Fiji integration users can reproducibly execute imaging libraries plugins pipelines and macros in Fiji on the cloud. In addition Fiji can be combined with other Bwb containerized modules (such as Jupyter notebooks visualization and genomic analysis widgets) to form multi-step workflows. Bwb and its workflows are executed inside downloadable containers thus only requiring that Docker be installed to function. To run Fiji as a standalone application the user launches Bwb and connects to the Bwb server using a browser or a VNC client. A tool dock of widgets including a Fiji widget can be dragged onto the Desktop canvas to create workflows. In addition a form-based user interface can be used to enter parameters start and stop the execution of each widget. Upon beginning execution Bwb will automatically download and install the application and its dependencies. The user interacts with Fiji as they would if Fiji were launched locally on a laptop. The GUI is designed so that the form inputs are translated to construct a single line Fiji command. This allows for support of macro and script execution.

We demonstrate the utility of our approach by analyzing focal adhesions and stitching three dimensional (3D) images in “Analysis of focal adhesions” and “Stitching of 3D images”. The first workflow in “Analysis of focal adhesions” performs a multi-step multi-executable analysis of focal adhesions. It utilizes a download widget an ImageJ macro for segmentation and Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and visualization. Each module (widget) is isolated within its own software container enhancing reproducibility and re-usability by insulating it from changes to other modules and the operating environment. The second workflow in “Stitching of 3D images” demonstrates how graphics enabled containerization can simplify the deployment of a computationally demanding workflow to a virtual machine of arbitrary size on the cloud. This workflow downloads the dataset and directory structure executes a modifiable Fiji module to execute the BigStitcher19 plugin for Fiji. The workflow can be run on the cloud while retaining the interactivity and extending the functionality of Fiji executed on a local computer. With these two workflows we demonstrate how our work enables scalable and reproducible bioimage informatic analysis and also facilitates the integration of imaging data analysis across multiple applications such as Jupyter notebooks.

Supporting graphical applications such as Fiji with software containers

The major technical challenge to porting desktop based image analyses applications to the cloud is to support the same graphical interface and display on the cloud that one would see on a laptop or desktop. Bwb supports two methodologies for accomplishing this using software containers2021. We combine both methods in Bwb to allow the user to export graphics from a container that functions both on a local laptop and on a remote cloud server. A container exports X11 commands to the Bwb desktop environment which draws the graphics to a framebuffer. The framebuffer is exported using the virtual network computing (VNC)22 protocol to a viewer that displays the screen and manages user interactions. An open-source VNC (noVNC) viewer allows users to use their browser to directly interact with the cloud workflow and avoid the need to install additional VNC software. While the the basic X11/VNC mechanism works well for many graphical applications in the original Bwb we made some adjustments to support Fiji. We also made some adjustments to Bwb to facilitate the creation of customized containers such as the one we have provided to demonstrate the Fiji workflows. Details of these modifications are provided in Methods.

Analysis of focal adhesions

Epithelial cell motility is crucial to many biological processes including development wound healing and metastasis. It is driven by cell-substrate interactions which are mediated by focal adhesions large multi-protein complexes situated on the basal surface of cells and most often near the leading edge23. They indirectly link the actin cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix proteins. This enables them to translate actin bundle contraction into traction forces that pull them across a substrate24. Although all focal adhesions are composed of a core set of proteins including vinculin and paxillin there are significant compositional differences between cell types with over 100 distinct proteins having been reported to associate with focal adhesions25. Moreover the numbers sizes and shapes of focal adhesions differ between cell types and are influenced by substrate stiffness extracellular matrix and signaling molecules with these metrics being associated with cell motility26. Calculating the numbers sizes and shapes of focal adhesions requires the segmentation of these microscopic structures in immunofluorescent images. Since dozens or more focal adhesions can be present in each cell this is a very laborious process. There is therefore a significant cross-discipline interest in methods to automate focal adhesion segmentation27. However because of differences between cell types immunostaining methods and imaging platforms and settings this is not an easily standardizable task. Flexible methods for modifying existing segmentation models or generating new ones are desperately needed.

Our Bwb workflow and ImageJ macros implement segmentation of focal adhesions using the algorithm described by Horzum et al.28. A set of images of fluorescently labeled paxillin available from the Focal Adhesion Analysis Server27 was first downloaded using the Download Files widget in Bwb along with the LoG3D plugin for Fiji29 which implements a Laplacian of Gaussians filter. We implemented an option in the Fiji widget to specify the directory containing the LoG3D plugin (see “Macro for segmentation in the focal adhesion workflow”).

A containerized copy of Fiji was then called to execute an ImageJ macro that triggers actions to perform the image processing steps as described by Horzum et al.28 that isolate the focal adhesions in the image. The macro then used the built-in “Analyze Particles” plugin to compute and save the area (in square pixels) and centroid coordinates for each focal adhesion to a CSV file. An ellipse was also fitted to each focal adhesion and the lengths of the major and minor axes of the ellipse as well as the angle of the major axis with respect to the horizontal were saved. Since ImageJ’s macro language is intended to execute graphical user interface commands the graphics and interface were exported from the Fiji container so the user can observe the status of the segmentation and interactively adjust the image in real time (Fig. 2B).

Another macro was then executed in Fiji to identify the outline of the cell in each time-slice of the image; this is important to determine the orientation of each focal adhesion relative to the edge of the cell. The macro first performed automatic thresholding and then performed a series of morphological operations to demarcate the cell. The operations consisted of morphological dilation closure filling holes using the Fiji “Fill Holes” plugin and erosion to return the cell to approximately its original shape. It was determined interactively that three rounds of the morphological operations were required to close holes and remove noise. The “Outline” operation in Fiji was then used to find the cell borders which was saved as xy-coordinate pairs to a text file using the “Save XY Coordinates...” command.

Finally a Jupyter notebook was executed to read the output csv file from the previous step obtain the segmentation and border coordinates create histograms to visualize the distribution of areas aspect ratios (i.e. the ratio of the lengths of the major and minor axes) and the angles relative to the cell edge observed in the focal adhesions. Two separate widgets are used. The first widget loads all the required libraries and automatically executes the analysis to generate the final graphs. The second widget displays a copy of the executed notebook with the generated results. Either notebook can be altered which gives the user the ability to interactively explore different visualization and analysis options for a particular dataset and then decide whether to commit them to the automated part of the workflow to be applied to other datasets. A screenshot of the complete workflow running in the Bwb platform (Fig. 2A) and the resulting graphical output of this workflow are shown (Fig. 2B). A video demonstration of this workflow is available at https://youtu.be/ymnmdRqS-pE.

Stitching of 3D images

Advances in microscopy techniques such as lightsheet or confocal microscopy have led to the generation of large overlapping three dimensional (3D) images. However the raw data acquired with these microscopes are not directly suitable for visualization and analysis. Digital reconstruction of these 3D images require stitching and fusion of large numbers of overlapping image tiles. Additionally these 3D datasets can be large particularly for lightsheet microscopy which is often on the terabyte (TB) scale. This leads to computational challenges in terms of storage efficient analysis and visualization.

BigStitcher is a software package that enables interactive visualization efficient image alignment and deconvolution of multi-tile and multi-angle image datasets19. Both alignment and viewing of terabyte-size datasets composed of overlapping three-dimensional (3D) image tiles are supported. BigStitcher offers options for fully automatic or interactive stitching. BigDataViewer30 is provided with the package for visualization of the aligned datasets. To accommodate the computational requirements the original benchmarks for BigStitcher were performed using high-end local servers19. However many researchers do not have access to this type of dedicated infrastructure but do have access to pay-as-you-go resources on the public cloud. We demonstrate how enabling execution of Fiji on the cloud democratizes access to computationally intensive applications such as BigStitcher.

BigStitcher is installed as a plugin through the Bwb Fiji widget. The demo workflow uses BigStitcher to align and display a multi-tile dataset of a 3D confocal scan of the nervous system of a Drosophila larva. The images consist of six tiles and three channels each. This data is available as an example dataset within BigStitcher’s Fiji plugin documentation and serves as a good example for the cloud capabilities of the software package. After opening the raw data in BigStitcher the filename patterns for channels and tiles are selected by our macro. The images are then pulled up in the BigDataViewer plugin and aligned to a regular grid for easier viewing. Manual alignment is skipped in this workflow but is available as an option for more complex datasets that require user intervention in stitching. Figure 2C shows the stitched image from the Drosophila dataset (123 MB) displayed in the BigDataViewer plugin. Stitching and viewing the raw data is completed in 20 s on a m5dn.4xlarge AWS EC2 instance.

This AI-powered tech will enable non-specialists to skillfully and efficiently analyze and diagnose factory data such as current and pressure values for intuitive high-level production operations management.

In recent years manufacturers have been increasing the use of various data from the factory floor to enhance further productivity stimulating the need for data collection and visualization and advanced analysis and diagnosis.

On the other hand several factory operations like production management and equipment maintenance still need to be handled by human workers making tasks such as equipment adjustments and consumables-replacement timing etc. dependent on the experience of skilled workers.

The lack of such skilled workers however is becoming a critical issue for manufacturers when they try to promote advanced data analysis and diagnosis.

Mitsubishi Electric’s MELSOFT MaiLab tool utilizes AI technologies like deep learning and other statistical methods to learn how skilled workers evaluate operations automatically. This tool is easy to handle and doesn’t require special knowledge of factory operations. After the automatic learning process the analysis and diagnosis results will be fed back from MELSOFT MaiLab for adjusting equipment parameters which helps manufacturers automatically improve their operations and further increase productivity. The tool’s functionality and AI technologies will undergo updates in response to the growing needs of manufacturers.

The launch of MELSOFT MaiLab is part of Mitsubishi Electric’s ongoing effort to support customers with digital technologies that can help streamline production processes and reduce engineering costs. Through such activities Mitsubishi Electric aims to transform into a “circular digital-engineering company” focused on solving a wide range of social issues with its customers.

Key Features

First an attacker needs to set up a Microsoft cloud account known as a tenant and set it to have admin controls over any machines that are assigned to it. This essentially allows the malicious account to run RPA processes on an end user’s device. On the previously compromised machine all a hack has to do now is assign it to the new admin account—this is done using a simple command line called silent registration.

“Once you do that you will get a URL that would allow you as an attacker to send payloads to the machine” Bargury says. Ahead of his DefCon talk he created multiple demos showing how it is possible to use Power Automate to push out ransomware to impacted machines. Other demos show how an attacker can steal authentication tokens from a machine. “You can exfiltrate data outside of the corporate networks through this trusted tunnel you can build keyloggers you can take information from the clipboard you can control the browser” Bargury says.

A spokesperson for Microsoft downplayed the potential of the attack pointing out that an account would need to have been accessed by an attacker before it could be used. “There is no mechanism by which a fully updated machine with antivirus protections can be remotely compromised using this technique” the spokesperson says. “This technique relies on a hypothetical scenario where a system is already compromised or susceptible to a compromise using existing techniques like social engineering—both for the initial and any subsequent network attack” the spokesperson adds recommending that people keep their systems up to date.

This type of attack could be hard to detect as it uses official systems and processes throughout Bargury says. “When you think about the architecture this is a remote code execution tool that is built by Microsoft and signed by Microsoft all throughout the way” Bargury says. He published demos and the steps needed to conduct the attack to help raise awareness of the potential issues companies face.

Before his DefCon talk Microsoft’s team reached out to him Bargury says and pointed out that business network admins can restrict access to Power Automate tools by “adding a registry entry” to their devices. This process would put controls on the account types that can sign in to Power Automate thus reducing the potential for the system to be abused. However to be successful Bargury says the move relies upon security teams having consistent and clear policies across their organizations which isn’t always the case.

While the popularity of RPA tools is increasing there have already been real-world attacks designed to abuse the platforms. In early 2020 Microsoft’s security team found six hacker groups including a Chinese APT inside the network of one company. One of the hacker groups used automated systems to remove data. “In an uncommon move the attacker used the customer’s existing systems including eDiscovery the Compliance Search feature and Microsoft Flow to automate stealing its search results” Microsoft wrote in an incident report.

As the possible risks around low-code/no-code applications become more obvious Bargury says companies may need to reassess their policies. “It’s very important to monitor what RPA agents are doing” he says. “You cannot really expect to provide all of the business users in an enterprise capabilities that were up until a few months ago reserved only to developers and expect everything to go well.”"

U.S. operators have shown restraint but according to World Oil’s mid-year forecast a further activity increase is in the offing.

The war in Ukraine has limited Russian oil and gas supplies and has the potential to cause a major shift in the world’s energy market. No one knows how long Russia intends to wage war in Ukraine or how much of its crude will be affected by sanctions or for how long. The uncertainty caused by the supply disruption has driven crude prices to multi-year highs. And anxieties persist that surging oil prices may rise so high that demand destruction will damage the global economy and cause a worldwide recession. However Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is creating a new market for U.S. LNG producers as product flows to Europe to replace Russian natural gas. The longer the conflict persists the more entrenched U.S. LNG will become.

ESG impact. Although the U.S. petroleum industry faces continued pressure from President Biden and environmental groups about the imperative of reducing fossil fuel usage to slow GHG emissions the drive for rapid implementation has lessened. However the transition to renewables and clean energy alternatives has created an unprecedented reduction of investment in hydrocarbon-based energy in favor of developing green resources. During 2021 global oil and gas discoveries hit their lowest level in 75 years. Total global discovered volumes in 2021 were calculated at 4.7 Bboe the lowest tally since 1946. This trend is predicted to continue in 2022. A data-based comparison shows a significant reduction in recoverable oil resources that will drive commodity prices higher and further damage global energy security.

U.S. production surges. Despite a sizeable drop in recoverable resources U.S. oil production remains on track for a record in 2023 even as output grows more slowly than anticipated amid increased costs and labor shortages in America’s shale fields. Output is expected to expand at an average 840000 bopd next year down from a prior forecast of 860000 bopd according to the EIA. While production is still seen reaching an all-time high in 2023 the government revised its forecast slightly lower to 12.7 MMbopd. The current annual U.S. record average is 12.3 MMbopd set in 2019.

At the start of the year production in the U.S. (11.7 MMbopd) Saudi Arabia (10.2 MMbopd) and Russia (11.0 MMbopd) was running at nearly full capacity. Brent and WTI were trading at $86.51/bbl and $83.22 respectively. When Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 2022 the EU and international community reacted quickly by boycotting Russian supply. The embargo quickly pushed prices up and in June Brent was trading for $122.71/bbl and WTI hit $114.84/bbl the highest price since August 2008. Prices retreated in July down to $111.93/bbl for Brent and $101.62/bbl for WTI due to rising interest rates and fear of economic recession despite restricted Russian supply.

Demand to lessen. The global surge in the cost of fuel is starting to weigh on demand according to Vitol Group the world’s largest independent oil trader. Consumers are being impacted by the run-up in gasoline diesel and other oil products said Mike Muller head of Vitol Asia. There is clear evidence of economic stress being caused by high oil and natural gas prices according to Muller.

MACRO U.S. PICTURE

The Baker Hughes rotary rig count stood at 588 units during the week ending Jan. 7 2022. U.S. drilling activity climbed steadily for the next seven months although it slowed in July and August reaching 760 in the week ending Sept. 2 Fig. 1. Although the 172-rig increase represents a Jan.-Sept. increase of 29% U.S. shale operators have resisted ramping-up drilling activity and remained relatively disciplined with their capital expenditures. The speed at which new rigs have been deployed to the field is considerably less than in previous up-price cycles. Most U.S. shale companies are still being conservative as priorities remain focused on protecting balance sheets and generating free cash flow.

This conservative approach along with high oil prices has enabled shale companies to reduce their debt burdens in the second quarter signaling room for them to pay dividends buy back shares or make acquisitions. A metric commonly used to measure companies’ ability to pay down their borrowings has widely improved among oil and gas producers as they repurchase some bonds and pile up cash amid ballooning profits.

Net debt reported by a group of independent operators including ConocoPhillips and Pioneer Natural Resources averaged less than 0.6 times their annual earnings before items such as interest and taxes in the second quarter down from 1.7 times a year earlier. Many companies have reached their debt target. Energy companies have made great strides toward repairing and reinforcing their balance sheets and are in a much stronger position to handle another downturn in commodity prices.

With WTI trading between $85/bbl and $95/bbl U.S. shale producers are on course to generate $200 billion this year enough to make the industry debt-free by 2024 and potentially fund a pivot toward more natural gas production (Deloitte). High oil prices and disciplined capital spending mean U.S. shale producers are on track for their most profitable year on record part of a global trend that will see the oil and gas industry generate a record $1.4 trillion of free cash flow. After paying down debt and rewarding shareholders U.S. producers will likely focus more on natural gas production due to high demand and prices around the world. Producers will also make record profits from U.S. LNG operations. They are expected to generate $59 billion this year double last year’s amount and easily recouping the $45 billion of losses from 2013 to 2020.

OVERALL U.S. FORECAST

Due to sustained higher oil prices World Oil forecasts a noticeable uptick in drilling activity for the remainder of the year projecting 18600 total wells for 2022—a 34% increase from the 2021 count of 13877 Table 1. Total footage is projected to increase from 191.5 MMft in 2021 to 256.4 MMft in 2022—an increase of 34%. During 2022 8769 wells are estimated to have been drilled during the first six months while 9831 are expected to spud in the second half of the year for a half-to-half increase of 12.1%. A 14.9% increase in footage is expected in the last six months.

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS

Oil prices have been rising since the start of 2021 bolstered by restricted Russian supplies and recovering demand. However upstream M&A activity which typically follows oil prices remains well below pre-pandemic levels. The total count and value of U.S. upstream deals during the first eight months of 2021 were down 30% and 46% respectively from the same period in 2019.

While the ongoing capital discipline of operating companies is the primary reason behind the slowdown in upstream M&A activity limited visibility of buyers into the carbon profile of sellers’ assets is a growing factor. Companies pursuing their net-zero goals are either looking to acquire low-carbon-intensity barrels or divest the high-intensity ones implying that there might be an acreage consolidation or portfolio restructuring on the horizon (Deloitte). But a large resource size and an attractive offering price may not be enough to elicit a response from a buyer focused on meeting its net-zero targets. Therefore M&A activities would need not only to be financially accretive but also to support ESG goals.

Devon Energy agreed to acquire Validus Energy for $1.8 billion in cash to expand in the Eagle Ford shale play in South Texas. The deal will add to Devon’s cash flow and earnings in the first year and boost its variable dividend by up to 10% based on current oil futures prices. Devon also said the transaction will enable the acceleration of the return of cash to investors via its existing $2 billion stock buyback program. Buying Validus will add 42000 net acres adjacent to Devon’s existing leasehold in the Eagle Ford. Validus’s production is approximately 35000 boed with volumes expected to increase to 40000 boed over the next year.

EQT to buy Marcellus assets. EQT Corp the largest U.S. natural gas producer agreed to acquire THQ Appalachia a privately held company in a $5.2 billion deal to expand holdings in the Marcellus shale. The company purchased the assets from Alta Resources for $2.9 billion. It also acquired Chevron’s assets in Appalachia for $735 million in 2020. THQ Appalachia produces nearly 800 MMcfgd in West Virginia. The company has about 11 years of inventory at maintenance capital levels. EQT is expected to produce the equivalent of 5.5 Bcfd this year.

OFS COSTS ARE UP

Heading into 2022 most operators expected pricing to increase for nearly all service lines but seismic. Labor tubulars fracturing/stimulation and transportation were the areas of greatest concern. A modest 15% expected pricing to remain stable including nearly 39% for completion equipment 35% for other services and 33% for drilling. Further pricing concessions were expected by a modest few for seismic services and tubulars.

Further pricing increases are expected in the second half of 2022 with limited availability of OCTG and casing potentially curtailing spending revisions. Overall spending in OFS is expected to remain about 25% below 2019 levels until 2025. With margins at the mercy of another price cycle and reduced spending many OFS companies are crafting a new strategy for the future of energy. With a broadening decarbonization mandate across industries companies have an opportunity to lead the way for customers by fully re-engineering traditional OFS business models and solutions outside the traditional oilfield services and to other industries.

Many large service providers have diversified beyond core services. One large company has restructured its business by launching cloud and edge computing services whose rate of growth is expected to outpace that of their O&G business in a few years. Similarly Halliburton and Baker Hughes are partnering with start-ups and academic institutions through their Halliburton Labs and Baker Hughes Energy Innovation Center respectively to accelerate technology development for diverse energy and industrial applications.

However digitalization will only help to a certain extent. Providing integrated solutions for decarbonizing upstream projects implementing subscription-based revenue models or diversifying into the low-carbon space such as hydrogen and CCUS are key to future growth.

LEASING DECLINES

The number of licensed blocks and total acreage fell to near all-time lows as the sector struggles to shake off the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing oil market crash (Rystad). Only 21 leasing rounds were completed globally through August this year half of the 42 rounds held in the first eight months of 2021. The acreage awarded so far this year has shrunk to a 20-year low of 320000 km2. Global leasing rounds are expected to total 44 this year 14 less than in 2021 and the lowest level since 2000.

Global spending on exploration has been falling in recent years as oil and gas companies seek to limit risk by focusing on core producing assets and regions with guaranteed output aiming to streamline their operations and build a more resilient business amid market uncertainty and the threat of a recession. The political landscape is also contributing to the decrease in license awards with many governments pausing or halting leases and encouraging companies to wrap up exploration activity within already awarded blocks. This trend is likely to continue as governments are less eager to invest in fossil fuel production and instead look ahead to a net zero future.

The onshore exploration sector is a significant contributor to the decline in awarded acreage. Total onshore acreage awarded in leasing activity has plummeted from more than 560000 km2 in 2019 to a mere 115000 km2 so far this year. Offshore leased acreage hit a high point in 2019 before dropping off a cliff in 2020 and has remained relatively flat in the past two years. Concluded leasing rounds have dropped significantly in the U.S. driven primarily by the cancellation of Lease Sales 259 and 261 in the Gulf of Mexico and Cook Inlet in Alaska.

EMPLOYMENT

Employment in the U.S. oilfield services and equipment sector rose by an estimated 6865 jobs to 648914 in August according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and analysis by the Energy Workforce & Technology Council. Gains in August make OFS employment the highest since the Covid-19 pandemic began but they are still off the pre-pandemic mark in February 2020 of 706528. Overall U.S. employers added 315000 jobs down from July numbers but still representing a strong pace of growth.

CAPEX FORECAST

North American spending is forecast to increase 33% from 2021 levels which is an acceleration from 20.6% growth projected in a December survey and builds on the modest 1% increase experienced in 2021 according to James West senior managing director at Evercore ISI. The increase is driven by a 1260 bps acceleration in the U.S. to 36% growth which more than offset a 2.8% decline in spending in 2021 excluding the historical capex of distressed companies that have since been acquired or privatized. Private and independent operators are leading the recovery with capex accelerating by 1440 bps and 1550 bps from the December survey to 56% and 42% respectively and also accelerating from 41% and 5% growth in 2021. More modest growth of 25% and 19% are anticipated from the majors and NOCs both of which contracted further in 2021.

While the majors have more than offset declines in 2021 despite recent divestitures—with Evercore’s projected 2022 spending nearly 7% above 2020 levels—spending from the NOCs remains 25% lower to account for less than 1% of total U.S. spending (vs. almost 2% in 2020). Overall the majors account for almost 30% of U.S. capex down from 36% in 2020 while the independents including privates account for 70% of all spending up from 62%. U.S. capex is on track to recover within 25% of pre-pandemic levels and approach levels last seen in 2009 before the start of the oil shale revolution.

There could be modest upside to NAM spending in in the second half of 2022 with current spot prices above the $84/Bbl WTI and $5.18/MMbtu HH average basis for establishing 2022 budgets. While half of survey respondents would maintain their budget regardless of changes in the oil and gas price one-third are willing to flex capex higher for rising cash flow. However Evercore believes upside is likely to remain muted as activity could be constrained by the availability of goods services and labor.

Operators have been highly disciplined over the past year as commodity prices increased. Yet a new round of consolidation may drive spending higher if commodity prices stabilize at a significantly higher range and confidence in the duration of the cycle increases. From a lower base Evercore believes the set-up is positive for growth in 2023 and beyond.

EIA FORECAST

The EIA’s Short-Term Energy Outlook published September 2022 reports that STEO is subject to heightened uncertainty resulting from Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and how sanctions affect Russia’s oil production. Also contributing to uncertainty is the production decisions of OPEC+ the rate at which U.S. oil and natural gas production rises and other contributing factors. Less robust economic activity in the STEO forecast could result in lower-than-expected energy consumption.

Oil price forecast. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has resulted in shifting trade patterns leaving Europe to find substitutes for Russia’s oil. This change has driven up the price of Brent contracts to a level high enough to reduce Asia’s imports of Brent and to retain more oil in Europe. EIA forecasts the spot price of Brent crude will average $98/bbl in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $97/bbl in 2023. The possibility of petroleum supply disruptions and slower-than-expected crude oil production growth continues to create the potential for higher oil prices while the possibility of slower-than-forecast economic growth creates the potential for lower prices.

Crude production forecast. U.S. crude oil production is forecast to average 11.8 MMbopd in 2022 and 12.6 MMbopd during 2023 which would set a record for the most U.S. oil output during a year. The current record is 12.3 MMbopd set in 2019.

Natural gas prices. In August the Henry Hub spot price averaged $8.80/MMBtu up from $7.28/MMBtu in July. Natural gas prices rose in August because of continued strong demand for natural gas in the electric power sector which has kept natural gas inventories below their five-year (2017–2021) average. EIA expects HH price to average $9/MMBtu in in the fourth quarter of 2022 and then fall to an average $6/MMBtu in 2023 as U.S. natural gas production rises.

Natural gas production. Dry natural gas production has been rising relatively steadily since the first quarter of 2022 when it averaged 94.6 Bcfd. EIA forecasts U.S. natural gas production to average 99.0 Bcfd during fourth-quarter 2022 and then rise to 100.4 Bcfd in 2023.

U.S. FORECAST

Given the restricted Russian supply demand recovery and resulting increase in crude prices operators working the various U.S. plays plan to noticeably increase drilling activity for the remainder of 2022. Overall activity in the Texas shale plays will improve in the second half of the year with the exception of District 7B District 8 and District 8A which will suffer slight second-half losses. However drilling on the Texas side of the Haynesville is projected to improve 26% on a y-o-y basis. Gulf of Mexico activity will increase 8.4% but a decline of 70% is forecast offshore California both on a y-o-y basis.

Gulf of Mexico. Higher oil prices should help boost activity slightly in the GOM and it appears that offshore operators are poised to resume limited development in 2022-2023 after last year’s decline Fig. 3. World Oil’s survey results and federal officials’ predicted well counts show a slight increase during second-half 2022. World Oil forecasts that GOM activity totaled 63 wells in the first half of the year with another 65 scheduled to be drilled during second-half 2022. The projected 128-well total will be 8.4% higher than 2021’s figure of 118. Footage drilled should be up 6.6% on a y-o-y basis.

STATE-BY-STATE OUTLOOK

Texas. Most of the shale plays in the Lone Star State are gaining ground during 2022. On a half-over-half basis World Oil predicts Texas wells will gain 11.6% with the 2022 total being 39% more than the 2021 figure. In the Permian basin (Fig. 4) District 8 will be up 8% in the second half buts its total will be 26% higher than wells drilled in 2021. Districts 7C and 8A will enjoy much-improved drilling activity with gains of 33% and 172% respectively compared to their 2021 totals.

The Eagle Ford forecast is also good with District 1 forecast to improve 30% in the second half and up 64% on a y-o-y basis. District 2 will experience a 4% gain in activity in the second half and is also projected to be up 26% on a y-o-y basis. District 4 in the Eagle Ford will experience a 47% increase between the two halves and post a massive 157% gain from 2021’s level. The reason that District 4 is surging is more gas-related activity. Of the 12 Railroad Districts 10 are forecast to experience gains with only two losing ground on a half-over-half basis. Again more gas drilling is a factor especially in RRC 6 with the Haynesville up 36% y-o-y.

DUC wells decline. According to EIA’s July 2022 tally the DUC total stood at 4277 a reduction of 1680 wells since July 2021 a reduction of 28%. In the Permian basin operators have completed 1092 DUC wells during the July 2022-July 2021 interval a reduction of 48%. All other regions declined too with the exception of the Haynesville which added 80 DUC wells up to 477 a y-o-y increase of 20%.

Oklahoma. Although the SCOOP and STACK plays are not as prolific as the Permian or Eagle Ford acreage in Kingfisher Canadian Blaine and Grady counties continues to attract interest for hydrocarbon development. But the region’s inconsistent geology and less-than-ideal shale formations have produced unpredictable results reducing ROI. However with higher oil prices the plays have become more attractive and we predict a major increase in Oklahoma’s activity. World Oil forecasts companies will drill 79% more wells in 2022 than last year’s total. Total footage will also surge forward 75% with operators making 15.7 MMft of hole.

Louisiana. In the state’s northern portion we forecast operators developing Haynesville shale gas will drill 25% more wells in 2022 than they did in 2021 with total footage up approximately 17%. With natural gas prices at near-record highs the increase in activity could continue similar to the Haynesville play in Texas RRC District 6. Despite near-record high natural gas prices DUCs in the Haynesville were up to 477 in July a jump of 20%. In the mature shallow oil plays of southern Louisiana we expect operators to drill 46% more wells compared to last year. Well footage is expected to increase 29% on a y-o-y basis.

North Dakota. The Bakken is running out of steam. Although transportation issues remain a challenge in this oil-rich shale play a greater concern is that the sweet spot has reached maximum infill development Fig. 5. However higher oil prices will help negate the cost of drilling the 21100-ft wells. Considering these factors along with data from state officials and World Oil operator surveys we forecast that drilling will be up a disappointing 4% with footage increasing 2.9% y-o-y in the Peace Garden State.

Northeast (Pa./W.V./Ohio). In the Northeast Marcellus activity is on an upward trend similar to other U.S. shale plays Fig. 6. Improving natural gas prices and increased LNG exports from Dominion Energy’s massive Cove Point facility are helping drive activity higher in the region. According to survey results operators tapping the high-quality reservoir in Pennsylvania will increase the number of wells drilled this year by 18% compared to the number drilled in 2021. Total footage for 2022 is forecast to jump 16.5%.

In Ohio operators working the Utica play plan to focus on growth and capitalize on higher gas prices with this year’s total well count expected to finish 30% higher than last year’s level. Footage is forecast to increase 31%. In West Virginia World Oil forecasts operators will drill 84 more wells than the number spudded in 2021 up 62%. We also forecast a 64% surge in total footage in the Mountain State. Despite surging gas prices operators working the shale fields of Appalachia were able to reduce the region’s DUC count by only eight wells in July on a y-o-y basis a reduction of just 11%.

Midwest (Illinois/Kansas). There are approximately 32100 oil and gas wells 10500 Class II injection wells and 1750 gas storage wells producing from 650 fields in Illinois. These wells are controlled by 1500 operators. There is oil production in 40 of the 102 counties mainly in the southern part of the state. Drilling will surge with a 61% increase in wells forecast for 2022 compared to 2021’s level. Although the wells are relatively shallow they provide work for the oilfield community and the drilling crews. We forecast a 59% jump in total footage.

In Kansas much of the shallow drilling in the Hugoton basin appears to stay below the Baker Hughes rig count radar. But according to the Kansas Corporation Commission drilling in the Sunflower State is projected to increase 24% in 2022 compared to the 1005 drilled in 2021. Total footage is forecast to jump 24%.

Rocky Mountains. The Denver Julesburg basin has experienced a constant decline since production peaked in November 2019. Reversing this trend will depend on the capital allocation from major operators in the region. The DJ basin accounted for 7% of oil and 6.6% of natural gas production in the Lower 48 in 2021 (GlobalData). While other U.S. basins have increased their rig count with the rise in commodity prices. Operators like Oxy and Chevron are earning better returns from investments in other basins but could grow production in the DJ by completing their DUC backlog.

In Colorado officials continue to attempt to ban or severely limit drilling in the state. In 2019 the state passed Senate Bill 118 “which fundamentally altered the oil and gas industry’s future in the state” according to Colorado Governor Jared Polis. However it appears companies intend to push back and continue operations on existing leases as World Oil expects operators in Colorado to drill 40% more wells in 2022 compared to activity during 2021. Total footage is projected to increase by 40% on a y-o-y basis.

In 2019 a federal judge ordered a halt to exploration on 300000 acres in Wyoming saying the government must account for its cumulative effect on climate change. The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by a pair of environmental groups challenging the BLM’s decision to lease federal lands for energy development in the state. Given that nearly 50% of all lands in Wyoming are owned by the federal government a ban on federal leasing would decimate the natural gas industry and Wyoming’s economy. Despite the ongoing lawsuit operators working in the state plan to increase drilling activity by 24% in 2022. World Oil predicts footage will increase 25%.

Canadian Overseas Petroleum received a resource report prepared by Ryder Scott that confirmed its deep oil discovery on lands in Converse and Natrona counties Wyoming. The report confirms the deep discovery has total original oil in place of 993.5 MMbbl. This supports the company’s conclusion that the Frontier 2 and Dakota discoveries are large stratigraphic oil accumulations encompassing the reserves at the company’s Cole Creek field. The report outlines 118 horizontal well locations to exploit the identified Frontier 2 and Dakota reserves. COPL plans to drill one Frontier 1 well and two horizontal Frontier 2 wells as part of its 2022-2023 drilling campaign commencing in fourth-quarter 2022.

Acreage in New Mexico has become as desirable as land on the Texas side of the Permian basin. Increased completion efficiencies in the Bone Springs formation will help support activity as drilling in the Land of Enchantment is forecast to increase 23% on a half-over-half basis and 30% y-o-y for 2022. Total footage will increase 33% y-o-y.

In California we expect onshore operators to spud four fewer wells in 2022 compared to 2021. But with no new discoveries operators working the Golden State are forced to survive by maintaining less-attractive heavy oil fields and residual acreage from long-ago discoveries. However considering the mature nature of these fields onshore footage is forecast to climb 15% (y-o-y) suggesting deeper total depths as operators squeeze out more oil from these old fields. Drilling offshore California will drop dramatically with only three wells expected in 2022 a y-o-y decline of 70%. Accordingly footage is forecast to drop 65%.

In Alaska the U.S. DOJ filed a brief defending the Willow project an energy development within the NPRA on Alaska’s North Slope that has been halted by litigation. The Biden administration announced it would review the Willow plan approved in 2020 by the Trump administration for consistency. The project is proposed by ConocoPhillips and if approved the project will provide 100000 bopd $10 billion in revenue for state local and federal governments during its lifespan 2000 construction jobs and 300 permanent jobs. It appears the prospect of opening new acreage is having the desired effect. Offshore work will surge 109% in 2022 12 more than spud in 2021. Onshore activity on the North Slope is projected to increase 67% with total footage up 67%.

Others. Activity in non-core producing states will also enjoy a jump in activity. Drilling will increase on a y-o-y basis in Alabama Arkansas Montana Nebraska and New York.",,,,,,,,,

Allan Kittleman would love to be Howard County executive again. So would current County Executive Calvin Ball. To achieve Republican Kittleman’s ambition he must defeat the same Democrat who thwarted his hope for a second term four years ago.

All things being equal a county exec who hasn’t upset a majority of constituents should win a second term. By that rule of thumb Kittleman probably should have won in 2018. He got 14000 more votes than he did in 2014 in defeating Democrat Courtney Watson.

Problem was all things were not equal in 2018. There was the blue wave. Democrats outraged by President Trump turned out in droves and voted for every Democrat on the ballot – except for Republican Gov. Larry Hogan.

Ball a three-term county council member beat Kittleman by CORRECTION 8000 votes. Riding the huge Democratic turnout Ball got 25000 more votes than Watson did against Kittleman in 2014 a gain of 50%.

Surprisingly without any polling data to support his dim view of Ball’s tenure Kittleman got into the race last year and has spent much of the time trying to persuade the populace that Ball has done a crummy job. It’s a bit of a role switch for the typically mild-mannered and sunny Kittleman a libertarian conservative who tends to look on the bright side of things.

Kittleman turned up the negative at a Howard County Chamber of Commerce forum Aug. 16 repeating the same charges he has made throughout the campaign.

Kittleman’s charges

Crime is up in Howard County people feel unsafe and Ball has demoralized the police force. Ball has the backing of the police and fire unions but not the rank and file says Kittleman who has the endorsement of several former police chiefs. Ball has removed school resource officers from the middle schools too.

Ball has also supported the school superintendent’s move to shift students in public schools based on social demographic factors busing some students away from their “neighborhood schools” where they belong says Kittleman.

Ball has raised taxes such as the fire tax resulting in a surplus that should be returned to taxpayers. He shows up at ribbon cuttings for new businesses but his office is unresponsive to business owners who call.

The Ball administration is paying fines and attorney fees in a lawsuit where Ball’s CORRECTION: administrative aid deputy chief of staff – who was also also being paid by his campaign – turned down legitimate requests for emails sent by a developer attorney.

administrative aid – who was also also being paid by his campaign – turned down legitimate requests for emails sent by a developer attorney. Ball is taking money from big donors while Kittleman is relying on the new public financing that matches county funds to small campaign contributions.

This last charge is the most ironic. As county executive Kittleman vetoed the public campaign financing bill co-sponsored by council member Ball because it required funding from taxpayer dollars. Now Ball is benefitting from the major contributions from developers and county contractors that incumbent executives get– as Kittleman once did—and has $865000 in his campaign account.

Kittleman whose veto was overridden conceded: “I didn’t realize how great a program it was.” As to getting money from taxpayers who might not support a candidate “I don’t think there’s any other way to do it” Kittleman said.

Ball responds

Ball doesn’t take the bait on most of Kittleman’s charges. He is clearly annoyed about the claim of lack transparency on the denied emails that showed no apparent wrongdoing. Ball calls it a “political stunt” by a former Republican official that wasted thousands of dollars and was part of Kittleman “supporters weaponizing the Public Information Act” flooding the executive’s office with requests.

Howard County schools are “some of the best in the nation” and Ball has provided them over $1 billion in record funding as well as curing the school system’s health fund deficit. And those SROs are now in all the high schools not the minority of middle schools that felt targeted. Ball also notes that Kittleman sought the police union endorsement last time that he finds “meaningless” now.

Development permits have gone down 70% and Ball has put forward a plan that shows “we are making progress on affordable housing.”

Ball is particularly proud of Howard County’s response to the Covid pandemic with one of the highest vaccination rates in the nation. He touts solar energy projects energy-saving LEDs in all the streetlights enhanced forest protection and “historic investment in road resurfacing.”

Lack of media

How much of this is resonating with Howard County voters? How could it? There are few reporters covering Howard County government and politics far fewer reporters and media than there were 20 years ago when there were 80000 fewer residents here. Facebook posts are no substitute for real reporters.

Both Ball and Kittleman privately bemoan the lack of coverage. Ball’s media folks put out a positive press release almost every day on projects and programs big and small. Much as there is little coverage of the things that go wrong in county government — the stories Kittleman likes to highlight — there is little reporting on the good things that go right. Stories and columns in a monthly business newspaper are significant but they can’t replace the daily and weekly barrage of journalism by knowledgeable reporters and editors who knew the turf back in the day.

Kittleman’s public financing can hardly fund the kind of massive advertising campaign that would publicize his charges against Ball.

On top of that Ball pointed out that Kittleman has spent so much energy telling voters “what is always going wrong” that he has offered little positive vision of what he would do in a second term. With the help of federal Covid spending and a booming property assessment base Ball is promising more of what he’s delivered for four years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS93aHktYS00NTAwMDAtc3F1YXJlLWZvb3Qtb2ZmaWNlLWJ1aWxkaW5nLWluLXBseW1vdXRoLWlzLWFib3V0LXRvLW1lZXQtdGhlLXdyZWNraW5nLWJhbGwvNjAwMjAzNTkwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why a 450000-square-foot office building in Plymouth is about to meet the wrecking ball,"With more than 1000 empty parking spaces and do-not-enter signs taped to several locked doors Prudential's 75-acre office campus in Plymouth feels nearly abandoned.

It's been that way nearly since the beginning of the pandemic when the company sent most of its workers home leaving the 450000-square-foot office building nearly empty. And like a lot of large companies Prudential began re-evaluating its space needs.

Late last month the company sold the property to a pair of development companies that decided that although the building is only 42 years old it doesn't have the features and amenities most companies want. Demolition is the only sensible option they determined.

""It's getting more and more difficult to fill existing [office] space ... and that's a really tough building to repurpose"" said Jeff Koch principal partner of Twin Cities-based Roers Cos. ""But it's a perfect site for residential.""

Koch and Dan Salzer a director of development for Scannell Properties said that over the next five years the team plans to spend $300 million to build 12 to 15 buildings that will include rental apartments medical offices and retail space in what will become one of the biggest redevelopment projects in the metro.

While there's plenty of demand for housing demand for traditional office space is weak and the future of the sector remains uncertain brokers say.

An estimated 18 to 25 % of all office space in the Twin Cities is empty and the situation is likely to worsen as leases expire and companies downsize leaving vacancy rates elevated for the ""foreseeable future"" according to a new report from Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL)

The group said the average vacancy rate for offices across the metro has increased slightly since the beginning of the year rising to 18% during the second quarter.

""Large tenants are still hunkered down and figuring out how and what hybrid work means"" said Jon Dahl a managing director in Minneapolis for JLL.

He said smaller companies are having an easier time determining their future space needs because they have a better handle on what works and what doesn't. Most of the active shoppers are in the market for spaces with 2000 to 10000 square feet. A few companies Dahl said are on hunt for 30000 to 40000 square feet.

""Small tenants are wanting new space and moving into new buildings"" he said. ""But there's a lot more movement than there normally would be.""

Dahl said that in a normal market there's a 75% probability of a tenant renewing but those odds are now below 50%. Still Dahl thinks the vacancy rate in downtown is close to leveling out.

Cushman Wakefield's estimates are even more dour. The company's second-quarter report shows that the average office vacancy rate across the metro was closer to 25% after hovering at around 18% for the three years prior to the pandemic.

The group said that leasing activity across the metro has remained relatively steady over the past several quarters. But for the eighth consecutive quarter more office space has been vacated than occupied.

Excluding the massive vacancy at City Center after Target Corp. left the building absorption during the second quarter was slightly positive given that several companies have signed leases and there have been several high-profile move-ins especially in downtown Minneapolis.

Those recently signed deals included Fox Rothschild which is taking nearly 40000 square feet of that former Target space. ESG Architecture & Design said it will take 20000 square feet at the new North Loop Green. In both cases however those new leases are downsizings from previous offices creating a net increase in available space.

During the second quarter Agiliti and HelpSystems moved into One Southwest Crossing and the Pohlad Cos. and JLL moved into their new office space at the RBC Gateway tower.

Demand has been especially strong in the North Loop which is now back to pre-pandemic leasing levels. The buildings in that area he said have the kinds of amenities and features that many companies want. Canteen One for example announced a move from the suburbs to a more than 40000-square-foot space in the North Loop.

""Companies are not shying away from quality space"" Paul Donovan executive director at Cushman Wakefield said. ""They just want less of it.""

With more than 2.3 million square feet of ""active office requirements"" (companies looking for space) JLL says leasing activity might increase slightly in the second half of 2022. If so that could push some new speculative office development forward in downtown Minneapolis and St. Louis Park's West End.

Though the future of the office sector is uncertain many investors are still shopping for and buying office properties especially those with the best amenities and in the best locations.

There have been several notable deals this year including the recent sale of the 1.7 million-square-foot Normandale Lake Office Park to Opal Holdings its first acquisition in the Minneapolis-St. Paul market.

That property which was nearly fully leased quickly found a buyer after being marketed but it closed for slightly less than the $369 million the seller paid in 2014.

Overall though investment sales have been relatively slow since the beginning of the pandemic. Higher interest rates have put downward pressure on prices and rising construction costs have only made such deals more challenging.

Still higher vacancy rates aren't necessarily leading to bargains for redevelopment sites. Koch said that when he first contacted Prudential to see if it would be willing to sell even a portion of its property in Plymouth he expected a deal. That wasn't the case.

""We thought we'd see a fire sale for office properties"" Koch said. ""We thought we'd get this for pennies on the dollar.""

Koch said that even at market prices it still made sense to do the acquisition. He'd long seen opportunity in the rolling hills and ponds on the Prudential property which he passed on his daily commute.

So just after the start of the pandemic thinking the company might be looking to downsize its holdings he made the call. His timing was perfect. The company said it was willing to sell the entire property.

Since closing at the end of August the development process has just begun. Land preparation is expected to begin in 2023 and it'll take about five years to fully redevelop the site into retail medical office buildings multifamily residential and a business park.

""This is going to be a vibrant new destination for the community"" Scannell said. ""Where people can live work shop eat and gather.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvaW53b3JsZC5jb20vbmV3cy91cy1jb2lucy9tYXJrZXQtYW5hbHlzaXMtbG93LWJhbGwtMTkzMC1zLWdvbGQtZG91YmxlLWVhZ2xl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Market Analysis: 'Low-ball' 1930-S gold double eagle,"The Stack’s Bowers Galleries and Heritage auctions held the week after the American Numismatic Association World’s Fair of Money at the auctioneers’ headquarters were massive this year.

Among the offerings a few standouts at Heritage included some coins that are rarely seen like a Professional Coin Grading Service certified About Good 3 1930-S Saint-Gaudens gold $20 double eagle with a green Certified Acceptance Corp. sticker that realized $44400 on Aug. 24.

The San Francisco Mint issue is a late rarity in the series with around 75 estimated to have survived from 74000 struck since most were melted around the time of issue. Nearly all survivors are Mint State or nearly so but this one has extensive wear with design elements that merge with the rim.

Heritage wrote: “This coin was clearly carried as a pocket piece and it may well be unique in this grade among 1930-S double eagles. A true once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the low-ball Registry collector.”

Before you sign up for a new credit card it can help to compare a few major issuers and their unique card offerings rewards structures and regular benefits and perks. One major comparison to take a look at is Chase Bank vs. Bank of America mostly because both of these issuers offer popular rewards credit cards that can help you score flexible rewards for each dollar you spend.

Maybe you already have a couple of credit cards in mind or maybe you want to do a basic comparison of all the cash back and travel credit cards each issuer offers. Either way this guide will help you decide between two banking giants — Chase Bank vs. Bank of America — before you sign up for your next credit card.

Bank of America overview

Bank of America has more than 4000 retail financial centers nationwide and roughly 16000 ATMs. Currently this card issuer also boasts 19 different credit cards which include rewards credit cards co-branded airline credit cards secured credit cards student credit cards and more.

Credit card features

If you’re wondering about the features you’ll get with a Bank of America credit card it really depends on the unique card offer you sign up for. Some cards offer cash back or welcome bonuses while others offer lower ongoing interest rates an introductory APR offer or credit-building tools.

However premium credit cards from Bank of America are likely to come with even more perks. For example the Bank of America® Premium Rewards® credit card comes with up to $100 in airline incidental credits annually up to a $100 credit for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck access to the Visa Signature Luxury Hotel Collection trip delay insurance trip cancellation/interruption coverage baggage delay insurance a lost luggage reimbursement an auto rental collision damage waiver and emergency evacuation and transportation coverage. This card also comes with extended warranty coverage purchase protection and return protection.

Approval odds and restrictions

Since Bank of America offers secured credit cards for bad credit this bank is likely a better option than Chase if you need to build credit or repair your credit.

It’s also worth noting that Bank of America lets you check for prequalified credit card offers on the website without a hard inquiry on your credit report. This feature lets you enter basic information to find out which Bank of America cards you might be eligible for. However there’s no guarantee you will ultimately be approved.

When it comes to getting approved for a Bank of America credit card note that restrictions may apply. For example you may face a 24-month rule — which says you cannot be approved if you have had the same card product within the last two years — for specific card offerings. Bank of America also reportedly has a 2/3/4 rule which may limit you to two Bank of America credit cards in a 30-day period three cards in a 12-month period and four cards in a 24-month period.

Mobile banking

If you’re looking for a credit card that lets you track your purchases payments and rewards with your mobile device you should know that Bank of America has an award-winning digital banking platform that is currently accessed by 55 million mobile users. With the Bank of America mobile app you’ll be able to customize your dashboard access your FICO score transfer money pay bills deposit checks and more. You’ll also have the benefit of fingerprint sign-in which can ward off hackers and thieves. Other security features you can access with the app include alerts for suspicious activity and zero fraud liability.

Chase Bank overview

Chase has more than 4700 banking locations nationwide as well as more than 16000 ATMs. It also boasts 36 different credit cards which include rewards credit cards student credit cards co-branded airline and hotel credit cards Disney credit cards Amazon credit cards and business credit cards.

Credit card features

Cash back credit cards from Chase typically include welcome offers extended warranty coverage purchase protection trip cancellation/interruption insurance an auto rental collision damage waiver and travel and emergency assistance services. Other benefits may include cellphone protection or exclusive merchant promotions.

Meanwhile some of the best travel credit cards from Chase come with benefits like 1:1 points transfers to airline and hotel partners no foreign transaction fees trip cancellation/interruption insurance baggage delay insurance or a lost luggage reimbursement an auto rental collision damage waiver a trip delay reimbursement and emergency travel assistance or evacuation coverage. The Chase Sapphire Reserve® a premium travel credit card also comes with airport lounge access an up to $300 annual travel credit and an up to $100 credit for Global Entry TSA Precheck or NEXUS among many other benefits.

Approval odds and restrictions

Chase does not offer any credit cards for consumers with poor credit. In fact all Chase credit cards are geared toward consumers with good to excellent credit.

Chase also limits new credit card welcome bonuses and approvals within specific card families. For example both Chase Sapphire cards — which include the Chase Sapphire Reserve and the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card — have the following wording in their fine print: “This product is available to you if you do not have any Sapphire card and have not received a new cardmember bonus for any Sapphire card in the past 48 months.”

In addition before you apply for a new credit card from Chase you should know about Chase’s 5/24 rule. This rule states that you cannot get approved for a Chase credit card if you have opened five or more cards — from any issuer — within the past 24 months.

Mobile banking

Like Bank of America Chase also offers a very versatile mobile app. The app lets you keep track of your credit card purchases make payments and track your rewards using your mobile device. Chase banking customers can also benefit from perks like mobile check deposit online bill pay and more. The Chase mobile app also supports fingerprint sign-in and facial recognition and you can use the app to lock and unlock your credit card if it has been lost or stolen.

Chase vs. Bank of America: Rewards programs

When comparing Chase vs. Bank of America you’ll also want to learn about each issuer’s rewards program and determine which type of rewards you want to earn.

Bank of America rewards program

Redemption options

Bank of America credit cards come with a number of potential redemption options. For example depending on the card you have you may be able to redeem your rewards for statement credits gift cards deposits to an eligible Bank of America or Merrill account or Bank of America Travel Center purchases.

In some cases such as with the Bank of America® Travel Rewards credit card you can redeem your Bank of America travel rewards points for statement credits to cover a wide range of travel and dining purchases including flights hotel stays campgrounds boat rentals public transit tourist attractions restaurants takeout bars nightclubs and many others.

Additionally note that Bank of America travel cards currently don’t offer the option to transfer points to airline and hotel programs.

Bank of America Preferred Rewards

Although the Bank of America Preferred Rewards program isn’t strictly a credit card rewards program it does help Bank of America customers earn 25 percent to 75 percent more rewards for each dollar they spend on their cards.

To qualify for this program you must have an eligible Bank of America checking account and a three-month combined average daily balance of $20000 or more in qualifying Bank of America or Merrill accounts.

The minimum balance qualifications and rewards bonuses for each program tier are:

Tier Gold Platinum Platinum Honors Minimum balance $20000 $50000 $100000 Rewards bonus 25% 50% 75%

The rewards bonus you’ll receive can make a substantial difference. For example the Bank of America Premium Rewards card normally offers 2X points on travel and dining purchases and 1.5X points on all other purchases. However Platinum Honors members with this card earn 3.5X points on travel and dining purchases and 2.62X points on all other purchases.

Chase Ultimate Rewards program

Redemption options

Many top Chase credit cards earn rewards in the Chase Ultimate Rewards program including their cash back cards and travel cards. In most cases Chase Ultimate Rewards points can be redeemed for cash back direct deposits statement credits gift cards merchandise travel shopping at Amazon or via PayPal Apple products and Chase dining or experiences. If you have a premium travel credit card from Chase such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred or the Chase Sapphire Reserve you can even transfer your points to Chase travel partners at a 1:1 ratio.

Chase travel partners and rewards

Although Bank of America offers some pretty nice incentives to customers who keep at least $20000 in eligible accounts Chase really stands out in terms of its travel rewards program. For example some Chase cards provide more value for your points when you redeem them for travel. Specifically the Chase Sapphire Reserve offers a 50 percent points boost when you redeem your points for travel through Chase Ultimate Rewards and the Chase Sapphire Preferred and Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card offer a 25 percent points boost for travel redemptions through Chase Ultimate Rewards.

Chase also partners with the following hotel and airline programs:

Airline partners

Aer Lingus AerClub

Air Canada Aeroplan

British Airways Executive Club

Emirates Skywards

Air France / KLM Flying Blue

Iberia Plus

JetBlue TrueBlue

Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer

Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards

United MileagePlus

Virgin Atlantic Flying Club

Hotel partners

IHG Rewards Club

Marriott Bonvoy

World of Hyatt

The bottom line

At the end of the day both Chase and Bank of America have some pretty intriguing credit card offers. However Chase really stands out in terms of its travel credit cards and redemption options for rewards while Bank of America is much more attractive if you’re a Bank of America Preferred Rewards customer or if you need to build or rebuild your credit.

If neither issuer seems like a good fit for you there are other top card issuers to consider as well. If you want the best rewards credit card for your needs and goals make sure you also consider options from American Express Capital One Citi Discover and Wells Fargo.

Under the trial program which was announced on Tuesday Bank of America will offer loans to people in certain predominantly Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in Charlotte N.C.; Dallas; Detroit; Los Angeles and Miami. Eligibility for the program which is called the Community Affordable Loan Solution is based on income and location and requires no mortgage insurance.

AJ Barkley the head of neighborhood and community lending for Bank of America said the goal of the program was to help individuals and families particularly Black and Hispanic people build wealth over time.

“It allows us to revitalize minority communities” she said in an interview noting that anyone looking to buy a home in one of the designated neighborhoods could apply for a loan under the program. She said that the bank aimed to expand the program to other cities in the future and that it was also offering educational resources to help buyers navigate the process.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvYmFuay1vZi1hbWVyaWNhLWlzLXRhcmdldGluZy13b21lbi1hbmQtbWlub3JpdHktYnVzaW5lc3Nlcy13aXRoLWRvd24tcGF5bWVudHMtb24tbG9hbnMtaW4tc2VsZWN0LW1hcmtldHMtMTE2NjIxNDA2NDfSAZoBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0d2F0Y2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9iYW5rLW9mLWFtZXJpY2EtaXMtdGFyZ2V0aW5nLXdvbWVuLWFuZC1taW5vcml0eS1idXNpbmVzc2VzLXdpdGgtZG93bi1wYXltZW50cy1vbi1sb2Fucy1pbi1zZWxlY3QtbWFya2V0cy0xMTY2MjE0MDY0Nw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bank of America is targeting women and minority businesses with down payments on loans in select markets,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bank-of-america-is-targeting-women-and-minority-businesses-with-down-payments-on-loans-in-select-markets-11662140647 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvYmFuay1vZi1hbWVyaWNhLWlzLXRhcmdldGluZy13b21lbi1hbmQtbWlub3JpdHktYnVzaW5lc3Nlcy13aXRoLWRvd24tcGF5bWVudHMtb24tbG9hbnMtaW4tc2VsZWN0LW1hcmtldHMtMTE2NjIxNDA2NDfSAZoBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0d2F0Y2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9iYW5rLW9mLWFtZXJpY2EtaXMtdGFyZ2V0aW5nLXdvbWVuLWFuZC1taW5vcml0eS1idXNpbmVzc2VzLXdpdGgtZG93bi1wYXltZW50cy1vbi1sb2Fucy1pbi1zZWxlY3QtbWFya2V0cy0xMTY2MjE0MDY0Nw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1saXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDkvYmFuay1vZi1hbWVyaWNhLWxhdW5jaGVzLXplcm8tZG93bi1tb3J0Z2FnZXMtaW4tc2VsZWN0LWNpdGllcy1vbmUtaXMtaW4tbWljaGlnYW4uaHRtbNIBhwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tbGl2ZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA5L2Jhbmstb2YtYW1lcmljYS1sYXVuY2hlcy16ZXJvLWRvd24tbW9ydGdhZ2VzLWluLXNlbGVjdC1jaXRpZXMtb25lLWlzLWluLW1pY2hpZ2FuLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bank of America launches zero down mortgages in select cities. One is in Michigan.,"First-time homebuyers have a new lending option to help them get into the market.

Bank of America announced a new zero down payment zero closing cost mortgage solution for first-time homebuyers.

The new loan will be available in designated markets with an emphasis on serving Black/African American and/or Hispanic-Latino neighborhoods.

The first cities to be eligible in the pilot are Charlotte Dallas Detroit Los Angeles and Miami.

The company’s Community Affordable Loan Solution will use credit guidelines based on factors such as timely rent utility bill phone and auto insurance payments. It requires no mortgage insurance or minimum credit score.

Individual eligibility is based on income and home location. Prospective buyers must complete a homebuyer certification course provided by select Bank of America and HUD-approved housing counseling partners prior to application.

“Homeownership strengthens our communities and can help individuals and families to build wealth over time” said AJ Barkley head of neighborhood and community lending for Bank of America. “Our Community Affordable Loan Solution will help make the dream of sustained homeownership attainable for more Black and Hispanic families and it is part of our broader commitment to the communities that we serve.”

The cost of buying a home is about 80% more expensive now than just three summers ago according to the National Association of Realtors. Coupled with high prices mortgage rates have been increasing as a result of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes.

Mortgage rates are reaching almost double what they were a year ago according to Freddie Mac. The 30-year rate hit 5.66% and the 15-year hit 4.98% on Sept. 1.

The competitive housing market has made affordability a top issue in the real estate sector. It has also widened the racial disparity between homebuyers with Black and Hispanic applicants being 7% more likely to be rejected for mortgage loans than their white counterparts according to the NAR.

There is a nearly 30-percentage-point gap in homeownership between white and Black Americans. Homeownership rates for Black Americans are lower than they were in 2010 according to the NAR.

Hispanic buyers have seen record growth in the housing market with Hispanic American homeownership at an all-time high and above 50% for the first time.

However the gap between Hispanic homebuyers and their white counterparts is nearly 20%

In 2011 Bank of America agreed to pay $335 million to settle the Justice Department’s allegations that its Countrywide Financial unit charged higher rates and fees to around 200000 qualified Black and Hispanic borrowers “solely because of their race or national origin” according to reporting by The New York Times.

In 2019 the bank launched its Community Homeownership Commitment which offers to grant options for down payment and closing costs. The goal is to help 60000 individuals and families purchase affordable homes by 2025.

So far more than 36000 people and families have used the program. Bank of America has provided more than $9.5 billion in low down payment loans and over $350 million in non-repayable down payment and/or closing cost grants.

To date two-thirds of the loans and grants made through the Community Homeownership Commitment has helped multicultural clients to achieve homeownership according to Bank of America.

The new program is geared toward first-time homebuyers including in designated neighborhoods in Charlotte Dallas Detroit Los Angeles and Miami. Bank of America said the program will not take a borrower's credit score into account when applying for a home loan. Instead creditworthiness will be based on such factors as timely payment of rent as well as phone auto insurance and utility bills.

""Our Community Affordable Loan Solution will help make the dream of sustained homeownership attainable for more Black and Hispanic families and it is part of our broader commitment to the communities that we serve"" AJ Barkley Bank of America's head of neighborhood and community lending said in a statement.

Black and Hispanic families typically don't have a large stash of cash on hand to fund a home down payment and closing costs so Bank of America removing those barriers will certainly help someone on the hunt for home Indiana University finance professor Jun Zhu told CBS News.

""If you have a program with no down payment and no closing costs it can help minority families to fill the gap between available savings and upfront cash needed"" said Zhu an expert on mortgage financing and housing affordability.

To qualify for the Bank of America program applicants must seek to buy a home in one of the five cities and complete a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development-certified homebuyer course. Applicants won't need mortgage insurance after they've acquired the loan.

Rates of homeownership vary dramatically across racial and ethnic groups thanks to differences in wealth and the legacy of historic discrimination. About 7 in 10 White households own homes while only 4 in 10 Black households and 5 in 10 Hispanic households do according to the National Association of Realtors.

Editor's note: The initial version of this story wrongly stated that only Black and Hispanic borrowers are eligible for a mortgage under Bank of America's Community Affordable Loan Solution program. In fact the program is eligible to all borrowers based on their income and home location."

This was seen when credit cards came into the picture and turned out to become their ultimate cash cow. Then came internet adoption with net banking followed by entire banking portals and mobile applications.And it seems the next step in their evolution is the inclusion of cryptocurrency. In this article we learn what crypto-friendly banks mean their services and even a few famous examples of such banks. Let’s get started.Crypto-friendly banks are nothing but traditional banks that have begun to offer certain crypto-related services. In most cases increased customer demand for crypto services pushes conventional banks into the digital asset space. This can be explained with the example of JPMorgan Chase in America one of the biggest banks in the U.S. that began providing services like crypto safety deposits and more due to customer demands.For banks to include crypto services is a step in the right direction. It would make crypto transacting holding and investing a breeze considering that these services will be available to customers on the same user-friendly dashboards they use for banking. The vastly reduced learning curve would also bring more people to crypto. Crypto-friendly banks are also an indication of the large institutions coming to terms with crypto as a definite part of the future of humanity.It is pretty easy for anyone to confuse crypto-friendly banks with crypto banks. However they are two very different entities. Crypto-friendly banks are traditional banks that have expanded their scope to include certain crypto services. In contrast crypto banks are made entirely for crypto users and offer various crypto services.A common example of a crypto-friendly bank is Morgan Stanley. The investment banking giant has opened crypto services to customers worth more than $2 million. These elite customers can now buy store and even yield interest or invest in cryptocurrency funds with Morgan Stanley. Other crypto-friendly banks include Goldman Sachs Bank of New York Mellon Vast Bank BankProv USAA etc.On the other hand a famous example of a crypto bank could be Juno. It is a digital bank that prides itself as the gateway to Web3 and the world of crypto. It is known worldwide for its low transaction fees and high returns with rates going up to 6 percent on Ethereum and Bitcoin. Other crypto banks include Ally Bank Nuri Revolut etc.This refers to the storage of tokens and other digital assets. Instead of maintaining a hardware wallet you can count on your bank to keep your digital assets safe as you do with your fiat currency.We already work as a global village where sometimes payments across countries happen via crypto to reduce the hassle and increase the speed. With your traditional bank offering crypto payment processing you would have a much easier time delivering work and getting paid. This is also useful for businesses looking to accept crypto payments on their website or mobile application.These are the simplest of banking services but in terms of crypto. The tokens you hold can be lent to others for an interest rate through your bank and you can also use your tokens as collateral to borrow a loan. Some banks will also offer crypto debit and credit cards along with a checking account for digital assets.Just a few years ago the idea of traditional banks offering crypto services was unheard of. Therefore with so many of the biggest names in the finance sector hurrying to join the digital asset bandwagon the future of the crypto industry seems promising.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL21pYW1pLzIwMjIvMDkvMDIvaGVyZS1hcmUtdGhlLXJlc2ktcHJvamVjdHMtcGxhbm5lZC1mb3ItZG93bnRvd24tbWlhbWkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here Are Resi Projects Planned for Downtown Miami,"Leaflet map created by Adam Farence | Data by © OpenStreetMap under ODbl.

Text description provided by the architects. Jocheon is a small village on the northeastern coast of Jeju. It is a seaside village known as a great place to see the sunrise every day. To the north is the blue sea of Jocheon and freshwater springs from the ground near the beach. Jocheon has been a clean and abundant village with clean spring water which was used by the people for washing and drinking before the waterworks were installed. This plot of land silently watching over the sea is about 18 square meters in size and is on the boundary between the beach of Jocheon and the freshwater springs.

This was a place for the travelers to begin and end their day. So what did it have to offer? We focused on the element of ‘water’ as harbored by the beach of Jocheon. We wanted the most daily element to give the most non-daily experience in this space. ‘Taking a bath’ is a very simple and daily action yet a powerful ritual of rearranging one’s mind and relieving the physical and mental fatigue. The Chinese character for bath is 浴 (Yok).

It represents the pouring water and means to clean the wastes with the force of water flowing downwards. We planned this space to be a place for relaxing and recharging focusing on the acts of washing and wiping in a space filled with various forms of water such as pouring water gushing water still water gazing water and steam.

The Jocheon Yokjang is a small bath place consisting of 3 floors that are about 15 square meters each. The building was designed to be within 50 square meters without a parking area so that the yard can be used more widely and it is a private space for only 2 people. The 3rd floor is a bathing space with an ocean view and various washing experiences. The 2nd floor is the bedroom and the 1st floor is the kitchen. The vertical concrete building is only open on the sides that come in contact with nature.

Only the surfaces that accept the ocean view and light are open and all other surfaces are completely shut from the outer world. The concrete walls have wood grain patterns that hold the movement of light. Along the basalt wall is the entrance path that opens into the garden and through the garden is the inside of the house. The entrance path is long enough to heighten the immersion in the space and the unpredictable changes of the space diversify the experience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxzaW1wbGUuY29tL2hvdy1vZnRlbi1zaG91bGQteW91LWNoYW5nZS15b3VyLWJhdGgtdG93ZWwtODY0NDg2NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's How Often You Should Change Your Bath Towel,"After a shower you probably throw your bath towel over a wall hook to dry. It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

BATH Maine — To address a growing need for diverse housing options a new affordable apartment complex was built in Bath and on Wednesday locals got to take a look during a grand opening.



Made possible through several tax credits and the guidance of MaineHousing the new 60-unit complex was developed by The Szanton Company and sits on the corner of Front and Summer streets.



Forty-two units will be reserved for those 55 and older and cost between $800 and $1500 a month to rent according to the developers.

""The mission of The Szanton Company is to create rental apartments that are moderate- to low-income which our tenants are proud to call home"" company President Nathan Szanton said at the grand opening.



The building also features several community spaces a rooftop deck and some mixed-use retail spaces some of which have already been renting before renovations and changes. Bookstore owner Jim Rice said as a retail and housing tenant seeing more affordable housing come to the downtown area is much-needed.

""Bath is in demand. It's really popular now and it's gotten more expensive"" Rice said. ""For me being right by the bookstore is ideal.""



With employers drawing folks to the midcoast area in recent years Bath Housing Authority Executive Director Deborah Keller said she is hopeful the development will address a need for diverse housing options in the greater Bath area."

The essays collected in FIRE SEASON: Selected Essays 1984-2021 (352 pp. Seven Stories paper $23.95) are erudite discomforting and often caustic — and almost always spot on which is a little sad because they tell us such ugly true things.

Indiana was the art critic for The Village Voice in the 1980s and is a multigenre artist. “Fire Season” presents 35 years of his political and cultural criticism much of it chilling to read in hindsight; he has been warning us for example about Vladimir Putin at least since the days when Chechnya was the war zone and Anna Politkovskaya was the journalist targeted for murder. He apprehended a terror in the Boston Marathon bombing much deeper than what other writers offered presenting a global context that makes the unfathomable seem inevitable. (“Why did they do it?” he writes of the Tsarnaev brothers. “Why wouldn’t they?”)

These essays are not arranged chronologically or by topic; they seem ordered to carefully explicate a darkness that has “been allowed to metastasize ever since the presidency of Ronald Reagan” but is rooted in the Kennedy assassination. That frames Indiana’s writing in the baby boom but such an easy frame would miss the more universal point. In the opening essay on the work of the artist Barbara Kruger Indiana writes that “empathy can in fact change the world … but if you don’t even try the incurably ugly side of human nature has already won the war inside us all.” This provides a guide to reading the collection as each of these essays is fully engaged in that war.

Indiana’s views penetrate so far beyond the usual pabulum that it requires a bit of moral courage to read them and a dark sense of humor would also help. “Up close Bill Clinton looks like he’s covered in fresh fetal tissue” he observes in his essay on the 1992 presidential campaign. Whether Indiana’s voice is disturbing or hilarious depends largely on the reader’s relationship to sarcasm. Either way “Fire Season” immortalizes a peerless voice one that describes a falling floor that may never find its bottom.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmllL3JlZ2lvbmFscy93aWNrbG93L2JyYXktbmV3cy9zdXBlcnZhbHUtdG8tc3BvbnNvci1zcG9ydGluZy1ncmV5c3RvbmVzLzQxOTU2OTM0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SuperValu to sponsor Sporting Greystones | Irish Independent,"Daly’s SuperValu in Greystones is the newest sponsor to back Sporting Greystones the youths’ Soccer Club.

BD Aptra™ Digital Endoscope System is intended to be used by physicians to access visualize and perform procedures in the urinary tract and the kidney. The

instrument enables delivery and use of accessories such as biopsy forceps laser fibers graspers and retrieval baskets at a surgical site.

Contraindications

Diagnostic or therapeutic ureteroscopy is contraindicated in people with an untreated urinary tract infection.

Other contraindications to therapeutic ureteroscopy (e.g. lithotripsy endopyelotomy tumor therapy) are more numerous and can mirror those associated with the

corresponding open surgical interventions. Patients on anticoagulants or with coagulopathies should be managed appropriately.

Warnings

• Do not use electromedical energy sources in the presence of flammable detergents anesthetics nitrous oxide (N2O) or oxygen.

• Consult the user manuals of all electromedical energy sources used with endoscopic instruments for appropriate instruments warnings and cautions prior to

use. Such sources of energy include electrical electrohydraulic electrosurgical heat hydraulic laser light pressure sound ultrasound and vacuum.

• Do not insert or advance the ureteroscope unless there is a clear live endoscopic view of the lumen through which the scope is being advanced (or confirm with

visualization by other imaging modalities).

• During the procedure if the live endoscopic image is lost do not advance or insert the ureteroscope and do not insert advance or actuate accessories.

• Do not use excessive force while advancing or withdrawing the scope. If resistance is felt during advancement or withdrawal of the scope investigate the source

of resistance and/or take remedial action if necessary.

• Do not force the distal tip of the ureteroscope against the sidewall of the ureter or renal pelvis.

• Do not use excessive force when advancing or withdrawing an accessory within the ureteroscope.

• When inserting or using accessories maintain continuous visualization of the distal tip. Ensure that the distance between the distal tip of the ureteroscope and

the object in view is greater than the ureteroscope’s minimum visible distance. Failure to do so may result in the accessories causing patient injury.

• Do not withdraw a laser fiber back into the ureteroscope while the laser is firing. Doing so may cause patient injury and/or scope damage.

• Do not look directly into the light emitted from the ureteroscope.

• Verify ground isolation when setting up and using accessories from different manufacturers prior to procedure.

• Do not open the handle of the ureteroscope.

• The ureteroscope is a single-use device and there are no serviceable parts. Do not repair damaged or non-operating ureteroscopes. Do not use the ureteroscope

if damage is discovered or suspected.

• Do not excessively bend the flexible shaft or the articulating section of the ureteroscope.

• If damage to the ureteroscope occurs or it stops functioning during a procedure stop using the ureteroscope immediately. See troubleshooting section for more

information. Continue the procedure with a new ureteroscope as appropriate.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9jb2x1bWJ1c3RlbGVncmFtL25hbWUvbGVyb3ktam9obnNvbi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNjQwOTYxNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LeRoy Johnson Obituary (1937 - 2022) - Columbus NE - The Columbus Telegram,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/columbustelegram/name/leroy-johnson-obituary?id=36409614 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9jb2x1bWJ1c3RlbGVncmFtL25hbWUvbGVyb3ktam9obnNvbi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNjQwOTYxNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

Berkshire Hathaway has sold another 1.72 million shares after dropping 133 million earlier this week. At an average sale price of roughly $33.47 apiece which would represent a profit of more than 3200% given the purchase price of $1 per share.

Rumors had circulated recently that Buffett was planning to drop all of Berkshire’s holdings in the company which caused its shares to plunge but to date he still holds a sizable percentage of the company.

Bloomberg reports Berkshire Hathaway sold roughly 18 million BYD shares between June 30 and Sept. 1 having originally bought 225 million shares in September 2008.

That initial $232 million investment has so far returned over $7 billion.

BYD shares were down 6.5% in mid-morning trading Friday. Investors are spooked since the sales in the company are Buffett’s first in 14 years and play into rumors that Buffett is exiting BYD altogether. In July a stake sale roughly the size of Buffett’s holdings in BYD appeared in the Hong Kong exchange’s clearing system prompting speculation that the billionaire investor was preparing to dump all his firm’s holdings in the company.

Whether Buffett stays in or takes his profits BYD is in solid shape recently overtaking Tesla as the world’s largest electric vehicle maker. Earlier this week it reported car sales jumped 300% in the first half of this year compared with the first half of 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA5LzAyL3N0b2Nrcy1iaWxsaW9uYWlyZXMtd2FycmVuLWJ1ZmZldHQtZ2VvcmdlLXNvcm9zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 High-Flying Stocks That Billionaires Warren Buffett and George Soros Both Love,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA5LzAyL3N0b2Nrcy1iaWxsaW9uYWlyZXMtd2FycmVuLWJ1ZmZldHQtZ2VvcmdlLXNvcm9zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016710ACEE00>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA5LzAyL3N0b2Nrcy1iaWxsaW9uYWlyZXMtd2FycmVuLWJ1ZmZldHQtZ2VvcmdlLXNvcm9zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9ycy5jb20vbmV3cy9jaGluYS1ldi1zYWxlcy1uaW8tbGktYXV0by14cGVuZy13YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC1zZWxscy1ieWQtc3RvY2sv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China EV Sales: BYD Deliveries Keep Booming As Warren Buffett Sells More Shares,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.investors.com/news/china-ev-sales-nio-li-auto-xpeng-warren-buffett-sells-byd-stock/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9ycy5jb20vbmV3cy9jaGluYS1ldi1zYWxlcy1uaW8tbGktYXV0by14cGVuZy13YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC1zZWxscy1ieWQtc3RvY2sv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA5LTAyL2J5ZC1zdG9jay1zYWxlLWlzLWFuLW9sZC1zY2hvb2wtdmFsdWUtaW52ZXN0aW5nLW1vdmUtYnktYnVmZmV0dNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BYD Stock Sale Is an Old-School Value-Investing Move by Buffett,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA5LTAyL2J5ZC1zdG9jay1zYWxlLWlzLWFuLW9sZC1zY2hvb2wtdmFsdWUtaW52ZXN0aW5nLW1vdmUtYnktYnVmZmV0dNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016710ACDED0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA5LTAyL2J5ZC1zdG9jay1zYWxlLWlzLWFuLW9sZC1zY2hvb2wtdmFsdWUtaW52ZXN0aW5nLW1vdmUtYnktYnVmZmV0dNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbnNpb25nbG9iYWwuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3RoZS1tb3N0LWV4cGVuc2l2ZS1ob21lLWluLXNhcmF0b2dhLXNwcmluZ3MtbmV3LXlvcmstYXNrcy0xNy05LW1pbGxpb24tMDE2NjIxNTA3NDDSAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5tYW5zaW9uZ2xvYmFsLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZXMvdGhlLW1vc3QtZXhwZW5zaXZlLWhvbWUtaW4tc2FyYXRvZ2Etc3ByaW5ncy1uZXcteW9yay1hc2tzLTE3LTktbWlsbGlvbi0wMTY2MjE1MDc0MA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Most Expensive Home in Saratoga Springs New York Asks $17.9 Million,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbnNpb25nbG9iYWwuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3RoZS1tb3N0LWV4cGVuc2l2ZS1ob21lLWluLXNhcmF0b2dhLXNwcmluZ3MtbmV3LXlvcmstYXNrcy0xNy05LW1pbGxpb24tMDE2NjIxNTA3NDDSAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5tYW5zaW9uZ2xvYmFsLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZXMvdGhlLW1vc3QtZXhwZW5zaXZlLWhvbWUtaW4tc2FyYXRvZ2Etc3ByaW5ncy1uZXcteW9yay1hc2tzLTE3LTktbWlsbGlvbi0wMTY2MjE1MDc0MA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016710ACEB00>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbnNpb25nbG9iYWwuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3RoZS1tb3N0LWV4cGVuc2l2ZS1ob21lLWluLXNhcmF0b2dhLXNwcmluZ3MtbmV3LXlvcmstYXNrcy0xNy05LW1pbGxpb24tMDE2NjIxNTA3NDDSAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5tYW5zaW9uZ2xvYmFsLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZXMvdGhlLW1vc3QtZXhwZW5zaXZlLWhvbWUtaW4tc2FyYXRvZ2Etc3ByaW5ncy1uZXcteW9yay1hc2tzLTE3LTktbWlsbGlvbi0wMTY2MjE1MDc0MA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Things to know:



– We have just partnered with Best Buy to ensure that everyone can attain true ownership of their digital assets through the Nano X and Nano S Plus wallets.



– Sharp rise in hacks has increased importance of and demand for self-custody in crypto.





We are bringing our crypto-hardware devices to all Best Buy stores across the US starting today.

Best Buy leverages a unique combination of tech expertise and human touch to meet customers’ everyday needs with over 900 stores in the United States.

The Ledger Nano X and the Nano S Plus are now available for same-day pickup from Best Buy stores. Customers can pick up their Ledger within one hour across all Best Buy locations. There is no need to wait for delivery anyone can start protecting their crypto and digital assets immediately.

As part of an initial rollout Ledger devices were already available in a select number of Best Buy stores across the United States. Ledger devices quickly sold out at multiple locations and this in part led to the expansion to all stores. There is also a direct correlation between hacks and market volatility with an increase in the sales of hardware wallets.

Best Buy saw a spike in Ledger sales after recent hacks such as the widely-publicized Solana wallet hack and various bridge-related hacks. The heightened demand and interest around security also comes amidst the high-profile bankruptcy filings of exchanges such as Celsius and Voyager and withdrawal halts from the likes of Hodlnaut. The importance of owning your own keys has never been so important.

Pascal Gauthier Chairman and CEO of Ledger says: “There has never been a more important time to truly own your digital assets.

Would you have been able to spot all the scams?



Impersonating famous brands scammers send out fake text messages containing phishing links and try to entice you into opening them with various lies. Below are some examples.

Payment Scams

Sending you notifications about problems with your subscription to online services or confirmation of charges scammers prompt you to click on the attached link to review your account status or verify your information:

(Netflix) Hi member! This is a message to inform you that your payment failed. To keep watching your favorite TV shows follow this: <URL>

The phishing link will take you to a fake Netflix page. In this case it’s a page that shows random promotional codes. It will end up asking you for detailed payment information and your Netflix account login credentials.

Scammers will record everything you enter on the fake login page and use it to commit cybercrimes and steal your identity. Don’t let them!

Walmart is one of the most commonly impersonated companies in phishing scams. This week we detected one such phishing scam circulating via text message:

🍦 $203.34 charged by Walmart. Check out your dashboard for more: <URL>

Phishing links will often lead to online survey pages that state you can claim a gift by filling out an online questionnaire.

After you complete the questionnaire you are prompted to enter credit card details before your “gift” can be delivered. Of course there’s no gift and your personal information could be stolen. Be careful!

Sweepstakes Survey Scam

Speaking of fake survey pages scammers also love to spread them via emails featuring irresistible rewards such as the upcoming iPhone 14:

#1 – Best Buy (ft. iPhone 14 Pro Max)

We’ve observed a lot of fake Best Buy sweepstakes emails featuring the iPhone 14 as a gift.

Scammers promise you that you can win it by simply taking an online survey. If you take the bait again you could end up exposing your credentials on the fake pages. Beware!

#2 – USPS (ft. Samsung Galaxy S21)

Besides the iPhone 14 Samsung’s S21 is also a popular “free gift” in survey scams. Posing as USPS scammers trick you into joining their giveaway campaign via the embedded button that leads to a fake survey page.

Delivery Notification Scams

Another one of the scammers’ beloved tactics is fake delivery notifications. They falsely claim that you have missed the delivery of a package or that you have to pay a delivery fee before you can receive it. The notifications always contain a phishing link that the scammers want you to click on.

“Your package is coming!” “Get your suspended package!”

How to Stay Safe from Scams

Pay close attention to URLs — are they legitimate?

Double-check the sender’s mobile number/email address.

Free gifts and prizes are always a major red flag.

Go to the official website/application instead of using links from unknown sources.

Never click on links or attachments from unknown sources. Use Trend Micro Check to surf the web safely (it’s free!).

Back when I grew up fishing in the 1980s and 1990s there weren’t many spinning reels to choose from. Now there are dozens of manufacturers making hundreds of different models of spinning reels for the angling community. But that also made choosing the right spinning reel for your specific fishing a little more difficult.

At the end of the day I feel like there are three different types of anglers when it comes to buying spinning reels. There’s the super avid enthusiast angler who wants the absolute best there is if they can afford it. Then there is the angler that wants the most bang for their buck. And finally there is the angler who just wants a reel that works for the least amount possible.

So while price is a factor I think the majority of us anglers fall in that middle category where we want the absolute best reel we can get in our budget. So how do you determine that?

Well you factor in all the things that makes a spinning reel good. While price matters in any purchasing decision if you’re looking for a good spinning reel for fishing it really comes down to these factors:

Smoothness of retrieve

Drag consistency

Castability of spool

Line management

Durability

Price

Brand

I will explain each of these factors at the end of this guide so you can make your own determinations on best reels for you.

So based on these factors we have collected a large sample of the top spinning reels available for this season and upcoming season and put each spinning reel through our tests and fishing to get on the water application experience with every reel we could get our hands on.

We have tested a barrel full of spinning reels over the years and we use that large breadth of knowledge and experience to quickly assess quality equipment. A lot of these brands and even models we are familiar with because the are the latest offerings of that model we already know from brands we know and trust.

We tested more than 20 of the latest spinning reels and here is what we found.

OUR TOP PICKS

Daiwa Exist G LT Spinning Reel

Voted Best Overall Spinning Reel

The Daiwa Exist is the new flagship for Daiwa’s freshwater reel line-up and it’s an incredible enthusiast spinning reel that incorporates the top materials and technologies available to build the most impressive spinning reel we’ve seen in a long time.

The Exist’s Magnesium Monocoque Frame stands out as the feature that makes this reel uniquely exquisite. The frame creates a thinner rigid body that makes reel torque seem to disappear while simultaneously eliminating the need for added component weight. This thinner and more rigid body provides more internal area to house larger DigiGears for a longer lasting reel that will remain smoothly operating over its entire lifespan.

The screwless Zaion Air Drive Rotor has super low startup inertia and make this reel feel light and airy on the retrieve. Like the spool is floating.

It’s such an incredibly fun reel and one of the top two if not the best spinning reel in the whole world available to anglers in our opinion. I have personally fished it on light gear for panfish. I have fished it on heavier gear for bass and stripers. It’s an incredible reel that is an absolute joy to fish with. The drag is buttery smooth. The bail the handle the rotor are all so solid but smooth in their operations that you feel weird going back to any other reel. Like it’s that noticeable.

But it also comes at the absolute highest price point in the market. So you have to be a finesse fishing enthusiast to warrant this top of the line purchase.

Shimano Stella FK

Voted Best Overall Spinning Reel

I’ve tested tens of thousands of products over the last two-plus decades in fishing and the Shimano Stella FK is the finest piece of fishing equipment I have fished with. At this level it’s nearly luxury engineering at its finest. The Stella FK uses the finest materials and Shimano’s decades of engineering and technology advancements to pack as many features as I’ve seen in a single piece of equipment.

The reel is so smooth you can’t feel the handle turning in the hand gripping the stem. There is no pressure whatsoever on the handle when you retrieve your lure thanks to their Infinity Drive system that is a step up from their advanced X Ship technology. On the Infinity Drive the main shaft which had previously been supported by the pinion gear is now supported by a new and unique low-friction bushing that significantly decreases frictional resistance which results in the lightest winding reel in the industry.

The Infinity Loop and Anti Twist Fin make for the most precise level winding and no sagging tension you will find on a spinning reel so your line lays uniformly and evenly on your spool to give you the best line management possible.

And finally the Duracross drag washers offer 10X the durability without any reduction in smoothness resulting in a longer lasting tougher drag system.

I was literally blown away by how well this reel casts light lures and how exceptionally smooth it is in every way possible on a spinning reel. The bail is top notch. The handle spool and system oscillation all move so fluidly. It is an absolute dream to fish with. It is however one of the most expensive pieces of fishing equipment I’ve ever used at $749.

That being said I’m planning to purchase two of them now as I was that impressed with them and think they are worth the lavish investment for 10 years of top-end luxury performance and enjoyment in my fishing. I’m at that age where I don’t spend money on a lot of things but I will spend more on the things I enjoy the most.

Daiwa Ballistic MQ LT

Best Value for the Money

The Daiwa Ballistic MQ LT made quite the impression on me. It’s light but feels heavy duty looks great and performances exceptionally well at price point close to $200. For a really solid top-of-the-line spinning reel you’re generally looking at $165-$225. Those tend to be your best made workhorse reels and that perfectly describes the Ballistic MQ LT.

The one-piece Monocoque Zaion V-Body gives the reel rigidity and strength which for an angler parlays into smooth operation while handling a tough fight. The oversized Digigear gives you a higher gear ratio with more cranking power. That added speed and power makes using a spinning reel a lot more enjoyable for bass fishing or larger prey. These reels are Magsealed for longevity and their Zaion V Air Rotor and Air Bail give you perfect performance with the lightest amount of pressure.

This reel feels heavy duty without feeling heavy. It feels like it will last a long time and its casting and retrieving is buttery smooth with a seamless drag system. It’s a total package at $229.

OTHER SOLID OPTIONS FOR THE MONEY:

Shimano Vanford

The Vanford came out last year but availability just got where you can get these reels. At $239 this reel offers a lot of technology in a very strong frame. Built to last a long time these reels feature the HAGANE cold-forged gearing that is much stronger than the Stradic. And the X-Protect coating helps prevent corrosion and wear. The Long Stroke Spool gives you increased casting distance and smoother line management.

This reel felt strong and durable. It was pretty smooth with its 7+1 bearings and it held a good amount of line. I could cast pretty far with a 3/8-ounce lure and did not have any issues with loops or line management. It’s a very strong reel. It can take a lot of force which I liked. It comes in 6 sizes from 1000 to 6000 so it can work well for inshore and freshwater although it’s not sealed so it needs to be thoroughly washed for salt use.

Abu Garcia Revo SX

The Revo SX also performs very well in this best bang for your buck price range. At the lower end at $165 the Revo SX features a more compact X-Craftic aluminum body frame for comfort and durability. The oversized AMG Gearing and Friction Free Main Shaft gives you a lot durable strong guts in this reel with smooth performance. This is a 9-bearing system gives you optimal smoothness and performance.

It casts really well. Fishes well. I used it with some crappie gear and was able to make some long casts with very light lures and retrieve them easily without a loss of sensitivity. The drag system was okay but I think the Daiwa and Shimano drag systems were slightly better. But you’re paying $60 less for this reel so there are tradeoffs here.

Shimano NASCI FC

Best Spinning Reels Under $100

Shimano makes some great spinning reels and thankfully they do it at a lot of price points. There are a few companies that try to push down as much technology into lower price points as they can. Obviously certain materials restrict some the applications of this methodology but I always appreciate that brands like Shimano and Daiwa try to push top technologies down into lower price points where they can even with different materials.

Read our full Shimano NASCI FC Spinning Reel Review

The Shimano NASCI is a no-nonsense purposeful spinning reel. This reel employs HAGANE Gears CoreProtect SilentDrive X-Ship Propulsion Line Management and Cross Carbon Drag. Those technologies give the reel strength and quiet smooth performance. At $99 this reel is very smooth albeit a little heavier than some of the more expensive options. But a great buy at $99.

OTHER REELS UNDER $100 WE RECOMMEND

Favorite Phantom

The Favorite Phantom is a 9 bearing reel on a composite body. This reel is not as tight as some of the high-end reels but it was very smooth and there was no tension whatsoever. Which makes it nice for using with finesse applications. The 5.2:1 speed is good and the drag was smooth. It was really nice to fish with.

I was pleasantly surprised by this reel and it’s at a great price point.

Shimano Sahara FJ

The Shimano Sahara holds a special place in my heart as it was one of the first spinning reels I ever owned after moving out on my own. I still have one of my Saharas from the late 1990s on my work bench.

The new Sahara FJ features 4+1 bearings and Shimano’s X-Ship technology in an all new body and rotor design meant to give entry level anglers and advanced anglers a quality reel at a very low price point.

The Sahara FJ is a solid choice at just $84.

Shimano Nexave

BEST SPINNING REEL UNDER $50

The Shimano Nexave gives you pretty good performance at an easy on the wallet price point of $49. So for under $50 you get a good spinning reel that’s basically a solid no-frills reel. This reel performed better with a little heavier and easy to cast lures. There is a little tension on the handle when reeling so super lightweight stuff is a little more challenging. But again for $49 this was a very solid reel in our fishing.

Piscifun Viper X

While this is a bit older reel it’s been one of my favorites for crappie and panfish. It’s light with a good drag and casts light stuff well. I own 6 of these reels that I keep on my panfish rods. I fish a lot of 1/16 ounce crappie jigs on this reel and have never had the first problem with any off my reels which is pretty unheard of at $34.

Penn Authority

BEST SPINNING REEL FOR SALTWATER

Penn is the name synonymous with saltwater toughness. Straight off of it’s Best of Show win at ICAST 2022 the new Penn Authority puts them up in the category of premium fishing reels as well. This reel boasts beautifully engineered craftsmanship from the IPX8 Sealed body and spool to the full metal construction stainless steel gear train and sealed Slammer Dura-Drag system.

This is a big heavy duty but great casting reel with a very even consistent drag. Retrieves fly with the big oversized EVA power knob. Even the smallest 2500 size is a big beefy strong reel and heavy at 11.9 ounces. But I can see it being a lot of fun for big saltwater fish or even some heavy duty freshwater applications like Catfish or big Muskies. It throws a big bait well and it can handle the weight of a big fight. I deadlifted a 25 pound block with it on a Penn rod and let it pull drag hard. It’s a tough piece of equipment built to last.

I can see this reel being a big winner for Penn going forward.

Shimano Exsence

Called the “Dark Horse Stella” by enthusiast anglers the Exsence is built similarly to a Stella but with a more heavy duty package. While the Exsence was built for inshore saltwater fishing it has a very popular following for freshwater fishing because as many have said you get Stella like performance for a little less money with saltwater construction.

This 11+1 bearing reel is sleek at the first inspection. It’s casting and retrieve are both buttery smooth. While lesser reels lose balance when reeling at high speed (i.e. you feel the reel sway up and down and back and forth as you turn the handle) the Exsence construction on the Hagane body and the micro-module gearing keep this reel in balance at all times. It’s a really light weight reel for saltwater fishing standards which is why it is so popular with freshwater anglers.

I tested the 4000MXG and it held the same amount of 10-pound braid as a standard 2500 reel holds. But I really liked that that the oversized spool casted that light braid so amazingly well. The X-Ship X-Protect and MGL Rotor give this reel great performance on the retrieve. And the line management is exceptional. I consider this a more light duty inshore reel. Using lighter lines and casting topwaters and jigs into mangroves and around docks for snook redfish trout and more. But it was equally impressive as a high end bass fishing reel so I can see why it has such a cult following.

Abu Garcia Revo Rocket

BEST HIGH SPEED REEL

The Revo Rocket reels offer the fastest gear ratios in the fishing space. And they have done it again with the Revo Rocket Spinning Reel. This newest version of the Rocket is lighter and more compact thanks to its X-Craftic body. The gear system is however 17% larger which gives it more guts and of course gear ratio. This reel has a whopping 7.6:1 gear ratio which is unheard of in spinning reels and the fastest we’ve seen. Over the course of a day of fishing or a year of fishing the equates to a lot of saved time and more efficiency in your fishing.

The reel balances well in your hand on a spinning rod. I put it on the Abu Garcia Zenon spinning rod and it was a dream combo. It casts well thanks to an improved spool design and it was quiet and smooth on the retrieve with effortless pressure. It makes for a great finesse fishing reel because it casted small lures well and retrieved them equally well. The ergonomics and aesthetics were some of the best we’ve seen with Abu Garcia Spinning reels. A sharp reel that is a joy to fish.

Abu Garcia Zenon

The new flagship for Abu Garcia is the Zenon. The reels features an uber lightweight frame (4.9 ounces for the 20 size). The Zenon builds on a one-piece magnesium body with a C6 V-rotor for super low startup inertia. The reel is feathery light on the retrieve and casts beautifully well.

The line management is good. And the carbon fiber bent handle is compact but solid. The reel features beautiful precision cut aesthetics a drop shot keeper on the side plate and hard case with spare spool. It comes in 20 and 30 sizes for $549. It was a joy to fish with.

This 11 bearing spinning reel features carbon frame and rotor and a hybrid carbon drag system that provides consistent performance. This is going to be a very popular spinning reel this season at $159. A very solid buy at 6.6 ounces and a gear ratio at 6.2:1.

The Procyon AL LT features a lightweight aluminum body DIGIGEAR Air Rotor and Bail and Long Cast ABS Spool.

It throws light lures well but can handle big fights on its Advanced Tournament Drag. It’s buttery smooth on start and stop on both retrieves and hard pulling drag. It’s another crossover reel for freshwater inshore and all species in between. And at $189 it’s a very reasonable price for this kind of performance.

13 Fishing Aerios

This 9 bearing reel is a new addition to the 13 Fishing line of reels. The Aerios handles really well. It’s water sealed and corrosion resistant. It can handle fresh and saltwater fishing. But it’s going to be a big hit with freshwater anglers as it’s been pro tuned to fish all of the bass fishing techniques on a spinning rod.

It’s Cast Iron Carbon Frame and Sealed Rotor and Cool Stop Drag system all perform very well. The reel feels heavy duty and durable with very smooth quiet operation while fishing. It had no resistance in the startup on the retrieve which made it very good with light lures. It has good line management and a durable bail.

This is one of the best spinning reels I’ve used in the 13 Fishing lineup and one they’ve been working on for several years. I highly recommend it. This reel is a real player at a good price point of $139.

Best Spinning Reel Brands

The best known spinning reel brands are easily Shimano Daiwa and Abu Garcia. For a while there was only really these three. But now several brands produce high quality great spinning reels. So the big three are still solid choices almost every time.

Brands like Lew’s 13 Fishing Pflueger and others offer solid options as well. And brands that focus more on budget conscious anglers like Favorite Fishing and Piscifun are kicking out some really solid spinning reels now for extremely reasonable price points.

So take a look through the guide above and be confident in purchasing spinning reels from these brands.

Best Spinning Reel for Bass Fishing

For me the best spinning reel for bass fishing is one that gives you good castability and performance for light to medium weight lures. Most good reels will last a decade. How they perform day in and day out is often as simple as making sure you have the right reel for the kind of fishing you do.

For bass fishing and most freshwater fishing a 2000-2500 size reel works really well. The larger spool makes your coils looser and casting easier and more efficient for distance and accuracy. Some of the larger models build their reels with shallower spools to hold the same amount of line on a bigger surface area for better line management and longer casts.

But you don’t want a giant 4000 reel on a rod tiny enough to hold a 500 reel. So match your rods and reels and try to go with a bigger spool if you can for better castability and line management.

The most popular brands typically among avid bass fishing anglers match the brands we mentioned above.

Best Spinning Reel options

When deciding which spinning reel to buy for fishing there are options to weigh. So I’m going to run through how I decide if a spinning reel is good or not when I’m at a store. I hope this will help other anglers make good choices when choosing spinning reels.

Smoothness of retrieve

In my opinion smoothness of the retrieve is the single biggest factor in a quality spinning reel. If you can’t tell what your bait is doing as you fish it because of your reel then you are at a substantial disadvantage when it comes to fishing with spinning reels. Yes you can catch fish with a low end reel. But you’re also missing a lot more fish that you never knew bit. You’re also not making as precise presentations so you’re not getting bit as much. Disadvantaged. Without even knowing it most of the time.

It’s the first test I do with every spinning reel. I pick up the reel and feel how much pressure it takes to turn the handle. This is known as startup inertia. If it takes more than the slightest pressure then you are not going to feel your bait very well. The harder the reel is to turn the harder it will be to feel your lighter lures on a retrieve.

Drag consistency

The next most important component in a spinning reel is the consistency of the drag. So if you hook a fish you don’t want the drag to “catch” before it starts releasing line. You want it to smoothly and slowly release line under the correct pressure it should start and stop effortlessly when needed and be consistent throughout.

You can do a quick check of the drag by adjusting the tension knob and turn the spool backwards while holding the reel fixed. You want to hear a consistent pinging of the drag as you wind the spool back.

Learn more about setting the drag.

Castability of spool

A spool that releases line effortlessly is also important. A lot of times this can be overcome by using a bit larger spool. The larger the spool especially a larger shallow spool will uncoil line better on a cast. Companies like Daiwa and Shimano have perfected their spools for the best casting performance on their higher end reels.

Line management

The other thing that affects casting is good line management. A poorly made or adjusted spinning reel will have the line get up under the spool too much and or criss cross the line too much because the spool travels too fast and too much as the roller oscillates around the spool. So I also prefer reels manufactured to use precision line winding to keep your line tight and clean on the spool so you deal with a lot less loops knots and line under the spool.

Another thing that helps with line management is closing your bail by hand. If you will close the bail with your hand instead of turning the reel to close the bail you will get a lot less loops or overruns in your reel on subsequent casts.

Durability

The materials a reel are made out of obviously matter as well. While composite reels are fine they will have more play over time and they will break easier under too much force. So you have to be mindful. Most of the time as long as you’re not jerking on snags steping on the reel on the deck or dropping it on the pavement you’re usually going to be fine.

Now reels need to be cleaned if used in saltwater and the better ones are water sealed to keep saltwater and other corrosion and deposits out of the moving parts. And saltwater reels are generally made with stronger stems. This added strength and durability in saltwater reels usually comes at a premium.

Brand

Brand has been a good determination of good spinning reels in the past. The big three in spinning reels definitely have to be Shimano Daiwa and Abu Garcia. But there are a lot of good spinning reels being made by several companies. That’s why we sought to bring some more reels into this guide so you can be more familiar with a larger base of options.

Reel supply has diminshed the last two years. Because of this you may not be able to get your hands on some of the top reels. So using the other factors we’ve listed above will help you evaluate reels from brands you’re not as familiar with.

Price

My advice with reels especially spinning reels is buy the best reel you can afford. Good fishing reels will last you a decade if you take care of them. So you’re investing in many years of use. But you can also buy some cheaper reels and just replace them more often as they break or diminish.

Price usually increases as manufacturers add features and components.

Generally speaking an 11-bearing reel will be more expensive than a 5-bearing reel. But it will also generally be a lot smoother and quieter. A reel that has functionality built into the spool the gears the drag the oscillation systems and more technologies will obvious increase the price of a reel. And the materials can increase the price as well. A reel frame made out of magnesium will be stronger and lighter but also much more expensive than a composite frame.

So this best spinning reels buyers’ guide should not only keep you up to date on good reels as we will add more to it as we go but it will also help you make your own sound decisions on good equipment in the future. Let us know your favorite brands on our social pages.

To investigate the effects of low dose rate irradiation on chromosome damage we assessed whether a pretreatment with chronic low doses of γ rays (priming dose) affects the frequency of total chromosome breaks (CBs; for examples of CBs see Fig. 1a) induced by an acute γ dose of 10 Gy (challenging dose) in Drosophila third instar larvae neuroblasts. Vials containing 12 h old Drosophila embryos were placed at 23 °C inside the LIBIS irradiation facility19 and irradiated continuously at a dose rate of 2.5 mGy/h until they developed into third instar larvae (7 days for a final dose of 0.4 Gy herein 0.4 Gy LDR). Irradiated and non-irradiated control vials were then exposed to a challenging dose at the dose rate of about 0.7 Gy/min and 4 h later larval neuroblasts were analyzed for CBs frequency (Supplementary Fig. 1). Chromosomes were fixed at 4 h and 8 h post irradiation time points (PIR) to recover cells that were irradiated in the S-G 2 or G 1 stage respectively20. The average number of total chromosome breaks per cell (CBs/cell) was calculated by measuring the ratio of the total number of chromatid deletions (CDs scored as a single event) and isochromosome breaks (ISOs or chromosome deletions scored as two events) to the total number of metaphases (Fig. 1b). Cytological analysis of exposed pretreated and non-pretreated third instar larvae showed that in non-pretreated larvae the average number of CBs/cell induced by the challenging dose after 4 h PIR was ~1.0 in females and ~0.8 in males. Differently the 0.4 Gy LDR determined a ~2 fold decrease of CBs/cell frequency in both male and female larval neuroblasts indicating that the LDR treatment renders neuroblast chromosomes resistant to IR-induced DNA breakage as a result of the activation of radioadaptive response (RAR). Interestingly a 1.2 mGy/h dose rate for 7 days (0.2 Gy total dose) was not sufficient to trigger a RAR suggesting that this response could be dose rate dependent (Supplementary Fig. 2a).

Fig. 1: Effects of 0.4 Gy LDR treatment on CBs. a Examples of IR-induced CBs in neuroblasts from Oregon-R third instar larvae. (A) Wild-type female and (D) male metaphases; (B) female and (C F) male metaphases with examples of isochromosome breaks (arrows); (E) male metaphase showing autosomal chromatid deletions (arrows). Bar = 5 μm. b Analysis of the frequency of CBs induced by the acute exposure to 10 Gy in 0.4 Gy LDR chronically treated and non-treated (NT) larvae after 4 and 8 h post irradiation (PIR) and in the first and the second generation from adults exposed to 0.4 Gy LDR during their development. Chromosome exchanges did not vary and were not considered in the analysis. The CBs frequency of 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy treated larvae at 8 h and 4 h PIR was compared with that of 10 Gy treated larvae at the same PIR times. The CBs frequency of 10 Gy treated F1 and F2 was compared with that of 10 Gy exposed controls after 4 h PIR. Note that CBs frequency of 0.4 Gy LDR treated larvae were indistinguishable from that of NT larvae. n = 3 biologically independent experiments were conducted.

All comparisons were performed using Student’s t-test †statistically significant for p < 0.05 ††statistically significant for p < 0.01. Full size image

We sought to understand whether the 0.4 Gy LDR could affect CBs frequency also at 8 h PIR when cells are irradiated during the G 1 stage. The analysis of ~1000 female metaphases revealed no statistically significant difference on CBs frequency between non-pre-treated (~54%) and 0.4 Gy LDR treated (~45%) larvae at 8 h PIR (Fig. 1b). This suggests that 0.4 Gy LDR could primarily influence the HR-based repair systems that by employing sister chromatids as template for the DNA synthesis to regenerate the sequence surrounding the break site is restricted to S-G 2 phase21. Furthermore we evaluated whether the radiation resistance could be also maintained for more than one generation. Thus male and female adult flies that developed from 0.4 Gy LDR-pretreated larvae were mated to each other outside the LIBIS and the resulting F 1 larvae irradiated with 10 Gy. Interestingly we found that the frequency of CBs calculated at 4 h PIR was ~2 fold reduced in metaphases from both male and female F 1 larvae of 0.4 Gy LDR -derived adult parents (n = 1861 for both sexes) with respect to control F 1 larvae deriving from non-pretreated adults (Fig. 1b). This indicates that the RAR shows a transgenerational inheritance. However the F 1 obtained from reciprocal crossings between 0.4 Gy LDR-treated females or males and non-treated males or females respectively did not elicit RAR (Supplementary Table 1) suggesting that the transgenerational inheritance of RAR depends on both maternal and paternal factors.

To analyze whether the 0.4 Gy LDR affected the regulation of G 2 /M checkpoint we carried out a standard checkpoint assay evaluating the proportion of dividing cells (Mitotic Index MI) in larval brain cells fixed at different times after the challenging dose (10 Gy). As shown in Fig. 2a the MI of the non-pretreated Oregon R control brains dropped at 5–30 min PIR remained low for 1 h and came back to a normal value only at 2 h PIR. The MI of 0.4 Gy LDR -pretreated larvae decreased as much as in control brains at 5–30 min PIR but then markedly increased after 30 min PIR suggesting that the 0.4 Gy LDR exposure determined a faster recovery from the G 2 -M checkpoint (Fig. 2a) compared to non-pretreated cells most likely due to a reduced amount of DNA damage (~50%) to be repaired.

Fig. 2: The influence of cell cycle and DNA Damage Response (DDR) on the RAR. a Checkpoint assay of Oregon-R 0.4 Gy LDR chronically exposed Oregon-R larval brains versus non-treated (NT) controls. In the picture is shown the mitotic index (MI) calculated as the ratio between the total number of dividing cells and the number of optical fields. Note that the MI of 0.4 Gy LDR larvae increases after 60 min post-irradiation compared to NT control. n = 3 biologically independent experiments were conducted. Values of p < 0.05 (*) were considered as statistically significant (Student t-test). b EdU incorporation analysis of Oregon-R larval brain cells exposed to IR. EdU-positive cell nuclei of larval brains show 3 different incorporation patterns: S 1 represents early S phase nuclei that do not incorporate Edu in the DAPI-stained chromocenter; S 2 represents mid-S phase nuclei that incorporate EdU in all DAPI-stained nuclei; S 3 shows nuclei in the late S-phase that incorporate EdU only in the chromocenter. c Frequencies of EdU positive nuclei. The frequencies of EdU positive nuclei in each sample (NT 0.4 Gy LDR 10 Gy 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy) were obtained by examining at least 2000 nuclei from 3 brains. Values of p < 0.05 (*) were considered as statistically significant (Student t-test). d Quantification (%) of EdU positive cells divided in S1 S2 and S3 phases according to the staining pattern observed in (b). No statistical differences were observed in treated cells compared to controls. e DNA repair gene mutant larvae do not elicit RAR. Frequency of CBs induced by an acute 2 Gy 5 Gy or 10 Gy irradiation on 0.4 Gy LDR Drosophila strains mutated in genes involved in the DNA damage response (DDR). The ATPCL mutant was used as a control. Note that in all DNA repair (but not in ATPCLDG23) mutants RAR is abolished. ISOs isochromosome deletions CDs chromatid deletions CBs chromosome breaks NT non-treated PIR post-irradiation time. The comparisons of the CBs frequency were performed among 0.4 Gy LDR treated- and untreated mutants before and after the exposure to the challenging dose using Student’s t-test; †statistically significant for p < 0.01. Bar = 10 μm. Full size image

We also checked whether the rate of IR-induced apoptosis and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were influenced by the 0.4 Gy LDR. Immunostaining of whole-mounted brains and imaginal discs for cleaved-Caspase-3 revealed that the number of positive cells in treated larval brains was indistinguishable from that observed in non-pretreated control after the challenging dose indicating that RAR does not reduce the occurrence and distribution of apoptosis caused by extensive DNA damage (Supplementary Fig. 3a-d). Moreover using dihydroethidium (DHE) as an indicator we found that ROS levels in 10Gy-irradiated brains did not differ from those observed in 0.4 Gy LDR + 10Gy-irradiated brains although as expected they increased compared to unirradiated larvae (Supplementary Fig. 4). These results indicate that LDR does not lead to a statistically significant response to the ROS generating activity that could be taken into account to explain the radioresistance.

We finally compared the occurrence of DNA replication in non-pretreated and pretreated brain cells by analyzing the incorporation of the EdU (5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine) analog of thymidine before and after IR (see Materials and Methods). Before 10 Gy irradiation non-pretreated wild-type and 0.4 Gy LDR-pretreated larvae exhibited a similar proportion of nuclei (~13%; n = ~2000 cells) that were actively replicating their DNA and incorporated EdU. However after irradiation whereas in non-pretreated wild-type brains the frequency of EdU-labeled nuclei dropped to ~6.5% (as a consequence of the arrest of S phase) 0.4 Gy LDR-pretreated brains displayed a proportion of positive nuclei (~20%; n = ~2000 cells) very similar to unirradiated larvae (Fig. 2c). Based on the EdU incorporation pattern according to Cenci et al. 201522 we subdivided the S phase in three subclasses namely S 1 (early/mid S; nucleus partially or completely stained with the exception of the chromocenter) S 2 (mid/late S; staining at the chromocenter and at a less compacted nuclear area) and S 3 (late S; only chromocenter stained; Fig. 2b). This classification revealed us that pretreated and non-pretreated cells did not differ in the relative frequencies of nuclei showing S 1  S 2 and S 3 EdU incorporation patterns (Fig. 2d). Altogether these results indicate that 0.4 Gy LDR-pretreated cells recover much faster than non-pretreated controls from the DNA damage-induced replication block.

The RAR to chromosome aberrations relies on a more efficient DNA damage response

To determine whether the reduction of chromosome breaks promoted by 0.4 Gy LDR depends on the presence of proteins required for specific DSB repair pathways we checked whether 0.4 Gy LDR-pretreated larvae bearing mutations in genes encoding DSB repair master proteins (dATM dRad50 dNbs1 dMre11) HR-specific repair proteins required for resection or homology search and strand invasion (dRad51 Bloom) and NHEJ-specific proteins (ligase IV Ku70) elicited a decrease of CBs frequency after the challenging dose. The analysis of mitotic chromosomes from all mutants revealed no significant difference (p < 0.05) in the frequency of CBs between 0.4 Gy LDR-pretreated and non-pretreated larvae indicating that the 0.4 Gy LDR-mediated resistance to γ-ray-induced CBs is strictly dependent on DNA repair genes (Fig. 2e).

We then verified whether 0.4 Gy LDR affects the kinetics of γH2Av recruitment to chromatin breaks. H2Av is the functional homolog of H2AX in Drosophila and its phosphorylation at Ser147 is induced by DSBs23. 0.4 Gy LDR -pretreated and non-pretreated larvae were exposed to 10 Gy γ rays and then checked by IF for the presence of γH2Av foci in larval neuroblasts (Fig. 3a) after 5 min 15 min 30 min and 60 min PIR. We found that in non-pretreated control larval brains the number of γH2Av foci/cell progressively increased over the time reached the highest peak (6 foci/cell) at 30 min PIR and started to slowly decrease at 60 min PIR (Fig. 3b). LDR -pretreated neuroblasts also showed a progressive increment of the γH2Av foci/cell frequency over the time with a peak at 30 min PIR. Interestingly the average of foci/cell at 30 min was around ~4 indicating that differently from non-pretreated controls LDR-pretreated brains accumulate less damage most likely as the results of either an accelerated DNA damage response or a more efficient DNA repair (Fig. 3b). We have also analyzed the kinetics of γH2Av accumulation by WB and found that consistently with our IF results at 30 min PIR γH2Av in 0.4 Gy LDR-pretreated cells does not accumulate as robustly as in non-pretreated cells (Fig. 3cd; see Supplementary Fig. 5 for unprocessed blot images) confirming that 0.4 Gy LDR could accelerate the completion of the DNA damage response. We also analyzed the levels of the MRN complex as well as of Ku70 in both pretreated and non-pretreated cell extracts. WB analyses revealed a statistically significant increase of Rad50 and Nbs1 but not of Ku70 protein levels in 0.4 Gy LDR-pretreated cells with respect to non-pretreated cells (Fig. 3e f; see Supplementary Fig. 6 for unprocessed blot images). Collectively these data along with the genetic analyses indicating a strict requirement of DNA repair genes suggest that the RAR relies on an efficient DNA damage response. However we cannot rule out the possibility that the LDR could also influence chromatin compaction making it more reluctant to damage or more accessible to DNA repair factors compared to non-pretreated chromatin.

LDR protects chromosomes from telomere dysfunction

We also asked whether other DNA damage-induced events are also affected by LDR. We focused on DNA damage response elicited by dysfunctional telomeres and verified the occurrence of telomere fusions (TFs) in mutants with a defective telomere capping. Depletion of either terminin complex components and/or terminin-associated factors induces the formation of multicentric linear and ring chromosomes very likely because of NHEJ-mediated fusion events that occur at uncapped telomeres2425 (for examples of TFs see Fig. 4a). We thus measured the frequency of TFs of 0.4 Gy LDR-pretreated mutants in selected genes coding for telomere capping proteins such as verrocchio (ver) and caravaggio (cav) that specify the terminin proteins VER and HP1-ORC-Associated Protein (HOAP) or Su(var)205 pendolino (peo) and effete (eff) that encode the non terminin protein Heterochromatin Protein 1a (HP1) Peo and UbcD1 respectively2425. As indicated in Fig. 4b we found that in all mutants analyzed 0.4 Gy LDR yielded a relevant reduction of TFs indicating that this exposure exerts a protective effect at uncapped chromosome ends. We have also analyzed the frequency of TFs caused by mutations in tefu nbs rad50 and mre11 genes encoding for the DNA repair factors ATM Nbs Rad50 and Mre11 respectively and which are also required for protecting telomeres from fusion events2627. Interestingly we found that the frequency of TFs in DNA repair mutants was indistinguishable from that of non-pretreated mutants (Fig. 4b) indicating that similarly to RAR the 0.4 Gy LDR-induced telomere protection depends on DNA repair factors. However the reduction of TFs did not always correlate with a reduction of γH2Av-positive Telomere Induced Foci (TIF) indicating that unlike chromosomal DSBs the reduction of fusigenic feature or uncapped telomeres does not have a direct effect on the cytological detection of telomere damage (Supplementary Fig. 7a b). We finally checked if LDR could induce an increase of retro-transposition of the telomeric retroelement HeT-A as it occurred in flies that were chronically exposed to sub-lethal doses of paraquat28. RT-qPCR analysis revealed no differences in the HeT-A expression between non-pretreated and 0.4 Gy LDR treated TF mutants (Supplementary Fig. 7c) indicating that the 0.4 Gy LDR protective effect on uncapped telomeres is unlikely due to an adaptive role of telomere elongation against the loss of capping.

Differential gene expression and genetic analyses reveal loquacious (Loqs) as a RAR responsive factor

To assess whether the 0.4 Gy LDR RAR was accompanied by differential modulation of specific set of genes we performed a genome wide RNA-seq analysis of total RNAs extracted from unirradiated (NT) 10Gy- 0.4 Gy LDR- and 0.4 Gy LDR + 10Gy-irradiated larval male brains. We decided to focus our transcriptomic analyses on males to avoid the confounding effects of gene expression variability of females which is known to be affected by dietary conditions during development and associated to investment into reproduction-related processes2930. To search for gene functions specifically associated to the chromosome break phenotype RNAs of 10Gy- and 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy irradiated larvae were extracted from brains dissected after 4 h following the acute dose exposure. Pairwise comparisons revealed that the 0.4 Gy LDR treatment per se has not determined a statistically significant modulation of general levels of transcripts compared to the unirradiated condition. In contrast both 10Gy- and 0.4 Gy LDR + 10Gy-treatments yielded a moderate yet statistically significant modulation of transcription in all comparisons (see Supplementary Data 1–5 for a list of both upregulated and downregulated genes). The Venn diagram including all differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy vs. 10 Gy 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy vs. 0.4 Gy LDR and 10 Gy vs. 0.4 Gy LDR comparisons has shown only a small number of genes in common among all comparisons (Fig. 5a). To further identify genes potentially involved in the RAR we focused on the set of DEGs found in the 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy vs. 10 Gy comparison. DAVID functional enrichment analysis (EASE score < 0.05 Adjusted p < 0.05) revealed that the DEGs from this comparison are involved in RNA processing (see Heat Map of Fig. 5b; Supplementary Data 6). 3 genes (l(3)72Ab CG5205 and CG8064) were also differentially expressed in the 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy vs 0.4 Gy LDR comparison.

Only a very low percentage of genes were in common among all comparisons.

Among these unique genes we have drawn our attention to the modulation of loqs (loquacious) transcripts that encode the dsRNA binding protein Loqs which is required for siRNA and micro-RNA biogenesis and that is the fly homolog of mammal TRBP3132. Four different transcripts have been identified for loqs (loqs-RA loqs-RB loqs-RC and loqs-RD) that give rise to the Loqs-PA Loqs-PB Loqs -PC and Loqs –PD isoforms respectively. Loqs PA and Loqs PB both harbor three dsRBDs (L1 L2 L3) while Loqs PC and PD both lack the third dsRBD and instead have short aa stretches at their C-termini. Loqs-PA and Loqs-PB interact with Dcr-1 during miRNA biogenesis32333435. Loqs-PC is rarely expressed and has no known function32 while Loqs-PD facilitates Dcr-2–dependent endosiRNA biogenesis3233. Our RNA-Seq experiment showed that the loqs-RD (but not the other transcripts) appeared ~2 fold decreased in 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy samples compared to 10 Gy irradiated samples. This reduction was also validated by RT-qPCR on three independent RNA extractions (Fig. 6a) suggesting that LDR could specifically influence Loqs-dependent esi-RNA biogenesis. Consistent with this we found that 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy larvae showed a statistically significant increase of mus308 transcripts that are the endogenous targets of esi-1 RNA36 with respect to both unirradiated and 10 Gy irradiated larvae (Fig. 6a).

Fig. 6: Loqs as a RAR responsive factor. a RT-qPCR on different Loqs splicing variants and mus308. Loqs-RD (but not -RB -RA and -RE) transcripts are downregulated in 0.4 Gy LDR exposed male brains following the exposure to 10 Gy while mus308 transcripts are upregulated.

To further understand whether the reduction of Loqs indeed accounts for the RAR we analyzed chromosome integrity in chronically irradiated Loqs-depleted larval brain cells with and without the 0.4 Gy LDR-treatment. We thus measured the frequencies of CBs in the loqsKO null mutant upon 0.4 Gy LDR 10 Gy and 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy treatments as well as in unirradiated loqsKO brains using the same experimental set up described above. Intriguingly we found that while unirradiated loqsKO larval brain cells exhibited very rare CBs the frequency of CBs in this mutant was >50% reduced with respect to Or-R control larvae (n = 250) after the exposure to 10 Gy (Fig. 6d). This suggests that the depletion of Loqs could mimic the effect of the 0.4 Gy LDR priming dose in determining resistance to ionizing radiation-induced CBs. Interestingly we observed that this response was lost when Loqs-PD but not –PB was expressed in the loqsKO null mutant (Fig. 6d) confirming that only the reduction of this specific isoform is involved in triggering radio-resistance to CBs. However we observed that the >50% reduction of CB frequency in 10 Gy irradiated loqsKO null mutant did not further decrease upon the 0.4 Gy LDR pretreatment suggesting that the effect of Loqs loss on the radio-resistance is epistatic over the 0.4 Gy (2.5mGy/h) LDR priming dose (Fig. 6d). Finally we observed a ~50% reduction of CBs also in loqsKO/+ heterozygotes suggesting that radioresistance effect is dominant and confirming our RNA-seq data that even a moderate downregulation of this gene can account for the protection against extensive DNA breakage.

To confirm that the loss of Loqs mirrors the effects of the 0.4 Gy LDR -induced radio-resistance we first verified whether the response to CBs in Loqs-depleted cells is also dependent on DNA repair factors. We thus sought to analyze CB frequency in loqsKO; tefuatm and loqsKO; nbs1 double mutants. While loqsKO; tefuatm double mutants turned out to be early lethal thus preventing us for a further characterization we found that the frequency of CBs in 2 Gy irradiated loqsKO; nbs1 larvae was similar to that of 2 Gy irradiated nbs1 single mutants (Supplementary Table 2) confirming that the protection from chromosome breakage in Loqs-depleted and 0.4 Gy LDR cells requires shared DNA protein factors. Finally we observed that the kinetics of γH2Av recruitment and the response to production of ROS in loqsKO and in 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy cells were similar (Fig. 6e; Supplementary Fig. 4). Altogether this set of evidences confirms that repression of Loqs explains the LDR-mediated RAR and endorses the view that Loqs-PD is a bona fide low dose responsive gene.

Loss of Loqs reduces the frequency of Telomere Fusions in Drosophila telomere capping mutants

We then sought to verify if a reduction of Loqs similarly to LDR affects the fusigenic ability of chromosomes with defective telomere capping. We thus checked the frequency of TFs in double mutant combinations between loqsKO and TF mutants (ver1 cav1 nbs1) mapping on the third chromosome and therefore more suitable for recombination with loqsKO located on the second chromosome. Very interestingly we found that in loqsKO; ver1 and loqsKO; cav1 mutant combinations the percentage of TFs/cell was substantially lower than that observed in the corresponding controls while as expected TF frequency of nbs1 mutants was not affected by loss of Loqs (Fig. 6f). This finding further confirms that similarly to RAR the reduction of Loqs is also involved in the protection of uncapped telomeres.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNTk4LTAyMi0xOTIyMC020gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Xanthohumol exerts anti-inflammatory effects in an in vitro model of mechanically stimulated cementoblasts | Scientific ...,"Until now multiple effects of XN such as anti-inflammatority2526 antibacteriality27 anti-angiogenity2628 and anti-proliferativity28 have been described. Concerning the periodontal microenvironment anti-inflammatory mechanisms are of highest interest since compression related remodeling processes in this area are associated with a local sterile inflammation29. The effect of XN on bone resorption may also be profitable in other inflammation types in periodontal tissues without compressive stimuli like periodontitis. In this work we investigated the effects of Xanthohumol on immortalized cementoblasts during compressive force application hypothesizing that the anti-inflammatory properties may modulate the inflammatory signaling processes. The drug concentrations corresponded to typical concentrations in standard beer (up to 0.4 µM)30 and XN enriched sorts of beer (8.5 µM)31. In addition these concentrations were in a comparable range with total human XN blood plasma concentrations (free and conjugated) after oral XN administration21. The proportion of conjugated XN relative to free XN in human plasma is close to 100% for conjugated XN21. In many cases conjugated agents in contrast to free ones are not relevant for therapeutic effects. Nevertheless in case of XN biological effects seem to correlate with total (free plus conjugated) XN levels not only with the levels of free XN213233. Furthermore XN has been shown to have a high bioavailability and a low toxicity profile3435. Orally administered Xanthohumol does not affect major organ functions in vivo36.

The in vitro experiments in this study showed dose dependent effects of XN on cytotoxicity and cell viability. Low doses increased cell viability while higher doses provoked cytotoxic effects. Based on this a XN concentration of 0.4 µM has been used for further experiments with compressive stimulation. Higher concentrations were not investigated in further experiments on mRNA and protein level due to high significance and better clinical plausibility of 0.4 µM. The level of exerted force was similar to previous experiments with fibroblasts of the periodontal ligament3738 and cementoblasts3940. In these experiments an initial lag phase of 24 h after force application followed by continuing proliferation has been reported37. We were able to confirm decreased cell proliferation in compressed cementoblasts by cell cytometry. XN had supporting effects on cell proliferation and survival comparable to our findings regarding cell viability.

Comparing compressively stimulated cementoblasts with their control we were able to confirm the results from previous publication indicating that Cox-2 gene expression is upregulated by loading compression41. Our findings regarding compression related Il-6 upregulation correlate with previous publications with periodontal ligament fibroblasts42. IL-6 is an important marker of periodontal remodeling being involved in osteoclast differentiation and activation17. This regulation indicates that cementoblasts are involved in regulatory mechanisms after compressive strain. As hypothesized XN is able to decrease this compression dependent IL-6 upregulation on mRNA and protein level. Regarding anti-angiogenic properties of XN we further investigated the regulation of Vegfa that is upregulated in PDL cells13 and not explored in compressively stimulated cementoblasts yet. We did not observe any relevant regulations neither of compressive force nor of XN on Vegfa mRNA expression. In contrast no effects on other proinflammatory markers´ gene expression such as Il-1a Vegfa Mmp9 and Cox2 were detectable.

Despite the exact intracellular target of XN and its mechanism remains unclear previous studies with various cancer cell lines have demonstrated that XN interacts with the three MAP-Kinase subfamilies: ERK434445 JNK45 and p3846. XN effects on protein kinase B/AKT are known too474849. The well-known relevance of these kinases for cell proliferation cell survival cell stress and inflammatory responses is important for getting a first insight in XN related changes in cementoblasts. Our data provide evidence that XN may influence cell proliferation and cell survival as seen in cell cytometry experiments (Fig. 2) and gene and protein expression of IL-6 (Fig. 3). As we reported before phospho-ERK and phospho-AKT are upregulated by compressive stimulation40 and—corresponding to publications about XN in cancer cell lines—both phosphorylated forms were decreased by XN. Activated ERK is able to translocate into the nucleus and modulates genes for the response to stimulation5051. Taking this together we hypothesize a correlation of ERK activation and IL-6 expression caused by mechanical stimulation in cementoblasts. Regulations of phospho-ERK following mechanical strain are also known in PDLF52. In contrast to that JNK p38 and their phosphorylated forms were not altered neither by mechanical stimulation nor by XN. This suggests first indications that these kinases are not involved in the cellular reaction to compressive stimuli in cementoblasts. Finally we investigated possible effects of XN on RANKL protein expression. RANKL is a key molecule for bone regeneration and remodeling by affecting the differentiation of osteoclasts53. As we showed static compressive stimulation had just a slight effect and XN had no impact on RANKL. This expression nearly independent of mechanical stimulation contrasts with previous studies with human PDLF54 and cementoblasts41 where a clear upregulation was observed.

In summary we were able to demonstrate selective anti-inflammatory effects of Xanthohumol in murine cementoblasts. This may be an interesting option for the modulation of inflammatory responses within the PDL in in vivo studies for orthodontic therapy and treatment of periodontitis.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNTk4LTAyMi0xODgxNS0z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Teg58 a small regulatory RNA is involved in regulating arginine biosynthesis and biofilm formation in Staphylococcus ...,"Characterization of sRNA teg58 (srn_2460) in S. aureus

To characterize sRNA directly regulated by SarA we have performed ChIP-Seq analysis with anti-SarA and anti-Myc antibodies using cell extracts of a sarA mutant of HG003 harboring pSK23643::sarA-myc followed by pulldown with Protein A-Sepharose to yield SarA-DNA complexes40. One of the pull-down fragments identified was a DNA fragment upstream of teg58 with a peak shape score of 46.0 and the p-value of 0.00 (Fig. 1B). In addition RNA-Seq of isogenic sarA mutant strains revealed increase in teg58 transcript in sarA mutant vs. respective parent (2.41-fold)40. Primer extension and 3´ RACE experiments were performed to map 5′- and 3′-ends of teg58 with total RNAs isolated from isogenic sarA strains (Fig. S1B for 3′-RACE) showing the sRNA to be 165-nt long (Fig. 1C). Further analysis revealed no well-defined ribosome binding site and coding region within the teg58 transcript consistent with a non-coding sRNA (Fig. 1C). Teg58 located in the intergenic region at the 3’ end of a gene cluster encoding putative virulence factors (Fig. S1A) is conserved in multiple S. aureus genomes.

SarA repressed sRNA teg58 transcription

For subsequent analysis we have selected two different strain backgrounds MRSA JE2 and MSSA SH1000. Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2A) showed increased teg58 transcript level ~ 4.9-fold increase at exponential and 11.6-fold increase at early post-exponential phases in the sarA mutant vs. the wild type while the level was restored to near parental level upon complementation with the shuttle plasmid pSK236::P1sarA consistent with repression of teg58 transcription by the sarA gene. Quantitative promoter activity of teg58 fused to GFP fluorescence44 at the various phases of growth in assorted strains (only shown for the post-exponential phase of growth in Fig. 2B) confirmed northern analysis data. Gel shift assay demonstrated that SarA bound specifically to the teg58 promoter region since unlabeled teg58 fragment competed out binding to the labeled DNA while non-specific 16S promoter fragment did not (Fig. 2C). The calculated binding affinity45 (K d = [protein) 50% of DNA bound ] of SarA to the teg58 promoter fragment was approximately 0.7 × 10–6 M indicating high binding affinity. Together these results clearly demonstrated repression of teg58 transcription by SarA.

Reduced biofilm formation in teg58 mutant is not dependent on PIA agr and SarA

To determine the role of teg58 in biofilm formation we have constructed deletion mutants of teg58 in both JE2 and SH1000 and complemented these mutants with shuttle plasmid pSK236 containing teg58 fragment (Table S1). As shown in Fig. 3A and Fig. S1C biofilm was significantly decreased in teg58 mutants in both backgrounds but increased in teg58 plasmid complemented strains. Incidentally optical density (OD600) of teg58 mutant from supernatants of biofilm wells at 24-h of growth was higher than the parent/complemented strains (Fig. S1D) but cells scraped from biofilm (in triplicates) in wells at 1 and 2-h after inoculation revealed significant reduction of surface attached cells with the teg58 mutant (53% and 30% of initial input cells at 1 and 2-h respectively) compared to the wild type (885% and 1142% increased at 1 and 2-h respectively) (Fig. S1E). To determine if any previously known factors of biofilm formation were affected due to teg58 deletion we assayed icaADBC which encodes PIA and icaR transcription in the teg58 mutant by qRT-PCR analysis and did not find any alternations (Fig. 3B). We also analyzed PIA production by dot blots with anti-PIA antibodies revealing little or no changes between teg58 mutant and the parents/complemented strains (Fig. 3C).

Figure 3 teg58 mediated biofilm formation is independent of PIA production and regulation of the target genes. (A) Static biofilm assay with isogenic strains in SH1000 background in TSB plus 0.25% glucose for 24 h. The sarA and agr mutant strains were used as controls.

PIA production was detected with an anti-S. aureus PIA antibody showing no changed in PIA production due to the teg58 deletion compared to the wild type and complement strains. Original blot is presented in Supplementary Material files Fig. X2. Full size image

Northern blot with a sarA probe (Fig. S2A) and Western blot with an anti-SarA monoclonal antibody (Fig. S2B) showed no major differences in sarA expression in isogenic teg58 strains grown under biofilm conditions. The agr locus is a negative regulator of biofilm formation indicated that expression of RNAII (agrDBCA) and RNAIII did not change in the teg58 mutant vs. the wild type/complemented strains (Fig. S2C). Transcription of psm-α known to be involved in biofilm dispersal was also not altered in the teg58 mutants (Fig. S2C). Analysis of the butanol extract46 of filtered cultured supernatants containing PSMs (PSMα1-4 PSMβ1-2 and δ-toxin) by SDS-PAGE (Fig. S2D) revealed no visual changes in intensity of the PSM band in the teg58 mutant vs. the wild type/complement consistent with a lack of change in concentration of PSM peptides in the teg58 mutant vs. isogenic parent as confirmed by Mass Spectroscopy. Analysis for nucleases proteases and DNases under control of agr and/or sarA systems were also not altered in the teg58 mutants vs. the parent. Together these results suggest that reduced biofilm formation in the teg58 mutant does not involve agr SarA PSMs and other known biofilm inducing factors controlled by SarA and agr.

RNA-Seq analysis of the teg58 mutant

Based on the above studies we hypothesized that teg58 may regulate uncharacterized gene products involved in biofilm formation in S. aureus. To determine target genes regulated by teg58 and the ensuing phenotypic involvement (e.g. biofilm formation) in S. aureus we performed RNA-Seq analysis of various strains in SH1000. To detect differentially expressed transcripts between various strains pairwise comparisons were performed and statistical significance (FDR-adjusted P < 0.05) determined using the edgeR package47 as described previously24. Phage-encoded genes were eliminated from analysis. Based on a twofold change transcriptional profiling revealed alteration of 116 genes (38 genes up-regulated and 78 genes down-regulated) in the teg58 mutant vs. the wild type whereas a threefold change would yield 43 affected genes (8 up- and 35 down-regulated) in teg58 deletion (Table 1 and Table S3). The altered genetic pathways include purine metabolism arginine biosynthesis transport systems metabolic and virulence genes. Some of teg58 neighboring genes (Fig. S1A Table S4) including virulence factor were altered in the RNA-Seq dataset. Some of the virulence including neighboring genes (e.g. Saoushc_-01121/hla -01954/lukD -02708-10/hlgA C and B _01110/efb-1 -01112/flipr -01113/HP -01114/efb -01115/scip) were confirmed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 3D). The data indicated that no significant alternation in transcript levels of the neighboring genes although we are not ruling out the effect of teg58 at the post-transcription stage which needs further investigation.

Impact of teg58 on l -arginine biosynthesis and production

RNA-Seq analysis indicated that argG (4.6-fold) and argH (5.0-fold) as part of an operon were significantly upregulated while ureA-G encoding urease subunits (converting urea to ammonium as a downstream catabolism event) were down regulated (2.7–4.6-fold) in the teg58 mutant (Table 1). Genes involved in arginine catabolism such as rocF (~ 1.0-fold) argF (~ 1.12-fold) arcA or arcB (~ 1.5-fold) were not markedly altered in the teg58 mutant (Table S4). Northern analysis indicated a significant increase in argGH transcript level in the teg58 mutant (~ 1.8–5.5 fold in Fig. 4A) vs. parent but returned to parental level upon complementation (Fig. 4A). Growth analysis in CDM42 without l-arginine (containing 1% glucose) for 48 h (Fig. 4B) indicated that the teg58 mutant grew well while the wild type isogenic complement as well as control sRNA mutants (teg49 and teg23) grew poorly in this arginine-depleted medium. As expected the double ∆teg58/argG/H or single argG/H::ermC mutants failed to grow in CDM without l-arginine suggesting that enhanced argGH expression for arginine biosynthesis in the teg58 mutant is likely responsible for growth in arginine deficient medium (Fig. 4B). Under static anaerobic (Fig. 4C) conditions the teg58 mutant retained growth pattern like the aerobic setting. Growth analysis of the isogenic teg58 strains in TSB (Fig. S3A) and CDM (Fig. S3B) revealed no growth defect due to deletion or complementation. We also found no alternation in transcription of ccpA2235 known to activate biofilm formation in a glucose-rich environment (Fig. 3D) and is involved in the biosynthesis of arginine via the urea cycle utilizing proline as the substrate.

Full size image

For confirmation ultra-high performance liquid chromatography—high resolution tandem mass spectrometry was used to analyze l-arginine and its metabolite using intracellular fractions of isogenic teg58 strains grown under aerobic condition (Fig. 4D). The data indicated ~ twofold increase in intracellular l-arginine concentration in the teg58 mutant compared to the wild type correlating with increased argGH transcription and higher growth in arginine-deficient CDM for the teg58 mutant.

Role of l -arginine in biofilm formation in S. aureus

l-arginine plays a critical role in growth and biofilm formation in several bacterial species by neutralizing acidic pH inhibiting biofilm formation and preventing co-aggregation of cells323348. However the role of arginine in biofilm formation in S. aureus has not been defined. Biofilm assays with assorted teg58 mutants in complete CDM (containing 1% glucose) found similar biofilm defect (Fig. 5A) as seen in TSB (Fig. 3A). Importantly inactivation of argG or argH also led to increased biofilm formation (Fig. 5A) while the double mutants (∆teg58/argG or ∆teg58/argH) exhibited reduced biofilm formation akin to the ∆teg58 mutant implying the role of additional factor(s) other than argGH that may be involved in reducing biofilm formation in the teg58 mutant. In fact our RNA-Seq analysis (Table 1) indicated that relA involved in stress-responsive alarmone (p)ppGpp production and biofilm dispersion in multiple bacterial species49 including S. aureus50 or l-arginine dependent factors yet to be identified could also be involved in reducing biofilm formation in the teg58 mutant. We are actively investigating the role of relA in biofilm formation in S. aureus as well as in combination with argGH in the teg58 mutant. Another possibility could be increased argGH mRNA that binds to teg58 therefore decreases titers of free teg58. Decreasing teg58 titers alters the abundance of an alternative mRNA that teg58 interacts with resulting in increased biofilm formation or increasing biofilm dispersal. Addition of l-arginine to CDM (Fig. 5B and Fig. S4C) or TSB (Fig. S4AB) also reduced biofilm formation with increasing concentrations l-arginine beginning at ~ 1 mM (Fig. 5B).

To verify the role of intracellular arginine in repressing biofilm formation we overexpressed argGH genes in a tetO-inducible vector pALC207351 under induced and uninduced condition (Fig. 5C and Fig. S4D). Results indicated a noticeable decrease in biofilm formation in the parent under induced vs. uninduced condition correlating with significant induction of the argGH transcript as detected by Northern blots in induced cells (Fig. 5D). Growth analysis in CDM lacking arginine indicated that the wild type grew faster under induced than uninduced condition implying overexpression of intracellular argGH leads to enhanced cell growth (Fig. S3C). Overall these analyses showed that extracellular l-arginine and/or intracellular overexpression of argGH can repress biofilm formation in S. aureus.

Specific interaction between sRNA teg58 and argGH mRNA for arginine production

To determine whether teg58 affects argGH at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level we performed gfp uvr reporter gene fusion with the argGH promoter (P argGH ::gfp uvr) in pALC148444 in isogenic teg58 strains showing no significant differences in mean GFP fluorescence per OD 600nm values between the wild type and teg58 mutant strains of JE2 (15464 ± 800 vs. 16350 ± 760) and SH1000 (10604 ± 612 vs. 9897 ± 700) indicating that teg58 does not regulate argGH transcription. In silico analysis using IntaRNA tool41 to locate potential site for sRNA-mRNA interactions (Fig. 6A and Fig. S5) revealed one 8-nt site (nt 51–58 in teg58) (Fig. 1C and Fig. S5A) with exact match to argG (nt 415–422 from start codon) and another 39-nt including gaps (nt 104–142 in teg58) (Fig. 1C and Fig. S5B) for plausible interaction with argH (nt 403–435 from the argH start codon). Notably 9-nt within this site in argH (nt 403–411 or nt 1598–1606 in the argGH transcript) showed perfect pairing with teg58 (nt 134–142). Since the entire argGH transcript at ~ 2600-nt long is not suitable for resolution by mobility shift assay5253 hence we have divided the argGH transcript into five different overlapping fragments (arg-1 (1–600-nt) arg-2 (350–950 nt) arg-3 (875–1475 nt) arg-4 (1000–1625 nt) and arg-5 (1500–2200) (Fig. 6A). We conducted mobility shift assays with a radiolabeled ~ 170 nt teg58 fragment and larger fragments of argGH mRNAs as cold interacting RNAs. As shown in Fig. 6B only arg-1 arg-2 and arg-5 RNA fragments showed interacting bands with the native teg58 RNA in good agreement with the in-silico prediction of sites of interaction. In contrast arg-3 and arg-4 mRNA fragments lacking homology with teg58 did not bind to teg58 in the assay. The teg58 probe also shifted in a concentration dependent manner with arg-2 and arg-5 RNA fragments (Fig. 6C). When the same experiments were performed with teg58 probe lacking the 8-nt interaction site for argG or scrambled 9-nt interaction site of argH for teg58 (without disrupting significant teg58 structure; Fig. S5DE) we did not detect any interacting bands (Fig. 6D) suggesting that teg58-argGH interaction is specific in vitro.

The arg-1 and arg-2 and arg-5 truncated region of argGH mRNA corresponding to coding regions of the argG and argH genes respectively interacted with teg58 sRNA in a manner consistent with in silico analysis while two truncated fragments that were predicted not to interact did not cause any mobility shift.

Teg58 and argGH interactions validated in vivo growth and biofilm formation and argGH mRNA stability

To verify in vivo RNA-RNA interaction between teg58 and argGH mRNAs we complemented the teg58 mutant with pSK236 containing teg58 fragment but with a deletion of 8-nt putative argG or a scrambled 9-nt argH interaction site followed by growth and biofilm analysis. Both mutated teg58 fragments on a plasmid mirrored the growth of the teg58 mutants in CDM without l-arginine (Fig. 7A) whereas the native teg58 fragment phenocopied the wild type. Chromosomal deletion of the 9-nt of argG or scrambling 9-nt site (coding for SLT instead of SLQ) of argH for interactions with teg58 in JE2 yielded growth in CDM lacking l-arginine (Fig. 7A) thus mimicking the growth pattern of the teg58 mutant instead of the wild type. Thus the predicted interactions between teg58 and argGH mRNA are important to prevent production of arginine for growth in media lacking exogenous l-arginine.

Besides growth we also ascertained biofilm formation. As shown in Fig. 7B the teg58 mutant harboring the recombinant pSK236 carrying teg58 with specific argG or argH mutation or chromosomal mutation of argG or argH at the putative interaction sites failed to restore biofilm formation to the level of the parent. In addition RNA stability studies for the argGH transcript in isogenic teg58 strains by qRT-PCR (Fig. 7C) clearly showed that the argGH transcript is more stable in the teg58 mutant than the wild type/complemented strains. The argGH mRNA half-life a parameter for RNA stability as defined by reduction of the transcript abundance by a factor of two was determined to be ~ 1 min in the wild type and about ~ 5 min in the teg58 mutant. Taken together these results from our in vitro and in vivo studies strongly suggested that failure to base-pair teg58 with argGH mRNA due to mutation stabilizes the transcript and increases arginine biosynthesis and production which represses biofilm formation in S. aureus.

Teg58-mediated biofilm production is independent of l -arginine catabolism

We have established above that reduced biofilm formation in the teg58 mutant is due at least in part to increased expression of argGH and ensuing production of l-arginine. As arginine level is balanced by biosynthesis and catabolism we wanted to determine if reduced arginine catabolism contributes to the observed phenotype in the teg58 mutant. Analysis by qRT-PCR of the putative catabolism genes including arcA arcB and arcD (antiporter) (transcribed as a single transcript) argF and rocF from biofilm grown cells revealed no significant differences (0.8 to 1.5-fold) between the teg58 mutant and the parent except for reduced ureA expression (~ 0.38 fold) (Fig. 8A) in the teg58 mutant. Failure to restore the ureA transcript in the complemented teg58 strain to wild type level as detected by qRT-PCR (Fig. 8A) suggested that regulation of the ureA/urease pathway genes by teg58 may be different from the classic arginine catabolism pathway. Results also indicated that argG and sarA as well as teg58 (~ 38 fold in the wild type vs. mutant) remained active in biofilm cells (Fig. 8A). We also found no significant alterations in intracellular l-citrulline concentrations the catabolite of ArcA ArgF and Nos enzymes between biofilm cells of the wild type and the teg58 mutant using a colorimetric microtiter plate method54 (Table 2). In contrast the ratio of citrulline content in teg58 mutants vs. wild types (JE2 and SH1000) grown under aerobic shaking condition revealed an increase of 1.7 and 2.2-fold respectively consistent with the data from UHPC-HRMS/MS (Fig. 4D). To confirm that increased l-citrulline level in aerobic or planktonic cells is associated with elevated transcript level of the arginine catabolism genes qRT-PCR of aerobic grown cells in TSB was performed (Fig. 8B) showing elevated transcript levels (1.2–2.7 fold) of arcA (1.7-fold) arcB rocF and arcD (~ 2.0-fold) argF (1.2-fold) argG (~ 3.0-fold) and nos (~ 2.7-fold) in the teg58 mutant consistent with increased l-citrulline (Table 2) and l-ornithine levels (Fig. 4D) in cells grown under aerobic conditions. As aerobic and biofilm growth conditions (with glucose) are diverse these data demonstrated that the catabolic pathway genes are relatively quiescent in biofilm cells but are more active in aerobic growth.

The introduction of Spinraza (nusinersen) as a treatment for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in Sweden was associated with trends of improved survival in children diagnosed with the disease before they were 2 years old a nationwide population-based study shows.

While these trends did not reach statistical significance relative to the period before Spinraza children receiving the therapy had a significantly lower risk of death compared with untreated children.

These real-world findings add to clinical trial data showing that Spinraza prolonged survival in children with the severe SMA type 1 the researchers noted.

The study “Survival in patients diagnosed with SMA at less than 24 months of age in a population-based setting before during and after introduction of nusinersen therapy. Experience from Sweden” was published in the European Journal of Paediatric Neurology.

Recommended Reading Determined Life of Service Keeps Man With SMA Type 2 Going at 66

Biogen’s Spinraza was the first disease-modifying therapy (DMT) approved for all SMA types. Administered directly into the spinal canal it works by increasing the production of the SMN protein whose deficiency causes SMA.

In a previous Phase 3 clinical trial (NCT02193074) the therapy was shown to significantly prolong the survival and improve the motor function of children with type 1 disease.

This severe form is characterized by a symptom onset at up to 6 months of age and a median life expectancy of less than 2 years without respiratory support.

“However there is a lack of data outside clinical trials on how the introduction of [Spinraza] has affected the survival of patients with SMA” the researchers wrote.

With this in mind a team of researchers in Sweden analyzed the survival of children diagnosed with SMA before 2 years of age before during and after Spiranza’s introduction.

Analysis includes 155 children from the Swedish National Patient registry

Eligible patients were identified through the Swedish National Patient registry — which includes all people with an inpatient diagnosis — between Feb. 21 2000 and Dec. 19 2019. Medical records including treatment with Spinraza were linked to the Swedish Cause of Death Registry to assess their vital status.

The selective inclusion of children diagnosed at 2 years or younger was expected to increase the proportion of type 1 patients in the analysis the team noted.

Data were divided into three time periods. The first period when no SMA DMT was available in the country ranged from Feb. 21 2000 to Sept. 22 2015.

Period 2 when Spinraza was available to patients only through clinical trials and an early access program ran from Sept. 23 2015 to Dec. 21 2017. The last period from Dec. 22 2017 to Dec. 31 2019 (study data cutoff) represented the time after the therapy’s approval and recommendation for use in Sweden.

A total of 155 patients (79 girls and 76 boys) were included in the analysis: 115 in period 1 21 in period 2 and 19 in period 3. About a quarter of them (42 children; 27.1%) were diagnosed with SMA after 1 year of age.

Follow-up clinical data were collected for a median of 1.14 years and 26 children initiated Spinraza treatment: 14 (66.7%) during the period of its limited availability and 12 (63.2%) after its approval.

Results showed that survival estimates for children diagnosed during and after Spinraza’s introduction were slightly better than those before the therapy’s introduction. This reflected a reduced risk of death by about 30% in children in periods 2 and 3 relative to those in period 1. However none of these differences reached statistical significance.

In addition during and after Spinraza’s introduction 12 (85.7%) of the 14 children who did not receive any DMT died versus one (3.85%) of the 26 children treated with Spinraza. This meant that Spinraza significantly reduced the risk of death by 95%.

A similar survival benefit was detected when restricting the analysis to children diagnosed before 1 year of age — which could include a higher proportion of type 1 patients.

“In conclusion we found no evidence of differences in overall survival between the three calendar periods” the researchers wrote.

“However SMA patients that were defined as receiving [Spinraza] had a dramatically increased overall survival which also indicates that [Spinraza] has an effect on survival in patients diagnosed with SMA in a nationwide real-world setting” the team added.

The study was funded by a grant from Biogen. Two of the four study authors were current or former employees of Biogen Sweden while the remaining two were consultants or have been on advisory boards for the company.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I’m at Burning Man and I feel like a kid again. The reason for this transmission is to tell you why.

Black Rock City a sprawling sandbox of stimuli on a planet called playa is a place entirely new to me but the inhabitants here say the only way to explore it is by bicycle.

The bicycle they told me is the main mode of transportation at Burning Man this planet’s yearly gathering of 80000 burners from far-flung corners of Earth a land much different than this one.

Here the people live in large camps named for the natures intentions and imaginations of the inhabitants there. There’s Run Free where the burners are clean and sober and find ways to explore Black Rock City without substances that turn the world into a lysergic candy-colored dreamscape. There’s Dustfish where desert angels sing of acid and hot springs. And among hundreds of others there’s Journeylizm a camp of artists scientists and journalists here to document another burn. They have adopted me. While I am here this is my home.

I have brought very little from my home planet to Black Rock City: Food water and camp gear to last 10 days in a hot dusty unforgiving place where people are not meant to live. But I have learned it is the red and cream cruiser with red and rainbow wheels that is most vital to experiencing this planet called playa.

The cruiser is not my own. It was loaned to me by Choco Taco the tough mamma burner who explored the playa long before me –– the burner without a name.

On my first night in Black Rock City I activated my red and rainbow wheels mounted the cruiser and pushed off into the dust.

What follows in the remainder of this transmission is a collection of lessons and discoveries I learned and documented atop a bicycle over the course of eight days at Burning Man.

Lesson One: Riding a bicycle in a dress is challenging

Where I come from men don’t wear dresses. And that’s unfortunate. I’m wearing one right now as I type this transmission and it is quite comfortable –– especially in a place like Black Rock City. There’s more room there’s more cover from the sun there’s no one judging you. And of course there’s that miraculous breeze that comes from under the bicycle when it seems you need it most.

But dear reader I must tell you: It is not easy riding a bicycle in a dress. The first night I wore one on the playa I failed to bunch up the fabric and pull it far enough over my knee to clear my leg over the seat and mount the bicycle. Down I went like a sack of hot garbage but I dusted myself off and tried again. Later I let the dress fall too low and soon the teeth of the sprocket bit into the fabric demanding a full stop wiggle and reset to get rolling. Dresses demand respect and practice –– well worth it to feel that breeze.

Lesson Two: Fast Travel

There is a time and place for exploring Black Rock City by foot. But for most travel situations the bicycle is ideal. During the day when temperatures shoot past the 90s and into the 100s the bicycle is vital. For one travel beneath the hard hot sun is faster. A journey that may take 20 minutes by bicycle may take over an hour by foot. Second this speedy travel grants access to analog air conditioning: The wind.

Lesson Three: Carrying Capacity

The first two nights on the playa were plagued by the worst dust storms at Burning Man in years. That made it necessary to pack the right equipment in case you ran into a dust devil with Dorothy still in it. Goggles to protect the eyes and a shawl to cover the mouth were part of my riding gear. Carrying all that on the body –– along with a camp cup lock notebook and water supply –– would be difficult without the aid of a basket. All that extra weight would cause further discomfort in an already uncomfortable environment.

Lesson Four: Exploration is enhanced

Exploring foreign lands is much more magical on a bicycle. That’s especially true at Burning Man. At sundown when burners howl to celebrate the coming of night the world takes on a carnival of the cosmos vibration. Flames explode into the sky. Vehicles shaped like pirate ships deep sea creatures and intergalactic monsters sail and swim and claw through dust that rapidly changes from a golden haze to a dense fog.

Under the metal bars of the Thunderdome burners compete in trapeze club battles while men and women in leather bark of violence and spectators hanging above make bets. In the dark of the playa rise up epic structures of light and sound. There is too much to see at Burning Man and there is no way to see it all. Well except one: Get on your bicycle find the 100-foot rocket tower ascend four sets of rickety ladders to the very top and look out at the psychedelic horizon. Somehow it will all seem smaller – conquerable. The sight produced in me a boost of bravery to climb down the ladders pull my dress far enough over my leg to mount the cruiser with ease and launch back into the mysterious expanse of the playa.

Lesson Five: Breakdowns are imminent

With each day that expires before the burn the playa dust gets thicker and thicker. Deep ruts and heavy bumps may eventually send the contents of your basket crashing to the dirt forcing you to dismount and collect. Late in the week breakdowns are more likely to happen. By then the dust has had many days to infiltrate every corner of your being –– several of those corners being unmentionable in this transmission.

On my eighth day in Black Rock City playa dust caked in the ball bearings of the cruiser’s chain ring and locked up the pedals. There are bicycle camps at Burning Man ready and available to help with repairs. But I had failed to bring my map that day and the closest suggestion of a passing burner was too far to walk in the 102-degree heat with a dwindling water supply. I walked back to camp. In the shade I knocked loose the caked dust by pounding the crank arms with the palm of my hand and gently bouncing the tires off the ground. With the chain ring teeth freed to bite the chain I slicked the bearings with WD-40 and cranked the wheels until the tires spun in a smooth whir.

Lesson Six: Bicycling with intentions to walk

An earlier portion of this transmission described the benefits of fast travel. But there are also advantages to securing the bicycle to a rack in a desirable location and setting off on foot. The benefits of slow travel have to do with discovery and connectivity. On a bicycle feeling like you have to get somewhere you may pass up the robot wheeling its way to camp. On foot you may shake that robot’s hand ask whether it knows Johnny 5 and get this response: “He’s not alive!”

On a bicycle the rattle of the basket and squeak of the chain may keep you from hearing the ethereal guitars of Miles Davis’ “In a Silent Way” on a night when the stars look so low you could pluck them out of the sky. On foot you may notice the 8-foot telescope beneath the rotating dome look into the eyepiece see the rings of Saturn craters of the moon.

Lesson Seven: You will be transported – somewhere

The red and cream cruiser with the red and rainbow wheels has a transporting effect. But not in the sense that it transports you from point A to point B and back again. The effect I’m talking about somehow transported me back in time. This time travel glitch did not alter the physical world around me but it without a doubt shifted the emotional realm within me.

Flying through the playa dust on the red and cream cruiser with the red and rainbow wheels I returned to a time of potent courage and discovery I had not experienced since I was a child on my home planet. On the cruiser wonder returned. Awe guided the direction of my handlebars. Curiosity compelled me to get lost. I realized I had no responsibility other than finding my own way.

This sandbox freedom reconnected me to a time long long ago when I pedaled my silver trick bike with gumball blue pegs down sidewalks illuminated streetlamp yellow imagining that –– if I could just pedal fast enough –– the fabric of that reality could tear and I could slip into a portal to a new reality of light and sound and color. And that feeling I discovered is what Burning Man on a bicycle is all about. Riding the red and cream cruiser dust trailing the red and rainbow wheels like rocket smoke I felt like a kid again –– like I could lift up and off the playa and through the dust and into the stars to a new galaxy far from the one I call home.

TULARE Calif. (KFSN) -- One person has died and two others were injured after a shooting in Tulare early Saturday morning.

Tulare police say it happened on South Blackstone just before 1:30 am.

Egypt bought an 11-year-old Boeing 747-8 from the planemaker and is modifying it for executive use.

The jumbo jet is practically new having only flown a handful of flights since being built in 2011.

Several other countries operate 747 variants as VIP transport aircraft like Turkey Oman and the US.

The beloved Boeing 747 may have lost interest from airlines but it lives on as a popular executive transport aircraft.

The mammoth 747 made its first commercial flight with Pan Am in 1970 launching the era of widebody long-haul transit. Powered by four engines the plane could fly across the Atlantic and for the first time made travel affordable for people other than just the rich and famous.

Now after over half a century of production Boeing's revolutionary 747 program will come to an end this year as the company builds its last-ever jumbo jet. The final plane — a 747-8 freighter — will go to cargo carrier Atlas Air.

The plane's demise came as airlines started favoring more fuel-efficient twin-engine widebody planes that could make the trek across the Atlantic but at lower operating costs like the Boeing 787 or the Airbus A350.

The COVID-19 pandemic was the nail in the coffin for many 747s as carriers like British Airways KLM Qantas and Virgin Atlantic sped up their retirement.

While airlines worldwide are parking their 747s the jumbo jet still remains popular with country governments. The latest nation to take ownership of the Queen of the Skies is Egypt which purchased the jet registered SU-EGY in 2021 per Simple Flying.

The 747-8 will replace the country's 28-year-old Airbus A340 government plane.

To fly as an executive jet SU-EGY needs some modifications. According to Simple Flying the jet was sent to Hamburg for an interior outfit by maintenance repair and overhaul services company Lufthansa Technik.

After what appears to be about nine months of cabin work the 747 then flew from Hamburg to Shannon Ireland per FlightAware data to get a new paint job.

The company doing the work is International Aerospace Coatings (IAC) which has completed projects like United Airlines' Star Wars-themed livery on a 737-800 and Allegiant Air's Las Vegas Golden Knights paint job on an A319.

Like other VIP transport 747s the plane is expected to have a luxury interior similar to Air Force One in the US or the Qatari government's former 747-8i.

Soon Egypt will join the myriad countries using the Queen of the Skies as a government transport plane proving the outdated 747 is still a beloved aircraft in modern times.







Here are all of the nations that use the iconic jumbo jet for VIP use.

US

The US currently operates two Boeing 747-200 aircraft for presidential use but is spending an estimated $5.3 billion to upgrade the fleet to more efficient 747-8s. The original models were first used by President George H.W. Bush in the early 1990s.

China does not have a dedicated presidential jet but instead borrows 747-400 airliners from Air China for ad hoc VIP transport missions. According to the Asia Times the country is reportedly converting an Air China 747-8 to use exclusively for presidential flights due to repeated mechanical and security issues on the -400s.

South Korea

Turkey's VIP 747-8i was gifted from the Qatar royal family in 2018 according to the BBC. The ultra-luxurious $500 million jet can carry 76 passengers and has seven bedrooms and two boardrooms.

Brunei's parked 747-400 presidential plane was unique because it was flown by the Sultan himself Hassanal Bolkiah who flew it to meet with President Barack Obama in 2013.

According to The Points Guy the ultra-wealthy Sultan used some of his own money to purchase the jet from Lufthansa and used to fly it around the world. The interior is reportedly gold-plated and nicknamed ""the flying palace"" per the South China Morning Post.

The plane has since been parked and replaced with a 747-8 model per TPG.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9ydXNzaWEtczctYWlybGluZXMtcmV0dXJuLWJvZWluZy03MzctbWF4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Russia Allows S7 Airlines To Return Leased Boeing 737 MAXs,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9ydXNzaWEtczctYWlybGluZXMtcmV0dXJuLWJvZWluZy03MzctbWF4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vYWlyd2F5c21hZy5jb20vcmV4LXJlY2VpdmVzLXNldmVudGgtNzM3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rex Receives Seventh Boeing 737-800 – Airways,"DALLAS - Rex Airlines (ZL) has taken delivery of its seventh Boeing 737-800 at its Brisbane (BNE) base.

Ferrari never sold this fellow in the United States due to its carbureted engine which didn’t comply with emission regulations. Come 1979 the Prancing Horse gifted the four-seat grand tourer with mechanical fuel injection thus giving birth to the 400i.

Offered through 1985 the 400i uses the renowned K-Jetronic system developed by German engineering and technology company Bosch. The first series-production car to feature K-Jetronic is the Porsche 911T and the 400i is Ferrari’s first-ever production car equipped with this technology.Named this way after the (nearly) 400 cubic centimeters of each cylinder the 400i displaces 4823 cubic centimeters. An evolution of the legendary V12 developed by Gioacchino Colombo in 1947 this lump is codenamed F101 D. At first glance the only difference over the F101 C in the 400 is a letter. On the other hand the D embodies all the changes that Maranello had to make with the adoption of Bosch K-Jetronic mechanical fuel injection.The distributors used by the carbureted 400 were replaced by a single unit and electronic ignition supplied by Magneti Marelli. Considering that Ferrari made the switch to fuel injection for more favorable emissions test results it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the F101 D isn’t as powerful as the F101 C. 311 ponies and 304 pound-foot (412 Nm) compared to 335 ponies and 347 pound-foot (471 Nm) is a tremendous difference no doubt about it!Just like the 400 the Prancing Horse’s first production car to be offered with a torque-converter automatic the 400i could be had with a five-speed manual and a three-speed automatic. As a result manuals were sold as the 400i GT and automatics were sold as the 400i A. Even though Ferrari says the automatic tranny is supplied by BorgWarner bear in mind that it's designed by General Motors. The automatic in question is the long-running TH400.Regardless of transmission the gran turismo is rocking a limited-slip differential a self-leveling rear axle power steering telescopic shocks from Koni coil springs unequal-length wishbones and two anti-roll bars. The Italian outfit also provided 15- by 7-inch Cromodora five-spoke alloys Michelin XWX rubber boots ventilated disc brakes and twin fuel tanks.The 2700-millimeter (106.3-inch) wheelbase was the longest of any production car from the Prancing Horse. By comparison the subsequent 456 and 612 boast 4600 mm (102.3 in) and 2950 mm (116.1 in) respectively. Unveiled in 1979 at the Turin Motor Show the most expensive Ferrari of that era uses the tubular steel frames of the 400 before it. The 400i is pretty similar in terms of exterior design too save for the redesigned taillights.Styled by Leonardo Fioravanti at Pininfarina the 400 series is mostly steel in terms of chassis and bodywork. The only exceptions are the aluminum hood and trunk lid. Pop-up headlights and branded mirror caps also need to be mentioned along with leather upholstery air conditioning a radio electric windows and a three-spoke steering wheel that frames a 300-kph speedo.The instrument cluster also consists of a tachometer that goes to 8000 rpm and two centrally-mounted gauges for the oil pressure and water temperature. Where the center console meets the dashboard the 400i presents you with a clock the fuel readout and oil temperature gauge.Tipping the scales at 1830 kilograms (4034 pounds) the fuel-injected sibling is obviously heavier than the 400 . In combination with the poorer output figures the additional weight took its toll on top speed. According to Ferrari the 400i tops 150 miles per hour (241 kilometers per hour) compared to 153 miles per hour (246 kilometers per hour) for the 400.As expected acceleration wasn’t particularly stellar either. Be that as it may zero-to-60 times aren’t of the essence. Enzo Ferrari used the 400i as his company car which speaks volumes about how the 400i is meant to be enjoyed. Famous owners also include Welsh actor Richard Burton Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham and Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman.Updated in time for the 1982 Paris Motor Show the 400i was never meant to sell like hot cakes. Enzo-era Ferrari was more into racing than sales volumes and the prohibitive price of the 400i didn’t help either. A grand total of 1305 units were produced through 1985 of which 833 were specified with the automatic transmission designed by General Motors.Despite its Bosch-sourced injection system the 400i was never sold in the United States on emissions and safety grounds.

BD Aptra™ Digital Endoscope System is intended to be used by physicians to access visualize and perform procedures in the urinary tract and the kidney. The

instrument enables delivery and use of accessories such as biopsy forceps laser fibers graspers and retrieval baskets at a surgical site.

Contraindications

Diagnostic or therapeutic ureteroscopy is contraindicated in people with an untreated urinary tract infection.

Other contraindications to therapeutic ureteroscopy (e.g. lithotripsy endopyelotomy tumor therapy) are more numerous and can mirror those associated with the

corresponding open surgical interventions. Patients on anticoagulants or with coagulopathies should be managed appropriately.

Warnings

• Do not use electromedical energy sources in the presence of flammable detergents anesthetics nitrous oxide (N2O) or oxygen.

• Consult the user manuals of all electromedical energy sources used with endoscopic instruments for appropriate instruments warnings and cautions prior to

use. Such sources of energy include electrical electrohydraulic electrosurgical heat hydraulic laser light pressure sound ultrasound and vacuum.

• Do not insert or advance the ureteroscope unless there is a clear live endoscopic view of the lumen through which the scope is being advanced (or confirm with

visualization by other imaging modalities).

• During the procedure if the live endoscopic image is lost do not advance or insert the ureteroscope and do not insert advance or actuate accessories.

• Do not use excessive force while advancing or withdrawing the scope. If resistance is felt during advancement or withdrawal of the scope investigate the source

of resistance and/or take remedial action if necessary.

• Do not force the distal tip of the ureteroscope against the sidewall of the ureter or renal pelvis.

• Do not use excessive force when advancing or withdrawing an accessory within the ureteroscope.

• When inserting or using accessories maintain continuous visualization of the distal tip. Ensure that the distance between the distal tip of the ureteroscope and

the object in view is greater than the ureteroscope’s minimum visible distance. Failure to do so may result in the accessories causing patient injury.

• Do not withdraw a laser fiber back into the ureteroscope while the laser is firing. Doing so may cause patient injury and/or scope damage.

• Do not look directly into the light emitted from the ureteroscope.

• Verify ground isolation when setting up and using accessories from different manufacturers prior to procedure.

• Do not open the handle of the ureteroscope.

• The ureteroscope is a single-use device and there are no serviceable parts. Do not repair damaged or non-operating ureteroscopes. Do not use the ureteroscope

if damage is discovered or suspected.

• Do not excessively bend the flexible shaft or the articulating section of the ureteroscope.

• If damage to the ureteroscope occurs or it stops functioning during a procedure stop using the ureteroscope immediately. See troubleshooting section for more

information. Continue the procedure with a new ureteroscope as appropriate.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJvc3RvbnBpbG90LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLnBocD9JRD0xOTMxMjDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Local deacon recounts journey from homelessness to nuclear scientist. Published Sep. 2 2022. Local.,"WAKEFIELD -- Like the two disciples on the road to Emmaus Deacon Tam Tran says he did not recognize God walking with him throughout much of his life. Born into a Buddhist family in Vietnam he came to the Catholic faith after years of hardship and worldly success and later after a near-death experience discerned a call to the permanent diaconate.



Deacon Tran who is a deacon at St. Theresa Parish in North Reading shared the story of his life in a presentation at St. Florence Church on Aug. 24. Dozens came to hear about his childhood in Vietnam his career as a scientist and his eventual conversion to Catholicism and ordination to the permanent diaconate.



He began speaking about the disciples who failed to recognize Jesus on the road to Emmaus. Like them Deacon Tran did not realize that Jesus had been walking with him until later in his journey.



""If Jesus could walk with me a poor Buddhist boy I think he could walk with anybody. In fact he walks with everybody we just don't recognize him"" Deacon Tran said.

His early life was marked with great suffering. As an infant he and his brother both had typhoid fever to which his brother succumbed. When he was six his father grandmother and baby sister all died within a few months of each other. His mother who sold lottery tickets for a living could not afford to feed all six of her children. Since Deacon Tran was the oldest she told him to find food and shelter from their neighbors or relatives.



As a child Deacon Tran had personal reasons to hate the Catholic Church. He tried to enter an orphanage where he could have received shelter and education but the nuns who ran it would not take him in because he still had a living parent. Later when his family moved a priest denied his mother a piece of land from the government because they were Buddhists. Deacon Tran retaliated against the local church by breaking their windows and poking a beehive when people came out of the building.



His first jobs included carrying buckets of water shepherding water buffalo and shining shoes. He learned to read by peeking into a school window to observe lessons. He was finally able to go to school himself when an aunt took in his family.



Deacon Tran said that sometimes being poor is an advantage because it gives an incentive to work harder and teaches resourcefulness.



""Poor is a blessing. And poor is opportunity because the only way to go is up"" he said.



While most men his age were fighting -- and dying -- in the Vietnam War Deacon Tran received permission to travel to the U.S. to study chemical engineering. He started attending the University of Michigan in 1971. When he was unable to pay the cost he sought out the most affordable school in the country which at the time was the University of Massachusetts Lowell. At his dean's suggestion he added nuclear engineering to his studies doubling the normal courseload and taking classes at Harvard and MIT.



He married his wife Thom and went on to patent several inventions including a water recycling system for the International Space Station kidney dialysis membrane and more efficient car parts. In 1995-1996 he became the first Asian American to be elected national president of the American Electroplaters and Surface Finishers Society.



Riding at the top of his career Deacon Tran had nothing to gain from becoming Catholic. But a few things pushed him toward the Church. One was his ownership of some water from Lourdes which never turned cloudy despite being exposed to open air for years defying scientific explanation. He also learned about the Vietnamese martyrs about 130000 people killed by the Vietnamese emperor in 1833 for refusing to renounce their faith. Finally he learned how many great scientists had been Catholic. In 1997 he was received into the Catholic Church.



He had a near-death experience and a seemingly miraculous recovery when he had a heart attack in 2008. He was unconscious for five days and his wife asked everyone they knew to pray for him. During that time Deacon Tran said he could see light feel the presence of angels and hear music that he had never heard before. When he woke he was not sure if what he had experienced was real or imagined but after years of research about angels he concluded it must have been real. After that he vowed to do whatever God wanted him to do and he felt the call to become a permanent deacon.



When Deacon Tran joined the permanent diaconate in 2014 he was assigned to serve at St. Theresa Parish and as a chaplain at Umass Boston. As he was struggling to attract students to ministry and catechesis he thought of the missionaries in Vietnam who had fed the people first and baptized them later. Inspired by that ""business model"" he decided to offer free courses -- one about investing and another about ""how to get along with jerks."" When he began each course he would introduce himself and explain what a Catholic deacon is. This allowed him to mix theology with his subject matter.



In his presentation Deacon Tran shared his ideas and plans for various projects including ways to raise money for campus ministries as well as scientific ventures like replacing coal with sorghum as a source of fuel. He shared that he is working on writing three books: one about politics one a memoir about his life and one about the relationship between faith and science.



Deacon Tran encouraged his audience to ""be humble and fruitful.""



""God chooses ordinary people to do extraordinary things"" he said.



He ended his presentation by talking about the parable of the talents in Matthew 25:14-30.



""If you follow Jesus he will make you a miracle worker. Miracles happen every day. Change your perception of what a miracle is and you will see them all around you. The moment you are ready to quit is usually the moment right before the miracle happens so don't give up"" Deacon Tran said.



Stephanie Oliveira a Umass Boston student attended Deacon Tran's talk and stayed afterwards to talk with him and his wife.



""I think young adults like me need to look up to people like him and see the face of God in him and try to do the same thing that he is doing which is using his gifts and his talents to serve God and to serve community"" Oliveira told The Pilot.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVzY2llbmNlLmNvbS81OTIzNC1jaG9jb2xhdGUtbWF5LWhlbHAtcHJldmVudC1hdHJpYWwtZmlicmlsbGF0aW9uLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sweet Therapy: Chocolate May Help Prevent Irregular Heartbeat,"Eating chocolate has been linked with a reduced risk of heart disease and stroke and now a new study from Denmark suggests that regular consumption of the treat may help to prevent the development of atrial fibrillation a type of irregular heartbeat.

Researchers found that adults in the study who ate chocolate at least once a month — or more frequently than that — had rates of atrial fibrillation that were 10 to 20 percent lower than those who ate chocolate less than once a month according to the findings published today (May 23) in the journal Heart.

Atrial fibrillation is a condition in which the heart's two upper chambers known as the atria do not beat at the same pace as the heart's two lower chambers resulting in an irregular heartbeat. The condition increases a person's risk of strokes heart failure and cognitive impairment.

The study found that the strongest overall effects were seen in men and women who ate 1 ounce of chocolate two to six times per week said the lead author of the study Elizabeth Mostofsky a researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centerin Boston. [5 Surprising Ways to Be Heart Healthy]

One ounce of chocolate is equal to about three or four small individual Dove Bar squares for example Mostofsky said.

Between 2.7 million and 6.1 million Americans have atrial fibrillation so it's important to identify effective ways to help prevent the condition from developing the researchers wrote in their study.

Two previous studies have looked at the connection between chocolate consumption and the risk of developing atrial fibrillation but the results from both of those studies suggested that any association found may be due to chance.

Unlike those two earlier studies whose participants were only men or only women the new study included both men and women. And the new study also included adults who had been clinically diagnosed with atrial fibrillation rather than people who had self-reported the condition as was the case with the previous studies.

In the new study the researchers analyzed data collected from more than 55000 adults between ages 50 and 64 in Denmark. All of them were participants in an ongoing study called the Danish Diet Cancer and Health Study. [5 Wacky Things That Are Good for Your Health]

When the participants were first recruited for the study between 1993 and 1997 they completed a detailed food-frequency questionnaire. One of those questions asked how frequently the participant ate chocolate during the past year.

Chocolate in moderation

The researchers found that more than 3300 adults were diagnosed with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (a condition in which the heart beats faster than usual but is not irregular) over the follow-up period of 13.5 years on average.

When researchers took into consideration other factors that could influence people's development of atrial fibrillation such as alcohol intake smoking obesity high blood pressure and cholesterol levels the study showed an association between people with a moderate intake of chocolate and a lower risk of developing atrial fibrillation.

The study does not prove there is a cause-and-effect relationship between eating chocolate and a lowered risk of atrial fibrillation. And although the exact mechanism of how chocolate may prevent atrial fibrillation is not known it's possible that compounds in chocolate called flavonoids may play a role the researchers said.

Flavonoids have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties Mostofsky said. They may limit the inflammatory process in the body reducing the stickiness of the blood and leading to less scarring of connective tissue. All of these factors may help prevent the electrical remodeling of the heart that leads to atrial fibrillation she explained.

The findings showed that for women the strongest association was seen in those who ate a 1-ounce serving of chocolate once a week – this level of consumption was linked to a 21 percent lower risk of atrial fibrillation. For men the strongest association was seen in those who ate two to six 1-ounce servings of chocolate weekly. These men had a 23 percent lower risk of atrial fibrillation.

But Mostofsky cautioned that chocolate sold in Europe generally has a higher cocoa content than chocolate available in the United States. [6 Distinctive Food Guides from Around the World]

All in all the findings suggest that compared with some other snack choices a moderate intake of chocolate may be a heart-healthy snack Mostofsky told Live Science. But people should choose chocolate with a higher cocoa content which has more health benefits and protective compounds she said.

One of the limitations of the study is that people in Denmark are more similar to each other in race and ethnicity than people in other countries so the findings may not be generalizable to other populations other researchers wrote in an editorial accompanying the study.

The chocolate consumers in the study were also generally healthier better educated and had lower rates of high blood pressure and diabetes than the people who didn't eat chocolate and all of these factors could lessen their odds for atrial fibrillation wrote the editorial authors Dr. Jonathan Piccini and Dr. Sean Pokorney. Both doctors are cardiologists at the Duke Center for Atrial Fibrillation at Duke University Medical Center in Durham North Carolina.

Even so Piccini and Pokorney said ""the findings are interesting and warrant further consideration given the importance of identifying effective prevention strategies for atrial fibrillation.""

Since 25 percent of adults will develop atrial fibrillation over the course of their lifetime there is a need to identify additional prevention targets including lifestyle factors to lower the risk according to the editorial.

Coronary artery disease is the most common cause of heart failure and is associated with poor survival and low quality of life despite advances in medical therapy.2 Treating the coronary arteries to improve blood supply (revascularization) has long been considered as a treatment option in this population. In the STICH trial coronary artery bypass surgery improved survival but only in highly selected typically young patients.3 However the benefit took 10 years to emerge largely due to the early harm of the operation. PCI was an attractive alternative to bypass surgery as it might offer the benefits of revascularization without the early hazard. However there was no randomized evidence to support this and guidelines recommending the use of this treatment in some patients were based only on expert opinion.

REVIVED-BCIS2 is the first adequately powered randomized trial to examine the efficacy and safety of PCI in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction.5 The trial enrolled patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction 35% or below) extensive coronary artery disease and demonstrable viability in at least four dysfunctional myocardial segments that could be revascularized by PCI. Viability could be assessed by any modality but cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was used most. Those with a myocardial infarction within four weeks decompensated heart failure or sustained ventricular arrhythmias within 72 hours were excluded.

A total of 700 patients from 40 centers in the UK were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either PCI with optimal medical therapy or optimal medical therapy alone. The median age of participants was 70 years 88% were men and the mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 28%. The primary outcome was the composite of all-cause death or hospitalization for heart failure. Secondary outcomes included left ventricular ejection fraction at six and 12 months and quality of life measures.

During a median follow up of 3.4 years the primary outcome occurred in 129 (37.2%) patients in the PCI group and 134 (38.0%) patients in the medical therapy alone group for a hazard ratio of 0.99 (95% confidence interval 0.78–1.27 p=0.96).

Chief Investigator Professor Divaka Perera of King’s College London UK said: “PCI provided no incremental benefit over optimal medical therapy in this high-risk population where approximately one in three patients died or were hospitalized with heart failure during follow-up.”

No significant difference was seen between groups in the major secondary outcome of the trial left ventricular ejection fraction at six and 12 months. Given that only patients with demonstrable myocardial viability were enrolled the latter finding challenges the concept of myocardial hibernation which for decades has been considered an adaptation of the heart to cope with the effects of severe coronary disease that can be reversed by treating the coronary disease.

Quality of life (the other major secondary outcome) favored PCI at six and 12 months but there was no difference between groups at 24 months.

Professor Perera said: “We can conclude that PCI should not be offered to stable patients with ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction if the sole aim is to provide prognostic benefit. Our findings were consistent across all subgroups and for all prespecified outcome measures. These definitive results should help to rationalize guidelines on managing coronary disease in patients with very poor left ventricular function. However it is important to note that REVIVED-BCIS2 excluded patients with limiting angina or recent acute coronary syndromes and PCI is still an option in these contexts.”

The settlement benefits individuals or entities who purchased Atripla Complera Evotaz Reyataz Sustiva Stribild Truvada or any of their generic equivalents directly from manufacturers between Oct. 6 2016 and Oct. 19 2021.

Combination antiretroviral therapy or cART drugs use a combination of HIV drugs to keep HIV infections controlled. These drugs stop the virus from replicating in the body allowing virus numbers to drop to undetectable levels. Drugs used for cART include Atripla Complera Evotaz Reyataz Sustiva Stribild Truvada and generic equivalents.

According to an antitrust class action lawsuit Bristol-Myers Squibb and Gilead Sciences conspired together to raise the price of cART drugs. The companies allegedly worked together to extend their drug patents and suppress generic competitors — allowing them to charge supracompetitive prices.

The antitrust class action lawsuit claims these actions resulted in significant financial damages for direct purchasers who were forced to pay a much higher price for HIV cART drugs than they would have in a healthy market.

Bristol-Myers Squibb hasn’t admitted any wrongdoing but agreed to resolve these allegations with a $10.8 million class action settlement. The company agreed to pay an additional $200000 for settlement notice expenses.

This settlement does not resolve the remaining claims against Gilead Sciences.

Under the terms of the HIV cART drugs settlement class members can receive a cash payment based on the number of qualifying purchases made during the class period.

Purchases of brand medications will receive a larger weight than those of generic drugs. Unit volume will also play a role in payment allocation. Exact payments will vary with no estimates available.

If funds remain in the settlement class members may receive a second distribution. However if remaining funds don’t warrant a second payment distribution they will be held in escrow for any additional disbursements — for example if Gilead settles the claims against it.

In addition to funding settlement payments Bristol-Myers Squibb agreed to waive the enforcement of part of its Evotaz licensing agreement with Gilead. This means Gilead will be able to authorize a third party to market or license a combination drug containing Gilead’s Cobicistat and Reyataz or generic atazanavir. However Gilead is not required to do so.

The deadline for exclusion and objection is Oct. 6 2022.

The final approval hearing for the Bristol-Myers Squibb HIV cART drugs settlement is scheduled for Nov. 17 2022.

Just as Biocon touted its biosimilar manufacturing capabilities in a proposed acquisition of partner Viatris’ biosimilar portfolio the Indian company was hit with multiple Forms 483. Its two biologics plants in India got 11 observations each and its Malaysian site received six observations. They followed preapproval inspections of a biosimilar to Roche’s Avastin and two insulins.

Shanghai Henlius Biotech a unit of Fosun Pharma is looking for a U.S. partner for its China-approved PD-1 inhibitor serplulimab CEO Wenjie Zhang said. The company is initially targeting small cell lung cancer where Bristol Myers Squibb’s Opdivo and Merck’s Keytruda have chalked up failures. Zhang also believed that the expected inclusion of biologics and biosimilars in China’s volume-based procurement won’t hurt Henlius’ anchor biosimilar business too much.

Takeda decided to end its inflammatory bowel disease collaboration with Finch Therapeutics which included two preclinical microbiome-based candidates. The news came a year after Takeda decided to accelerate the transition of development responsibility for one asset ahead of the originally planned first-in-human study. In the deal Takeda has paid $44 million in total including for R&D expense reimbursement.

Study Details

In the multicenter study 108 patients received luspatercept for up to 5 years. Among the 108 patients 62 did and 44 did not have ring sideroblasts; 34 were non­–transfusion dependent; and 29 and 45 had low and high transfusion burdens respectively.

Key Findings

Overall hematologic improvement–erythroid occurred in 58 (53.7%) of 108 patients including: 42 (67.7%) of 62 patients with ring sideroblasts vs 16 (36.4%) of 44 with non–ring sideroblasts (P = .002) 24 (70.6%) of 34 non–transfusion dependent patients 17 (89.5%) of 19 non–transfusion dependent patients with ring sideroblasts 10 (34.5%) of 29 low–transfusion burden vs 24 (53.3%) of 45 high–transfusion burden patients (P = .115) and 7 (46.7%) of 15 non–transfusion dependent patients with non–ring sideroblasts 3 (23.1%) of 13 low–transfusion burden patients with non–ring sideroblasts and 6 (37.5%) 16 high–transfusion burden patients with non–ring sideroblasts. Hematologic improvement–erythroid was observed in 35 (74.5%) of 47 patients with SF3B1 mutations vs 19 (38.8%) of 49 with wild-type SF3B1 (P < .001) and 6 (33.3%) of 18 with non-SF3B1 splicing factor mutations vs 13 (41.9%) of 31 with no splicing factor mutations (P = .031).

Hematologic improvement–erythroid response was accompanied by a nearly threefold increase in bone marrow late to early progenitor cell ratio irrespective of ring sideroblast status and was associated with lower baseline erythropoietin levels in non–ring sideroblast patients (69.6 vs 623.3 IU/L P = .008) and higher late to early erythroid progenitor cell ratio (10.44 vs 4.48 P = .011) in ring sideroblast patients.

Hematologic improvement–neutrophil was observed in 8 (33.3%) of 24 patients including 4 (25.0%) of 16 non–ring sideroblast and 6 (46.2%) of 13 high–transfusion burden patients 4 (80.0%) of 5 with SF3B1 mutations vs 6 (42.9%) of 14 with wild-type SF3B1 (P = .224) and 1 (33.3%) of 3 with non-SF3B1 splicing factor mutations vs 5 (45.5%) of 11 with no splicing factor mutations (P = .894).

Hematologic improvement–platelet was observed in 2 (9.5%) of 21 patients overall including 1 (20.0%) of 5 with SF3B1 mutations vs 4 (33.3%) of 12 with wild-type SF3B1 (P = .509) and 2 (50.0%) of 4 with non-SF3B1 splicing factor mutations vs 2 (25.0%) of 8 with no splicing factor mutations (P = .418).

No new safety signals were identified.

The investigators concluded: “This study highlights luspatercept’s effects across lower-risk MDS subtypes… serving as a platform for future trials.”

Revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter will be about US$8.9bil (RM39.9bil) Broadcom said in a statement Thursday compared with an average analyst estimate of US$8.72bil (RM39.1bil). The shares rose about 2% in late trading following the report.

The outlook suggests Broadcom is sidestepping a broader decline in chip demand at least for now. Other suppliers including Nvidia Corp Intel Corp and Micron Technology Inc have predicted a steep sales slowdown – hurt by sluggish orders of personal computers and smartphones.

Given that pessimism Broadcom chief executive officer Hock Tan acknowledged that his company’s report was “somewhat surreal.”

“From our vantage point infrastructure spending is still very much holding” Tan said on a conference call with analysts. “It’s true end demand.”

Broadcom’s backlog of orders which can’t be cancelled is expanding and now sits at US$31bil (RM139.1bil) Tan said.

The company is rigorous in ensuring that those orders reflect demand for real products – and aren’t just going to be sitting in a warehouse. Broadcom’s average lead time the gap between getting an order and filling it remains at 50 weeks Tan said.

Broadcom is faring better than companies that focus on chips for personal computers which aren’t selling well because consumers are coping with inflation and putting off big-ticket purchases.

Nvidia revealed an additional headache this week when it said that new restrictions on exporting to China could hurt sales. The warning triggered a decline in chip stocks Thursday with Nvidia falling as much as 12%.

Broadcom which gets about 30% of its chip revenue from China hasn’t received a notice from the US government and doesn’t expect to according to Tan.

It sells a wide range of chips making it a bellwether for the tech industry.

Its semiconductors provide short-range connectivity for many Apple Inc devices including the iPhone. Other products are key to the networking machinery inside giant data centres owned by Amazon.com Inc’s AWS and Alphabet Inc’s Google.

Cisco Systems Inc uses those same chips in its products for corporate data centers and a different range of Broadcom silicon runs many of the world’s set-top boxes.

Broadcom said demand from its large North American customer its code for Apple was solid and that it expects an increase in the current period when that company debuts a new range of models.

The chip supplier said it expects unit volumes to be about the same as they were when the previous model was introduced.

Broadcom also has branched out into enterprise software by acquiring security and mainframe capabilities. And it’s trying to extend that diversification with a US$61bil (RM273.6bil) purchase of VMWare Inc in a transaction announced May 26. — Bloomberg",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHdpcmVhc2lhLmNvbS8wOS8yMDIyL2lzLXRoZS10ZWNoLWluZHVzdHJ5LXJlYWxseS1oZWFkZWQtaW50by1yZWNlc3Npb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is the tech industry really headed into recession?,"Everyone wants to avoid recession especially with the impact it can bring to the economy. While some may feel that their jobs may be secured as they work in industries that will least likely be hit by a recession the reality is ever industry is now in danger of experiencing this problem no matter how profitable they are.

The Economist reports that the signals are already flashing red in Europe especially with the region finally beginning to experience the full impact of the ongoing crisis between Russia and the Ukraine. In the US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned last week of the central bank’s effort to fight inflation.

In fact many economists are projecting to hit the US by the end of next year especially with more people struggling to cover their expenses and such. CNN reports that close to 40% of Americans are already facing this problem and its most likely to get worse in the months to come.

Looking at the tech industry recession is now becoming even more obvious given the recent lay offs by large tech companies. Make no mistake tech companies have been profitable for the longest time. However with increasing costs and geopolitical pressure more tech companies are already thinking how they can survive the next year.

Most recently Snap Inc the parent company of Snapchat announced plans to layoff up to 20% of their employees. Meta and Apple have also released a number of contract staff while Robinhood laid off about 23% of its staff in August as well. Microsoft and Tesla also made headlines when they announce plans of staff layoff.

Apart from recession due to economic reasons there is also the concern of employees being laid off due to merger and acquisitions. For example most Twitter employees are still feeling uncertain about their job security since Elon Musk announced plans to acquire the company. VMware employees are also concerned on the future of their jobs with Broadcom’s acquisition of the company expected to close by the fiscal year of 2023.

History has also shown that most merger and acquisitions have resulted in some job cuts despite new hires coming in eventually.

Recession looming in Southeast Asia?

In Southeast Asia South China Morning Post reported a Chinese tech engineer being laid off by Shopee just as he arrives in the country to start his new job. Shopee has already shut down their business in several countries including India. Several crypto companies based in Singapore have also reduced their staff.

Despite this some tech workers feel there is still hope especially with the market still showing a demand for tech employees. While the tech giants are feeling the heat from a potential economic slow down other industries are increasing their tech adoption and are looking to bring in more tech employees to ensure they have a sufficient workforce.

Reports have shown that tech related roles in Southeast Asia are still plenty. However the challenge now is for companies to meet the requirements of their new employees especially with a majority of them looking for remote or hybrid based roles.

The reality is though the tech industry is one of the richest industry in the world. And if they are feeling the pinch of a global economic slowdown its only a sign that worst has yes to come.

Recession is inevitable and enterprises need to ensure they have sufficient plans in place for business continuity. Reducing the workforce should only be seen as the last resort especially with most employees dedicating their commitment and passion to their employers during the pandemic.",,,,,,

BRO,Brown & Brown,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjQvbWF5LzA5L3N1Z2FyLW9yaWdpbi1oaXN0b3J50gFQaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2Vudmlyb25tZW50L2FydGljbGUvMjAyNC9tYXkvMDkvc3VnYXItb3JpZ2luLWhpc3Rvcnk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Sugar is brown!’: there’s more to the sweet stuff than its pure white version,"One night I was preparing steak for dinner and mistakenly reached for the wrong white granulated substance. Instead of salting my steak to create a brown crust by searing I created a brown crust with notes of caramel.

Ethan Frisch co-founder of Burlap & Barrel an artisanal spice company that works with small producers worldwide laughed wryly when he heard this story over Zoom. “This is the first time in history anyone could make that mistake. Refined white-bleached sugar is a very modern development in the centuries-old sugar industry. Sugar is brown! It’s only white when you do a lot of work to remove the brownness.”

His co-founder Ori Zohar elaborated: “The whole sugar industry is focused on this pure white chemical that is so far away from being a plant: a shelf-stable consistent interchangeable ingredient. None of those qualities make for good food” though it makes an item that can be traded around the world for similar base prices.

Many of us only know white granulated sugar that comes packaged with no information about its sugarcane or beet origins – much less its geographical origins – on its package. But sugar is diverse. White processed sugar makes up the largest segment of the global market but sugar also comes in liquid and brown forms. About 80% of the world’s production comes from sugarcane but some comes from beets. Even sugarcane itself is not a monolith; though most sugar is derived from the Saccharum officinarum species and its hybrids there are hundreds of varieties which have adapted (or been adapted through human intervention) to their specific ecosystems.

Zohar and Frisch are on a mission to “do to sugar what has been done to salt” in the last few years. You can now buy specialty salts from specific places and have specific characteristics: a black Himalayan salt that has a sulphurous funk or Burlap and Barrel’s Pearl salt from Tanzania’s Swahili coast with its surprisingly spherical crystals.

Saltverk which sells hand-harvested salt from Iceland has been riding this wave. Founder Björn Steinar Jónsson said “People want to know where the products they’re buying are from. We’ve seen this as a gradual growth in the salt industry and really we’re only at the beginning stages of where people understand what’s going into their salts. As a staple ingredient used by most of the world sugar could follow a similar path.”

This is not just marketing. A sugar’s texture and taste can be as individual as coffee beans from a corner of Ethiopia or wine grapes grown on a chilly slope in the Pacific north-west.

Brown sugar from Okinawa in Japan is a favorite of pastry chef Salvatore Martone of Le Jardinier in New York. He said: “Okinawa brown sugar (kokuto) is produced on eight remote Japanese islands. Each island produces sugar that has a slightly different taste. The sugar is sold in small irregular lumps and the flavor is rich minerally smokiness with an earthy undertone and a hint of bitterness.” He uses it for ice-cream.

Burlap & Barrel’s founders want to introduce consumers to sugars connected to a specific place and that have a distinctive flavor born of the environment that produced them. The company’s work expands the market for traceable sugar focusing on sourcing from communities using traditional processing methods.

It’s introduced panela a traditionally unrefined cane sugar from Boyacá Colombia. In June the company is launching two other single-origin sugars jaggery from Satara district India and a granulated sugar from Portvale Barbados. When the company uses the term “single-origin” it doesn’t merely refer to a country of origin but a single farm or producer.

Had I reached for their sand-textured panela in making my steak I could not have mistaken it for salt. Its soft irregular granules are the color of milk caramel with which it shares similar aromas. A spoonful is like sucking on sweet cinnamon toffee. It melts on the tongue leaving a trace of floral spice as if I took a shot of ginger juice.

The jaggery has the varied irregular texture and look of crushed peanuts and opening it fills my apartment with the scent of fresh squeezed sugarcane. It comes from Dr Shashikant Salunkhe who has grown turmeric for Burlap & Barrel as part of a regenerative agricultural system. A local refiner filters the raw sugarcane juice with wild okra whose gel collects any floating impurities. The jaggery is granulated and then stone ground ancient methods that are worlds away from industrial filtration and mechanized refinement.

The Barbadian sugar’s crystals are startlingly angular and crunch loudly between one’s teeth.

“Barbadian sugar has to de-commoditize if they’re going to compete globally” said Frisch. This means that the country’s producers need to embrace their sugar as a specialty product and divert it from being blended with other sugars before it reaches supermarket shelves where it will be simply labeled “cane sugar”. Frisch wants people to understand what makes Barbadian sugar so good – the terroir of its coral island flavors enhanced by molasses cane fed by rainwater and not irrigation like in most industrial practices and its history.

View image in fullscreen Sugar production has an ugly past with roots in slavery and abhorrent working conditions into the present. Photograph: Ethan Frisch

Sugar production has an ugly past. About 5 million slaves were brought to the Caribbean most to toil on sugar plantations starting in the mid-1500s. The slave trade reached its height in the 1700s and Barbados known as Sugar Island was its crown jewel. Abolitionists in Europe and the US waged boycotts of sugar a slave-derived good that represented abhorrent working conditions.

Centuries later Frisch and Zohar want consumers to demand sugars that retain their individual nuanced flavors. “Home cooks and chefs have huge buying power” said Zohar which could advance more sustainable and equitable production. Sugarcane farms are responsible for massive deforestation. Added to innumerable food products sugar drives the global obesity epidemic. Sugar from the Dominican Republic’s Central Romana corporation which is often supplied to and sold as Domino brand has been banned from the US since November 2023 due to allegations about exploitative work conditions and forced labor among its largely Haitian migrant workforce.

But as of the moment it’s difficult to know exactly where your sugar comes from. Non-alcoholic beverage company Everleaf goes to extraordinary lengths to source botanicals. Founder Paul Mathew is a conservation biologist and his company has tracked down “cherry blossoms hand-picked in the Shizuoka region of Japan between May and August” and gum acacia used for mouthfeel from the Sahel region of Africa.

That wasn’t possible with sugar which Mathew said is all being “hoovered up into a commodity-based industrial system”. The UK-based company is currently switching from fair-trade sugar derived from sugarcane to beet sugar from the UK prioritizing a lesser carbon footprint.

One way for a company to know where its sugar comes from is for that business to grow it themself. This is what Copalli Rum in Belize chooses to do. The majority of rum is made from molasses produced when sugarcane juice is boiled multiple times in sugar’s refining process and sucrose is removed. But new agricole-style rums which are made from fermenting fresh sugarcane juice like Copalli are emerging from former commodity sugar plantation fields from Hawaii to Belize. Copalli uses red and black cane instead of yellow cane engineered over many years to produce commercial sugar in Belize.

Wil Maheia the philanthropy services advisor for Copalli has tended to this area his entire life. His great-grandparents worked the land when it was a sugarcane plantation and he helped organize Belize’s first debt-for-nature swap (a transaction where a country’s debt is exchanged for environmental conservation commitments).

He’s proud to say: “We have never cut any rainforest to plant cane.” To the contrary – Copalli is cultivating 220 acres of sugarcane on old citrus orchards rather than reaching into 12000 acres of rainforest. As the largest employer in southern Belize it’s creating jobs that do not rely on the logging industry and deforestation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd2VhdGhlci5jb20vc2NpZW5jZS9uYXR1cmUvdmlkZW8vYnJvd24tYmVhci1jaGFyZ2VzLWF0LWNhci1pbi1qYXBhbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brown Bear Charges At Car In Japan - Videos from The Weather Channel,"Weather in your inbox

After she became the NCAA's all-time scorer Brown was among those to send congratulations to the Hawkeyes sharpshooter but it came in a strange way.

""Congrats to Caitlin Clark on becoming all-time leading scorer"" he wrote in a message on X accompanied by a GIF of actor Mel Gibson with long flowing hair.

Brown later called the former Iowa Hawkeyes star the ""Cracker of the Day"" after he revealed to his followers on X that she blocked him on the social media platform. It appeared that one lewd attack after another finally crossed the line for Clark.

Well the former NFL receiver went on Jason Whitlock's podcast to discuss their social media beef.

""Caitlin Clark we love you. There's no drama here. I'm excited about what you're going to do for women's basketball. You're an amazing player. I love to watch your game. You bring a lot of excitement and energy"" Brown said.

Brown later said his made-up network CTESPN ""would love to have you talk express what you deal with your traumas your adversities how you continue to be great"" saying his comments about Clark were ""all in fun and games.""

""Continue to be great continue to keep focus on being the best athlete you want to be. Continue to lead women's sports and pioneering it the way you want to pioneer it. I have a daughter they look up to you and look up to everything you guys are doing. So shout out to you Caitlin Clark.""

It was a nice message from Brown at first. But then he couldn't help but throw in one more crude comment.

""If it's hairy don't worry about it"" Brown concluded.

It's tough to imagine that Clark will be unblocking Brown any time soon after that.

The comment resulted in a sigh and little chuckle from Whitlock.

BLDR continues its acquisition spree with its latest Trussway buyout. However the terms of the transaction have been kept under wraps.



Shares of Builders FirstSource gained by a meager 0.3% during yesterday’s trading session but slipped 1.2% during the after-hour trading session on Sep 1 2022.



Trussway is one of the leading providers of pre-fabricated roof and floor trusses and value-added building components and services. It provides roof and floor truss offerings to multifamily clients thereby enhancing Builders FirstSource’s value-added portfolio and accelerating growth.



Based in Houston Trussway with annualized revenues of $340 million serves more than 340 customer accounts in the United States. Trussway has a unique innovative in-house estimating design and engineering approach that will complement Builders FirstSource. Notably Builders FirstSource has also acquired Trussway’s integrated network of six strategically located manufacturing facilities across the country.

Strategic Acquisitions

Acquisitions are an important part of Builders FirstSource growth strategy to supplement its organic growth and expand extensively across vast geographic boundaries. Notably net sales for second-quarter 2022 were $6.9 billion a 24.2% increase from a year ago. Core organic sales increased by 12.2% acquisitions contributed net sales growth of 8.1% and commodity price inflation contributed 3.9%.



The company expects acquisitions that have been completed within the last 12 months to add net sales growth of 6% to 7%.



Among the latest buyouts on Apr 1 2022 the company made two transactions to acquire Texas Panel Truss Businesses and Valley Truss Co. Inc. for $169.4 million in cash and $31.2 million in cash respectively.



On Jul 1 it made a tuck-in acquisition of HomCo Lumber and Hardware. HomCo is a highly-profitable distributor in the attractive Flagstaff AZ market with low customer concentration and a diverse product mix. HomCo generated approximately $44 million in sales in 2021.

Abstract:

“The design of modern industrial products is further improved through the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation. Realistic simulation is enabled by the closed loop between the hardware under test (HUT) and real-time simulation. Such a system involves a field programmable gate array (FPGA) and digital signal processor (DSP). An HIL model can bypass serious damage to the real object reduce debugging cost and finally reduce the comprehensive effort during the testing. This paper provides a historical overview of HIL simulations through different engineering challenges i.e. within automotive power electronics systems and different industrial drives. Various platforms such as National Instruments dSPACE Typhoon HIL or MATLAB Simulink Real-Time toolboxes and Speedgoat hardware systems offer a powerful tool for efficient and successful investigations in different fields. Therefore HIL simulation practice must begin already during the university’s education process to prepare the students for professional engagements in the industry which was also verified experimentally at the end of the paper.”

Caesars announced this week that Sunderland will begin a new post as SVP of iGaming starting Oct. 1.

Sunderland moving from BetMGM over to Caesars Digital

“This is an exciting time to be in iGaming and at Caesars Entertainment and I am so pleased to join the Caesars team” said Sunderland. “As the industry continues to grow I’m looking forward to identifying new potential for our iGaming business while continuing to bring top-notch service to our customers.”

Sunderland’s career spans over 20 years including stints at Probability PLC GTECH/IGT and CNN International. He is best known for his work as VP of Gaming at BetMGM where his tenure coincided with a somewhat meteoric rise of the BetMGM brand. Prior to serving as VP he consulted for the company dating back to 2017. After playing a relatively small role in the first two years of regulated US sports betting it pardon the pun roared onto the scene in 2020. Since then it has grown to be one of the top three brands in the country with a particularly strong online casino presence.

Most recently Sunderland’s accomplishments included BetMGM being named Casino Operator of the Year at the SBC Awards in New Jersey in July.

Caesars Sports continues rollout in Pennsylvania Kansas

Caesars Digital rolled out a similarly large campaign in the fall of 2021 featuring JB Smoove alongside the launch of a new sports betting app utilizing William Hill’s technology. Caesars’ market share has grown substantially in the following year but it still lacks the market share of BetMGM DraftKings or market leader FanDuel in part because it is available in fewer states. With the updated version of the Caesars Sports app now available in Pennsylvania and additional markets like Ohio and Kansas in the pipeline the company is poised for growth in the next year.

“We’re thrilled to have Matt join the Caesars team” said Eric Hession President of Caesars Digital. “His deep experience and successful track record will be a tremendous asset as we continue to grow our iGaming and sports betting business. We’re looking forward to what we can accomplish together with Caesars Sportsbook & Casino.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vbGFzdmVnYXNtYWdhemluZS5jb20vZGluaW5nLzIwMjIvc2VwLzAyL2dvcmRvbi1yYW1zYXlzLWhlbGxzLWtpdGNoZW4tbGFzLXZlZ2FzLWNhZXNhcnMtcGFsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gordon Ramsay's Hell's Kitchen brings star power to the Las Vegas Strip,"It’s official: No celebrity chef has dominated Las Vegas quite like Gordon Ramsay has. In addition to his existing empire of five restaurants that stretch across four Strip properties Ramsay is about to open his sixth later this year—Ramsay’s Kitchen at Harrah’s. There seems to be no saturation point for Ramsay outposts in the desert much to the delight of his fans. But no matter how prolific the spirited Scot remains his flagship seems destined to remain Gordon Ramsay’s Hell’s Kitchen one of the hardest reservations to snag in town.

This restaurant just has it all: the perfect location in the Roman Plaza where you can also find the enormously successful show Absinthe right next door; a great look including the now-iconic red and blue kitchens to mirror those used on the show now entering its 21st season; and a menu reflecting all the famous dishes Ramsay is so particular about (although we get the feeling not one of these dishes will be sent back like they are on TV).

You’ll want to start your experience here with a cocktail and Hell’s Kitchen offers some great options particularly Notes From Gordon—each one made with Plymouth dry gin green tea lemongrass peach and lemon comes with its own rolled-up piece of paper containing a famous phrase from Gordon on the show such as “This lamb is so undercooked it’s following Mary to school!” There’s also the Smoke on the Blvd. Woodford rye aperol amaro averna and sweet vermouth infused with cherry wood smoke inside a small box.

Now that your tastebuds have been awakened it’s time to explore this menu’s delights. Seared foie gras served with stewed cherries Scottish shortbread and candied marcona almonds is a great appetizer as is lobster risotto (a dish the show’s fans are well acquainted with here made with butter-poached lobster tail truffle risotto and crispy onions).

Odds are most first-timers to this establishment will want to try the beef Wellington. And who could blame them? It’s the very essence of both Ramsay and his home country a large medium-rare cut of delectable beef surrounded by a puff pastry shell and served with potato purée glazed root vegetables and a red wine demi- glace. If you want to go a bit more steak-forward get the 8-ounce filet mignon from Santa Carota Beef served with bearnaise sauce. More in the mood for fowl? No problem—the Jidori chicken scallopini more than satisfies served with roasted pee wee potatoes artichokes lacinato kale and truffle chicken jus.

We always recommend saving room for dessert but nowhere is it more necessary than here where desserts are practically their own food group. Ramsay’s sticky toffee pudding—for many the best dessert on the Strip which is to say the world—is beyond decadent served with dulce de leche ice cream. Coconut 3-Ways features a tasty treat in sorbet passion fruit caramel and coconut cake.

Posted on: September 2 2022 06:01h.

Last updated on: September 2 2022 06:11h.

Penn Entertainment’s (NASDAQ:PENN) lengthy share price decline is leading to the stock’s removal from the S&P 500.

Barstool Sports founder David Portnoy. Penn Entertainment which owns his company is being removed from the S&P 500. (Image: National Review)

S&P Dow Jones Indices made the announcement today after the close of US markets noting the regional casino operator and PVH Corp. (NYSE:PVH) are getting the boot from the world’s most widely followed equity gauge. That pair of stocks will be replaced by CoStar Group (NASDAQ:CSGP) and Invitation Homes (NYSE:INVH).

Those changes and others announced by the index provider will take effect prior to the open of US markets on Monday Sept. 19. Penn Entertainment is the only gaming stock affected by the moves.

With the Bartstool Sportsbook operator leaving the S&P 500 the remaining gaming names in the index in order of weight are VICI Properties (NYSE: VICI) Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS) MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) and Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN).

Penn Looking Like Mid-Cap Stock

Penn’s stay in the S&P 500 was brief as it along with rival Caesars was added to the index in March 2021. The casino operator’s departure from the benchmark makes sense because the S&P 500 is designed to be a large-cap gauge – a status Penn no longer meets.

All companies moving from the S&P 500 to the S&P MidCap 400 are more representative of the mid-cap market space and all companies moving from the S&P MidCap 400 to the S&P SmallCap 600 are more representative of the small-cap market space” according to a statement from S&P Dow Jones Indices.

As of today’s close Penn sports a market capitalization of $5.27 billion which undoubtedly qualifies as mid-cap territory.

While the gaming company has its share of supporters on Wall Street how it arrived at the predicament of S&P 500 removal isn’t a mystery. The stock is down 39.63% year-to-date and 62% over the past year. Over the near-term those percentages could increase as fund managers that benchmark to the S&P 500 are forced to sell shares of Penn.

Trillions of dollars of global assets are allocated to the S&P 500 and related index funds. For example the three largest US-listed exchange traded funds (ETFs) all follow that index and the trio has a combined $918.36 billion in assets under management.

Where Penn Stock Heads to Next

As noted above Penn’s destination is the S&P MidCap 400 Index. While that’s a widely followed benchmark in its own right it pales in comparison to the S&P 500. Additionally mid-cap equities of all stripes are frequently overlooked relative to large- and small-cap fare.

Still hope is not lost for Penn stock. Far from it. Historically mid-caps outperform their larger and smaller counterparts often doing so with less volatility than the latter.

As for prestigious index inclusions it’s possible that with the benefit of major rally into the fourth quarter Penn could be in position for promotion to the Nasdaq-100 Index (NDX) — same goes for Caesars — but that’s likely asking a lot of any gaming equity at this juncture."

While most of its key brands including Campbell’s Campbell’s Chunky and Pacific Foods remained at or slightly above FY19 market share levels the company’s soup portfolio (while still growing) has lost some share to private label brands in the past year as more consumers exhibited trade down behavior.

Soups: ‘Chunky continues to be a star’​

In Wet Soup (excluding condensed soup and broth) Campbell holds a 57% category share as of FY22 and grew dollar consumption by 8% compared to its competitors who grew at a rate of 12%.

Looking at Condensed Soup only Campbell still holds the lion’s share of the market with an 83% share. But the company is growing at a slower rate of 9% compared to the rest of the category which grew by 12% in FY22 vs. the prior year.

Speaking on the Q4 2022 and FY22 earnings call on Thursday Campbell CEO Mark Clouse said “Although never happy with share loss in a category where we have a significant share leadership position the strength of the category translates to compelling growth on a very important part of our portfolio.”​

Addressing which consumers are trading down and why Clouse said “We have been very focused on which consumers are trading down within soup and they tend to be our baby boomer consumers who historically are a bit more sensitive to price gaps and also very likely to trade back over time. The good news is most of our new millennial consumers in soup have been highly brand loyal.”​

A few brands within its soup portfolio were able to defend and grow share however.

“In the ready-to-serve business Chunky continues to be a star with dollar share up 1.3 points and consumption up 20.3% versus the prior year”​ said Clouse adding that compared to 2019 the brand has gained 1 million new buyers.

Because of the success of the Chunky products Campbell will be revitalizing the brand for new generations and leveraging its partnerships with the NFL and EA Madden in the coming fiscal year.

“We are also expanding our new Chunky spicy lineup following the insight that nearly two-thirds of consumers agree that savory foods taste better with spice”​ added Clouse.

For its Pacific Foods soup brand the company is expanding its portfolio of organic ready-to-serve soups and plant-based chilis which launched in Q4 2022.

Swanson broths: 'In fiscal 2023 we will be modernizing our packaging and improving our ingredients'

In broth pressure from private label competitors has hit harder and as a result Campbell is stepping up innovation for its Swanson brand to further differentiate it from private label offerings including an improved formulation.

“We have got a quality improvement that now tests superior to private label” ​he said.

“In fiscal 2023 we will be modernizing our packaging and improving our ingredients to drive the taste superiority quality and value of our Swanson brand. We will also be launching Swanson Quick Cups which is a convenient one cup serving a broth which fits the majority of broth recipe usage occasions.”​

In sauces Prego remained the #1 share leader in the Italian category for the 39th​ consecutive month delivering consumption growth of 12.4% compared to the prior year and repeat rates up 4% vs. three years ago.

Pace salsa regained momentum after material shortages earlier in the year gaining 0.4% in dollar share and growing consumption by 14.5% vs. last year.

Turning to snacks Clouse highlighted the firm's strength in the salty snacks category which registered double-digit consumption growth across power brands Kettle Cape Cod Snack Factory Pretzel Crips Snyder’s and Pepperidge Farm Goldfish.

“We were the only major player who grew unit share in the fourth quarter as we have worked hard to keep price and promotion balanced as supply recovered”​ said Clouse.

Fiscal year 2023 what’s in store?​

With an action plan in place to continue strengthening many of its core brands through new product innovation and a recovering supply chain Campbell is entering the fiscal 2023 year in an advantaged position commented EVP and CFO Mick Beekhuizen.

“While we expect the current macro challenges to continue our portfolio of brands is well positioned to meet consumer demand. Our previous pricing actions are now fully in place with expected price elasticities in fiscal 2023 to be slightly above fiscal 2022 levels. We expect positive top-line growth for the year in both divisions partly driven by an increase in our brand investments supported by an improved supply chain​.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhc3Rpbmd0YWJsZS5jb20vOTkyMzMyL2hvdy1jYW1wYmVsbC1zb3Vwcy1zYWx0eS1zbmFja3MtYXJlLWtlZXBpbmctdGhlLWNvbXBhbnktYWxvZnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Campbell Soup's Salty Snacks Are Keeping The Company Aloft,"How Campbell Soup's Salty Snacks Are Keeping The Company Aloft

It's been an eventful year for the Campbell Soup Company. Earlier this summer Campbell's launched the Flavorup! line of flavor-packed sauces. The company also took on 3500 new employees (per Reuters). For good reason too — running Campbell's is a pretty massive operation.

Believe it or not the Campbell Soup Company is the face behind many popular grocery store brands that consumers know and love including V8 juice Swanson broth Pace salsa Pepperidge Farm cookies Prego pasta sauce and more. Campbell's condensed soups are popular ingredients in home-cooking as well. You might even have a Cream of Mushroom can lying around in your pantry right now. Campbell's Goldfish crackers boast legendary television commercials typically featuring animated aquatic crackers ""swimming"" around stacks of books on human-sized desks and hanging out under the bed in a kid's room. They're ""the snack that smiles back"" for a reason — and you may have just sang that jingle in your head as you read it.

But adults love Campbell's Goldfish crackers too – so much so in fact that according to recent data sales of Campbell's salty snacks are keeping the company afloat at this very moment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2RidXNpbmVzc25ld3MubmV0L2FydGljbGVzLzIyMTI2LWNhbXBiZWxsLXNvdXAtdGFrZXMtdGhpcmQtd2F2ZS1vZi1wcmljaW5nLWluLWZpc2NhbC0yMDIy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Campbell Soup takes third wave of pricing in fiscal 2022,"CAMDEN NJ. — Campbell Soup Co. continued to work to thread the needle as it sought to blunt the effects of inflation in the fiscal year ended July 31.

“In the fourth quarter we continued our efforts to mitigate inflation … through a combination of targeted price increases and trade optimization as well as productivity improvements primarily in our supply chain cost-saving initiatives and a continued focus on discretionary spending across the organization” Mark Clouse president and chief executive officer of Campbell said in a Sept. 1 conference call with securities analysts to discuss fourth-quarter and fiscal 2022 financial results.

“A particularly competitive segment is total salty snacks where we were the only major player who grew unit share in the fourth quarter as we’ve worked hard to keep price and promotion balanced as supply recovered” Mr. Clouse said. “Goldfish continues to deliver exceptional results also driven by relevant innovation and award-winning marketing.

“Organic net sales in our Snacks division increased 6% driven by sales of our power brands which were up 9%. Snacks sales increased due to gains in salty snacks primarily Kettle brand and Cape Cod potato chips as well as in cookies and crackers primarily Goldfish crackers. Inflation-driven pricing and sales allowances were partially offset by increased promotional spending and volume declines.”

For the full fiscal year Snack unit sales were $3.96 billion up 3% from $3.86 billion in the previous fiscal year. In the Snack unit net sales in the fourth quarter ended July 31 were $1.05 billion up 6% from $995 million in the fourth quarter of the previous fiscal year.

Net earnings attributable to Campbell Soup Co. in the fiscal year ended July 31 were $757 million or $2.51 per share down 24% from $1 billion or $3.31 per share a year ago. Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter increased 8% to 56¢ per share. Full year adjusted earnings were flat. Net sales of $8.56 billion were up narrowly from $8.48 billion a year ago.

“Inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 810 basis points with the majority of the impact driven by cost inflation as overall input prices on a rate basis increased by approximately 15% which was relatively consistent with the prior quarter” Mr. Clouse said. “Lastly unfavorable volume and mix had a negative impact of 170 basis points in the quarter.”

When pressed by an analyst about the timing of pricing actions and promotional activity Mr. Clouse said the company rolled out the third wave of its pricing in the final month of fiscal 2022.

“And that was really designed to ensure that we had the pricing fully reflected and in place as we stepped off in fiscal ‘23” he said. “However in a month where you’re executing pricing I do think we saw a little bit slower especially as it relates to inventory recovery as we executed that. The good news is as we project in the Q1 that’s probably a couple of hundred basis points of difference that I think will move into the Q1 timing.

“Perhaps even more encouraging is the continued strength of our growing highly relevant and unique portfolio of power brands. Taking a closer look at these brands end market consumption grew 11% versus the prior year. And on a three-year basis consumption grew 26% with double-digit growth across all our power brands versus three years ago. With respect to share our power brands held dollar share in the quarter versus the prior year with share gains on Kettle Brand Cape Cod Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps and Pepperidge Farm cookies.”

In the fourth quarter companywide net earnings attributable to Campbell Soup Co. totaled $96 million or 32¢ per share down 67% from $288 million or 95¢ per share in the year-ago quarter in which earnings more than tripled primarily as result of at-home restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. When compared with fourth-quarter results in fiscal 2020 fourth-quarter net earnings in fiscal 2022 were up 12% from $86 million or 28¢ per share.

In the Meals and Beverage unit fiscal year sales were flat at $4.61 billion. In the fourth quarter ended July 31 Meals and Beverages unit sales were up 6% to $935 million from $878 million in the year-ago quarter.

“I feel tremendous about the progress we’re making on supply chain we still have a few businesses where material availability has slowed full supply recovery” Mr. Couse said. “That’s primarily Lance Late July and V8 where each of them have their own kind of material availability challenge that will take us some time into ‘23 to fully recover.”

Mr. Clouse added as Campbell Soup emerges from the last three years of COVID-19 pandemic influence the company is pleased with the share for most of the key brands remaining at or above fiscal 2019 levels.

“While as we expected in the fourth quarter we have experienced some select share pressure this sustained share growth versus pre-pandemic levels is a positive sign that we’re emerging with a stronger portfolio of brands as we head into 2023” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NhbWRlbi1icmlkZ2VzLWNvdW50eS10cmFpbC1iZW4tZnJhbmtsaW5nLWJyaWRnZS1jYXBlLW1heS0yMDIyMDkwMi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Camden County has plans for 2 trail bridges that will connect Philly to Cooper River Park and beyond,"Camden County plans to build a pedestrian bridge at U.S. Route 130 in Camden at the intersection of North Park and 130 at the Golf Academy driving range. It also plans another bridge in Camden to cross the Cooper River at Flanders Boulevard not far from Campbell's Soup Co. headquarters and the Subaru office complex. Read more

Camden County is moving quickly to build one of two bridges that will serve as key connectors to a 32-mile trail system that will start at the Ben Franklin Bridge and run the length of the county eventually connecting with other trail systems that end at the Shore.

In the future officials say riders will be able to bike from Manayunk to Cape May and back.

Just the addition of these two Camden County bridges will give say a cyclist coming from Philly and someone walking from Camden unimpeded access to the Cooper River system for the first time without having to cross major roadways.

“These bridges are critical components of the trail because without them there is no continuous trail” said Jeffrey Nash a county commissioner and liaison to the parks department.

Although the complete linked trail is still years away the county has $1 million in federal money and a design for a pedestrian/bicycle bridge that will cross the Cooper River in Camden at Flanders Boulevard parallel to the Admiral Wilson Boulevard (Route 30) and adjacent to the Speedway gas station.

It will be near both Campbell Soup Co. headquarters and Subaru of America and give people direct access to Gateway Park which runs parallels to the Admiral Wilson Boulevard.

Officials expect to start construction next summer and the bridge to open in the summer of 2024.

The county also has a $3.2 million federal grant to build a second bridge about 1.4 miles to the east that will cross busy Route 130 in Camden at an existing county-operated golf driving range and connect to the extensive Cooper River Park system in Pennsauken. Designs are not complete for that second bridge and it needs approval from the state’s Historic Preservation Office because it connects with the park which was built in the 1930s by the Works Progress Administration.

The bridges would serve as the start of the $52 million LINK Trail that would run from the base of the Ben Franklin Bridge near Rutgers to Winslow Township. Officials hope that from there it will dovetail into Gloucester County then join unbroken trail systems for Atlantic and Cape May Counties eventually ending in Cape May.

Jack Sworaski a retired county environmental official who has been retained to work on the trail said the LINK Trail would connect with the East Coast Greenway and Schuylkill River trails in Philadelphia.

The LINK Trail will end in Winslow Township near a state fish and wildlife area but will connect with a trail in Monroe Township Gloucester County and then with trails in Atlantic County and eventually in Cape May County he said. Not all of those trail segments are in place but the counties are working together.

The vision remains that a solid trail network will be in place in future years that will run “about 110 miles from the base of the Ben Franklin Bridge to Cape May City” Sworaski said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlYW5rbGVyLmNvbS9wL3Jlc2VuZC1hLXdvbWFucy1wbGFjZS1pbi10aGUtdHYta2l0Y2hlbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RESEND: A Woman's Place in the TV Kitchen,"TV TASTEMAKERS From left: Martha Stewart Julia Child Ree Drummond (photo illustration Haley Kluge: Getty)

In 1962 Andy Warhol would forever enshrine an avatar of everyday Americana as a lasting icon of modern culture. His serial work Campbell's Soup Cans made its debut a series of 32 canvases each devoted to a different variety of the ubiquitous canned soup. Those screen-printed paintings put the emerging Pop Art movement on the map displaying the artist’s nonchalance about what subjects were fit for artistic glory. (The now-priceless canvases first exhibited by Los Angeles gallerist Irving Blum are now part of MoMA’s permanent collection but Eli Broad paid $11 million in 2006 for a later single soup can painting.)

But that all came later. As the seemingly guileless Warhol explained his choice at the time Campbell’s soup was simply what he ate for lunch every single day.

However the same year that Warhol unveiled his seminal Pop Art pieces — his paean to the ordinary the corporate ideal of American mass-production — came the beginnings of a counter-revolution in how the country would regard food on their tables. This time the medium was not the gallery wall; it was televised.

MODERN CHOICE From Andy Warhol’s Campbell's Soup I Portfolio  1968 ( Artsy.net )

In 1962 one of the authors of the just-published Mastering the Art of French Cooking turned up on Boston public television show I’ve Been Reading and astonished the grumpy book-reviewing host by turning out a perfectly made omelet with a hot plate giant whisk and a few eggs she brought along. Afterwards dozens of viewers wrote to WGBH wanting more. After three pilots Julia Child made her series debut in The French Chef in 1963.

Child would have turned 110 this month (hat tip to Lane Doss’ Broken Palette newsletter for the reminder and this summary):

“In an era that embraced the modernity of frozen TV dinners and instant Jell-O Child reminded people that the act of cooking for someone is also an act of love. She also taught American housewives — and later everyone else that cooking need not be a chore — it can be a creative outlet and a source of great pride.”

Child’s initial series ran 10 years winning the first Emmy for an educational program and a Peabody. With almost 20 books and countless series she didn’t put down her whisk until age 85 after her last program in 1998 Julia Child & Jacques Pépin: Cooking at Home. A towering cultural figure literally (at six-foot-two) she was lampooned by Dan Aykroyd in an unforgettable 1978 Saturday Night Live skit. Julia was so tickled that she used to play a videotape of the segment for her dinner guests shouting “Save the liver!”

JUST THE APPETIZER

Today we have a food-stuffed television landscape including a whole cable channel devoted to cooking star TV chefs and even just food-adjacent stars.

Meryl Streep earned one of her multitude of Oscar nominations for her portrayal of Child in the 2009 Julie and Julia. Today Child who died in 2004 is the subject of an HBO Max narrative series Julia starring British actor Sarah Lancashire now readying its second season.

Considered unscripted TV’s fastest-growing sub-genre a sample of today’s food TV includes also on HBO Max Selena Gomez’s popular Selena + Chef (with a parade of bold-face-name chef guests like Marcus Samuelsson Roy Choi José Andrés and Rachel Ray); Bravo’s Top Chef (now filming its 13th season in London) and its imitators; and Netflix’s The Great British Baking Show which just announced an American iteration produced by Roku with Ellie Kemper and Zach Cherry. Scripted food drama is also proving delectable: this summer’s unsettling The Bear gave Hulu an edgy talker and the upcoming black comedy horror film The Menu starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Nicholas Hoult fending off a scary chef played by Ralph Fiennes is premiering at the Toronto Film Festival.

It’s a smorgasbord fragmented from Child’s singular vision into a hundred directions. But food and its subsequent TV programming is more than ever proxy for our larger cultural conversations.

And in the context of the entertainment industry’s sweeping changes — where Warner Bros. and Discovery two companies with distinct identities are in the throes of an arranged marriage — it seemed a moment to examine the culture of what today’s food TV reflects about the times.

THREE DEFINING WOMEN

In the '60s America had an extended love affair with all things Gallic. There was a Francophile First Lady in Jacqueline Kennedy. In New York the apogee of fine dining in the U.S. was a group of mannered French restaurants that included Lutèce La Côte Basque and La Caravelle a Kennedy favorite. (California was but a culinary backwater.) In the first season of The French Chef Julia exhorted her viewers to make duck à l’orange chicken livers à la Francaise (with Madeira sauce) and crepes suzette for their dinner parties.

Child ushered in a new appreciation of cooking but it was a style devoted to a singular vision of haute cuisine a reflection of her Cordon Bleu training. She cemented the notion by signing off each episode with the just-prepared dish a glass of wine and a hearty bon appetit!

MARTHA INC.

As the ‘70s entered the Me Decade ‘80s a new star-chef hit the airwaves and came to symbolize women’s emerging role in business (the era of Working Girl). Martha Stewart’s first book Entertaining hit in 1982 grown out of the former model and then stockbroker’s Connecticut catering business. Stoked by frequent newspaper publicity and appearances on shows of the time — The Oprah Winfrey Show and Larry King Live — she published a book every year for the rest of the decade (often efficiently ghost-written something Julia would have blanched at). Her careful precision and aesthetic cemented a largely white Northeastern WASP Americana ideal companion meals to the constructed Ralph Lauren aesthetic of the time.

Eventually Martha became more: a brand. Commonplace today it was head-turning when she consolidated all her tv print and merchandising into a new company Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia (not just media but omnimedia!). When the stock went public she became the first female self-made billionaire in the U.S.

MOGUL IN THE MAKING Stewart’s company went public in 1999 turning her into a billionaire. ( marthastewart.com )

At 81 today Stewart has evolved with the times defrosting her image. She has her own “Martha’s Chard” chardonnay Martha Meal Kits her just-opened The Bedford restaurant on the strip at Paris Las Vegas (modeled said Eater on her own 1925 country farmhouse in Bedford New York where she served part of her felony prison sentence in her 2005 stock-trading imbroglio) and her line of CBD edibles — and of course another just-announced streaming series this time on Roku. She also recently responded to rumors that she was dating Pete Davidson with the comment that he was “like the son I never had. He’s a charming boy finding his way.”

A FOOD NETWORK STAR

Which brings us to Ree “The Pioneer Woman” Drummond.

If you’re not familiar let’s get you up to speed. With nods to Giada De Laurentiis Ina Garten and Rachel Ray it’s Drummond who has been climbing the ranks at now Discovery-owned Food Network for the last 10 years who seems to have met the moment all from her countrified ranch kitchen just outside Pawhuska Oklahoma. With her husband Ladd whom she euphemistically refers to as “Marlboro Man” they are somewhat at odds with Ree’s “homey” vibe since their share of the family ranch empire totals a massive 433000 acres making them the 23rd largest landowners in the country. (Cue Yellowstone!)

They homeschool their four kids and she is unabashedly “traditional” in matters of romance. She claims he wouldn’t marry her until she was able to make his favorite breakfast Eggs in a Hole — and her version is a dish made with at least a half-stick of butter. (Contrast that with Stewart divorced and largely single the entire time she built her empire.)

In 2017 Food Network and Drummond were criticized after a particularly distasteful segment resurfaced from five years earlier.

As reported by Huffington Post:

The questionable segment…shows Drummond playing a “trick” on her family by serving them a batch of “Asian hot wings” instead of the Buffalo-style they’re expecting. Drummond’s crew is askance asking “Where are the real wings?” Another man says “I don’t trust ’em.” Then Drummond chuckles indulgently and tells them “I’m just kidding guys. I wouldn’t do that to you.” Then she pulls a tray of traditional Buffalo wings out of the oven inspiring one of these gourmets to say “Now those are some wings.”

A couple of weeks ago Drummond made a big step up to prime-time host with Big Bad Budget Battle produced by the Food Network’s biggest draw portly good ‘ole boy Guy Fieri with his white shock of hair.

Besides starring on The Pioneer Woman since 2011 Drummond also turns out cookbooks children’s series and home goods cookware and women’s wear all exclusive at Walmart. Drummond fans can even get a taste of the lifestyle with a stay in Pawhuska at the Drummond-owned lodging and retail-restaurant complex. Last year she even logged her first role in her own Yule movie Candy Coated Christmas for Discovery+ playing a small-town bakery owner.

Drummond presents herself as a bit of a rube and she’s okay with that. Her backcountry voice timbre and jokey manner is probably as beloved by her fans as they seem ridiculous to “city folk.” Though the Oklahoma native actually went to college at USC it doesn’t seem to have rubbed off.

It’s tempting to speculate on The Pioneer Woman and the network’s lineup of mostly male white prime-time hosts (the various shows are populated with a diverse slate of contestants and the network also features “daytime” cooking shows featuring more diverse chefs like Delicious Miss Brown and Molly Yeh of Girl Meets Farm). But Food Network seems untouched by the same battles that have roiled gourmands with issues of equity and representation that led to the resignations of Bon Appetit editor Adam Rappaport New York Times columnist Alison Roman the editor of the Los Angeles Times food section and others.

One could call those travails coastal fights internecine media battles that most Americans don’t care about. But as Discovery+ the streaming home of Drummond and all of Food Network prepares to combine into one entity with HBO Max as part of CEO David Zaslav’s new kingdom some are predicting culture clash.

There’s been a welter of speculation about a regressive turn coming on Zaslav’s watch following his hiring of a nearly all white male leadership team and appointment of six white men to the board.

The Daily Beast reported that laid-off Warners executives are foreseeing “a rejection of left-wing or highly diverse content in favor of more homogenous Middle America-friendly fare.” Interesting detail from the piece:

THE NEXT RECIPE

So will Max’s Selena + Chef CNN’s reruns of humanist Anthony Bourdain or even its bio-pic series Julia (wherein the first season she came face to face with her drag-queen doppelgänger) comfortably coexist on the same platform as The Pioneer Woman? One has to wonder even in the era of algorithms that allow the viewer to choose their own adventure.

Our narrative of any era’s defining female chef has mirrored our cultural shifts: from globalist Child ambitious post-women’s rights empire builder Stewart to Drummond whose popularity stems in part out of a seeming rejection of our media’s progressive values.

Putting all those ingredients together in 2022’s ultra-bifurcated era to this scribe it sounds like one potentially messy kitchen.

""It's been fun to do it with Cooper for our second year"" Peyton tells PEOPLE.

""It was six days that we were together that doesn't happen very much anymore"" says the 46-year-old Hall of Famer who adds that he and Cooper ""went to dinner every night in Atlanta"" and ""got up and worked out together every morning.""

""It was great brother time"" he adds.

And when it comes to getting along with the show's young contestants Cooper is a natural.

""Cooper is fun to work with always upbeat and doesn't take himself too seriously. He likes to laugh and I think the students really like that"" says Peyton who admires his older brother's ability to make them feel comfortable.

""There's a live audience here there's cameras everywhere so it's not a normal environment for a lot of these students so I'm sure there's some nerves"" he adds. ""I really feel like Cooper and his personality helps the students relax which I think is important.""

Peyton went on to joke that most of their time on set was spent just ""trying to do our part and stay of the way.""

The two-time Super Bowl champion says the ""last thing"" he wants to do on set is ""be a distraction"" for the contestants — or ""pronounce a word incorrectly"" while reading the trivia questions.

""During the show the students are the stars and they're playing for scholarship money...I want to do my part but also like you said stay out of the way and let these kids shine"" he says.

""For me all I'm trying to do is pronounce the question correctly"" he adds. ""To act like I know what the question actually means or what the answer is no chance. And I can see it in my monitor!""

Steve Swisher/NBC

But even when mistakes happen Peyton says the contestants still made it work. ""Some of these students are getting the question correct even after I pronounce a word incorrectly. That tells you how smart they are"" he says. ""They can figure out my mistakes and still get it correct.""

In the competition's biggest season yet more schools than ever before will compete in a five-round tournament putting their knowledge to the test for a chance to win the coveted Capital One College Bowl trophy and a life-changing amount of scholarship money for their team.

This season 16 teams from various colleges and universities across the country as they compete in the ultimate battle of the brains.

Ohio’s journey to develop maps for the legislative and congressional voting districts began with the convening of the Ohio Redistricting Commission by Gov. Mike DeWine himself a member.

The commission embarked on a statewide town hall style tour where members of the commission heard what voters and interested parties wanted to see and didn’t want to see in drawing maps that mirrored election trends for the last ten years.

A series of meetings were held where the elected officials who made up every member of the commission interpreted and re-interpreted a constitutional amendment more than 70% of voters had approved to reform the redistricting methods in the state.

One year five legislative map proposals and two congressional redraws later the state will hold a general election in November with maps that have been ruled unconstitutional by the Ohio Supreme Court.

“There is nothing like redistricting” said Brian Glassman professor emeritus of election law at the Cleveland State’s Cleveland-Marshall College of Law. “It is the most raw display of political power.”

The hang up according to those who study redistricting falls at the end of the process. What happens when a commission can’t agree to even a four-year compromise that stands up to the rules set forth in the Ohio Constitution?

“A lot of us who worked really hard to create redistricting reform…we were really hopeful in 2018 that the compromise proposal that was put forward by legislators was one that could have worked for Ohioans” said Kathay Feng director of redistricting and representation at Common Cause of Ohio.

In other states like Virginia redistricting rules allowed a court to provide a resolution to the problem of district-drawing gridlock. Virginia’s supreme court brought in a “special master” a map-drawing expert ordered to create the maps after the half-politician half-civilian commission couldn’t come up with a plan.

In Maryland a state controlled by Democrats the state supreme court rejected a map but the legislature was able to return a map that was accepted as constitutional.

In North Carolina Republicans in control of the state have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the redistricting process saying state courts were wrong to reject a legislature-drawn congressional map (deemed overly-partisan to benefit the GOP) and implement a map drawn by the court.

Like Ohio the map put in place in North Carolina is only effective for the 2022 election and a new plan will be needed for the 2024 races.

“The principle that emerges from all those experiments is finding what the mechanism is for the final authority (to draw maps)” said Sam Wang professor and director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project which analyzes redistricting state-by-state.

The power to gerrymander

One thing Ohio and North Carolina have in common is the attorney who fought for maps in both states. Phillip Strach a North Carolina attorney from the firm of Nelson Mullins represented the legislative defendants in his home state making arguments that computer programs could easily be manipulated likening those creating simulations of redistricting maps to the Wizard of Oz and calling the use of race demographics in redistricting a “red herring.”

The use of race demographics was a point of contention in Ohio’s redistricting battle as well with GOP staffers who drew the majority of the legislative maps that were considered by the commission saying they were told specifically not to include race data.

Legislative leaders like Senate President Matt Huffman argued that federal law prohibited map-drawers from using the data unless a complaint was explicitly made about racial discrimination in district maps.

A lawsuit filed in federal court by two Youngstown residents called into question that decision but no ruling has been made in the case.

Strach turned up to defend Ohio’s congressional maps before the Ohio Supreme Court making similar arguments including calling simulations in the Ohio maps “deeply flawed.”

“At the end of the day the computers draw what a human being tells it to draw and so if you don’t tell the computer to use criteria that match what the General Assembly actually used then what it will spit out is really just garbage” Strach told the state supreme court in December 2021. “It really is meaningless for any legal analysis.”

He also said the case could be taken to the federal system all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court if needed. The process “could go on for quite a bit” he told the state supreme court justices.

In fact House Speaker Bob Cupp said that is still under consideration for the rejected congressional maps after arguing that the deadline to redraw those maps did not start until all appeals had been exhausted.

“There is definitely a thread that runs through Ohio and North Carolina where the majority party decided they should have unbridled power to gerrymander” Feng told the OCJ.

But Feng says Ohio’s situation is unique in that “the majority party decided to pursue an extreme gerrymander” but even after the state supreme court determined the lines to be unconstitutionally partisan they also decided they couldn’t intercede.

“The temptation of total control existed particularly for legislative leaders and it was that temptation that ended up taking over” Feng said.

The way that redistricting ended up working in Ohio comes down to a legal phenomenon referred to as “constitutional hardball” according to Wang. This simply requires redistricting leaders to follow the letter of the law but “do whatever it takes to gain an advantage.”

“Ohio is a Republican-leaning state but it is closely-enough divided that you could imagine there’s a lot at stake in terms of who controls the legislature” Wang said.

Arguments to this effect were made during legislative redistricting when the GOP-led commission approved maps that had the court-required 54% GOP to 46% Democrat proportions on paper but had districts with razor-thin margins that made them more toss-ups than “Dem-leaning.” Under the maps no Republican districts are considered competitive.

Even though those maps and all the others were rejected by the Ohio Supreme Court commission members and legislative leaders seem undaunted by the uncertainty partly because of a new argument that has come up nationwide.

The “independent state legislature theory” has come into the redistricting process with leaders arguing district-drawing as part of the elections process and therefore under the purview of the state legislatures and the state legislatures alone.

The use of this theory in legal cases – like the U.S. Supreme Court’s consideration of Moore v. Harper in deciding whether state legislature have control over redistricting – could warrant concerns about the steadfastness of the concept of coequal branches of government.

“All the way back to the country’s founding it’s been understood that legislatures have to be bound by the courts” Wang said. “(The theory) would remove the one remaining constraint on legislatures from running away with power.”

But the idea that majority parties like the GOP in Ohio may just be using the legal process to force a map into play as happened when a federal three-judge panel put a February legislative map in for the 2022 general election is also not out of the realm of possibility.

“Running out the clock is an effective strategy in sports and in politics” Glassman said. “And the (redistricting) results indicate that those who wanted change did not get the kind of maps they thought they were going to get.”

New reforms ahead

With anti-gerrymandering groups and voters rights groups disappointed with the results as they stand in Ohio redistricting talk of revising the constitutional amendment put in place in 2018 has come up.

With eyes on creating a final arbiter of redistricting plans Feng said reforms have a good chance at support and it’s something Common Cause and others are pushing hard for.

But finding that sweet spot where voter-desired results occur doesn’t happen without trial and error.

“Ohio is in a lynchpin situation in politics which makes it hard to achieve total reform all at once” Feng said.

California Feng said went to the ballot six times before the reform was where the state wanted it. Virginia and Florida have both gone back to the ballot box as well to adjust their reforms.

Glassman is among many who argue that the Ohio Redistricting Commission was flawed in its use of purely elected officials including a majority of Republicans.

The commission includes Gov. Mike DeWine state Auditor Keith Faber Secretary of State Frank LaRose along with state Sen. Rob McColley and state Rep. Jeff LaRe. LaRe and McColley replaced Senate President Matt Huffman and House Speaker Bob Cupp after the two legislative leaders said other priorities required their attention.

“On some level we shouldn’t be surprised at the result given that our commission was comprised of elected officials” Glassman said.

The increased interest in the redistricting process brings hope to those looking to future reforms in the 2024 election season.

“Until you’ve experienced that pang you don’t know what medicine you want prescribed” Feng said. “People are much more clear-headed about what they’re looking for.”

That could include a push for an independent commission and a more fervent system of checks and balances Feng said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9kZWFscy9ib3N0b24tYWlyZmFyZS1kZWFscy1jaGljYWdvLXNhbmZyYW5jaXNjby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boston airfare deals to San Francisco and Chicago from $158,"Looking for a cheap flight to or from Boston?

Otherwise expect to pay an extra $60 for the trip or you'll have to travel carrying just a personal item.

The sample flight listed here is between Boston and Chicago in the first week of November. Many of the discounted fares are for Tuesday-to-Tuesday itineraries like this one but other date choices are also currently possible.

According to Google Flights the $158 fare listed here is an amazing $258 cheaper than usual flights on the route. That's a savings of more than 60%. Peak fares and holiday travel on this route can top $850.

Currently you can still find reasonable flight times with these fares without resorting to red-eye or early-morning flights.

Tickets for this fare begin on selected dates in September and run through March 2023.

This fare is for United's basic economy class so again unless you have mileage status or book the fare with a United credit card you'll have to travel only with a personal item or pay approximately $60 extra for the ticket.

Even if you have to pay the additional fare this pricing is still a good deal — and a great one if you can take advantage of your status for the baggage allowance.

Boston to San Francisco on American Airlines

American Airlines with codeshare partner JetBlue is also offering some highly discounted flights from Boston. One of its best fares is $258 for a nonstop cross-country flight between Boston and San Francisco.

Like the United fare above these prices are for a basic seat class that does not include carry-on bags.

GOOGLE.COM/FLIGHTS

As shown in the Google Flights search results above you can currently find round-trip tickets between Boston and San Francisco for just $258. This fare represents more than $200 per ticket savings versus typical fares.

The shared flight between JetBlue and American Airlines offers two booking and price options. The JetBlue fare is for its Basic Blue economy seat class which does not allow carry-on bags on board. You'll have to make do with just a personal item that can fit under the seat in front of you. If you want to bring a bag surcharges of at least $60 for the round trip will apply to your ticket.

The American Airlines fare for this route is $318 which is still close to $150 cheaper than average. The American fare is for regular economy seating allowing carry-on bags. The price is equivalent to booking the ticket via JetBlue with its baggage surcharge. If you have American or JetBlue status or book with one of their credit cards you may be able to benefit from a free luggage allowance.

If you can travel luggage-free or can score a free luggage allowance this is a great fare to fly cross-country.

Bottom line

Multiple airlines including United and American are offering discounted flights from Boston from this fall through the early spring of 2023.

Round-trip tickets between Boston and Chicago for $158 and between Boston and San Francisco for $258 represent great savings on regularly priced flights. But when booking these fares be careful to note your luggage allowance as most basic economy seats do not allow for carry-on bags without paying a surcharge.

If you can make the luggage allowance work for you (perhaps by leveraging airline status) these fares become great deals. If you find an itinerary that works for you book the tickets quickly as prices may change at any time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy91ay1lbmdsYW5kLWxvbmRvbi02MjY5MzUzN9IBN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy91ay1lbmdsYW5kLWxvbmRvbi02MjY5MzUzNy5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deptford: The London high street voted one of the world's coolest,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy91ay1lbmdsYW5kLWxvbmRvbi02MjY5MzUzN9IBN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy91ay1lbmdsYW5kLWxvbmRvbi02MjY5MzUzNy5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016710574070>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy91ay1lbmdsYW5kLWxvbmRvbi02MjY5MzUzN9IBN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy91ay1lbmdsYW5kLWxvbmRvbi02MjY5MzUzNy5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

According to the Erie County Department of Human Services the county will receive $673818 this week. The amount is the first of 17 payments the county will receive on an annual basis until 2039.

In total the county is expected to receive nearly $16 million from the settlement. The money — as per settlement guidelines — must go toward opioid prevention treatment or any of a wide range of opioid remediation uses as listed in the settlement.

Human Services Director John DiMattio appearing at a County Council finance meeting Wednesday requested the money be placed in the 2022 budget of the Erie County Office of Drug and Alcohol Abuse which falls under Human Services.

Dahlkemper discusses settlement:Erie County poised to receive $16 million from landmark opioid settlement

He said his department will create an oversight committee composed of members from the county administration County Council Human Services staff and the Drug and Alcohol Advisory Board to determine how and where to spend the money as well as proper reporting procedures.

""We want to make sure that we're able to receive the money and then prepare how we might spend the money and that we're doing it appropriately before any money is spent"" DiMattio told council.

DA office which had separate lawsuit to receive payments

The Erie County District Attorney's Office will receive an initial payment of $217805 as part of the settlement.

District Attorney Elizabeth Hirz said her office will receive roughly $1.8 million between now and 2039. The money is separate from the payments going to Human Services because the District Attorney's Office was part of a separate lawsuit against the same drug companies.

Family's battle with opioids:Taylor Miller's family continues her mission to fight opioids spread hope

""We're really excited to be able to get this money to use for prevention education and abatement uses for the county to combat this opioid epidemic"" she told the Erie Times-News.

Hirz said her office is looking to develop its own spending plan for the payments but will collaborate with the oversight committee to avoid duplicating services.

Council administration disagree over restricting funds

County Council Solicitor Tom Talarico recommended council create budget line items for both Human Services and the District Attorney's Office but restrict expenditures until the oversight committee developed a spending plan.

""The money came in before we know what we're spending it on"" Talarico said.

He recommended that a spending plan be developed and then brought before council. If it proves satisfactory council can then vote to remove the restrictions on the money.

County Director of Administration Doug Smith disagreed with the idea insisting that returning the discussion to council would be a time-consuming and ""unnecessary impediment."" Smith said a member of council would already be sitting on the oversight committee and be working with drug and alcohol professionals.

""(Restricting the funds) just seems like adding another process here. It does nothing to help get this money to programming. It simply creates a bureaucratic barrier"" Smith told council members.

Council agreed to move the measure to Tuesday's regular meeting agenda for a first reading before making any decisions on whether to restrict the funds.

The county will have 18 months to spend each annual allotment. If the money is not expended in this timeframe it could be taken away according to Human Services.

Payments are part of $26 billion landmark agreement

The payments stem from a $26 billion settlement reached in 2021 between several states and three major pharmaceutical distributors — Cardinal Health McKesson and AmerisourceBergen — as well as opioid manufacturer Johnson & Johnson.

The settlement resolves the nearly 4000 lawsuits filed by state and local governments against the companies for their alleged roles in perpetuating the opioid crisis. The settlement would release the companies from any future civil liability.

More on the settlement:Pa. could get $1 billion from landmark opioid settlement. Here's how it'll be used

In January Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro announced that all 67 counties in the state including 241 local governments with a population of 10000 or more had joined the agreement meaning the state would receive its maximum payment of $1.07 billion.

States and their local governments received maximum payments if each state and its local governments joined together in support of the agreement according to a news release from Shapiro's office.

DiMattio said Erie County received more money than some other counties because the county was one of the litigants in the class-action lawsuit against the companies.

Former Erie County Executive Kathy Dahlkemper pushed to join the lawsuit in 2017.

Erie County Information Officer Chris Carroll said the settlement money was ""welcome news"" for the community and the administration has confidence the oversight committee will create an effective spending plan.

""We are leaving the allocations up to the drug and alcohol professionals on the oversight committee"" he said in an email to the Times-News. ""They are the ones who are dealing with this crisis on the frontlines day in and day out. We have all the confidence that they will spend this money appropriately to help combat these problems.""

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

August has always been a tough month for Delton Russell. Twenty years ago on Aug. 6 he lost his best friend to an overdose.

“I think about that dude every damn day” he said holding back tears.

A former executive at Will’s Place who now works as a recovery specialist with Partners Health Management Russell was a teenage addict and has been in the recovery process for more than two decades.

He credits his recovery for helping bring about all the good things in his life including his wife his home and a stable job.

Kari Womack is also painfully aware of the power of addiction especially to drugs. She said she lost nine people in her life due to overdoses over the last five years and her own struggles strained relations with her family when she was younger.

“It’s a hard path to walk down” Womack a peer support specialist who works at Uwharrie Harm Reduction Initiative said about being an addict.

Russell and Womack shared their truth in front of a crowd of more than 50 people Wednesday night at YMCA Park to mark International Overdose Awareness Day.

Organizations such as Will’s Place Bridge to Recovery and Stanly Community Christian Ministry were present to share resources with those in attendance.

Rows of small purple flags — representing the more than 3700 people in the state who have died of an overdose over the last year — dotted a section of the park. There were also numerous lighted memorials laid out to form a walking path as a way to remember the 25 Stanly County residents who died of an overdose last year.

People also had the opportunity to write the name of a loved one who died from an overdose or their own name as someone who survived an overdose on a large #EndOverdose sign.

The event which included a remembrance walk was sponsored by Stanly County Project Lazarus a coalition of public health health care law enforcement mental health personnel and concerned citizens working to combat drug abuse. It represented a safe space for people to feel comfortable to talk about their addictions and loved ones lost without feeling any kind of shame or stigma.

“This is a place where we want people to be able to talk about stigma and to be honest about it” said Wendy Growcock Project Lazarus coordinator and public health education specialist with the health department. “Because if we’re not honest about it we’re not going to make any changes in Stanly County.”

“I’m an addict in recovery and I will always be that” Womack told the crowd “but I am not a stigma you’re going to classify me as. I am a person and I am a human being.”

Stanly has struggled over the years to blunt the ravages of the opioid epidemic repeatedly ranking in the top 10 in the state when it came to overdoses. But the numbers seem to have improved of late.

The county last summer fell out of the state’s monthly list of top 10 counties with the highest rates of overdoses leading to hospital visits. Since 2020 Stanly County has had a 21 percent decrease in overdose deaths and a 20 percent decrease in overdoses according to a letter sent to county commissioners from Stanly County Health and Human Services Board Chairwoman Jann Lowder in early May.

Additional help is on the way as the county is set to receive close to $4.7 million over an 18-year period from the national opioid settlement reached last year between the country’s three major drug distributors — Cardinal Health AmerisourceBergen and McKesson — and pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson. The settlement provided the groundwork for billions of dollars to begin flowing into communities across the country for addiction treatment prevention services and other expenses from the epidemic.

Stanly has already received almost $180000 from the settlement and should receive another $395000 within the coming months.

“I see some positive outcomes happening in the community” said Deputy EMS Chief Mike Campbell who spent several years as a first responder with the Community Paramedic Program a post-overdose response team created in 2019 to target people suffering from opioid overdoses and help connect them with treatment options such as Monarch Nazareth Child & Family Connection and Project Lazarus.

“We definitely have a lot less overdoses than we did when we first started this program” he added. “That just goes to show right there that the less people are overdosing the less people are dying.”

Many of the speakers acknowledged that people struggling with addiction cannot get through recovery by themselves; it takes the support of the community to make sure positive behaviors are long-lasting.

“It’s going to take a village to save people” Womack said.

While recovery from addiction is a process that often takes a long time the speakers stressed there is light at the end of the tunnel.

“I spent so many years of my life numb just completely numb and I feel every damn thing now” Russell said. “And I’m grateful as can be for it.

“My recovery has given me the opportunity to be set free.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludGVsbGlnZW50Y2lvLmNvbS9ub3J0aC1hbWVyaWNhLzIwMjIvMDkvMDIvbWNkb25hbGRzLW5ldy1jaW8tdG8tYnVpbGQtb24tZGVlcC1iZW5jaC1vZi10YWxlbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's new CIO to build on deep bench of talent – Intelligent CIO North America,"Global food retailer McDonald’s has appointed a new Executive Vice President and Global Chief Information Officer.

In fact Carnival was the first cruise line to really market itself as the best option for weekend cruises. This is unsurprising as weekend getaway cruising perfectly aligns with Carnival’s brand of having ""The Most Fun Ships at Sea.""

Image

As a cruiser living in Florida this means I have the flexibility to take weekend cruises more often than the average person. Although it had been over a decade since my last Carnival cruise I was intrigued when I found a cheap weekend cruise from Mobile Alabama on Carnival Ecstasy.

For just $250 per person we could sail to Cozumel Mexico over a weekend in August while also enjoying two days at sea. This port is less than two hours from my house so it was almost too convenient to turn down.



Image

A little research revealed that this cruise was on the oldest ship in Carnival’s fleet. To my surprise Carnival Ecstasy would be retiring and heading to the scrapyard in just a few months. This was interesting as using old ships for weekend cruising has been a trend slowly being phased out by other cruise lines. For example Royal Caribbean has started to offer weekend cruises on some of their bigger and newer ships.

Although I’ve taken a few weekend cruises with Royal Caribbean I was excited to see what Carnival had to offer. Carnival is known for cultivating a highly energetic atmosphere onboard - people often refer to these cruise ships as the party ships!

Image

I was a little worried that the onboard Carnival experience might not align with my current travel style anymore. I usually don’t love drinking all day or staying up super late to hit the nightclub. If we are being honest I struggle to stay up for the evening entertainment sometimes!

I figured I would need to have extra coffee throughout the day to keep up with the onboard parties.

As I’ve gotten older I’ve learned the hard way that you often get what you pay for. With a cruise being this cheap I had my expectations set low in regards to luxury service and amenities. You can’t pay for a dirt-cheap cruise and expect to have a luxurious experience.

Image

But I also kept a very open mind. I reminded myself that any cruise can be fun if you have the right attitude - and a weekend in Mexico would surely be more fun than a weekend at home mowing the lawn.

Here’s an overview of my experience onboard a weekend Carnival cruise.

Why I Like Weekend Cruising

To start I want to give a few reasons why I love cruising over the weekends.

Don’t get me wrong I absolutely love a week-long cruise to really disconnect and get away. I even love 12-13 night cruises for grand adventures which allows me to see multiple countries without ever having to re-pack my suitcase.

Image

First taking a weekend cruise is usually very affordable. Since you’re only sailing for a few days you’re never spending more than a few hundred bucks to sail. Of course you can always spend way more than that with shore excursions drink packages and other add-ons. But for the most part weekend cruising is great for those looking to keep their budget low.

It’s even better when you can drive to the cruise port and not have to worry about the additional cost and stress of airfare.

Image

Second it’s much easier for me to take a weekend cruise with work than it is to take longer vacations. I can finish most of my weekly work before setting sail and I am already back to work the following Monday.

This also makes it much easier to get a group of family or friends together for a weekend sailing. It’s not uncommon to see bachelorette parties and family reunions take place on a weekend cruise. It can be tough to align work schedules and commitments during the week but a weekend cruise is easier to schedule.

Image

Finally weekend cruising is a great way to get out of my day-to-day life and escape reality for a bit. Vacation really is a state of mind and sailing away from the stress of daily life is a perfect way for me to reset.

Carnival Ecstasy Initial Impressions

When we first boarded the Carnival Ecstasy for a weekend cruise a few weeks ago I expected the cruise ship to be one giant party.

The partying started almost immediately as we got onboard and made our way to the pool deck. Everyone was letting loose and having a good time as Carnival Ecstasy sailed away from Mobile and started her journey to Mexico for the weekend.

Image

The first indication that this would be a wild cruise was when a granny holding a cocktail got on the pool deck stage and started to grind on the DJ. Even the DJ yelled across the pool deck “Oh man y’all. This is gonna be a good cruise!”

Safe to say we realized quickly that it would be a rowdy crowd! We noticed tons of families and friends traveling together based on the number of matching shirts.

Image

That evening we noticed most people weren’t even getting dressed up for dinner. Most people were still on the pool deck drinking even as the sun went down and the sail-away music stopped. It seemed like everyone came to dinner without even changing from their pool-party attire.

At first I had a bit of culture shock with everything. I wasn’t used to such a crazy environment onboard. But people only had four days to dance and drink their vacation away so they weren’t wasting any time.

By the third day we became pretty acquainted with the party atmosphere onboard. It was nice to feel like we didn’t need to impress anyone - certainly no one was judging what we were wearing or how we looked.

Image

The casual and upbeat environment was welcomed and allowed us to focus more on enjoying the high-paced energy. There was nothing stuffy about this cruise!

The Fun Squad

Image

For this weekend cruise I was shocked to see our cruise director was probably the same age as me. I’ve never been on a cruise with a young cruise director! Although most cruise directors are very fun and charismatic they’re almost always around my parents’ age.

To our surprise the entire Fun Squad (or entertainment staff) probably had an average age of 30. This is no accident as I am sure Carnival utilizes this energetic staff to keep the energy high onboard.

Image

On a weekend cruise the Fun Squad was working around the clock! They hosted all of the onboard events and activities to keep the party going.

Carnival also heavily leads into its ""Fun"" branding - everywhere you look something has the word fun in it. Every announcement makes mention of Carnival being the most fun fleet in the industry! You can’t go anywhere on a Carnival ship without thinking of fun.

Weekend Cruise Entertainment

One of the biggest surprises for me on this weekend cruise was the entertainment. First the activities only lasted around 30 minutes for everything. On most cruises I’ve found the shows and entertainment last at least 45 minutes - some cruise ships have full-length Broadway shows!

With shorter activities we could do more onboard. This allowed us to go from the comedy show to the karaoke bar and finish off at the Alchemy Bar within 2 hours. It was nice not having to commit large chunks of our onboard time to one activity.

Image

We were also pleased to see most of the activities were geared towards our demographic. The trivia topics were things that we could actively participate in. Topics for trivia ranged from Harry Potter to the TV shows Friends and The Office.

The music trivia songs were all ones that we recognized too - most music wasn’t older than 1980. We participated in 2000s music trivia and 90s music trivia which was really fun!

Image

I always roll my eyes when my parents want to go to the Name That 70s Tune trivia when we cruise with other cruise lines. I didn’t realize how the entertainment is geared towards an older audience on other cruise lines.

It also seems like similar events on other cruise lines are normally held late on other cruise lines. If you want to find fun music or go to the silent disco party you will have to stay up pretty late. The earlier slots are reserved to appeal to the older cruisers and they assume the younger ones will stay up late.

Image

On this Carnival cruise you didn’t have to stay up super late to go to the events that sounded fun! As someone who likes to go to bed early I appreciated that I could still find activities and events that appealed to me without staying up until midnight.

We found ourselves laughing through the adult-only comedy shows and singing along at karaoke almost every night. Everyone onboard was there to have a good time and you could feel that eclectic energy throughout.

No Time for Relaxation

Let me start by saying that I almost always come back from a cruise feeling rejuvenated. I normally love spending my sea days in the adult-only area reading a book sipping on a mojito taking a nap and eating snacks poolside.

I won’t lie though I came back from this weekend Carnival cruise feeling exhausted. Although we had a lot of fun there was no time (or place) to relax or take a nap.

Image

If people were hoping to relax on this weekend cruise there were very few places for us to do that. Our days were better spent letting loose exploring the ship and having a drink poolside while we listened to the DJ play his tunes.

For the most part I sleep like a rock on cruise ships; between the swaying of the ship and my interior cabin being pitch dark I sleep super well. I was surprised when I found that I wasn’t sleeping well on this ship at all!

Image

The first night our neighbors were very noisy into the early hours. When we ran into them in the hallway we discovered it was a group of college friends spending the weekend together. This absolutely aligns with what we expected for a weekend Carnival cruise.

All throughout the night we heard groups of drunk people stumbling back to their cabins. Unfortunately older ships tend to have thin walls. A rowdy crowd coupled with thin walls makes for horrible rest and relaxation.

Image

I was hoping to sleep in during our sea days since we had some late nights but I was woken up both mornings by early announcements and loud people in the hallways.

The non-stop string of announcements was one of my least favorite aspects of the Carnival experience. Staying up late having a great time just to be woken up by the cruise director making unnecessary announcements isn’t my idea of fun.

Image

Although an older crowd can be slower-paced at least they are very quiet and considerate onboard. By the last morning I had to sleep with earplugs if I had any hope of feeling rested in the morning. I’ve never had to wear earplugs on a cruise but I was running on empty and there’s only so much coffee I can drink to get through the day.

Final Thoughts

I came into this weekend Carnival cruise expecting that it would be in short a party cruise. Between Carnival’s ""Fun"" branding and weekend cruises tending to have a more party atmosphere I had a feeling this cruise would be wild.

Not to mention that Carnival cruises have a well-known stereotype of having a rowdy and crazy crowd onboard.

Image

When we boarded the ship we learned pretty quickly that most of our preconceived notions were fairly accurate. While it wasn’t as crazy as I had anticipated in my mind the energy onboard was off the charts.

This cruise was a perfect fit for those looking to have some good cheap fun. Nothing about this weekend Carnival cruise was glamorous; but we didn’t expect glamor given the cheap price!

Image

On the side of luxury rejuvenation and relaxation there was none of this on our cruise. It would actually be hard to find a place to truly relax on this ship because everything onboard is geared towards hosting fun activities and entertainment.

Everyone on this ship was looking to have a great time over this weekend cruise. We loved how friendly everyone was and how much fun they were having. We couldn’t help but have fun ourselves!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbnkxLmNvbS9ueWMvYnJvb2tseW4vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA5LzAzL2NoaWxkcmVuLWhpdC10aGUtc3RyZWV0cy1mb3ItanVuaW9yLWRheS1wYXJhZGUt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Children hit the streets for Junior Carnival Day Parade,"From stilt walkers to those wearing feathered pieces on their backs children showed out to the Junior Carnival Day Parade in Crown Heights Saturday.

According to officials 18 colorful entries walked the parade route down St. John’s Place toward a performance stage at the Brooklyn Museum.

Children attending the parade said they’ve been expecting this day for a while.

“I feel great I’ve been waiting two years for this - I’m glad it’s back and I’m just glad to be out here” Alanah Jones a participant in the parade said.

“I’m feeling very good because I’ve been waiting to do this since I was six years old” Brandon Powlette a stilt performer for Kaisokah Moko Jumbies Inc. said.

Whether it was waving a flag representing their Caribbean island or dancing along to the rhythm children came ready to celebrate their heritage and make their parents proud.

“It gets my energy pumping I love me some soca music and you know I’m on the road with my family” Francis DaSilva said.

The curfew will only apply to travelers 17 years of age and younger and goes into effect immediately across the entire fleet.

Curfew for Young Guests

Outlined on the cruise line’s Minor Guest Policy page the new curfew is as follows:

“Guests 17 years of age and under who are not accompanied by an adult in their traveling party 21 years of age or older must be clear of all public areas by 1:00am each evening unless involved in a Club 02 or Circle C teen activity.”

Cruise passengers have long been divided on the subject of young cruisers with some travelers reporting younger guests taking over elevators playing in hallways or stairwells pounding on stateroom doors or otherwise causing excess noise and disturbance particularly late at night.

The last day of a cruise when youth programs have typically concluded is often a more raucous night for young cruisers and their newly-made onboard friends before they part ways the next morning.

Carnival Cruise Line brand ambassador John Heald clarified the consequences of violating this new policy on his popular Facebook page.

“Any guest in violation of the curfew or whose behavior contradicts our rules could be disembarked in the next port at their own expense and not be allowed to have a cruise with us again” Heald said.

This does not mean however that young travelers would be put off the ship without their parents or guardians.

Any reported incident is sure to be investigated before consequences are applied and it is likely that a warning could be issued before such drastic action is taken depending on the individual circumstances and the severity of the incident.

Furthermore the curfew will not apply when young cruisers are involved in a supervised Club O2 or Circle C activity or when they are accompanied by their parents or another member of their immediate traveling party over 21 years of age.

More Emphasis on Respect

This change comes just days after Carnival Cruise Line updated its “Know Before You Go” information to emphasize respect courtesy and other values expected of its guests.

“No one will ever confuse a Carnival Cruise Line ship with a school library but our experience has taught us that everyone has a better time when children are supervised noise in the hallways is kept to a minimum guests follow queues and that a spirit of community and neighborliness is shown by all” the new policy reads.

Similarly the consequences for excessively disruptive behavior is the same as for breaking the new curfew: disembarkation at the next available port at the guest’s expense and a ban from sailing with Carnival in the future.

It has not been clarified as to whether a guest could also be banned from all Carnival Corporation & plc cruise lines which would also include multiple other popular lines including Princess Cruises Holland America Line and Costa Cruises.

These changes come after there has been a rise in onboard incidents in recent weeks with physical altercations between groups of guests that escalate to violence.

In June and July separate incidents occurred aboard Carnival Magic from New York and Carnival Elation from Jacksonville Florida. Such incidents however are not confined to Carnival Cruise Line. Royal Caribbean International’s Navigator of the Seas had a similar incident in early July.

Furthermore smaller incidents that involve fewer parties and are quickly broken up are rarely reported but do happen on occasion when guests may be involved in misunderstandings or other unfortunate circumstances.

In many cases excess alcohol consumption and the uninhibited atmosphere of a cruise vacation may contribute to such incidents though all cruise lines do take steps to ensure a safe enjoyable getaway for everyone onboard.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vcGF0Y2guY29tL2NhbGlmb3JuaWEvYWdvdXJhaGlsbHMvY2Fybml2YWwta2lja3Mtc3VwcG9ydC1hZ291cmEtaGlsbHMtc2Nob29sc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival Kicks Off For To Support Agoura Hills Schools,"Schools Carnival Kicks Off For To Support Agoura Hills Schools The annual Las Virgenes carnival to support Agoura Hills schools kicked off Friday for the holiday weekend.

The vessel’s debut this fall will continue to mark Carnival’s 50th birthday in PortMiami where its Fun Ships first started sailing. It’s fitting then that the ship will carry themes of Miami not only through its architectural details but also in its food and beverage offerings.

Bar 820 will feature several Miami-inspired tropical martinis and other drinks that will infuse an essence of southern Florida throughout each voyage and represent a mixture of local partnerships on board.

“Miami is a rich source of inspiration for drinks and we tapped into the city’s flavors well with what we’ve developed for Bar 820. Many of the drinks we’ll serve on this ship are the product of collaboration with brilliant partners that share our hometown and our love of fun” said Edward Allen Carnival’s vice president of beverage operations.

Carnival Cruise Line’s beverage team created special martinis in tribute to the line’s Miami roots and unveiled them for the first time at Tropical Distillers near downtown Miami.

Tropical Distillers’ new distillery is set for a debut of its own this fall and will provide an important component — JF Haden’s Mango Liqueur — for one of the ship’s new cocktails Mango 305.

Carnival also worked with local partners Magic City Garnish and Filthy Foods to source the garnishes that will adorn each cocktail. Additionally the cruise line’s brew team worked with M.I.A. Beer Company on a collaborative beer and the brewery’s Miami Weiss beer.

Photo:AFP

The commissioning of India's first home-built aircraft carrier on Friday received pretty much flattery from the Western media. A CNN report claimed the aircraft carrier has put India into ""an elite league of the world's naval powers"" and an AFP article hailed it as ""a milestone in government efforts to counter China's growing military assertiveness in the region.""Their intention couldn't be any clearer: By shaping ""China's much larger and growing fleet"" as the major target of India's first home-built aircraft carrier they want to instigate tension and even confrontation between China and India creating public opinion pressure to push India into an anti-China forefront. It's particularly important for India to stay sober amid Western flattery that is aimed at luring India into an anti-China cannon fodder.It indeed was a moment for India to celebrate its progress in indigenous shipbuilding capabilities. Building The INS Vikrant whose name is the Sanskrit word for ""powerful"" or ""courageous"" hasn't been easy for India. It took 13 years to commission the indigenous aircraft carrier since the keel-laying of it was done in 2009. The carrier has filled the nation with ""new confidence"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at Friday's ceremony marked by fanfare at the Cochin Shipyard in India's southern Kerala state declaring India has taken one more step toward becoming a developed nation.But was the West really happy for India? Modi also unfurled the country's new naval flag without a British colonial symbol left over from India's colonial era on the commissioning ceremony a milestone in India's de-Western colonialism. This however was seldom mentioned in most Western reports.New Delhi needs to guard against the West's attempts to turn the moment into a military event against China. ""China has never regarded India as a threat nor has China taken India as an imaginary rival and target when it develops its own aircraft carriers and navy forces"" Lan Jianxue director of the Department for Asia-Pacific Studies at the China Institute of International Studies told the Global Times. He noted India's biggest enemy is its own poverty backwardness and insufficient development as some Indian scholars have acknowledged.If India falls into the Western public opinion trap to provoke China and regard China as its ""main rival"" that needs to be contained it will gain no benefits but only become a cannon fodder warned Song Zhongping a Chinese military expert. China is ahead of India in terms of both the number and technology of aircraft carriers and China's carrier localization rate is higher than that of India.""India's aircraft carrier has a relatively small tonnage limited combat capabilities and ranges and certain technologies are still dependent on foreign countries which has constrained its combat effectiveness and supporting power"" said Song.For an ambitious India that direly needs development external stability is an important guarantee for domestic development and maintaining stable relations with major powers is especially important. India needs to keep its strategic sobriety and not to be fooled by the Western flattery. In recent years the US and the West have increased their efforts to curry favor with India their real purpose is to fool India to play a bigger role in their Indo-Pacific Strategy to serve their ends. They hope to take advantage of the confrontation between India and China.A view in the West and within India as well holds that China doesn't want to see India's development. This doesn't hold water at all. When it comes to developing relations with India China has attached great importance to the special significance of ""the dragon and elephant dancing together."" Aircraft carriers are considered to be one of the most effective strategic tools to safeguard national maritime interests. There is no arms race between China and India and China will not view India's military progress from a perspective of zero-sum game. It's also hoped that India will not be deceived by the honeyed words of the West.Both China and India are emerging economies committed to economic and social development. Their common interests far outweigh their differences. China and India should be partners for mutual success instead of adversaries of mutual attrition.The author is a reporter with the Global Times. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn"

Entomophagy the practice of eating bugs is liable to draw cocked eyebrows and crinkled noses from many Americans. But around the world some two billion people enjoy insects as dietary staples according to The New York Times. These people may be on to something as a very strong case can be made for entomophagy. Though the exact nutritional makeup varies from species to species insects are generally high in protein vitamins minerals essential amino acids and omega-3 fats and farming them exerts far less strain on the environment.

Insects have been largely rejected from Western diets which the Times attributes to a matter of geography. Europe has a low level of biodiversity due to its cold climate; It is home to just 2% of the world's edible insects none of which are large enough to provide much in the way of food. The American attitude is showing signs of a potential shift as crickets have achieved some popularity. However beetles and caterpillars are much more popular internationally accounting for nearly 50% of insects eaten globally according to further reporting by the New York Times.

This might come as a surprise if you're used to seeing caterpillars smaller than your pinky but on the streets of Harare Zimbabwe it's another story altogether (per Atlas Obscura).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWx3YXlhZ2UuY29tL21lY2hhbmljYWwvbG9jb21vdGl2ZXMvaGFwcHktMTAwdGgtYW5uaXZlcnNhcnktZW1kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Happy 100th Anniversary EMD®!,"Caterpillar Inc. on Aug. 31 marked the 100th anniversary of EMD®. Founded as Electro-Motive Engineering Corporation EMD is now a product brand of Progress Rail a Caterpillar company.

Harold L. “Hal” Hamilton established Electro-Motive Engineering Corporation in August 1922 and soon after renamed it Electro-Motive Company (EMC). In 1924 EMC introduced the first Electro-Motive gas-electric railcar with 150 hp.

The company was sold to General Motors in 1930 where Hamilton helped design a locomotive to run on diesel fuel rather than steam power. After merging with another engine division at General Motors EMC was officially renamed the Electro-Motive Division (EMD).

In 1939 EMD introduced the FT a 1350-hp diesel-electric locomotive. The “F” stood for Fourteen Hundred (1400) hp (rounded up from 1350) and the “T” for Twin as it came standard in a two-unit set. Equipped with a two-stroke 567 prime-mover a total of 1096 were built—555 cab-equipped A units and 541 cab-less booster or ”B” units. The FT was the first locomotive in EMD’s successful F-unit series of cab unit freight diesels and is credited with convincing many U.S. railroads that the diesel-electric freight locomotive represented the future. Widespread dieselization however did not occur until after World War II.

The EMD E6 was a 2000-hpA1A-A1A streamlined passenger train locomotive. The cab version the E6A was manufactured from November 1939 to September 1942; 91 were produced. The booster version the E6B was manufactured from April 1940 to February 1942; 26 were produced. They were equipped with two 1000-hp 12-cylinder 567 prime-movers each with a generator to power the traction motors. The E6 was the seventh model in a long line of passenger diesels of similar design known as EMD E-units. Compared with passenger locomotives made later by EMD the noses of the E3 E4 E5 and E6 cab units had sloping noses. Later E models (E7 E8 E9) had the “bulldog nose” of the F series.

During World War II EMD manufactured engines for the U.S. Navy and after the war continued to produce them for some of the nation’s largest railroads.

The EMD GP7 was the first model in EMD’s GP (General Purpose) series of locomotives. Power was provided by an EMD 567B 16-cylinder prime-mover that generated 1500 hp. More than 2700 of these four-axle (B-B) diesel-electrics were built between October 1949 and May 1954. The GP7 was the first EMD road locomotive with a hood unit design instead of a carbody design. This proved to be more efficient than the car body design as the hood unit cost less to build was cheaper and easier to maintain and had much better front and rear visibility for switching.The GP7 was replaced by the GP9 in EMD’s long GP line. The six-axle SD (Special Duty) series is derived from it. Many “Geeps” remain in service today and are popular models for rebuilding and repowering. (Sean Lamb Wikimedia Commons)



General Motors sold EMD to Greenbriar Equity and Berkshire Partners in 2005. In 2010 the company was sold again to Progress Rail—which Caterpillar Inc. acquired in 2006—and renamed Electro-Motive Diesel. A new freight locomotive that met EPA tier-4 emission regulations was unveiled in 2015.

EMD has delivered more than 75000 locomotives around the world with single engine power ratings as high as 6000 hp according to Progress Rail. It also provides engines for the marine drilling and power generation industries.

Continuing EMD’s legacy Progress Rail says it is investing in new technologies. In 2021 Caterpillar announced a memorandum of understanding with BNSF and Chevron to pursue a locomotive powered by hydrogen fuel cells and in early 2022 BHP and Fortescue announced the purchase of Progress Rail’s battery-electric EMD Joule locomotives for Australian mining operations. Additionally many EMD locomotives are also capable of using up to 20% biodiesel blends and are being tested with 100% biodiesel capabilities.

“EMD has a proud 100-year legacy of providing rail customers with proven technology and innovation” says Martin (Marty) Haycraft Caterpillar’s Senior Vice President and Progress Rail’s President and CEO. “We’ll continue to develop new ways to deliver premier locomotives to our customers and we look forward to another century of helping our customers build a better more sustainable world.”

Credit: M. Muffoletto/USU

The greatest diversity of life is not counted in the number of species says Utah State University evolutionary geneticist Zachariah Gompert but in the diversity of interactions among them.

""It's often unclear if the outcome of an interaction such as whether a microbe can infect a host is the same for all members of a species or depends on the genetic makeup of the specific individuals involved"" says Gompert associate professor in USU's Department of Biology and Ecology Center.

For example he says one might ponder why a particular butterfly either can or can't feed on a particular plant.

""Is that affected by the specific genetic makeup of the butterfly or is it the specific genetic makeup of the individual plant?"" Gompert asks. ""Or is it affected by genetic interactions between the butterfly and plant species?""

Gompert and colleagues from University of Nevada Rice University University of Wyoming University of Tennessee Texas State University and Michigan State University address this knowledge gap through a series of experiments using a recent host-range expansion of alfalfa by the Melissa blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa). The team reports its findings in the Aug. 29 2022 issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

""We show that genetic differences among Melissa blue caterpillars and alfalfa plants account for nearly half of the variability in caterpillar growth and survival"" says Gompert. ""Our results suggest individual variation matters and the outcome of this plant-insect interaction is affected by many genes with mostly independent—or additive—effects. Moreover genetic differences among alfalfa plants have consistent effects on caterpillar growth in multiple butterfly populations and species making such effects predictable.""

Collecting extensive data over several years at field plots in Utah and Nevada the team's results support the hypothesis that both plant and insect genotypes matter and about equally so for caterpillar growth and survival.

Beyond issues specific to insects and their host plants genetic variation within species could also be important for other host-parasite interactions Gompert says. ""Including for example susceptibility to parasitic diseases in humans and other animals being a function of both genetic variation in hosts and among pathogen strains. But the generality of this hypothesis remains to be tested.""

A national beverage distributor will be expanding at a planned warehouse project in Melville.

Keurig Dr. Pepper has pre-leased an entire 103500-square-foot warehouse that will be built on 8.18 acres at 125 Baylis Road. The company will be relocating from an adjacent building it’s been leasing at 135 Baylis Road.

The new warehouse and distribution facility is being developed by Phoenix-based Creation Equity and assisted by J.P. Morgan. The developer purchased the 100000-square-foot office building at 125 Baylis Road for $10.716 million in August 2021 and is currently securing approvals for redeveloping the site.

The plan calls for demolishing the existing office building and replacing it with the new warehouse and distribution center featuring 32-foot ceilings 20 dock doors and two drive-in bays. The new building will have 96900 square feet of warehouse space and 6600 square feet of office space.

Formed in 2018 with the merger of Keurig Green Mountain and Dr. Pepper Snapple Group publicly traded Keurig Dr. Pepper owns several well-known brands including Snapple Canada Dry 7 Up Green Mountain Coffee Mott’s Hires Root Beer and many more.

The first step in upgrading a K–12 district’s network is determining the starting point. Working with a partner like CDW Education can help an IT team better plan its wireless journey.

Because K–12 IT professionals frequently wear many hats they don’t always have the time or insights to build a plan for their network upgrades. Working with a partner can ensure students and staff stay connected leaving IT leaders free to answer other needs.

READ MORE: Tech reignites educators and IT leaders in K–12 districts ahead of a new school year.

CDW’s solution architects can assess a school’s infrastructure and help it create a plan for immediate and future upgrades. With the modern state of innovation it’s almost impossible to implement a one-and-done networking solution that will carry a district through the next decade.

Instead schools should consider network upgrades that are scalable and flexible. Also consider a phased approach that allows for addressing the most urgent needs first. Then plan for continued updates in coming years as funding and budgets allow. CDW Education with its deep bench of technology partners can provide the solutions schools need as the digital world continues to evolve. CDW’s experts can also help IT leaders plan ongoing upgrades around funding cycles such as E-rate.

Two young hungry environmental engineers — Larry Blackwell and Joe Busby — were at a waste-pollution-control conference and having known one another from their days in Clemson’s graduate school of environmental systems engineering decided to take a walk and talk things over.

At the time Busby a Ph.D. in environmental engineering was doing some consulting work for Celanese. Blackwell also a Ph.D. in environmental engineering was working for AMECO.

“Larry asked me what I wanted to do” Busby remembers. “I said ‘Start my own business.’ Larry said ‘Let me join you!'”

Within a year the two men had launched Environmental Dynamics Inc. an environmental-engineering company focused on water- and waste-treatment solutions and services.

“Larry asked me what I wanted to do. I said ‘Start my own business.’ Larry said ‘Let me join you!'” – Joe Busby

“One of our first backers was Howard Suitt of Suitt Construction who provided us an office” Busby says. “He was an entrepreneur too.”

The men chose to headquarter EDI in Greenville because as Busby puts it “it made sense.”

“I’d lived in Greenville before going to grad school at Clemson. And Larry made the gutsy decision to move down from Naperville Illinois” he said.

In 1975 George Fletcher an engineer who’d studied with Blackwell and Busby at Clemson joined them.

“They invited me to join as the third principal with a 10% stake” Fletcher recalls. “By the time we sold the company eight years later I had 25% and they each had 33%.”

A star is born

Fletcher recalls how EDI bought a little-known software package used to run waste-treatment plants for $16000 in 1982.

Its name? Datastream.

Fletcher says the software captivated Blackwell most of all.

“Larry was a classic entrepreneur” Fletcher says. “Totally focused. He’d wake up thinking about how to make money out of Datastream.”

When EDI sold in 1984 to an environmental engineering outfit named RMT itself a subsidiary of Wisconsin Power and Light Busby and Fletcher stayed on in leadership roles with the new company.

But Blackwell broke off later buying the Datastream software for $65000 and going on his own.

“No one followed me into Datastream” Blackwell says of his move. “No one else had any interest in it. They thought it was a dead end. But it was evident to me that everything was going to be computerized… particularly operations issues.”

“It was choppy but after about ’87 on we were doubling revenues every year” he adds.

“No one else had any interest in it. They thought it was a dead end. But it was evident to me that everything was going to be computerized … particularly operations issues.” – Larry Blackwell

Key to Datastream’s success was Blackwell’s decision to hire John Sterling a young Silicon Valley sales superstar whose father Jack Sterling provided the seed money for Blackwell to buy the software.

“Hiring [John] to focus on sales was a big lift” Blackwell says. “We began to replicate his sales process across a larger number of salespeople. John was excellent at training and implementing a telephone-sales organization. We placed ads in trade publications and were getting 2000 leads a month – people would cut the ads out and call us.”

Datastream’s pre-9/11 market cap topped $1 billion and though the company’s valuation softened in a post 9/11 economy they eventually sold to Infor Global Solutions for a little more than $200 million in 2006.

Now an angel investor — he’s invested about $6 million in 12 companies he says — Blackwell is quick to offer advice to those thinking of starting a new business.

“It always takes a lot more money than you think” he says.

His other advice?

“Never give up.”

Ambition and brains

Busby who later became president of RMT (the company that bought EDI) commuted weekly from Greenville to RMT’s offices in Madison Wisconsin for years.

In time the commuting got to him he says.

An engineer at heart Busby started OptiQuest Technologies offering “mathematical modeling for artificial neural networks.”

He also did some consulting work with Fletcher.

When asked what made EDI such an entrepreneurial incubator Busby says it came down to the people they hired.

“People we hired had a lot of ambitions and brains — like Kurt — he was a very bright guy” Busby says.

“All were engineers all had strong personalities and they believed they could do something better than someone else was doing it.” – Sue Priester

He’s talking about Kurt Priester another entrepreneurial-minded engineer who joined EDI in 1980 before launching Computer Dynamics in 1981 together with his wife Sue. By 1997 they’d sold to Total Control Products which in turn was gobbled up by GE Fanuc a year later.

Sue Priester says her late husband (Kurt was killed in a car crash in 1998) shared several traits with Fletcher Busby and Blackwell.

“All were engineers all had strong personalities and they believed they could do something better than someone else was doing it” she says.

But more than that she says it was about the confluence of several critical pieces most notably melding environmental engineering processes with emerging technology.

For Blackwell the confluence behind Datastream’s success was the advent of the IBM personal computer.

“Datastream really got going in ’86. But the IBM was the nucleus. The thing that made Datastream go was that everyone wanted to work on the IBM PC” he says.

‘A good career’

George Fletcher sits in the screened-in back patio of his Greenville home and spreads — what else — an 11-by-17 inch piece of engineering grid paper on the table in front of him. Pen in hand he begins charting the daisy chain of startups that grew out of EDI: Datastream… Computer Dynamics… The Fletcher Group… all companies that eventually spun off other companies that morphed into other companies or merged with larger ones.

Fletcher says when EDI sold to RMT he Busby and Blackwell each had their own idea for what to do next.

For him it was to build an engineering company.

“Busby became president of RMT in ’90 and I was a regional president based here in Greenville” Fletcher says. And because RMT had the money to recruit and retain top talent Fletcher built a formidable group.

“I had a good career. I had good people and let them do their jobs.” – George Fletcher

“I hired people with master’s or Ph.D.s in environmental or chemical engineering from around the country and brought them to Greenville” he remembers.

In time Fletcher left RMT and launched the Fletcher Group out of his Greenville home in the early ’90s. The company offered consulting engineering software and waste treatment.

“I hired one of RMT’s employees and another then another then another” he says. “I knew most of the environmental engineers in Greenville and could cherry pick.”

Fletcher ticks off the names: “Jim Clemmer Ph.D. chemical engineer and former professor at Ole Miss; Kathy Webb superstar hydrogeologist from Alabama; Mark Taylor geologist with degrees from Harvard and the University of Michigan; Bill Husk industrial hygienist; Joe Barron civil engineer; Ruth Albright chemical engineer; John Chastain designer… good people who made a great company.'”

When the company pumped $400000 into buying a Dow Chemical waste-treatment plant in Mauldin another company was born: Piedmont Industrial Waste Services offering waste treatment services to other companies.

In 2000 Vopak North America an international chemical and liquid bulk storage company came calling offering to buy PIWS over a period of five years.

The Mauldin plant itself became VLS Environmental Solutions and was eventually sold to a private equity firm in 2017.

“That was as big a success story eventually as Datastream” Fletcher says. “I mean they sold for a couple of hundred million.”

And the engineering arm of Fletcher Group? It’s now SynTerra Corp.

Though Fletcher sold his share of the business to employees in 2006 and retired long before the VLS sale knowing it grew out of what he began is a point of pride.

“I’ve had a good career” he says. “I had good people and let them do their jobs.”

As for the entrepreneurial fire Fletcher says it’s a mindset.

“There are people who can handle the risk” he says. “And they’re in the minority.”

Whatever became of EDI?

After being absorbed into RMT the combined companies have become part of TRC Solutions a 6000-employee global consulting and management company focused on environmental solutions like wind energy.

To learn more about the role of alternative drug delivery formulation in expanding the potential indications of a drug product or improving compliance Pharmaceutical Technology Europe spoke with Kimberly Shepard associate director R&D principal engineer and Jonathan Cape head of Multiparticulate Technology both at Lonza Small Molecules; Brian Wilson new business development Celanese; and Wen Chin Foo senior pharmaceutical scientist Roquette Pharma Solutions.

Driving growth

PTE: What factors are currently driving growth in the alternative drug delivery formulation market? Are there any growth trends that will be important in the future?

Shepard (Lonza Small Molecules): For lung indications such as asthma and COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease] local delivery by inhaler has been the standard of care for decades. Biotherapeutic treatments such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been approved more recently for lung indications but via intravenous or subcutaneous administration. In cases where systemic administration is not needed for treatment direct delivery to the lung would be hugely beneficial for the patients. There have been efforts in recent years to create dry powder inhaled formulation of these kinds of drugs using spray drying as a single-step process to stabilize the fragile biomolecules and engineer respirable particles for inhalation. The advantages for patients with lung conditions are potentially so significant that a continued focus on these formulations will be inevitable.

Cape (Lonza Small Molecules): There has been a real drive over recent years to develop dosage forms aimed at paediatric populations. These dosage forms are often distinct from adult products with challenges ranging from taste masking controlled release and even bioavailability enhancement. CDMOs [contract development and manufacturing organizations] with the necessary experience and technologies have been taking a leading role in helping innovator companies develop commercializable products for the paediatric market. Both FDA’s [US Food and Drug Administration’s] Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) and the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA’s) Paediatric Regulation incentivize companies to develop and commercialize products suitable for infants and children. The six months of market exclusivity they provide are a real incentive—two years in Europe for orphan indications—and it’s working with maybe 15 paediatric approvals every year now in the United States. These incentives are proving a significant growth driver for paediatric products including multiparticulate formulations as they can be particularly useful when formulating medicines for these young patients.

Editor’s Note: This article was published in Pharmaceutical Technology Europe’s September 2022 print issue.

Wilson (Celanese): Alternative drug delivery formulations can help overcome limitations of traditional dosage forms. These solutions are designed to provide improved bioavailability reduced off-target effects expanded compatibility across a variety of molecular classes and lower treatment burden for patients. Market focus has been on identifying alternative dosage forms that offer sustained delivery of complex molecule types with the goal to improve efficacy and provide better outcomes.

The industry is focused on innovating novel sustained-release solutions to deliver biologics and RNA therapeutics. Sustained-release dosage forms allow precise delivery using improved targeting localized delivery and solutions that help deliver drugs across physiological barriers a recognized impediment to drug efficacy in the past. Success in sustained controlled-release drug delivery represents an opportunity to reduce treatment burden and ensure patient adherence. Another interesting trend is the effort to improve patient outcomes through controlled release of multiple drugs concurrently. Fixed-dose combinations and multi-preventative technologies are potential applications of this approach.

Advancements to develop fixed-dose combinations and multi-preventative technologies for multiple pathways or multiple indications will continue. Oncology is an exciting therapeutic area where this trend has renewed focus and the concurrent delivery of multiple therapeutics may prove efficacious in treating heterogeneous tumours or the tumour microenvironment.

Foo (Roquette Pharma Solutions): The rising demand for innovative small-molecule drug delivery forms is being fuelled by the need to get more patients to adhere to their prescriptions. With the number of people aged over 60 years set to double by 2050 and global instances of chronic disease on the rise the need for effective drug delivery formats has never been greater (12). Despite this as many as 50% of patients do not take their medication as instructed (3). Pill fatigue triggered by patients feeling overwhelmed by the amount of drugs they must take is one of the many causes of medical noncompliance (4). Groups with specialized dosage requirements—like children older adults and people with disabilities—are especially susceptible to pill fatigue and other forms of nonadherence because most conventional medications aren’t suited to their needs.

Alternative drug delivery forms such as orally disintegrating tablets (ODTs) and orally disintegrating films (ODFs) give pharmaceutical brands an invaluable opportunity to adapt. With a broader range of treatment options drug makers can address a wider spectrum of clinical needs improve bioavailability reduce toxicity and improve patient compliance.

In terms of large-molecule biologic drugs there is a slow transition away from the traditional parenteral route (intravenous [IV] intramuscular or subcutaneous injections) towards new and exciting delivery strategies. Intensive research is currently underway to overcome the unique challenges posed by biologic APIs and make them suitable for more patient-friendly delivery forms. Intranasal and pulmonary delivery strategies for example are actively being explored for protein and peptide therapeutics in addition to buccal and transdermal administration for vaccines. Most of these alternative drug delivery formulations are still in the preclinical or clinical stages of development but there have been a few examples of licensed products entering the market in recent years.

Avoiding attrition

PTE: How might alternative drug delivery formulation approaches help companies avoid potential attrition during development?

Foo (Roquette Pharma Solutions): While drug attrition has generally decreased over the past 10 years the rate of failure still remains high—almost 90% by some estimates (5).Alternative small-molecule delivery routes offer manufacturers many advantages for increasing drug viability—from the potential to avoid first-pass metabolism to lower doses and fewer side effects—but they also present their own inherent formulation challenges. As with conventional drug formulations these issues can be overcome through the judicious selection of functional excipients and a drug design tailored for commercial success. Cyclodextrins and their derivatives for instance are commonly used in nasal ophthalmic pulmonary and transdermal delivery systems to improve drug solubility permeation and bioavailability as well as the stability of pharmaceutical actives (6).",,,,,,,,,

Dubbed H 2 theFuture the project is among 21 – out of 529 submissions and 60 finalists – to be selected for funding through the 2021 American Rescue Plan competitive grant program. The $1 billion BBB initiative which the U.S. Commerce Department described in its Friday announcement as “the most impactful regional economic development competition in decades” seeks to boost economic recovery and rebuild communities through “transformative investments” in regional industry clusters. The winning Louisiana proposal – led by Greater New Orleans Inc. and its affiliate Greater New Orleans Development Foundation – creates a roadmap for decarbonizing Louisiana’s manufacturing sector while creating new energy jobs.

The federal grant will be supplemented by $24.5 million in matching funds from the State of Louisiana bringing the total project size to $74.5 million.

“Today’s announcement by President Biden and Secretary of Commerce Raimondo is a significant milestone in Louisiana’s transition to a cleaner more sustainable and more diversified energy future” Gov. John Bel Edwards said. “As the first state in the Gulf South to implement a Climate Action Plan Louisiana has demonstrated the vision and leadership required to meet the historic challenge that climate change represents. This infusion of federal and state dollars on top of the nearly $20 billion of private capital investment in Louisiana emissions reduction projects announced in the last two years alone moves us closer to the ultimate goal: net zero carbon emissions by 2050.”

The H 2 theFuture proposal includes safeguards ensuring that business procurement and training opportunities are made available to all stakeholders and communities. The plan also prioritizes protecting legacy energy industry workers through the creation of retraining programs that will convert traditional skill sets to low-carbon processes.

“Since day one President Biden has been laser-focused on ensuring that economic opportunity is delivered to all Americans especially communities that have grappled with decades of disinvestment or suffered economic distress exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic” said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. “As we invest and grow critical industries in the U.S. we want to create industry hubs in diverse communities across the country. These grants will provide critical and historic funding directly to community coalitions to invest in new infrastructure research and development and workforce development programs while creating good-paying jobs supporting workers and prioritizing equity.”

H 2 theFuture would effectively create a new clean energy business model in Louisiana consisting of five interconnected workstreams:

Workforce training (H 2 W) to “upskill” displaced oil and gas workers rural residents and minorities led by the Louisiana Community & Technical College System.

“We are grateful for the vision of the U.S. Department of Commerce and Economic Development Administration that made H 2 theFuture possible” said Michael Hecht CEO & President of Greater New Orleans Inc. “Moreover we want to recognize that this exciting project has come together due to the work and trust of two dozen organizations across South Louisiana and we extend our gratitude to these outstanding partners as well.”

In addition to GNO Inc. the 25-organization coalition that developed the H 2 theFuture blueprint includes south Louisiana’s regional economic development organizations and regional planning commissions; the Port of South Louisiana; four public research universities (LSU ULL UNO and Nicholls State) and four HBCUs (Dillard University Southern University and A&M College in Baton Rouge Southern University of New Orleansand Xavier University of Louisiana); the Louisiana Community and Technical College System representing eight south Louisiana community colleges; and several organizations focused on equity including the Urban League of Louisiana and the Louisiana Parole Project.

“Securing one of the coveted Build Back Better Challenge awards solidifies Louisiana’s status as a global leader in the energy transition and a prime location for renewable energy investment and innovation” LED Secretary Don Pierson said. “An economic development project of this scope and complexity requires an extraordinary level of stakeholder collaboration and cooperation. LED is proud to have played a role in leveraging existing economic partnerships and helping to forge new ones to move our entire state forward.”

Green hydrogen is produced by splitting water (H 2 O) with electrolyzers powered by renewable electricity such as wind; the carbon-free feedstock can then be used to power advanced manufacturing commercial-scale transportation and other energy-intensive processes. A study commissioned by the coalition concluded that H2theFuture could cut in half total emissions produced by hydrogen in Louisiana representing millions of tons of CO 2 that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere.

“Louisiana has a long and proud history of supporting energy production on and off our shores” Louisiana Department of Natural Resources Secretary Thomas Harris said. “This is an opportunity to continue that tradition as we transition to a lower-carbon future and more diversified sources of energy. Both wind and hydrogen are expected to be important tools in Louisiana’s efforts in carbon management in the future.”

WEVER Iowa — When the Iowa Fertilizer Co. opened in 2017 many Iowans were skeptical the production facility in Lee County was worth more than $230 million in state and local incentives.

Five years later owner OCI NV has met all state obligations by building a $3 billion fertilizer plant that employs 265 people full time and contracts with another 50 to 90 for engineering electrical and service functions Plant Director Mickey McHale said.

The multinational company reported $6.3 billion in revenue in 2021 up 82 percent from $3.47 billion in 2020 and is planning for another big year amid shortages in fertilizer imports from abroad.

Crop prices “remain at levels that incentivize farmers globally to maximize yields by using more nitrogen” OCI NV officials said in their 2022 second-quarter report.

An Iowa State University study from earlier this year said there wasn’t sufficient evidence at that time to say fertilizer companies — some of which have seen their net income increase 400 percent in recent years — were price gouging.

But Iowa farmers wonder.

“They say they are pricing it off the global market but yet their cost of production is very low here in the United States” Robb Ewoldt a Scott County farmer and outgoing president of the Iowa Soybean Association said about the fertilizer industry.

“They are making a lot lot of money. It always seems to coincide with when our grain prices go up.”

As droughts and floods cause famine in some parts of the world Iowa farmers say skimping on fertilizer could reduce U.S. food exports.

“Do we cut fertilizer and take reduced yields?” Lance Lillibridge a Benton County farmer and president of the Iowa Corn Growers Association asked at a roundtable discussion with U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst in June at his farm near Vinton. “We’re going to have some hangry people around the globe.”

Iowa Corn Growers reports that more than half of the state’s corn is used in ethanol production.

Impact on Iowa

The fertilizer industry creates more than 32000 jobs in Iowa and pays workers more than $3 billion a year according to the Fertilizer Institute a Virginia-based advocacy group.

There are 31 manufacturing plants in Iowa.

The Iowa Fertilizer Co. is the largest new plant built in the United States in 30 years officials said. The compound of shiny metal tubes towers and tanks rises among corn and soybean fields just east of Highway 61 seven miles north of Fort Madison.

“It’s really beneficial for the farmers where we put this” Charles Ireland plant operations manager said during a tour this past month. “We are surrounded by thousands of acres of farm fields.”

CF Industries with nine manufacturing sites in the United States Canada and the United Kingdom completed a $2 billion expansion of a facility near Sergeant Bluff in 2016 the Sioux City Journal reported.

OCI NV which changed its name from Orascom in 2013 started out as a family-owned construction company in Egypt according to its website. The company bought its first fertilizer plant in 2005 and now has plants in the United States the Netherlands United Arab Emirates Egypt and Algeria.

When Iowa signed a deal with Orascom in 2012 to build the Wever plant farm groups predicted having a large supplier in state would reduce fertilizer costs for Iowa farmers.

Other groups blasted the incentive package one of the richest in state history and on a per-job basis the Associated Press reported. Iowa paid the company $107 million over two years while Lee County offered $133 million in local tax abatement over 20 years.

The Iowa Fertilizer Co. agreed to make predetermined payments to Lee County instead of paying property taxes and also pays a replacement tax on natural gas used at the plant said Dennis Fraise president and CEO of Lee County Economic Development.

“They’ve been a great corporate citizen” he said. “They’re very generous with their time and dollars they spread around the community.”

Production levels

The Iowa Fertilizer Co. combines nitrogen from the air with hydrogen from natural gas at high pressure and temperature to produce ammonia which binds the nitrogen to make fertilizer.

When the plant opened in 2017 owners said they planned to produce up to 2 million metric tons of fertilizer a year.

The company’s total fertilizer output last year included 1.2 million tons of urea ammonium nitrate and 700000 tons of anhydrous ammonia McHale said. Most of that fertilizer is sold in the Midwest.

The plant also made 700000 tons of diesel exhaust fluid or DEF which is added to diesel gas to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Russia’s war on Ukraine has strangled fertilizer production and delivery worldwide but there are other challenges including countries hoarding fertilizer and increases in the price of natural gas especially in Europe the Washingon Post reported.

Profits expected to rise

OCI NV is poised to make money during this rocky period the company noted in its 2022 second-quarter report.

“The outlook for the fundamentals of our nitrogen end markets continues to be underpinned by tight supply healthy farm economics and decades low grain stocks globally that incentivize the use of nitrogen fertilizers” the report states.

Some European producers can’t get enough ammonia to increase production but OCI NV can import ammonia from its facilities in North Africa and the United States.

Natural disasters and COVID-19 have slowed natural gas production in some parts of the world raising the cost of this core ingredient for fertilizer production. But OCI NV says it has “favorable gas supply agreements” through a subsidiary in the United Arab Emirates.

“With less than 10 percent of our natural gas supply exposed to market fluctuations in Europe we have further enhanced our cost resiliency” the report says.

Some U.S. fertilizer plants have sought to increase production here. Koch Fertilizer in February finished a $150 million upgrade in Oklahoma designed to increase production capacity the Enid News and Eagle reported.

The Iowa Fertilizer Co. which already operates around the clock has not added production capacity McHale said.

“It’s not like you can flip the switch and automatically make more” McHale said. “We’ll focus on the bottlenecks to get the most material through the process as possible.”

Farmers pay more

Fertilizer sales in Iowa for the year that ended June 30 2021 were 4.65 million metric tons — the highest level since 2014 according to data from the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship.

“We were able to purchase our fertilizer before it really really went up because we purchased it all in August or September 2021” said Ewoldt the Iowa Soybean Association president who grows corn soybeans and some alfalfa.

“We typically would not have bought that early but we needed to protect ourselves.”

Ewoldt saw his fertilizer costs go up 30 percent between the 2021 planting season and 2022. He expects a similar jump when he buys fertilizer for next season.

Farmers are getting more money for their crops. The average price per bushel of corn in June was $7.48 up from $6.19 per bushel a year ago ISU Extension reported. Soybeans were selling for an average price of $16.20 a bushel up from $14.70 in June 2021.

But fertilizer prices are outpacing commodity prices.

‘More questions than answers’

Iowa State’s June study found that while the price Iowa farmers are getting for their crops has roughly doubled since 2020 fertilizer prices are two to four times higher in that same span.

Factors include the cost of importing ingredients such as ammonia phosphate rock and potash from other parts of the world. Natural disasters the pandemic trade disputes with China and the war in Ukraine have made it more expensive to import these inputs the report found.

“Statistical analyses of these structural changes point to underlying energy costs and to a lesser extent farm demand having more influence on fertilizer prices” ISU concluded.

Last fall the U.S. International Trade Commission imposed a tariff on imported phosphate fertilizer at the request of the Mosaic Co. one of the nation’s largest fertilizer companies causing prices to rise Successful Farming reported.

Mosaic’s net income went up 484 percent from 2018-19 to 2020-21 ISU reported.

“The argument that fertilizer firms may be taking advantage of inflation to raise prices raises more questions than answers at this point” ISU researchers said. “Nevertheless they are good questions for which we need more data.”

Chad Hart an ISU economics professor and one of the study’s authors said the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s most recent fertilizer price report released Aug. 23 shows prices have come down slightly.

Pipelines OCI NV wants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its plants seeking a 20 percent cut in “intensity” of operations — measured by the amount of carbon dioxide produced for each ton of fertilizer — by 2030 the company’s 2021 annual report said. To work toward that environmental goal the Iowa Fertilizer Co. has signed on with the proposed Navigator CO2 pipeline which would collect up to 1.13 million metric tons of CO2 each year from the Wever plant and transport it to an underground sequestration site in Illinois. The Navigator project is one of three pipelines proposed to crisscross the state taking advantage of federal tax credits for carbon capture and storage. The Iowa Fertilizer Co. also hopes to be connected to a 14-mile NuStar anhydrous ammonia pipeline proposed for Lee County the Pen City Current reported.

Pig farmers soft drink producers brewers and bakeries are also being hit by the increase in the cost of the gas which is used to stun animals before slaughter as well as in packaging and as an ingredient.

Ranjit Singh Boparan who owns 2 Sisters Food Group and the turkey processor Bernard Matthews called on the government to take rapid action and consider price capping the CO 2 market to ensure supply as the price rise would add £1m a week to his businesses’ costs.

He said the UK required 2000 tonnes of CO 2 a day with CF Industries’ fertiliser plant in Billingham and the Ensus ethanol plant in Wilton both of which are temporarily closing accounting for 1300 tonnes while just 600 tonnes could be imported.

CF said it was closing its plant because the price of natural gas which is used to make fertiliser was now twice as high as a year ago making it uneconomic to produce ammonia the fertiliser which has food-grade CO 2 as a by-product. The Ensus plant is closing for maintenance.

Boparan said: “This is a very serious situation we are facing. Once again UK food security is under threat and the shopper ultimately loses – we simply have no choice other than to pay to keep supply. CO 2 suppliers are saying these increases happen immediately. They say it’s a take it or leave it situation.”

Industry insiders said prices had risen to as much as £4500 a tonne up from about £1000 last week and just £200 last year as two major suppliers temporarily close their facilities maintenance. That comes after a third site prepares for permanent closure having temporarily shut in September last year.

The costs surge is likely to add to pressure on food prices which rose by more than 9% last month according to the latest data from the British Retail Consortium.

The resumption of grain exports from Ukraine prompted a fall in global food prices in August from the all time highs of earlier this year but prices remain almost 8% higher than a year ago. Global cereal demand is expected to outstrip supplies partly as a result of hot dry weather in Europe which together with the war in Ukraine has hit maize production.

Boparan said his company had no choice but to pay the new price of CO 2 : “When poultry cannot be processed it means birds must be kept on farms where there is a potential implication for animal welfare. The overall effect is welfare is compromised and there is a reduced supply.”

He added: “What is very sad is that it’s the UK shopper who will ultimately pay the price and CO 2 suppliers are in effect holding consumers hostage.”

Nick Allen the chief executive of the British Meat Processors Association said his members were “looking at a difficult month to six weeks” while the plants producing CO 2 were closed. “Price increases on this scale will really hit them hard” he said.

Abattoirs and hospitals will have priority of supply but those producing drinks may struggle to find a key ingredient when they are already struggling with higher energy bills and labour costs.

Gavin Partington director general of the British Soft Drinks Association said the price rise was a “cause for concern” although CO 2 made up only a small percentage of costs for drinks makers. He said the industry required “more than a temporary fix”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNjb3R0aXNoZmFybWVyLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvMjA4OTIyNzYuam9obi1zbGVpZ2gtb3V0bGluZXMtbmV3cy1zZWN0aW9ucy13ZWVrcy1pc3N1ZS0zcmQtc2VwdGVtYmVyLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Sleigh outlines what's in the news sections of this week's issue (3rd September 2022),"As a subscriber you are shown 80% less display advertising when reading our articles.

The Bruins trailed 17-7 early in the second quarter before scoring 38 straight points to win their opener for the second straight year.

Thompson-Robinson completed 32 of 43 passes for 298 yards and two touchdowns along with rushing for 87 yards and two scores. The fifth-year senior supplied an early highlight with a career-long 68-yard TD run during the first quarter to tie the game at seven.

Bowling Green brought a nickel blitz on third-and-3 but the fifth-year senior escaped pressure from Davon Ferguson in the backfield scrambled right went down the sideline and then cut across the field including escaping another diving tackle attempt from a Falcons defender at the BG 34 before going into the end zone.

Charbonnet posted his eighth 100-yard rushing game since transferring from Michigan last year. The Bruins rushed for 264 yards improving to 16-4 when that has happened since Chip Kelly became coach in 2018.

UCLA scored 17 straight points in the second quarter to take a 24-17 lead at halftime. Keegan Jones supplied the go-ahead score when he caught a screen pass from Thompson-Robinson and went 52 yards up the left sideline.

NOT A FUN HOMECOMING

Bowling Green quarterback Matt McDonald who grew up in Newport Beach was 17 of 34 for 125 yards. He did give the Falcons a fleeting 17-7 advantage early in the second quarter with a 22-yard touchdown pass to tight end Christian Sims.

SPECIAL START

Bowling Green got its first 10 points courtesy of its special teams coming up with big plays. After UCLA went three-and-out on its opening drive Falcons' running back PaSean Wimberly blocked Nicholas Barr-Mira's punt at the UCLA 11. Charles Rosser picked up the loose ball and returned it for a touchdown to give BG a 7-0 advantage 74 seconds into the game.

It was the first time since 2014 the Falcons have returned a blocked punt for a touchdown

Later in the first quarter Patrick Day recovered a muffed punt by UCLA's Jake Bobo at the 11. Four plays later Mason Lawler made a 24-yard field goal to put the Falcons up 10-7.

RECORD LOW

The late-morning start and 100 degrees at kickoff drew an announced crowd of 27143 the lowest for a UCLA game since the Bruins moved to the Rose Bowl in 1982. The previous low was 32513 against Oregon State in 1992.

Another factor for the low crowd was students don't report to UCLA's campus until later this month.

THE TAKEAWAY

Bowling Green: The Falcons were hoping to upset a Power Five team on the road for the second straight year but were held to 37 yards rushing and averaged only 2.7 yards per offensive play.

UCLA: Kelly will not be pleased with the Bruins' special teams play. Barr-Mira was 1 of 3 on field goals and missed a chip-shot attempt in the second half.

Roberto Robinson told CBS News senior investigative correspondent Catherine Herridge that Judge Bruce Reinhart's address was posted online —a tactic called doxing — and his teams are ""on it.""

""Threats are real"" Robinson said. ""People really have intent to harm folks and they will carry it out.""

Asked if there was a risk of real harm to Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanagh after an alleged murder plot was disrupted earlier this year Robinson said ""Without a shadow of a doubt. We're thankful that we were in a strategic location in which we were able to stop anything before it before it happened. But absolutely there was a real threat yes.""

Investigators say credible online threats targeting federal authorities have surged since the FBI's search for sensitive government documents at former President Donald Trump's Florida residence last month.

""We're seeing a major uptick in threats"" said a cyber threat investigator named Simon who asked CBS News not to use his last name for security purposes. ""Any public figure is a viable target for these people and it knows no political affiliation.""

U.S. Marshals say the number of online threats targeting authorities had already been consistently rising since last year when they saw 4500 reported threats against federal judges. And according to law enforcement the January 6 Capitol riot in 2021 and the Supreme Court decision on abortion rights this year have also contributed to nationwide tensions.

Simon said he believes the Mar-a-Lago search was a tipping point.

""There's a very real risk of law enforcement officers being hurt or killed as a result of these threats"" he said.

He and his team at the Washington-based research group Memri produced a 90-page report tracking the online threats. Some of the threats refer to the FBI as scum say officials will die for treason and express the need for agencies to be ""cleansed"" and ""eliminated.""

""We're seeing threats like this on a daily or hourly basis"" Simon said.

Within days of the Mar-a-Lago search 42-year-old Ricky Shiffer attempted to breach the FBI field office in Cincinnati Ohio wearing body armor and carrying an AR-15 style rifle before being killed following an hours-long standoff with police.

Simon says the attempted breach could be a new normal. ""I think it's moving in that direction"" he said.

Robinson whose team protects more than 2700 federal judges said the U.S. Marshals Service is ""doing the best we can with what we have now"" to protect federal judges.

But he added ""We are pretty thin right now. We are trying to get academy classes through so we can bring on more deputy marshals. But we could definitely use more help for sure.""

Congress considered increasing funding to pay for more deputy marshals after the son of federal Judge Esther Salas was murdered at her New Jersey home in July of 2020 but the bill has not passed.",,,,,,,,,

Shares have lost about 10.7% in that time frame underperforming the S&P 500.

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release or is Charles River due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.

Charles River Q2 Earnings Beat Estimates Reduces View

Charles River Laboratories reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.77 for second-quarter 2022 reflecting a 6.1% improvement from the year-ago earnings. The metric surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.1%.

In the quarter higher revenue and operating margin improvement were partially offset by higher interest expense and tax rate.



On a GAAP basis earnings surged 23.8% year over year to $2.13.

Revenues

Revenues in the second quarter totaled $973.1 million missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.5%. However the top line improved 6.4% from the year-ago number (up 9.5% organically excluding the impact of acquisition divestiture and foreign currency translation).

Segment in Detail

Charles River’s second-quarter total Research Models and Services (RMS) revenues of $186.4 million were up 5.5% year over year (up 8.5% organically). Organic revenue growth was driven by growth in research model services particularly Insourcing Solutions (IS) and Genetically Engineered Models and Services (GEMS) business.

Discovery and Safety Assessment (DSA) revenues of $591.9 million rose 9.6% (up 12.9% organically). Organic revenue growth was mainly driven by strong contributions from Safety Assessment businessesand Discovery Services businesses.

Manufacturing Solutions revenues totaled $194.8 million down 1.5% year over year (up 1% organically). Organic revenue growth was fueled by higher revenues in the Biologics Testing and Microbial Solutions businesses effectively offset by a revenue decline in the CDMO business.

Margins

The gross profit in the reported quarter was $356.7 million up 4.3% from the prior-year quarter. The gross margin of 36.7% contracted 74 basis points (bps) year over year.

Meanwhile selling general & administrative expenses declined 23.2% to $131.7 million.

Adjusted operating income totaled $225 million reflecting a 31.9% rise from the prior-year quarter. The adjusted operating margin in the second quarter expanded 448 bps to 23.1%.

Liquidity and Cash Position

Charles River exited the second quarter of 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $200.3 million compared with $241.9 million at the end of Q1.

Story continues

Cumulative net cash provided by operating activities at the end of the second quarter was $252.1 million compared with the prior-year quarter’s $356.8 million.

2022 Guidance Update

The company has reduced its 2022 guidance.

For 2022 revenues are now expected to grow in the band of 9-11% on a reported basis (a significant slash from the earlier guidance of 13.5-15.5%). Organic revenue growth is now expected in the range of 10-12% (12.5%-14.5% previously). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $4.02 billion indicating a 13.5% rise from 2021.

Adjusted earnings per share for 2022 is expected in the range of $10.70-$10.95 ($11.50-$11.75 expected previously). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $11.50.

How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?

In the past month investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.

The consensus estimate has shifted -11.24% due to these changes.

VGM Scores

At this time Charles River has an average Growth Score of C though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.

Overall the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy this score is the one you should be interested in.

Outlook

Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably Charles River has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

UBS announced the deal for Wealthfront in January as a way to tap into a pool of mass affluent and next-generation investors. The Swiss bank will instead be providing almost $70 million in financing for Wealthfront at the same $1.4 billion valuation.

“I am incredibly excited about Wealthfront’s path forward as an independent company” Wealthfront Chief Executive David Fortunato said in an announcement.

A spokesman for UBS did not immediately return a request for additional comment. UBS Group Chief Executive Ralph Hamers on the company’s July earnings call said the deal was still on course.

“UBS remains committed to its growth plans in the US and will continue the build-out of its digital wealth management offering” the company said in a separate statement late Friday about the abrupt halt of the deal.

The Swiss bank in July named Naureen Hassan a veteran wealth executive who worked on digital advice at Charles Schwab Corp. and Morgan Stanley to be president of UBS Americas effective October 3.

“We have an ambitious plan for the U.S.” Hamers said at the time. “Not only for the digital proposition but also to support the financial advisors as crucial and Naureen brings that experience.”

The company’s second quarter earnings fell short of analyst expectations a period that Hamers called one of the “most challenging” for investors in a decade.

UBS Wealth USA had its own digital advice offering through SigFig Wealth Management. Executives had said the Wealthfront deal would compliment its retirement services and corporate stock plan business offerings in the U.S.

UBS’s Wall Street competitors have been pushing into the self-directed market including Morgan Stanley with its 2020 purchase of E*Trade Financial and Merrill Lynch with its consumer-bank based Merrill Edge unit. JPMorgan Chase is rolling out a call center-based advice offering for customers with at least $25000.

Wealthfront had around $27 billion in assets under management and 470000 clients at the time the deal was announced. It said in the statement on Friday that it expects to be “cash flow positive” and profitable in the next few months.

A new report out Friday from Fox News confirmed that not only did they donate to his primary political foil they fled the state entirely in the early part of the COVID pandemic.

According to the report the parents of Newsom's wife purchased a house in Naples Florida in 2020:

""Kenneth F. Siebel Jr. and Judith A. Siebel parents of Newsom's wife Jennifer Siebel and longtime California residents became Florida residents in 2020 after purchasing a $3.3 million Naples home in March of that year records show.""

While they still appear to have a home in California they registered to vote in Florida signaling their intention to live there the majority of the time.

Gavin Newsome Has Been Brutal

Gavin Newsom's mismanagement of the state as well as the brutal lockdowns school closures and mask mandates he enforced have caused huge numbers of residents and massive amounts of household wealth to flee elsewhere in the past few years.

Far from acknowledging the multitude of problems he and his left wing predecessors have created Newsom has chosen to attack other states instead.

He previously donated $100000 to DeSantis's gubernatorial challenger and ran hilariously inaccurate ads in Florida begging former Californians to return.

No one seems to be listening as the state lost hundreds of thousands of people over the past few years.

For example in just one year from July 2020 to July 2021 the state lost 262000 residents nearly all of them to domestic migration according to the LA Times. That was the first year of population loss in the state's history.

Some of those people include Gavin Newsom's own extended family who also appear to realize what a disastrous job he's done.

Don't worry though with his actions it's becoming more and more clear that Newsom intends to try and take his version of failure to the White House replacing the ever angrier Joe Biden on the 2024 ticket.

It'll be interesting to see who his in-laws support then. Based on how they've voted with their feet so far it probably won't be Gavin Newsom.",,,

Network Buildout is Part of Spectrum’s $5 Billion Multiyear Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF) Investment in Rural Broadband

BEAUMONT Texas — Spectrum today announced the launch of Spectrum Internet Mobile TV and Voice services to more than 2670 homes and small businesses in rural Jefferson County Texas.

Spectrum’s newly constructed fiber-optic network buildout is part of the company’s approximately $5 billion investment in unserved rural communities which includes $1.2 billion won in the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) RDOF auction. The company’s RDOF expansion will provide broadband access to approximately 1 million customer locations as estimated by the FCC across

24 states in the coming years.

“Today’s announcement is great news for residents in Jefferson County who lacked a broadband connection at home until now” said Speaker of the House Dade Phelan (TX-76). “Spectrum’s high-speed broadband will bring economic opportunity to this community.”

Spectrum Internet Gig with download speeds of 1 Gbps is now available throughout the buildout area. Spectrum Internet offers starting speeds of 300 Mbps with Spectrum Internet Ultra providing download speeds of 500 Mbps. For small and medium-sized businesses Spectrum Business Internet offers download speeds of 300 Mbps 600 Mbps and 1 Gbps. Local residents and business owners should visit spectrumruralexpansion.com to learn more about when their home or business may be able to receive Spectrum services.

“Through RDOF Spectrum is making a multiyear investment to extend gigabit broadband networks to unserved communities across America” said Abe Robinson Vice President of Construction leading Spectrum’s New Mexico Texas and Louisiana RDOF expansions. “Our commitment is making it possible to deliver the high-value broadband mobile TV and voice services now available in rural Jefferson County. We are providing superior connectivity to local residents and small businesses at highly competitive prices backed by an organization committed to craftsmanship and service.”

Ranked by U.S. News & World Report as the Best Internet Service Provider for Rural Areas in its 2021-22 ratings Spectrum Internet also exceeded advertised download and upload speeds for all tiers measured — even during peak weeknight usage between 7 and 11 p.m. — according to the FCC’s most recent “Measuring Broadband America Fixed Broadband Report” issued in December 2021. And all Spectrum Internet plans have no data caps modem fees or contracts.

“Ensuring our rural communities in Jefferson County have reliable high-speed internet is critical” said U.S. Rep. Randy Weber Sr. (TX-14). “Charter’s network expansion through the FCC’s Rural Digital Opportunity Fund is a step in the right direction to ensure families and small businesses have access to reliable broadband they need to live work and thrive.”

Spectrum’s Robinson credited Jefferson County officials and Entergy for enabling a prompt RDOF deployment.

“Permitting processes and access to local utility poles are key to bringing these RDOF projects to fruition” Robinson said. “Entergy moved quickly to help us access their poles and install new infrastructure and local government representatives helped us navigate the necessary permitting procedures so we were able to start work without delay. Everyone’s cooperation made it possible for Jefferson County residents to begin enjoying improved broadband services at a much quicker pace.”

Grant totals for individual winners were not provided in the announcement. However the state said the $206 million will help connect nearly 85000 households and over 2000 businesses across 69 counties. North Carolina previously awarded $23.4 million in GREAT grants in July and another $30.8 million in early August. To date it has doled out more than $260 million of the $350 million in funding available through the program.

“We are excited to be awarding this unprecedented amount of funding to bring high-speed internet access to such a large number of residents and businesses across the state” N.C. Department of Information Technology Secretary Jim Weaver said in a statement. “These funds will go a long way in closing the digital divide by bringing equitable access to both rural and urban communities.”

Brightspeed (which applied as Connect Holding) came away from the latest round with grants in the most counties securing funding in 29 total. It previously won funding in one other county in July meaning it has received grants in 30 of North Carolina’s 100 counties.

The operator is set to take over Lumen Technologies’ ILEC assets in 20 states later this year and in June announced plans to run fiber to 300000 new locations in North Carolina by the end of 2023.

Commenting on this week's awards a Brightspeed representative told Fierce the money will ""allow us to cover an additional 38000 connections across the state. As we move closer to day one operations these partnerships with local counties will play an important role in our efforts to expand broadband availability and provide fast reliable internet and WiFi for families and businesses within our operating footprint.""

Related Charter wins 3 more broadband grants in North Carolina

Charter’s latest wins included grants for Haywood Jackson Jones Lee McDowell Pamlico Richmond Rutherford Scotland Wake and Warren counties. The operator was previously awarded grants for Anson Cabarrus and Polk counties in early August and Avery Bertie Cleveland Gaston Lincoln and New Hanover counties in July. All told it has scored grants for 20 counties.

A Charter representative told Fierce the grants it won this week total more than $33.2 million. It received the largest awards in McDowell Richmond and Rutherford winning $4 million in state funding in each county. The money will help it connect approximately 11900 locations across the 11 counties. The largest portion of those will be in Rutherford where the funding will go toward broadband for 2915 homes and businesses.

Other winners in this week’s funding round included Frontier Communications in three counties Lumos in two counties and Altice USA (which applied as Cebridge Acquisition) in one county. Lumos’ GREAT grants total more than $7 million and will help the operator cover more than 2600 locations across Alamance and Randolph counties.

Durham School Services the district’s bus contractor was four drivers short of the 125 drivers needed to cover the district’s planned 125 routes according to a memo from the district’s Transportation Supervisor Zachary Nicotera to school board members following his meeting with Durham officials on Tuesday.

But Durham has five drivers who may be ready to hit the road on the first day or soon after and it’s bringing two drivers in from the Schenectady area where the company has extra drivers the memo said. And the company should have enough drivers for all 125 routes within the first few weeks of school officials have said.

“All schools are routed” said Edward Flavin vice president of external communications for National Express Durham’s parent company. “We are making minor adjustments to a few routes to cover all routes assigned until the last few positions are filled. We don’t expect any routes to go uncovered or operate anywhere near last year.”

That’s a big change from last year when Durham started out in September with only 62 drivers a local manifestation of a national school bus driver shortage. The company never got a full contingent of drivers during the 2021-22 school year its first year of operation in Utica. As a result many students arrived late for schools others got picked up late after school and some were left standing at their bus stops.

2021-22 school year:Bus company: Driver shortages leading to Utica school bus delays threats from parents

2021-22 school year:Utica school buses still running late but company still says it expects progress

The Utica Academy of Science Charter School pushed back its start time which was too early for buses that dropped off Utica city school students first. But students still frequently arrived late ― often considerably late ― throughout the year staff said.

But Hanka Grabovica regional student affairs officer said communication and cooperation with the district is better this year.

“As of now everything looks good and the way it should be” she said. “All of our students received a bus schedule of picking and dropping them off. Now we just have to wait and see how everything will work out.” School board members questioned Durham officials following a presentation on the driver situation at the board’s August meeting. “I’m very concerned” Vice President Donald Dawes said “about kids being on a corner somewhere and not being picked up. … I was waiting all last year to hear that everyone was being picked up and I’m still waiting.”

“We’re getting very close” Brett Wester regional manager told him “to a good position. … Where we’re at is manageable.”

School bus driver positions consistently difficult to fill

Districts across the state have been struggling to fill all kinds of positions within their schools this summer but bus drivers and substitute teachers have consistently been the hardest to fill according to the New York State Council of School Superintendents. Yet Durham has significantly increased its numbers.

Although the company is still a few drivers short officials think they’ll have enough drivers on the first day of school to pick up students on time and more drivers after the first week or two of school Other details of plans include:

The district and the company will pool staff to make sure that all routes and after-school sports meets have drivers.

“Mop-up” buses stationed around Utica will pick up any students who get missed for some reason.

Durham has several drivers expected to be cleared any day: one who took the road test on Tuesday two waiting for medical clearance and two full licensed drivers who recently applied.

The district has been able to remove 113 students from bus routes because their parents have promised to drive them.

Newly elected board member James Paul is optimistic based on Durham’s work to recruit train and license drivers its cooperation with the district’s transportation department and its monthly updates to the board.

“I believe” he said “that our students and families will see a substantial improvement in our transportation department.”

And the situation should keep getting better Durham officials stressed. Another eight to 10 drivers should be ready for the road in the next week or two Flavin said. Another 27 drivers are somewhere in the training pipeline Wester said.

The company is also still hiring to make sure it has enough substitutes and drivers for extracurricular activities.

Durham has made several changes this year that have helped it hire and retain more drivers Flavin said such as a 12.1 percent wage increase referral bonuses of between $500 and $1000 extensive advertising and publicity and a streamlined process for recruiting and training workers.

And the local Department of Motor Vehicles offices have stepped up he said to make sure candidates can get permitted and tested in a reasonable timeframe.

When Durham won the contract for the Utica schools one selling point was an app that lets parents track their child’s bus in real time. But with all the driver difficulties last year the app didn’t work.

But Durham plans on starting up its Bus Tracker app to show parents their children’s bus’ estimated time of arrival once all the routes are firmly set hopefully in October Flavin said.

The app will also help the company let parents know about any busing issues he said.

U.S. operators have shown restraint but according to World Oil’s mid-year forecast a further activity increase is in the offing.

The war in Ukraine has limited Russian oil and gas supplies and has the potential to cause a major shift in the world’s energy market. No one knows how long Russia intends to wage war in Ukraine or how much of its crude will be affected by sanctions or for how long. The uncertainty caused by the supply disruption has driven crude prices to multi-year highs. And anxieties persist that surging oil prices may rise so high that demand destruction will damage the global economy and cause a worldwide recession. However Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is creating a new market for U.S. LNG producers as product flows to Europe to replace Russian natural gas. The longer the conflict persists the more entrenched U.S. LNG will become.

ESG impact. Although the U.S. petroleum industry faces continued pressure from President Biden and environmental groups about the imperative of reducing fossil fuel usage to slow GHG emissions the drive for rapid implementation has lessened. However the transition to renewables and clean energy alternatives has created an unprecedented reduction of investment in hydrocarbon-based energy in favor of developing green resources. During 2021 global oil and gas discoveries hit their lowest level in 75 years. Total global discovered volumes in 2021 were calculated at 4.7 Bboe the lowest tally since 1946. This trend is predicted to continue in 2022. A data-based comparison shows a significant reduction in recoverable oil resources that will drive commodity prices higher and further damage global energy security.

U.S. production surges. Despite a sizeable drop in recoverable resources U.S. oil production remains on track for a record in 2023 even as output grows more slowly than anticipated amid increased costs and labor shortages in America’s shale fields. Output is expected to expand at an average 840000 bopd next year down from a prior forecast of 860000 bopd according to the EIA. While production is still seen reaching an all-time high in 2023 the government revised its forecast slightly lower to 12.7 MMbopd. The current annual U.S. record average is 12.3 MMbopd set in 2019.

At the start of the year production in the U.S. (11.7 MMbopd) Saudi Arabia (10.2 MMbopd) and Russia (11.0 MMbopd) was running at nearly full capacity. Brent and WTI were trading at $86.51/bbl and $83.22 respectively. When Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 2022 the EU and international community reacted quickly by boycotting Russian supply. The embargo quickly pushed prices up and in June Brent was trading for $122.71/bbl and WTI hit $114.84/bbl the highest price since August 2008. Prices retreated in July down to $111.93/bbl for Brent and $101.62/bbl for WTI due to rising interest rates and fear of economic recession despite restricted Russian supply.

Demand to lessen. The global surge in the cost of fuel is starting to weigh on demand according to Vitol Group the world’s largest independent oil trader. Consumers are being impacted by the run-up in gasoline diesel and other oil products said Mike Muller head of Vitol Asia. There is clear evidence of economic stress being caused by high oil and natural gas prices according to Muller.

MACRO U.S. PICTURE

The Baker Hughes rotary rig count stood at 588 units during the week ending Jan. 7 2022. U.S. drilling activity climbed steadily for the next seven months although it slowed in July and August reaching 760 in the week ending Sept. 2 Fig. 1. Although the 172-rig increase represents a Jan.-Sept. increase of 29% U.S. shale operators have resisted ramping-up drilling activity and remained relatively disciplined with their capital expenditures. The speed at which new rigs have been deployed to the field is considerably less than in previous up-price cycles. Most U.S. shale companies are still being conservative as priorities remain focused on protecting balance sheets and generating free cash flow.

This conservative approach along with high oil prices has enabled shale companies to reduce their debt burdens in the second quarter signaling room for them to pay dividends buy back shares or make acquisitions. A metric commonly used to measure companies’ ability to pay down their borrowings has widely improved among oil and gas producers as they repurchase some bonds and pile up cash amid ballooning profits.

Net debt reported by a group of independent operators including ConocoPhillips and Pioneer Natural Resources averaged less than 0.6 times their annual earnings before items such as interest and taxes in the second quarter down from 1.7 times a year earlier. Many companies have reached their debt target. Energy companies have made great strides toward repairing and reinforcing their balance sheets and are in a much stronger position to handle another downturn in commodity prices.

With WTI trading between $85/bbl and $95/bbl U.S. shale producers are on course to generate $200 billion this year enough to make the industry debt-free by 2024 and potentially fund a pivot toward more natural gas production (Deloitte). High oil prices and disciplined capital spending mean U.S. shale producers are on track for their most profitable year on record part of a global trend that will see the oil and gas industry generate a record $1.4 trillion of free cash flow. After paying down debt and rewarding shareholders U.S. producers will likely focus more on natural gas production due to high demand and prices around the world. Producers will also make record profits from U.S. LNG operations. They are expected to generate $59 billion this year double last year’s amount and easily recouping the $45 billion of losses from 2013 to 2020.

OVERALL U.S. FORECAST

Due to sustained higher oil prices World Oil forecasts a noticeable uptick in drilling activity for the remainder of the year projecting 18600 total wells for 2022—a 34% increase from the 2021 count of 13877 Table 1. Total footage is projected to increase from 191.5 MMft in 2021 to 256.4 MMft in 2022—an increase of 34%. During 2022 8769 wells are estimated to have been drilled during the first six months while 9831 are expected to spud in the second half of the year for a half-to-half increase of 12.1%. A 14.9% increase in footage is expected in the last six months.

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS

Oil prices have been rising since the start of 2021 bolstered by restricted Russian supplies and recovering demand. However upstream M&A activity which typically follows oil prices remains well below pre-pandemic levels. The total count and value of U.S. upstream deals during the first eight months of 2021 were down 30% and 46% respectively from the same period in 2019.

While the ongoing capital discipline of operating companies is the primary reason behind the slowdown in upstream M&A activity limited visibility of buyers into the carbon profile of sellers’ assets is a growing factor. Companies pursuing their net-zero goals are either looking to acquire low-carbon-intensity barrels or divest the high-intensity ones implying that there might be an acreage consolidation or portfolio restructuring on the horizon (Deloitte). But a large resource size and an attractive offering price may not be enough to elicit a response from a buyer focused on meeting its net-zero targets. Therefore M&A activities would need not only to be financially accretive but also to support ESG goals.

Devon Energy agreed to acquire Validus Energy for $1.8 billion in cash to expand in the Eagle Ford shale play in South Texas. The deal will add to Devon’s cash flow and earnings in the first year and boost its variable dividend by up to 10% based on current oil futures prices. Devon also said the transaction will enable the acceleration of the return of cash to investors via its existing $2 billion stock buyback program. Buying Validus will add 42000 net acres adjacent to Devon’s existing leasehold in the Eagle Ford. Validus’s production is approximately 35000 boed with volumes expected to increase to 40000 boed over the next year.

EQT to buy Marcellus assets. EQT Corp the largest U.S. natural gas producer agreed to acquire THQ Appalachia a privately held company in a $5.2 billion deal to expand holdings in the Marcellus shale. The company purchased the assets from Alta Resources for $2.9 billion. It also acquired Chevron’s assets in Appalachia for $735 million in 2020. THQ Appalachia produces nearly 800 MMcfgd in West Virginia. The company has about 11 years of inventory at maintenance capital levels. EQT is expected to produce the equivalent of 5.5 Bcfd this year.

OFS COSTS ARE UP

Heading into 2022 most operators expected pricing to increase for nearly all service lines but seismic. Labor tubulars fracturing/stimulation and transportation were the areas of greatest concern. A modest 15% expected pricing to remain stable including nearly 39% for completion equipment 35% for other services and 33% for drilling. Further pricing concessions were expected by a modest few for seismic services and tubulars.

Further pricing increases are expected in the second half of 2022 with limited availability of OCTG and casing potentially curtailing spending revisions. Overall spending in OFS is expected to remain about 25% below 2019 levels until 2025. With margins at the mercy of another price cycle and reduced spending many OFS companies are crafting a new strategy for the future of energy. With a broadening decarbonization mandate across industries companies have an opportunity to lead the way for customers by fully re-engineering traditional OFS business models and solutions outside the traditional oilfield services and to other industries.

Many large service providers have diversified beyond core services. One large company has restructured its business by launching cloud and edge computing services whose rate of growth is expected to outpace that of their O&G business in a few years. Similarly Halliburton and Baker Hughes are partnering with start-ups and academic institutions through their Halliburton Labs and Baker Hughes Energy Innovation Center respectively to accelerate technology development for diverse energy and industrial applications.

However digitalization will only help to a certain extent. Providing integrated solutions for decarbonizing upstream projects implementing subscription-based revenue models or diversifying into the low-carbon space such as hydrogen and CCUS are key to future growth.

LEASING DECLINES

The number of licensed blocks and total acreage fell to near all-time lows as the sector struggles to shake off the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing oil market crash (Rystad). Only 21 leasing rounds were completed globally through August this year half of the 42 rounds held in the first eight months of 2021. The acreage awarded so far this year has shrunk to a 20-year low of 320000 km2. Global leasing rounds are expected to total 44 this year 14 less than in 2021 and the lowest level since 2000.

Global spending on exploration has been falling in recent years as oil and gas companies seek to limit risk by focusing on core producing assets and regions with guaranteed output aiming to streamline their operations and build a more resilient business amid market uncertainty and the threat of a recession. The political landscape is also contributing to the decrease in license awards with many governments pausing or halting leases and encouraging companies to wrap up exploration activity within already awarded blocks. This trend is likely to continue as governments are less eager to invest in fossil fuel production and instead look ahead to a net zero future.

The onshore exploration sector is a significant contributor to the decline in awarded acreage. Total onshore acreage awarded in leasing activity has plummeted from more than 560000 km2 in 2019 to a mere 115000 km2 so far this year. Offshore leased acreage hit a high point in 2019 before dropping off a cliff in 2020 and has remained relatively flat in the past two years. Concluded leasing rounds have dropped significantly in the U.S. driven primarily by the cancellation of Lease Sales 259 and 261 in the Gulf of Mexico and Cook Inlet in Alaska.

EMPLOYMENT

Employment in the U.S. oilfield services and equipment sector rose by an estimated 6865 jobs to 648914 in August according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and analysis by the Energy Workforce & Technology Council. Gains in August make OFS employment the highest since the Covid-19 pandemic began but they are still off the pre-pandemic mark in February 2020 of 706528. Overall U.S. employers added 315000 jobs down from July numbers but still representing a strong pace of growth.

CAPEX FORECAST

North American spending is forecast to increase 33% from 2021 levels which is an acceleration from 20.6% growth projected in a December survey and builds on the modest 1% increase experienced in 2021 according to James West senior managing director at Evercore ISI. The increase is driven by a 1260 bps acceleration in the U.S. to 36% growth which more than offset a 2.8% decline in spending in 2021 excluding the historical capex of distressed companies that have since been acquired or privatized. Private and independent operators are leading the recovery with capex accelerating by 1440 bps and 1550 bps from the December survey to 56% and 42% respectively and also accelerating from 41% and 5% growth in 2021. More modest growth of 25% and 19% are anticipated from the majors and NOCs both of which contracted further in 2021.

While the majors have more than offset declines in 2021 despite recent divestitures—with Evercore’s projected 2022 spending nearly 7% above 2020 levels—spending from the NOCs remains 25% lower to account for less than 1% of total U.S. spending (vs. almost 2% in 2020). Overall the majors account for almost 30% of U.S. capex down from 36% in 2020 while the independents including privates account for 70% of all spending up from 62%. U.S. capex is on track to recover within 25% of pre-pandemic levels and approach levels last seen in 2009 before the start of the oil shale revolution.

There could be modest upside to NAM spending in in the second half of 2022 with current spot prices above the $84/Bbl WTI and $5.18/MMbtu HH average basis for establishing 2022 budgets. While half of survey respondents would maintain their budget regardless of changes in the oil and gas price one-third are willing to flex capex higher for rising cash flow. However Evercore believes upside is likely to remain muted as activity could be constrained by the availability of goods services and labor.

Operators have been highly disciplined over the past year as commodity prices increased. Yet a new round of consolidation may drive spending higher if commodity prices stabilize at a significantly higher range and confidence in the duration of the cycle increases. From a lower base Evercore believes the set-up is positive for growth in 2023 and beyond.

EIA FORECAST

The EIA’s Short-Term Energy Outlook published September 2022 reports that STEO is subject to heightened uncertainty resulting from Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and how sanctions affect Russia’s oil production. Also contributing to uncertainty is the production decisions of OPEC+ the rate at which U.S. oil and natural gas production rises and other contributing factors. Less robust economic activity in the STEO forecast could result in lower-than-expected energy consumption.

Oil price forecast. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has resulted in shifting trade patterns leaving Europe to find substitutes for Russia’s oil. This change has driven up the price of Brent contracts to a level high enough to reduce Asia’s imports of Brent and to retain more oil in Europe. EIA forecasts the spot price of Brent crude will average $98/bbl in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $97/bbl in 2023. The possibility of petroleum supply disruptions and slower-than-expected crude oil production growth continues to create the potential for higher oil prices while the possibility of slower-than-forecast economic growth creates the potential for lower prices.

Crude production forecast. U.S. crude oil production is forecast to average 11.8 MMbopd in 2022 and 12.6 MMbopd during 2023 which would set a record for the most U.S. oil output during a year. The current record is 12.3 MMbopd set in 2019.

Natural gas prices. In August the Henry Hub spot price averaged $8.80/MMBtu up from $7.28/MMBtu in July. Natural gas prices rose in August because of continued strong demand for natural gas in the electric power sector which has kept natural gas inventories below their five-year (2017–2021) average. EIA expects HH price to average $9/MMBtu in in the fourth quarter of 2022 and then fall to an average $6/MMBtu in 2023 as U.S. natural gas production rises.

Natural gas production. Dry natural gas production has been rising relatively steadily since the first quarter of 2022 when it averaged 94.6 Bcfd. EIA forecasts U.S. natural gas production to average 99.0 Bcfd during fourth-quarter 2022 and then rise to 100.4 Bcfd in 2023.

U.S. FORECAST

Given the restricted Russian supply demand recovery and resulting increase in crude prices operators working the various U.S. plays plan to noticeably increase drilling activity for the remainder of 2022. Overall activity in the Texas shale plays will improve in the second half of the year with the exception of District 7B District 8 and District 8A which will suffer slight second-half losses. However drilling on the Texas side of the Haynesville is projected to improve 26% on a y-o-y basis. Gulf of Mexico activity will increase 8.4% but a decline of 70% is forecast offshore California both on a y-o-y basis.

Gulf of Mexico. Higher oil prices should help boost activity slightly in the GOM and it appears that offshore operators are poised to resume limited development in 2022-2023 after last year’s decline Fig. 3. World Oil’s survey results and federal officials’ predicted well counts show a slight increase during second-half 2022. World Oil forecasts that GOM activity totaled 63 wells in the first half of the year with another 65 scheduled to be drilled during second-half 2022. The projected 128-well total will be 8.4% higher than 2021’s figure of 118. Footage drilled should be up 6.6% on a y-o-y basis.

STATE-BY-STATE OUTLOOK

Texas. Most of the shale plays in the Lone Star State are gaining ground during 2022. On a half-over-half basis World Oil predicts Texas wells will gain 11.6% with the 2022 total being 39% more than the 2021 figure. In the Permian basin (Fig. 4) District 8 will be up 8% in the second half buts its total will be 26% higher than wells drilled in 2021. Districts 7C and 8A will enjoy much-improved drilling activity with gains of 33% and 172% respectively compared to their 2021 totals.

The Eagle Ford forecast is also good with District 1 forecast to improve 30% in the second half and up 64% on a y-o-y basis. District 2 will experience a 4% gain in activity in the second half and is also projected to be up 26% on a y-o-y basis. District 4 in the Eagle Ford will experience a 47% increase between the two halves and post a massive 157% gain from 2021’s level. The reason that District 4 is surging is more gas-related activity. Of the 12 Railroad Districts 10 are forecast to experience gains with only two losing ground on a half-over-half basis. Again more gas drilling is a factor especially in RRC 6 with the Haynesville up 36% y-o-y.

DUC wells decline. According to EIA’s July 2022 tally the DUC total stood at 4277 a reduction of 1680 wells since July 2021 a reduction of 28%. In the Permian basin operators have completed 1092 DUC wells during the July 2022-July 2021 interval a reduction of 48%. All other regions declined too with the exception of the Haynesville which added 80 DUC wells up to 477 a y-o-y increase of 20%.

Oklahoma. Although the SCOOP and STACK plays are not as prolific as the Permian or Eagle Ford acreage in Kingfisher Canadian Blaine and Grady counties continues to attract interest for hydrocarbon development. But the region’s inconsistent geology and less-than-ideal shale formations have produced unpredictable results reducing ROI. However with higher oil prices the plays have become more attractive and we predict a major increase in Oklahoma’s activity. World Oil forecasts companies will drill 79% more wells in 2022 than last year’s total. Total footage will also surge forward 75% with operators making 15.7 MMft of hole.

Louisiana. In the state’s northern portion we forecast operators developing Haynesville shale gas will drill 25% more wells in 2022 than they did in 2021 with total footage up approximately 17%. With natural gas prices at near-record highs the increase in activity could continue similar to the Haynesville play in Texas RRC District 6. Despite near-record high natural gas prices DUCs in the Haynesville were up to 477 in July a jump of 20%. In the mature shallow oil plays of southern Louisiana we expect operators to drill 46% more wells compared to last year. Well footage is expected to increase 29% on a y-o-y basis.

North Dakota. The Bakken is running out of steam. Although transportation issues remain a challenge in this oil-rich shale play a greater concern is that the sweet spot has reached maximum infill development Fig. 5. However higher oil prices will help negate the cost of drilling the 21100-ft wells. Considering these factors along with data from state officials and World Oil operator surveys we forecast that drilling will be up a disappointing 4% with footage increasing 2.9% y-o-y in the Peace Garden State.

Northeast (Pa./W.V./Ohio). In the Northeast Marcellus activity is on an upward trend similar to other U.S. shale plays Fig. 6. Improving natural gas prices and increased LNG exports from Dominion Energy’s massive Cove Point facility are helping drive activity higher in the region. According to survey results operators tapping the high-quality reservoir in Pennsylvania will increase the number of wells drilled this year by 18% compared to the number drilled in 2021. Total footage for 2022 is forecast to jump 16.5%.

In Ohio operators working the Utica play plan to focus on growth and capitalize on higher gas prices with this year’s total well count expected to finish 30% higher than last year’s level. Footage is forecast to increase 31%. In West Virginia World Oil forecasts operators will drill 84 more wells than the number spudded in 2021 up 62%. We also forecast a 64% surge in total footage in the Mountain State. Despite surging gas prices operators working the shale fields of Appalachia were able to reduce the region’s DUC count by only eight wells in July on a y-o-y basis a reduction of just 11%.

Midwest (Illinois/Kansas). There are approximately 32100 oil and gas wells 10500 Class II injection wells and 1750 gas storage wells producing from 650 fields in Illinois. These wells are controlled by 1500 operators. There is oil production in 40 of the 102 counties mainly in the southern part of the state. Drilling will surge with a 61% increase in wells forecast for 2022 compared to 2021’s level. Although the wells are relatively shallow they provide work for the oilfield community and the drilling crews. We forecast a 59% jump in total footage.

In Kansas much of the shallow drilling in the Hugoton basin appears to stay below the Baker Hughes rig count radar. But according to the Kansas Corporation Commission drilling in the Sunflower State is projected to increase 24% in 2022 compared to the 1005 drilled in 2021. Total footage is forecast to jump 24%.

Rocky Mountains. The Denver Julesburg basin has experienced a constant decline since production peaked in November 2019. Reversing this trend will depend on the capital allocation from major operators in the region. The DJ basin accounted for 7% of oil and 6.6% of natural gas production in the Lower 48 in 2021 (GlobalData). While other U.S. basins have increased their rig count with the rise in commodity prices. Operators like Oxy and Chevron are earning better returns from investments in other basins but could grow production in the DJ by completing their DUC backlog.

In Colorado officials continue to attempt to ban or severely limit drilling in the state. In 2019 the state passed Senate Bill 118 “which fundamentally altered the oil and gas industry’s future in the state” according to Colorado Governor Jared Polis. However it appears companies intend to push back and continue operations on existing leases as World Oil expects operators in Colorado to drill 40% more wells in 2022 compared to activity during 2021. Total footage is projected to increase by 40% on a y-o-y basis.

In 2019 a federal judge ordered a halt to exploration on 300000 acres in Wyoming saying the government must account for its cumulative effect on climate change. The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by a pair of environmental groups challenging the BLM’s decision to lease federal lands for energy development in the state. Given that nearly 50% of all lands in Wyoming are owned by the federal government a ban on federal leasing would decimate the natural gas industry and Wyoming’s economy. Despite the ongoing lawsuit operators working in the state plan to increase drilling activity by 24% in 2022. World Oil predicts footage will increase 25%.

Canadian Overseas Petroleum received a resource report prepared by Ryder Scott that confirmed its deep oil discovery on lands in Converse and Natrona counties Wyoming. The report confirms the deep discovery has total original oil in place of 993.5 MMbbl. This supports the company’s conclusion that the Frontier 2 and Dakota discoveries are large stratigraphic oil accumulations encompassing the reserves at the company’s Cole Creek field. The report outlines 118 horizontal well locations to exploit the identified Frontier 2 and Dakota reserves. COPL plans to drill one Frontier 1 well and two horizontal Frontier 2 wells as part of its 2022-2023 drilling campaign commencing in fourth-quarter 2022.

Acreage in New Mexico has become as desirable as land on the Texas side of the Permian basin. Increased completion efficiencies in the Bone Springs formation will help support activity as drilling in the Land of Enchantment is forecast to increase 23% on a half-over-half basis and 30% y-o-y for 2022. Total footage will increase 33% y-o-y.

In California we expect onshore operators to spud four fewer wells in 2022 compared to 2021. But with no new discoveries operators working the Golden State are forced to survive by maintaining less-attractive heavy oil fields and residual acreage from long-ago discoveries. However considering the mature nature of these fields onshore footage is forecast to climb 15% (y-o-y) suggesting deeper total depths as operators squeeze out more oil from these old fields. Drilling offshore California will drop dramatically with only three wells expected in 2022 a y-o-y decline of 70%. Accordingly footage is forecast to drop 65%.

In Alaska the U.S. DOJ filed a brief defending the Willow project an energy development within the NPRA on Alaska’s North Slope that has been halted by litigation. The Biden administration announced it would review the Willow plan approved in 2020 by the Trump administration for consistency. The project is proposed by ConocoPhillips and if approved the project will provide 100000 bopd $10 billion in revenue for state local and federal governments during its lifespan 2000 construction jobs and 300 permanent jobs. It appears the prospect of opening new acreage is having the desired effect. Offshore work will surge 109% in 2022 12 more than spud in 2021. Onshore activity on the North Slope is projected to increase 67% with total footage up 67%.

Others. Activity in non-core producing states will also enjoy a jump in activity. Drilling will increase on a y-o-y basis in Alabama Arkansas Montana Nebraska and New York.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvMjAyMi1vcGluaW9uLTUwLXN0YXRlcy01MC1zdGFydHVwcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,50 States 50 Startups: How Innovation Surged In 2022,"Why did this happen?

After a commenter asked Lynch to show herself ordering the burrito Lynch obliged and posted a second video.

In that clip — shared on TikTok on Aug. 22 — Lynch is shown filming herself as she walks up to the counter at a Chipotle and places her order.

""Hi can I get a tortilla please with just beans and cheese in it?"" Lynch says in the video.

At the end of the video Lynch reveals her burrito — and the receipt for her meal totaling exactly $2.36.

""Breakdown of the receipt: They always ring it up for me as 2 sides when I order this which is $2"" Lynch wrote in the comments.

By the Numbers

Research from PYMNTS’ study “Digital Economy Payments: Consumers Buy Into Food Bargains” which drew from a survey of a census-balanced panel of nearly 3000 U.S. consumers finds that Gen Z’s restaurant habits vary dramatically from month to month. For instance 69% of Gen Z had made a restaurant purchase in the previous 30 days in November 2021 while only 54% said the same the following month. Fifty-nine percent did so in June 2022 compared to just 50% in July.

The Data in Action

Fast-casual giant Chipotle Mexican Grill for one which has more than 3000 locations across five countries finds every year that the habits of college students who now tend to be Gen Z tend to fluctuate considerably with the time of year.

“For the first time in three years [we] saw kind of normal college seasonality meaning the college restaurants really performed exceptionally well during the school year because they were all in-person” the brand’s Chief Financial Officer Jack Hartung said on a call brand’s second quarter fiscal year 2022 financial results. “And then we saw seasonality that we haven’t seen in three years where the college students go back home [over the summer] and they tend to eat less.”

FORMER GPIF ESG HEAD JOINS IFRS SUSTAINABILITY BOARD

Hiroshi Komori

Hiroshi Komori former head of stewardship and ESG for Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) is one of three appointments to the International Sustainability Standards Board according to its parent organisation IFRS Foundation. Komori was senior director and head of GPIF’s stewardship and ESG division until March 2022.

Komori joined GPIF in December 2015 and became head of stewardship and ESG in 2016 building up ESG related practices and expertise for the pension fund. Prior to GPIF Komori was with Sumitomo Trust Bank (currently Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank) for over 25 years in the investor relations and shareholder relations consulting service group.

Also appointed were Jenny Bofinger-Schuster senior vice president for sustainability and operational excellence with Siemens and Veronika Pountcheva senior vice president of corporate responsibility for German corporation Metro.

IFRS Foundation trustees chair Erkki Liikanen said in a news release that the latest appointments give ISSB a geographically balanced board with a broad range of expertise as it works to develop standards for corporate sustainability disclosures.

CIC CHAIR OF BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HU HAO DEPARTS

Hu Hao

Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Chicago has been around for 125 years and acted as the primary church for three surrounding neighborhoods of Ashland Avenue.

The church held its first mass in October 1892 and was physically moved in 1929.

It took the efforts of 50 men and their horses to pry the 10000 ton church from its foundation move it across the street and rotate it 90 degrees. According to a Chicago Ancestry site the church was moved at a 'foot a minute.'

'It is a magnificent historically and architecturally significant church' said church preservation advocate Julie Sawacki on the steps leading to the church's entrance. 'Imagine tearing something so significant down.'

The church in its present form was built in 1916 and moved across a street by 50 men and horses in 1929

The Archdiocese of Chicago told CBS News that attendance at the church's Sunday masses have steadily declined.

The church simultaneously needs $2 million worth of repairs and without the community's support its likely it will be demolished.

There are a group of parishioners including Hilda Correa who are desperately trying to save the famed religious landmark. Correa and others say the church attracts tourists both Christian and non-Christian.

Correa also alluded to the fact that times are hard. Although she didn't specify what she was talking about - perhaps the years-long pandemic or stubborn inflation - Correa says the church is a place of comfort for those who come to visit.

Hilda Correa left and Julie Sawacki right as well as a number of others passionate about keeping Our Lady of Lourdes alive made impassioned pleas on the steps of the church before its last service on May 19

'The religious aspect is really what's really touching us because losing such a valuable place that people can come especially in these days...'

Our Lady of Lourdes will be holding its final service on May 19 but Preservation Chicago a non-profit organization dedicated to saving city landmarks plans to revive the church and make it into a holy shrine.

'The effort here will probably be long and labored perhaps. There's a lot of different moving parts and a lot of different factors' said Preservation Chicago Executive Director Ward Miller.

There is a Change.org petition with 1107 signatures to preserve the church as a historical landmark rather than knocking it down. The goal is to reach 1500 signatures.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20uY2h1cmNob2ZqZXN1c2NocmlzdC5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZS9jaHVyY2gtb2YtamVzdXMtY2hyaXN0LXJlc3BvbmRzLXRvLW1ham9yLWZsb29kaW5nLWluLXJpby1ncmFuZGUtZG8tc3VsLWJyYXppbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Church of Jesus Christ Responds to Major Flooding in Rio Grande Do Sul Brazil,"PHOTO-2024-05-08-12-51-59[13].jpg Missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints help load emergency supplies from an Azul airplane onto a truck at a military airport in Canoas Brazil following severe flooding in the Rio Grande do Sul state Brazil May 8 2024.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is sending humanitarian aid to those affected by the recent rains in Brazil’s southern state of Rio Grande do Sul. Some 200000 people have been forced out of their homes with at least 90 people dead and more than 130 missing.

The Brazil Area Presidency has assembled staff and resources to assist those affected by the floods. A letter sent to bishops and stake presidents from Elder Joni L. Koch Brazil Area President and his counselors Elder Arnulfo Valenzuela and Elder Mark D. Eddy all General Authority Seventies states that 21 meetinghouses are now being used as shelters for evacuated people and thousands of basic food packages provided by the Church to the state Civil Defense have already begun to be distributed to the population.

Missionaries from the Church helped unload emergency supplies from an Azul airplane at a military airport in the city of Canoas on Wednesday May 8. Working with Azul Airlines the Church is planning to send an aircraft from Saõ Paulo to Porto Alegre with supplies donated by the Church on Thursday May 9.

Other humanitarian aid initiatives are underway in close coordination with the government to help the community. The Church’s Welfare and Self-Reliance and Family Services departments are coordinating support and efforts to meet the needs of members as well.

Authorities consider the flooding the state’s worst-ever crisis caused by natural disasters.

News reports say some 80% of the population is without running water right now a week into the flooding. Many also do not have telephone or internet services.

The airport bus station and main roads are all blocked or closed going into the capital of Porto Alegre — and more than two-thirds of the nearly 500 cities in the state are affected by the flood waters. Field hospitals have been set up to help those affected.

Social media posts on the Church’s Autossuficiência Brasil and Brazil Area accounts of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also explain that the Church is responding to the disaster.

Thousands of essential items are being donated including basic baskets mattresses bedding and blankets hygiene kits cleaning kits drinking water personal protective equipment and tools.



These donations are being coordinated in collaboration with the State Civil Defense. Also local church leaders are coordinating efforts to help the community.

“[T]he Brazil Area office is mobilized to do everything possible to help and help the population of Rio Grande do Sul our dear brothers and sisters and friends at this time of great sorrow” the post said in Portuguese.

The post goes on to say that Church members who want to make donations to those affected by the calamity can do so through official government organizations that are coordinating donations through civil defense and social funds.

Some of the cities in Rio Grande do Sul — roughly the size Ecuador — were already suffering from at least three previous major floods in less than eight months.

The rains are expected to continue in the area along with high winds.

Kaitlyn Fisher was charged with three counts of felony grand theft on May 3.

Court documents say on Oct. 14 2022 an employee of the Presbytery of Kendall reported that Fisher the administrative clerk had been embezzling from church funds.

The Presbytery of Kendall is an organization that oversees the Presbyterian churches in the eastern Idaho area. According to a church newsletter obtained by EastIdahoNews.com Fisher was the administrative executive assistant.

EastIdahoNews.com has attempted to contact the Presbytery of Kendall by phone and email for comment and we are awaiting their response.

The reporting party told police the staff had not met for annual financial review meetings since the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time she repeatedly asked Fisher who acted as a secretary and bookkeeper for a summary of the church organization’s financials.

In October 2022 the board of trustees chair obtained the organization’s bank statements after asking the banks directly.

In the statements the employees reportedly discovered “numerous unauthorized purchases and transfers out of both accounts via Venmo and Paypal as far back as 2020.”

The two employees confronted Fisher on Oct. 10 where she allegedly admitted to making the unauthorized transfers and purchases.

On Dec. 6 an Idaho Falls Police officer contacted Fisher about the allegations and she denied stealing the money.

Over a week later the officer contacted a criminal investigator with the Idaho State Tax Commission who was able to issue and serve subpoenas for Fisher’s PayPal and Venmo account records.

In the transaction history investigators discovered at least $338458 worth of unauthorized purchases made from Fishers account allegedly using church funds between January 2019 and October 2022.

According to police reports Fisher used the money to buy a red 2018 Honda 4-wheeler from Action Motor Sports to pay The Yard Butler a local landscape designer and debited between $280890.01 and $281474 from the church organization’s Wells Fargo account.

Venmo account records showed Fisher’s Venmo account was linked to the church’s Wells Fargo account as a payment method for transactions.

Transaction descriptions further show Fisher allegedly used the money to pay for child care furniture a dog dog waste cleanup food gasoline her mortgage and supplies/labor to finish the basement of her new house.

Between July and October 2022 alone Fisher allegedly spend at least $38801.84 from the church’s Idaho Central Credit Union account.

A warrant was issued for Fisher’s arrest on May 3 and she was booked into the Bonneville County Jail on May 7. Her bail was set to $30000. She posted bond and was released on the same day.

Fisher is expected to appear for a preliminary hearing on May 29. If convicted she could face up to 42 years in prison.

Though Fisher has been charged with these crimes it does not necessarily mean she committed them. Everyone is presumed innocent until they are proven guilty.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtpcm83LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL25lYXJseS0xMDAtdGlyZXMtbGVmdC1jaHVyY2gtcHJvcGVydHktdmFuZGFscy1zdHJpa2UtYWdhaW4vTFlSNllUTkVGVkFSNUZQQkMySlpUQ1BDVUkv0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtpcm83LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL25lYXJseS0xMDAtdGlyZXMtbGVmdC1jaHVyY2gtcHJvcGVydHktdmFuZGFscy1zdHJpa2UtYWdhaW4vTFlSNllUTkVGVkFSNUZQQkMySlpUQ1BDVUkvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nearly 100 tires left on church property as vandals strike again,"We’re Sorry!

The Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and All Africa ordained Zimbabwean Angelic Molen as a deaconess in the Orthodox Church. Taking place on May 2 Orthodox Holy Thursday the ordination was conducted at St. Nektarios Mission Parish near Harare Zimbabwe by the archbishop of Zimbabwe Metropolitan Serafim.

The St. Phoebe Center for the Deaconess a U.S.-based organization that has advocated for reviving the ancient female diaconate said in a press release that Molen’s ordination would prepare the way for the restoration of the role in other branches of the Orthodox Church. The group’s board chair Dr. Carrie Frost wrote: “Being the first to do anything is always a challenge but the Patriarchate of Alexandria has courageously chosen to lead the way with Metropolitan Serafim laying his hands on Deaconess Angelic.”

According to the release Molen said: “At first I was nervous about going into the altar but when Metropolitan Serafim blessed me to enter the altar as part of my preparation this week those feelings went away and I felt comfortable. I am ready.” According to the St. Phoebe Center Molen was well received by her community and parish.

“The Alexandrian Patriarchate in Africa felt the need to revive this order to serve the daily pastoral needs of Orthodox Christians in Africa” the release read. Metropolitan Serafim said that Molen will have both liturgical and pastoral roles. He said: “She is going to do what the deacon is doing in the liturgy and in all the sacraments in our Orthodox services.”"

Heading back to school after the summer ends is always a time of adjustment for children whether they’re starting a new grade a new school or both. It’s a time of adjustment for parents and other guardians as well – and two-plus years into the COVID-19 pandemic they still have plenty of health and safety concerns to think over plan for and worry about.

With that in mind we asked Dr. Leslie Barakat a pediatrician and senior medical director for Cigna for advice on keeping children as safe as possible at school and elsewhere.

How can I assess my child’s COVID risk at school?

Understanding what’s going on in your area is a key to making informed decisions about risk at school and elsewhere in your community. A good source of information is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) COVID-19 Data Tracker which uses a color-coded map to show the level of COVID transmission in every county or city across the United States. For example 39.6% of counties had a high COVID-19 community level as of August 11 2022 while 40.7% had a medium level and 19.8% had a low level.

Throughout the summer we saw COVID-19 omicron variants emerge causing regional spikes in outbreaks. Although immunity through vaccinations and natural infections has created a relatively high level of protection against serious disease and hospitalization new variants may circumvent protection and cause new infections so it’s important to stay informed.

Children in general are at less risk than older individuals for serious complications. However they could be at more risk for serious disease if they have certain chronic conditions or a weakened immune system. The chances of becoming very sick or dying from COVID increase with age and underlying medical conditions including cancer diabetes heart conditions dementia and obesity particularly when people are not up to date on COVID vaccinations. People with immune deficiencies some disabilities some mental health conditions and some chronic diseases are also at higher risk.

What can I do to reduce my child’s COVID risk?

The single most effective way to protect our children is to make sure they are up to date on all of their immunizations. We've seen a decline in vaccination rates nationally and are concerned about potential outbreaks of life-threatening diseases. The recent case of polio reported in New York reminds us that we cannot let down our guard. We also know that people vaccinated against viruses such as COVID and influenza (flu) are much less likely to have a severe illness or be hospitalized if they do get sick compared with those who are unvaccinated.

The American Association of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends COVID vaccination for everyone 6 months and older. Children should get fully immunized – receiving the first two doses – as soon as they are eligible. Children who are 12 or older are now eligible for Pfizer’s new COVID vaccine which targets the omicron variant and was authorized by the FDA on August 31. The FDA also authorized Moderna’s new booster but only for adults 18 and older. The new boosters can be administered two months or longer after completing the first two vaccine doses or receiving a booster.

In addition protect others by keeping your children and teens home from school if they are sick or show new symptoms and continue to emphasize handwashing.

Should my child wear a mask in the classroom?

Ideally schools should stay informed about community transmission levels and require masks when community transmission rates are high. Even if the school does not require indoor masking it’s still a good idea for your child to wear a mask indoors especially if your child is currently ineligible for the COVID-19 vaccine; is unvaccinated; is immunocompromised; if a family member is at high risk; or if you live in a community with high COVID transmission. For maximum protection use snug well-fitting masks that cover the nose and don’t gap around the sides.

What about sports and other school (or non-school) activities?

The AAP offers guidance for parents of children and teens participating in sports physical education classes and other physical activities. In general indoor settings have greater risks than outdoor activities while the number of players how close they are together and the amount and duration of contact all are risk factors for COVID transmission.

Wrestling ice hockey and basketball probably put players at the highest risk the AAP concluded. Other sports might be less risky while in process but activities such as team meals and transportation in private vehicles can put unmasked or partially masked athletes at greater risk. If your community is having a high transmission rate you probably will want to refrain from having your child participate in those types of activities.

The AAP recommends that local officials monitor conditions when considering whether a sporting event or practice should be canceled delayed or otherwise limited. It also notes that encouraging or requiring vaccinations requiring face masks and enforcing physical distancing can decrease the risk that players and others will contract COVID.

What else can I do to help ensure my children are safe and healthy at home as well as at school and during activities?

Make sure your child gets a yearly check-up which will include screening for mental health conditions. If your child will be playing a sport be sure to get a pre-participation (sports) exam. Your pediatrician can help you update any forms your child's school may need in case of a medical emergency.

If you have health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) check that your contact information is up to date with your state Medicaid agency. This will ensure you get timely updates about your health coverage so you can avoid any gaps in coverage.

Many children and teens have experienced mental health struggles over the past few years. It's important to let them know they can talk to you or other trusted adults about how they're feeling. Be alert to worrisome changes in behavior or any signs anxiety or distress. Try to prioritize family meals and exercise breaks like taking walks together. These can be great opportunities to talk.

Ask your pediatrician if you are unsure if your child needs help or how to start a discussion. Schools may also offer sources of mental health support.

If you have a firearm in your home make sure to lock it up and store the ammunition separately. The risk of suicide is higher for children and teens who live in a home where guns are stored loaded or unlocked.

The changes in routine that accompany back-to-school make it a good time to create or update your family media plan so you can help your child balance screen time with sleep exercise and other healthy activities. As part of your planning help your children choose high-quality programs or games and teach them how to recognize sites that that promote false information.

Above all as the AAP reminds us remember that children are resilient. When they face issues trusted adults like parents educators and their pediatricians can help them rebound and thrive. Pediatricians are available to help their patients’ parents as well so don’t hesitate to reach out with questions or concerns at the beginning of the school year or any other time of year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vYXpiaWdtZWRpYS5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvY2lnbmEtbWVkaWNhbC1ncm91cC1jaGFuZ2VzLW5hbWUtdG8tZXZlcm5vcnRoLWNhcmUtZ3JvdXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cigna Medical Group changes name to Evernorth Care Group,"Cigna Medical Group is changing its name to Evernorth Care Group today Sept. 1 as part of Cigna’s new health services business Evernorth.

Insurer Cigna has announced that healthcare industry leader Dr. David Brailer will join the company as executive vice president and chief health officer in early September.

As Cigna's first chief health officer the company said Brailer will focus on bringing together the company's products technologies and services in ways that drive more value and help people improve their overall health.

Brailer will report to David M. Cordani Cigna chairman and chief executive officer and will serve on the company's Enterprise Leadership Team.

WHAT'S THE IMPACT?

Brailer is founder and chairman of Health Evolution an organization that convenes healthcare leaders as they navigate changing forces in the industry. He's also vice chairman of the Duke-Margolis Health Policy Center.

Brailer will continue to be actively involved with both of those organizations as part of his role at Cigna.

He has been an investor in numerous health technology and services companies through Health Evolution Partners. In 2004 Brailer was appointed by President George W. Bush as a health policy advisor and became the nation's first National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. Prior to that he was founder and CEO of CareScience one of the first health data analytics companies in the internet era.

He's also served on the boards of directors of or as an advisor to numerous healthcare companies including Walgreens Boots Alliance VillageMD Censeo Health and Prolacta Bioscience.

Brailer holds doctoral degrees in medicine and economics. He earned his M.D. from West Virginia University and his Ph.D. in economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He was appointed a Charles A. Dana Fellow and a Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholar at the University of Pennsylvania.

He taught for a decade at the Wharton School where he developed its curriculum on health information technology. Brailer became board certified in internal medicine after internship and residency at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania where he later practiced infectious diseases and HIV medicine.

THE LARGER TREND

The news comes soon after Cigna announced it will be expanding the reach of its ACA Marketplace exchange plans during the upcoming Open Enrollment period that begins in November. Cigna health plans will be available on the individual exchange in three new states – Texas Indiana and South Carolina – as well as in additional counties in Georgia Mississippi and North Carolina.

According to Charles Berg president of Cigna's U.S. Government business the expansion was spurred in part by what the company perceives as ""a significant need for a competitive and sustainable individual market.""

ON THE RECORD

""I believe that Cigna is well positioned to improve the health and well-being of the millions of customers it serves"" Brailer said. ""I know the company is deeply committed to being a leader in the coming era of digitally inspired consumer-driven healthcare. I look forward to working alongside David and the leadership team to advance Cigna's culture of health excellence and innovation.""

Hidayatullah.com | PENYAKIT Cinta dunia (hubbud-dunya) adalah penyakit masyarakat yang secara fakta ada dan sudah ditegas sendiri dalam Al-Quran. Berapa banyak kasus di sekitar kita bahkan yang terbaru seorang jenderal bintang dua membunuh anak buah sendiri hingga merekayasa fakta tujuanya tidak lain menyelamatkan kecintaanya pada dunia dan isinya.

Benang merah yang bisa diambil pelajaran kasus terbaru ini adalah; bahaya cinta dunia itu merusak dirinya sendiri dan orang lain. Dengan perilakunya ini menyebabkan hak-hak orang terampas oleh manusia serakah pengidap penyakit cinta dunia.

Rasulullah ﷺ telah lama mengingatkan masalah ini;

حب الدنيا رأس كل خطيئة

“Cinta dunia adalah biang keladi dari semua kesalahan.” (HR. Baihaqi).

Bahkan Sayyidina Ali bin Abu Thalib Radhiyallahu Anhu pernah berujar dalam khotbahnya “Dunia ini ibarat ladang tempat makan orang baik dan orang jahat.”

Jika melihat berbagai ayat Al Qur’an serta hadis Nabi mayoritas “orang tidak baik” lah yang mendominasi kehidupan di dunia ini. Karena hampir tidak ada yang tidak “menoleh’ kepada dunia kecuali orang-orang yang diberi petunjuk oleh Allah.

Imam Ghozali menyebutkan di dalam Ihya’ Ulumuddin bahwa ayat-ayat Al Qur’an yang menjelaskan tentang keburukan dunia sangat banyak sekali. Dan kebanyakan ayat-ayat Al Qur’an memuat mengenai keburukan (fitnah) dunia dan anjuran untuk memalingkan makhluk dari dunia serta mengajak kepada akhirat.

Zaid bin Arqom pernah bersama Sayyidina Abubakar Asshidiq Radiyallahu Anhu saat itu beliau meminta minuman lalu diberikan kepadanya air dan madu. Maka ketika beliau telah kenyang dari minuman itu beliau menangis hingga sahabat-sahabatnya juga ikut menangis.

Lalu para sahabatnya itu diam dari tangisnya dan tidak demikian dengan Abubakar beliau menangis lagi dan para sahabatnya menyangka bahwa Abubakar ada masalah yang mereka tidak mampu membantunya. Lalu Abubakar mengusap kedua matanya dan para sahabatnya bertanya “Wahai Khalifah penerus Rasulullah ﷺ apa yang membuat engkau menangis?” Abubakar menjawab “Aku pernah bersama Rasulullah ﷺ dan aku melihat beliau menolak sesuatu dari dirinya padahal aku tidak melihat seorangpun bersamanya. Maka aku bertanya kepada beliau apa yang engkau tolak tadi? Kemudian Rasulullah ﷺ bersabda

هذه الدنيا مثلت لي فقلت لها إليك عني ثم رجعت فقالت إنك افلت مني لم يفلت مني من بعدك

“Inilah dunia menampakkan diri kepadaku dan aku berkata kepadanya pergilah dariku kemudian dia kembali dan berkata sesungguhnya engkau (Rasulullah ﷺ) bisa lepas dariku namun tidak akan ada yang bisa lepas dariku sepeninggalmu.” (HR. Bazzar Hakim Baihaqi).

Lihat bagaimana angkuhnya dunia yang memproklamirkan diri di depan Rasulullah ﷺ bahwa tidak ada yang bisa lepas dari cengkeramannya (dunia) sepeninggal Nabi Muhammad ﷺ kelak. Hujjatul Islam Imam Al Ghazali menukil sebuah hadis di dalam kitab Ihya’ Ulumiddin dalam bab fitnah (kejelekan) dunia yang berbunyi

حديث موسى بن يسار “ان الله جل ثناؤه لم يخلق خلقا ابغض اليه من الدنيا وانه منذ خلقها لم ينظر

اليها” اخرجه ابن ابي الدنيا من هذا الوجه بلاغا وللبيهقي في الشعب من طريقه وهو مرسل

“Sesungguhnya Allah tidak menciptakan makhluk yang lebih dibenci daripada dunia. Dan sesungguhnya Allah tidak pernah melihat kepada dunia sejak Dia menciptakannya.” (HR. Ibnu Abi Dunya dan Baihaqi).

Lantas setelah melihat berbagai celaan kepada dunia yang banyak tersebar di Al-Quran dan Hadis Nabi tersebut apakah itu artinya kita dilarang untuk ‘menikmati’ dunia? Tentu bukan demikian maksudnya.

Syeikh Abdul Wahhab As Sya’roni di dalam kitabnya mengatakan hendaknya kita meniru akhlak para Salaf Saleh dalam menyikapi dunia. Disebutkan oleh Imam Sya’roni bagaimana Salaf Saleh menyikapi dunia;

النظر إلى الدنيا بعين الاعتبار لا بعين المحبة لها وشهواتها، كما قد درج عليه جمهور السلف الصالح رضي الله عنهم

“Melihat kepada dunia dengan pandangan pertimbangan (untuk diambil pelajaran) bukan dengan pandangan cinta dan berkeinginan kepada dunia. Seperti yang dilakukan oleh mayoritas Salaf Soleh Radiyallahu Anhum” (Syekh Abdul Wahhab As Sya’roni Kitab Tanbihul Mughtarin hal. 65 cet. Darul Kutub Islamiyyah Jakarta).

Hatim Al-A’shom pernah ditanya seseorang perihal kriteria manusia yang bisa menjadi Ahlul I’tibar

وقيل لحاتم الأصم : متى يكون أحدنا من أهل الاعتبار فى الدنيا ؟

فقال : إذا رأى كل شيء فى الدنيا عاقبته إلى الخراب وصاحبه يذهب إلى التراب.

Ditanyakan kepada Hatim Al A’shom “Kapan kita dianggap termasuk daripada orang yang bisa mengambil pelajaran di dunia? Hatim menjawab “Tatkala sudah bisa melihat setiap sesuatu di dunia ini akibatnya adalah kehancuran dan pemilik (harta) dunia akan mati menjadi tanah.”

Maknanya adalah semua yang berkaitan dengan dunia akan musnah belaka ini sesuai dengan firman Allah di dalam Al-Quran

كُلُّ شَىْءٍ هَالِكٌ إِلَّا وَجْهَهُۥ ۚ لَهُ ٱلْحُكْمُ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ

“Tiap-tiap sesuatu pasti binasa kecuali Allah. Bagi-Nya-lah segala penentuan dan hanya kepada-Nya-lah kamu dikembalikan.” (QS: Al Qashash : 88)

Walhasil orang beriman telah diingatkan berkali-kali di dalam Al Qur’an bahwa dunia adalah kesenangan yang menipu (QS. Al Hadid : 20). Maka mewaspadai tipuannya adalah sebuah keniscayaan.

Imam Ghazali di dalam kitab Ihya’ Ulumuddin menukil wasiat dari Ruhullah Nabi Isa Alaihis Salam yang berbunyi

وقال عيسى عليه السلام : لا تتخذوا الدنيا ربا فتتخذكم عبيدا

“Jangan kalian menjadikan dunia sebagai Tuhan maka dunia akan menjadikan kalian sebagai hamba.”

Barangsiapa yang menjadi hamba dunia maka dunia akan menghancurkannya sehancur-hancurnya baik secara cepat atau lambat. Dan itu yang kini sedang terjadi di belahan dunia manapun di akhir zaman ini.

Lihat bagaimana para koruptor dan penguasa zalim. Kehancuran hidup mereka pasti akan datang dan jika masih bisa lepas di dunia ingat pengadilan akhirat sudah menanti.

Sebagai penutup penulis ingin mengutip wasiat dari Nabi Isa ibnu Maryam Alaihis Salam yang bisa menjadi pegangan bagi orang beriman dalam menyikapi dunia. Beliau berkata

وقال عيسى عليه السلام : لا يستقيم حب الدنيا والآخرة في مؤمن كما لا يستقيم الماء والنار في إناء واحد.

“Tidak (mungkin) tegak (akur) cinta dunia dan akhirat pada diri seorang mukmin seperti tidak akan bisa akur air dan api di dalam satu wadah.” Wallahu A’lam Bis Showab.*/ Muhammad Syafii Kudo murid Kulliyah Dirosah Islamiyah Pandaan Pasuruan",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvbXBhcy5jb20vaHlwZS9yZWFkLzIwMjIvMDkvMDMvMjEwNDMzODY2L3NldC1saXN0LWl3YW4tZmFscy1kaS1rb25zZXItYmVydGFsdS1yaW5kdS1jaW50YT9wYWdlPWFsbNIBZmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmtvbXBhcy5jb20vaHlwZS9yZWFkLzIwMjIvMDkvMDMvMjEwNDMzODY2L3NldC1saXN0LWl3YW4tZmFscy1kaS1rb25zZXItYmVydGFsdS1yaW5kdS1jaW50YQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Set List Iwan Fals di Konser Bertalu Rindu Cinta - Kompas.com,"JAKARTA KOMPAS.com - Penyanyi Iwan Fals akhirnya kembali naik ke atas Panggung Kita untuk gelaran Konser Bertalu Rindu Cinta.

Cisco was dominant in the datacenter networking space and fed organizations with a steady stream of hardware from routers to switches to silicon. The company carried an expansion view of its role in networking.

“At Cisco we were thinking always we have to control the end-to-end of the network” Monclus vice president and chief technology officer of VMware’s Networking and Security business unit tells The Next Platform. “The idea was we have to control the edge of the network so the core doesn’t fall because the core was where most of the markets were. We would have core routers core switches and then take it all the way to the access to create the end-to-end networking as a principle because from a Cisco perspective what we were delivering was an end-to-end connectivity solution with our protocols.”

About a year after Monclus left Cisco to found PlumGrid VMware bought Nicira for $1.26 billion a move that allowed the company that already was a significant datacenter presence through its server and storage virtualization to absorb networking into its increasingly software-defined world. NSX and networking have evolved over the past ten years to become a key part of VMware’s own adaptation to an IT world that has broken well beyond the datacenter boundaries and out to the cloud and the edge. With containers microservices and Kubernetes software now dictates to hardware rather than the other way around.

It’s also a world where the network is now tie that binds this increasingly decentralized IT environment becoming the main thoroughfare for applications and data moving between the datacenter cloud and edge and a central focus for organization’s security measures. All this was on full display this week at VMware’s Explore 2022 conference which allowed the company to tout its ongoing expansion into the cloud and out to the edge and its networking portfolio’s central role in helping to make this happen.

The evolution of networking at VMware has taken several steps Monclus says. At the time of the Nicira acquisition enterprises would spend weeks or months putting the network in place before applications that would run top it could be put into production.

When VMware got into networking the company heard from customers that they could quickly create and application and get a server up and running “but it takes them weeks to configure the network” he says. “We started that journey with network virtualization and the first story [for networking] was about automation and agility. The question was ‘If I create a VM could I just connect it to the network and give it an IP address?’ That was kind of the early days of network virtualization.”

As more workloads and data were making their way out of the datacenter security of the network became increasingly important which is why VMware embraced micro-segmentation a way to manage network access and separate workloads from one another to reduce an organization’s attack surface and more easily contain breaches by preventing the lateral movement of attackers. The acquisition two years ago of network security startup Lastline helped fuel the vendor’s distributed IDS/IPS technology to complement the east-west protection delivered by micro-segmentation.

In June the company added to its lateral security for network and endpoint technologies with a broad threat intelligence capability called Contexa. It sits in the infrastructure and offers visibility into both traditional and modern applications.

VMware over the years has put networking and security capabilities into the hypervisor and made them available as services in its own cloud offering and those of hyperscalers like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud. It’s also making NSX and its expanding growing security capabilities – including those from Carbon Black which it bought in 2019 for $2.1 billion –key parts of the multicloud strategy.

The vendor at Explore rolled out a broad range of enhancements to its networking and security portfolio all aimed at making it easier for enterprises to manage and secure their multicloud environments. It also gave a look to what the near-term future looks like with the introduction of a number of network- and security-focused projects.

VMware is embedding network detection and visibility capabilities into Carbon Black Cloud’s endpoint protection program a move that is now in early access and brings together visibility into both the network and endpoints. It also is adding threat prevention tools like IDPS malware analysis sandboxing and URL filtering to its NSX Gateway Firewall and enhanced bot management to the NSX Advanced Load Balancer (ALB). The last two – along with Project Watch which aims to offer a continuous risk and compliance assessment model to multicloud environments – are part of VMware’s Elastic App Secure Edge (EASE) a strategy announced last year to offer a range of data plane services around networking and security.

As we noted earlier this week VMware also is embracing data processing units (DPUs) from Nvidia for a number of its cloud-based offerings including vSphere 8 and for this case NSX. Cloud providers like AWS and Oracle already are using DPUs and many in the industry believe that servers and other hardware in the near future will routinely include the chips. Monclus says customers that will gravitate toward DPUs – or smartNICs – for performance and security. For organizations like telcos that demand high performance – and where their datacenters are revenue-generating facilities – enabling CPUs to offload networking or compute tasks to DPUs is attractive.

There is a tradeoff – they may save 15 percent in CPU utilization which they can sell back to customers but there also is the cost of the DPUs themselves. However where datacenters are a cost factor increasing security by leveraging the workload isolation offered by the DPUs and that likely will be a fast-growing use case for the chips Monclus says.

Looking to the near future VMware offered a look at Project Northstar and Project Trinidad along with the aforementioned Project Watch. Project NorthStar is in technical preview and is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) network and security offering that will deliver services visibility and controls to NSX users who can manage them via central cloud control plane.

The services include VMware’s NSX Intelligence ALB Network Detection and Response and Web Application Firewall.

“We are taking the control plane of NSX and turning it into a SaaS service to enable true multicloud solutions” Monclus says. “When we have a policy as a service it works on vSphere environments but it works across VMware Cloud VMware Cloud Network AWS Google Azure and we have the same advanced protection we have the same load balancer.”

Both Project Trinidad and Project Watch are aimed at addressing the needs of modern workloads he says. They’re not tied to physical endpoints; instead the API becomes the endpoint he says. Project Trinidad uses AI and machine learning models to understand what are normal and expected east-west API traffic patterns between microservices so that if something anomalous pops up it can be quickly detected.

“We basically discover all the API the schemas API data and we create a baseline and we can start from the baseline” Monclus says. “Project Trinidad introduces is AI/ML deep correlations between workflows and microservices.”

As noted Project Watch brings continuous security compliance and risk assessment as well as automated and encrypted connectivity across clouds – AWS Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure – virtual private clouds (VPCs) and virtual networks (VNETs) and security operations and integrates workflows from such areas as security and cloud operations and lines of business onto a single platform.

It also addresses the challenge of not only enabling networks and security to adapt to modern workloads but also to ensure that legacy hardware that can’t make that change are secure.

VMware will assess and report the security risks enterprises face giving the necessary data to make decisions he says adding that the vendor wants “to create a continuous monitoring model in the same way as high availability which uses the metric of three 9s four 9s and so forth” he says. “We are trying to create a metric of how well you’re running your datacenter or your applications from across security points.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZXRmZGIuY29tL2V0Zi1lZHVjYXRpb24tY2hhbm5lbC9jeWJlcnNlY3VyaXR5LXN0b2Nrcy1taWdodC1zcGFyay10aGVzZS1ldGZzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cybersecurity Stocks Might Spark These ETFs,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='etfdb.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /etf-education-channel/cybersecurity-stocks-might-spark-these-etfs/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016712647AC0>, 'Connection to etfdb.com timed out.

EVERMAN − Stephenville spotted Everman a 21-0 lead in the first quarter Friday but roared back to beat the Bulldogs 62-61 on the final play of the game – a 15-yard TD pass from Ryder Lambert to Topher Foster.

“It was a broken play” Stephenville coach Sterling Doty said. “(Lambert) scrambled threw it back in the end zone. (Foster) got two feet in.”

The Yellow Jackets overcame four turnovers to win the non-district game.

“They’re a good football team” Doty said of Everman. “We battled. Showed the heart of a champion.”

The defending Class 4A Division I champs ranked No. 1 in the state improved to 2-0 while Everman dropped to 1-1.

Lambert completed 16 of 34 passes for 257 yards and four TDs while Tate Maruska ran for 311 yards and five TDs on 45 carries.

Foster had four catches for 54 yards and two TDs. Tristian Gentry had seven for 121 yards and a TD and Tytus Russell also caught a TD pass.

The Yellow Jackets had 603 total yards including 346 rushing.

Stephenville hosts Decatur next Friday before going to Abilene Wylie a week later. Decatur (0-2) lost a 30-24 heartbreaker to Wichita Falls Rider on Friday.

Breckenridge shocks Childress

At Childress Chase Lehr threw for 150 yards and two TDs while Anson Rodgers ran for two more as Breckenridge shocked Childress 35-8 in a non-district game.

Childress (1-1) came into the game ranked No. 7 in Class 3A Division II.

But the Buckaroos (2-0) led 21-0 at halftime and outscored the Bobcats 14-8 in the third quarter.

“We handled the travel well and we got up there and played decent” Breckenridge coach Casey Pearce said. “We got after it pretty good.”

Pearce said the Bucks forced the Bobcats to punt a couple of times in the first half and also got some short drives thanks to Childress kicking game mistakes.

“We scored right before the half and we got it back after halftime and took it down and scored again” Pearce said. “That was good.”

Adrian Ruiz and Alejandro Franco each had TD catches for the Bucks.

The win sets up a showdown with another state-ranked team Cisco (2-0) which is No. 7 in Class 2A Division I.

“We’re excited” Pearce said. “We need to play the spoiler role and we need to worry about us. If we worry about us we’ve got a chance.

No. 7 Cisco edges Wall

At Wall Trenton Huston’s second touchdown run of the night a 5-yarder with 6:08 left in the third quarter lifted Cisco to an 18-14 victory over the Hawks in a non-district game.

It was the only score of the second half and allowed the Loboes – ranked No. 7 in Class 2A Division I – to win in Wall for the second consecutive year. They beat the Hawks 27-21 in two overtimes last year.

Wall (1-1) returned a Hunter Long fumble for the game’s first score with 4:07 left in the first quarter.

Cisco (2-0) pulled within one (7-6) on Huston’s 8-yard TD run with 7:27 left in the first half.

Tre Brackeen returned a Wall fumble to put the Loboes on top 12-7 but Canyon McCable ran 23 yards for a TD to give the Hawks a 14-12 advantage two minutes later.

It was a defensive slugfest. Cisco managed just 200 yards of total offense while Wall had 175. Both teams lost two fumbles and Wall also picked off a pass.

Long had a game-high 115 yards rushing on 30 carries and Huston added 58 on 18 carries.

Semiconductors or computer chips have attracted much attention lately. Nowadays they power a wide array of products and devices which are becoming more interconnected through the internet of things. Further the lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic sparked a huge surge in demand for laptops and other electronic devices causing a major shortage in the chip supply – a problem widely reported in the media and felt by consumers worldwide.

From an equities market perspective Nasdaq’s PHLX Semiconductor Sector IndexSM (SOXSM) has become one of the best-known and most widely tracked subsector indexes in the technology sector. Market participants not only invest in the underlying stocks in this industry but also ETFs that track SOX. Now they are also empowered to manage their exposure using the new CME Group E-mini PHLX Semiconductor Sector futures contract (ticker: SOX).

“Our partnership with CME Group continues to provide more choice and versatility for investors looking to manage risk and meet their investment objectives” says Sean Wasserman Vice President Global Head of Index & Advisor Solutions at Nasdaq. “As with our existing futures contracts we’re excited for the launch of the SOX futures and value the important role CME Group plays in the investment community.”

Nasdaq’s SOX index comprises companies primarily involved in the design distribution manufacture and sale of semiconductors including the top 30 securities by market capitalization in the semiconductor industry with U.S. listings. The top 10 holdings are Texas Instruments (TXN) Intel (INTC) Broadcom (AVGO) Nvidia (NVDA) Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Qualcomm (QCOM) KLA Corporation (KLAC) Analog Devices (ADI) Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM) and ASML (ASML). The index is modified market cap-weighted (8% capping for the top five constituents with the rest capped at 4%) on a quarterly rebalancing schedule. Constituents must have a listing in the U.S. on either the Nasdaq NYSE or CBOE exchanges. They are also required to meet minimum thresholds for market cap ($100 million) and liquidity (1.5 million shares traded in each of the last six months).

According to Paul Woolman Executive Director – Head of EMEA Equity and Alternative Index Products at CME Group sector dispersion is a key use case for the SOX futures contract. At any given time broad market indexes such as the S&P 500 Russell 2000 or Nasdaq-100 may be trending in one direction. However some sectors within those indexes may be performing very differently from each other and can move in the opposite direction. This dynamic presents an opportunity to trade one sector against another sector a sector against a broad index or a sector against one or more stocks in the sector.

“You’re expecting one sector to outperform or underperform the other exposure depending on your view” he explains. “In addition to this relative value trading opportunity sector futures also provide the ability for clients to go long or short in order to express a directional view to put on an overlay strategy or to risk manage a specific sector within their portfolio. These are all potential user cases for the new E-mini PHLX Semiconductor Sector futures.”

To this end it is not surprising that sector-based futures volumes and the number of participants using the contracts have increased with average daily volume up 56% since 2019. The main users are asset managers pension funds insurance companies and hedge funds who use the contracts typically for one of the use cases described above. Market makers and proprietary trading firms help to provide liquidity on the central limit order book whilst banks facilitate access to these contracts on behalf of their clients and provide both block and on-screen liquidity.

As of Aug. 8 2022 SOX futures may be traded on screen or as outright blocks. Block trades are privately negotiated transactions that meet certain quantity thresholds and are permitted to be executed apart from the public auction market.

However sometimes the block quantity may be too large and require a longer reporting period to allow the counterparties to hedge their exposure. As such SOX futures are eligible for derived block trading like the other 18 sector-based Equity Index futures contracts listed at CME Group. A derived block is a block trade consummated by eligible contract participants in which the price and quantity of the trade depends on hedging transactions in an eligible related market. Parties agree to the predefined notional or number of contracts and the market in which the hedging transaction will take place. Additionally a basis price is agreed to be added to the index price of the resultant hedge in the related market. Permitted hedging instruments include stock baskets and other eligible related market instruments such as ETFs.

“Derived blocks allow market participants to source liquidity in the underlying stocks in the index or in ETFs that track the index and then transfer the liquidity into the futures contracts” says Woolman.

Additionally SOX futures are eligible for Basis Trade at Index Close (BTIC) under the ticker SOT. These transactions enable market participants to trade futures contracts at a fixed spread or basis relative to the official index cash close. Market participants may also migrate their existing exposure into the futures contract through an Exchange of Futures for Physical (EFP). This is a private agreement between two parties to trade a futures position for the basket of underlying stocks or an ETF. EFPs can be used to open or close a futures position or switch a futures position for the underlying asset.

SOX futures are cost- capital- and tax efficient. Market participants can get exposure to the semiconductor subsector by putting up a small percentage of the notional amount as margin which can be offset against positions in other products at CME Group. Under section 1256 of the U.S. tax code profit and loss on these transactions are entitled to be taxed at a rate equal to 60% long-term and 40% short-term capital gain or loss. Finally SOX futures are UCITS eligible which is beneficial for EMEA-based investors.

CME Group has had great success partnering with Nasdaq on futures products. Woolman points out that the E-mini Nasdaq-100® Index (NDX®) futures contract is an important part of the equity ecosystem because the technology sector is a driver of equity markets and market cap. This is evidenced by the liquidity of the contract continuing to grow strongly over the last few years. Further technology tends to be one of the more volatile sectors.

“Clients who like trading tactically like to trade the Nasdaq-100” he says. “SOX will have its own unique risk profile and it will give clients greater choice.”

He has brought in creative producers and developers (“To have good content and a method to deliver it that’s what is at stake here"") he leased triple the studio space and spends hundreds of millions of koruna to create content. He reinvented the stagnating online project Voyo making it a pillar of his strategy and that now brings Nova hundreds of millions each year. Stoessel still sees a series of challenges: competition on the market (“our biggest competitor is sleep – that’s 6-7 hours per day when you don’t consume our content”) the economic slowdown or the constant drop in the viewership of linear broadcasting. How does one of the most significant television executives in Czechia plan to handle them?

Difficult times are coming to the Czech Republic. Inflation is climbing to 20% real wages are falling and a recession is on the horizon. What does this mean for TV Nova?

Of course we know what's going on. Difficult times are coming and not only for us TV companies but for most other industries as well. For us it is specific in that households have a designated budget for entertainment and the moment this budget comes under pressure we feel it.

Can you already see in your numbers that people are saving?

Not yet but it will come as households are exposed to ever higher costs. However even if the most difficult times await us I do not believe that they will change the overall trend - and that is the share of people who are looking for quality video content is growing. Yes there may be a slowdown a stutter we have to prepare and adapt to it but that doesn't mean we stop doing our jobs and offering people our content.

In addition the good news is that TV Nova is free to broadcast on terrestrial so a substantial part of our content can be watched by most households.

When Netflix presented its latest results it was revealed that it had lost over a million subscribers. As someone who is building a similar service in the Czech Republic - does it bother you?

Our positions are different. Netflix is ​​in 70% of households in the US market and clearly when you have that kind of penetration and you're newly competing with a growing number of other streaming companies there are going to be fluctuations.

However the situation is different in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The rate of penetration of SVOD services here is only around 25% so I don't think we should see such a sharp decline. On the other hand low penetration means a big opportunity and I'm confident that whether it takes three years or five years we'll eventually catch up with America and Western Europe.

The SVOD service Voyo is a bet on the future for TV Nova. You make it clear that you want to reach a million subscribers within three years. Are online video libraries like Voyo or Netflix the future of television? It may be fashionable to think so now. SVOD is in the limelight and these services are mushrooming. But SVOD is only one part of the answer. What I'm really after is coming up with the ideal mix of channels through which our viewers can watch premium video. I want to create a durable resistant model such as the Nova Content Hub where everyone will choose a service according to their preferences: some will watch linear TV some SVOD some AVOD and others will prefer formats like HbbTV. My goal is not to focus on a single channel in this ecosystem but to deliver content on each of them: each of us is different and each of us watches TV differently - my job is to have all these ways captured - and to be present in as many homes tablets and mobile phones as possible. If we stay briefly with Voyo - the trend in the world today is to introduce ad-supported SVOD subscription models. They are offered by HBO or Hulu it is being tested by Netflix and others. Is this an approach that makes sense from your point of view? The reason why Netflix and others introduce ad-supported subscriptions is simple - if you have the aforementioned 70% market penetration and want to get another 10-15% of households you need to introduce a cheaper subscription model to attract new customers. And this is happening now although the implementation of ad-supported SVOD services will be interesting to watch in practice. Personally I'm not at all sure this ad-supported subscription model will be implemented in Western markets especially in the premium US market because by getting Netflix to take on a new 10% of subscribers they could also cannibalize 20% of current subscribers who are currently paying full price. On the contrary this model will almost certainly be introduced in Asia for example in India where Netflix could gain tens of millions of potential subscribers.

You aren’t considering a similar model for Voyo?

No we’re not. Voyo is in a different situation. It's a premium product where the original content is constantly growing: We currently have 35 scripted projects in development pre-production or production. When I joined CME two years ago we had three such programs.

Is this programming offensive coming at the expense of linear television?

We manage both. We also are preparing a lot of new programs for linear broadcasting. We will present the autumn program schedule this week and I think the audience will be surprised. I'll compare it again to when PPF acquired TV Nova which I described at the time as a sleeping giant with not enough development or new ideas.

I said at that time that my mission was to reinvent TV Nova and now we are in the middle of that process. Storytelling the content we produce is key. In the television business you either make people laugh or cry or you're not going to be successful. It's that simple. Therefore I focus half of my time on the development of new content thanks to which we have a strong creative team that maybe surpasses the capabilities of Czech Television. “In the television business you either make people laugh or cry or you're not going to be successful.”

Last week your competitor Prima TV announced the arrival of its own SVOD platform. Isn't the Czech market small for two local services?

Maybe it will sound arrogant of me but I don't see them as our competition. I'll say it again in numbers: We currently produce around 35 different shows for Voyo. They announced three or four. There is a quantum difference in how much work and energy we devote to the development of our SVOD platforms at both stations. With all due respect - it's night and day. But to answer the question: Yes the Czech market is too small for two local platforms and two services with local content will not survive. In addition an SVOD service is not something you can do half throttle. You need a dedicated long-term strategy. It takes four to five years to get anywhere. We at TV Nova decided to build a premium service to produce local content. Within two years we had hired 10 to 12 creative producers we tripled our production capacity the number of studios we rent for filming also increased. Voyo currently has close to 400000 subscribers. Our ambitions are of course seven figures and quite frankly it's quite clear that there's no room for two players here.

You yourself said a while ago that Voyo was also involved in three original productions two years ago. Are you not underestimating Prima?

I'm not underestimating them but I prefer looking forward rather than backwards and my competition is Netflix. They can't catch up to us because of the current bottleneck in creative production capacity.

Which is limited in the Czech Republic.

Exactly. We realized very early on that in order to grow and scale very quickly we needed to hire and train enough creative producers. We succeeded in this also thanks to the fact that we were able to recruit talent – such as Michal Reitler for example - from competing stations and thereby secure capacity. But you won't that creative production capacity on the market anymore - and it is clear from this that the local SVOD market is a ""winner takes it all"" proposition. Personally I can't even imagine how it would be possible to build a new SVOD service with a production capacity of around 30 originals a year. In short objectively there are not enough people here who could handle it. Furthermore we’re launching the CME Content Academy where we want to support new talents and the beginning of their careers in TV by incorporating them into our production process..

Is the previously speculated Czechflix project done for good?

First: I don't believe Czechflix was ever a realistic proposition. Second a similar approach in Europe has not worked look at the results of Britbox or other similar services in France or Germany. I think that the idea of ​​Czechflix arose from the fact that nobody in the Czech Republic wanted to invest heavily in their own SVOD service - and everyone waited until we took up the gauntlet at TV Nova. And we are now extremely confident that our content distribution strategy is correct we currently have close to 400 000 Voyo subscribers in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Netflix has around 600-700 000 in the Czech Republic.

Based on your research?

Yes in the Czech Republic and Slovakia they might have between 900 000 and one million subscribers but of course only they know the real numbers. But the growth rate is key. In the last two years we have grown practically from zero to number two in the market which shows not that only are people interested in quality local content but also that we are probably doing something right.

Okay but how many of those 400000 people are actual subscribers who voluntarily pay for Voyo - and how many of them gained access through a marketing campaign?

About 98% of our subscribers are people who have proactively decided to subscribe to Voyo themselves. We have some marketing events - and we'll be focusing a lot more on that in the next six months - but the subscribers we have now are completely organic. They subscribe to us themselves and directly for the full price. We do not give any discounts apart from the 7-day trial.

Some time ago Netflix identified neither HBO or cable TV as its biggest competitor but the online game Fortnite. Do you agree with that view?

Our biggest competitor is sleep – that's the six to seven hours a day you're not consuming our content. But if we look at the time you're awake in the United States the proportion of time people spend on online entertainment is something like this: basically 20% is spent on social media 20% on cable TV 25% on streaming and the rest goes to gaming and other activities. It is thus clear that all online activities including gaming are big competition for us the boundaries are blurring and everything is now about content about entertainment. This is the reason why I say that I am not competing with other local broadcasters. I compete with all services for which Czech households spend money from their entertainment and content consumption budget - whether it's cinema SVOD services or mobile games. And I'm mostly interested in how much time households choose to spend with my content compared with other types of online entertainment.

Once again we are back to the content.

Content is where it all starts. Unless you are the strongest storyteller and the strongest local content producer you can't even think about creating the Nova Hub I spoke about earlier.



But you are talking about premium content?

Of course. From time to time we see new TV channels pop up on the Czech market which to be honest are basically just an aggregation of foreign content. Someone simply buys content from foreign studios aggregates it and puts ads in the background. But this isn’t the future of television. This is the approach that will soon be overtaken by streaming companies be it AVOD or SVOD. And personally I am no longer interested in bluntly adding channels with foreign content. That is a game of the past. I want to focus on building a form and content that is relevant now. “Voyo currently has close to 400 000 subscribers. Our ambitions are of course seven figures and quite frankly it's quite clear that there's no room for two players here.”

What does all this mean for classic linear TV? Where can it excel?

There are still plenty of room. Take the evening news for example. They don’t have that on Netflix. We have the most popular news in the country every day at 19.30 which is watched by 1.7 million people. That's a huge number of people - and of course huge advertising potential. It can also excel in local content - that's why when we present the program for the autumn season there will be 5-6 days dedicated to local content. In the spring season we will broadcast local content six days a week.

What exactly does that mean?

That we will broadcast either a Czech series a Czech reality show or another Czech product. If you look at our program a few years back it was more based on foreign production. We don't want to go in that direction anymore. On the contrary we will be local. And this applies to both linear and non-linear production. We don't want to focus only on content for Voyo. We're also putting huge effort into recreating TV Nova as I mentioned. We're still airing some long-running shows and that's why great. But I'm also looking forward to being able to supplement them during the next year: between spring and autumn we will launch 6 new series purely for linear TV.

Is the role of linear television changing with the advent of online video stores such as Voyo or Netflix?

The linear world whether you like it or not is already becoming a non-linear world especially as time-shifted viewing increases dramatically. In the last ten years we have seen a decrease in viewership of linear broadcasting by two to three percentage points per year but the number of people who watch our content does not change - It is stable. What we lose in live linear broadcasting we gain in time-shifted viewing. And even though I am convinced the viewership of live broadcasts will continue to decrease slightly in the years to come we must not forget that people in the Czech Republic still spend more than 4 hours a day in front of screens and linear broadcasting is thus still an important source of content consumption.

However it also depends on who is watching it. Advertising's lucrative Generation Z has all but abandoned it.

But Gen Z also wants to watch great stories and original content. That hasn't changed. It's just the way young people want to consume these stories. They want freedom the ability to watch stories when it suits them not the TV and with the option to eliminate ads. And this is all possible if you have good content and you can adapt to them both in terms of content and technology. After content technology is the second most important area that we emphasize. Voyo has become a very technologically advanced platform and we are still working on it. We're not at Netflix’s level yet but we're getting close. If you ask me about the two biggest changes to the soul of TV Nova where we are changing what the brand means what our DNA is the first is storytelling and greater drama/script capacity and the second is technological excellence. For comparison: Two years ago we started with around 30 digital professionals who took care of the development of our platforms. Now we have about 170. Great production quality and technological understanding and excellence are two things you absolutely need as a CEO. In today's television world if you have these two competencies you will succeed. Content without the right technologies will get only you halfway. If viewers experience choppy images the platform crashes or they can't download their favourite movie you won't get very far. Image quality latency download capacity: They cost us a lot of time and resources but they are extremely important.

When you joined the group you heralded TV Nova's return to prominence. However the group's ratings have been steadily declining in the last four years.

The numbers you are basing it on are from the 15+ audience which I never look at. Our strategy is aimed at the 15-54 age group. Just to remind you TV Nova is at least double the size of the next local broadcaster. I for myself sometimes follow the even more specific category 15-40 where we have a share of over 40% and we are much better represented in this group of viewers than the competition. The data clearly confirms that we have the youngest demographic profile of all major television stations. The reason why the 15-54 category is so extremely relevant to us is that it is required of us by advertisers. They try to reach a younger audience and create brand awareness for their product which if they succeed often means they manage to create a relationship between the brand and the consumer for life. That's why younger audiences are so important - and I'm extremely happy that we have that group of viewers. And a word about ratings - rating numbers are not as simple as they often seem. You need to have a comprehensive picture in front of you because as you create new distribution channels you partially cannibalize your older traditional channels. For example we recently calculated that if Voyo were a separate TV channel it would have a market share of about 4%. If you wanted to be consistent and measure the Nova group's share you would have to take Nova's current market share and add 4 percentage points to it. Same with our AVOD platform that would also add another few percentage points. In other words the better channels you use to deliver content to viewers today the more pressure it puts on your traditional channels in this case linear broadcasting because you give viewers a better chance to watch the content they like.

So are viewership ratings still meaningful to you?

Of course but you have to look at the total numbers. I'll give an example: an episode of Survivor a show aimed at a young audience which by the way worked great on Voyo. Even before the episode hit TV screens 120 000 people watched it in Preview mode. Subsequently it went on linear where it was watched by approximately 320 000 people who turned it on live or watched it with delayed viewing and after three days another 50-60 000 people played it on our website and other places. If you add it up it’s a different number place than if you're only interested in live numbers.

Does this mean we need a new metric to measure viewership?

It’s rather about changing the current approach. We want to focus more and more on how to measure the overall consumption of premium video rather than the viewership of individual channels. In the future the market will fragment more and more and we do not want to get into a situation where we would measure something that would not in principle reflect the real state of viewership.

Are you working on it yet?

Yes we have a pilot project where we measure where and how our premium content is viewed. As I mentioned we invest a lot of energy and money into content. Every hour of filming costs us millions of crowns so we want to be really sure we can correctly measure the impact of such content.

“If you look at our program a few years back it was more based on foreign production. We don't want to go in that direction anymore. On the contrary we will be local.”

When PPF bought the CME group two years ago many expected synergies with telecom operator O2. However we don't see much of that yet. Will it change?

I'll start in broad terms: The media has undergone a major transformation in the last decade or two. 20 years ago top management practically only dealt with producers and advertisers. They didn't really know much about who their audience was. Of course such an approach no longer holds up today. A b2b (business to business) principle is changing to d2c (direct to consumer). And who is the best in d2c? Telecommunications operators that have millions of clients tried and tested technological systems and the appropriate know-how. And regarding our synergies with O2 it was clear that before we could offer Voyo to a wider audience through this operator for example we needed to make it an excellent product both in terms of technology and content. We didn't have that two years ago.

Today however Voyo meets these demands.

Yes today we are where we want to be. So if you’re asking me about d2c in the coming weeks and months we will be announcing several partnerships with telecom operators – basically joining forces with them to reach an even wider audience with our product. As for working with O2 they are a sister company so a partnership there is more than logical. On the other hand our aim is to be the market leader and in this position we want to deal with all relevant parties.

TV Nova has not yet released its financial results for last year. Can you give us an indication of what they will be?

Good. Sales exceeded six billion koruna. A year earlier during the covid period we were just over five billion. But we'll see how it goes. As you mentioned economically difficult times await the entire Czech Republic.

Voyo revenue should be in the high hundreds of millions this year if I'm doing my math right?

I'm sure you can do the math. As I just told you 98% of subscriptions are d2c so just multiply that by the number of subscribers and the retail price minus VAT.

So about 600 million crowns. Within three years when you want to have a million subscribers this will be a solid income vertical.

Yes but I don't look at it that way. More fundamental is the question of how much of the content people will watch non-linearly in 2025. And the answer is that about half: through time-shift which today has a share of 15-18% it will be 30 percent in three years. SVOD will also continue to grow and when I say we want to get to a million subscribers I'm being conservative. And AVOD will represent 5-10% of viewership. When you add it up possibly up to 50% of our revenues will come from sources other than advertising.

When you mention time-shift - Prima recently banned operators from skipping ads. Will you follow?

It is not planned now. We are in a slightly different position than our competitor. The difference is in our strong viewership. By having higher absolute viewership we don't have to repeat ads as many times as our competitors so we have fewer of them and skipping ads in delayed viewership mode doesn't burn us as much as them. In other words in order to reach for example a million people we only need to play the ad 5 times not 20 times.

At the same time advertisers and their agencies have to fulfil their campaign reach such as 60% of the population and they want to ensure that people see the commercial at least 3 times during the campaign. And despite skipping commercials we are able to deliver such an assignment relatively easily and quickly - as I mentioned - if we have a viewership of 1.7 million in prime time it's not that complicated. But when you have more fragmented content it's more difficult - and you're looking for a place where it’s possible.

Global investment firm KKR-backed Virescent Renewable Energy Trust is in advanced stages of discussion to acquire 100MW solar assets from Jakson Group . The 100MW portfolio comprises three operational solar power projects in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan and has a power purchase agreement (PPA) with NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd and Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation for 25 years.Headquartered in Mumbai Virescent was established to acquire operating assets and leverage investment opportunities in the fast-growing renewable energy sector.Virescent is the only infrastructure trust (InvIT) in India in the renewable energy space it said in a statement.Virescent completed the acquisition of one of the three projects -- 12.4 MW project at Lalitpur -- earlier this month. Jakson Group owns and operates around 200MW of solar portfolio across four projects. It had recently announced the commissioning of a 70MW project in Assam.It recently announced its new venture Jakson Green Pvt Ltd (JGPL) which will focus on green energy.""With the conclusion of this transaction VRET (Virescent) will come closer to its aim of achieving a 1.5GW portfolio of assets in the initial phase of its growth over the next two-three years.""Virescent will expand its diversified portfolio of operational renewable energy assets by identifying investment opportunities that have stable cash flows stemming from long-term contracts with state and central government-owned power utilities across India"" he added.Earlier Virescent had acquired assets from Shapoorji Focal Sindicatum and Godawari Power  and Ispat . The Jakson acquisition would take Virescent's total operational solar capacity to 600MW.The AUM (asset under management) of Virescent as of March 31 2022 stands at around Rs 3850 crore which will go to Rs 4250 crore with Jakson acquisition.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2NyeXB0b2N1cnJlbmN5L3RoZS1jcnlwdG8td29ybGQtY2FudC13YWl0LWZvci10aGUtbWVyZ2UvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTM5NjM4NDkuY21z0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY3kvdGhlLWNyeXB0by13b3JsZC1jYW50LXdhaXQtZm9yLXRoZS1tZXJnZS9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTM5NjM4NDkuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The crypto world can't wait for 'the Merge',"







SAN FRANCISCO - The cryptocurrency industry has endured a terrible year. A devastating crash wiped nearly $1 trillion from the market draining the savings of thousands of people. Several companies filed for bankruptcy.Now the industry is fixated on a potential saving grace: a long-awaited software upgrade to the most popular cryptocurrency platform ethereum  which provides the technological backbone for thousands of crypto projects. The upgrade - known as the Merge - has gained near-mythical status after years of delays that left some insiders questioning whether it would ever happen.But if all goes according to plan the Merge will take place around Sept. 15 more than eight years after it was initially discussed. The change would shift ethereum to a more energy-efficient infrastructure addressing the widespread criticism that crypto's climate effect outweighs its possible benefits. And it would lay the foundation for future upgrades to reduce the hefty fees required to conduct transactions in Ether the platform's signature currency and the second-most valuable digital asset after bitcoin.""This transition is essentially laying a road map to a future which is far more scalable far more energy efficient and a lot more usable to the normal person"" said Joseph Ayoub an analyst at Citi who has studied the Merge. ""It's laying the groundwork for adoption.""But the risks are profound. Even by crypto standards the process is almost ludicrously complicated.For months insiders have engaged in frantic jargon-heavy discussions of developments such as the Goerli Testnet Merge and the Beacon Chain's Bellatrix upgrade crucial software changes leading up to the main event. A botched Merge would imperil the thousands of crypto applications that operate using ethereum which collectively handle more than $50 billion in user funds.""It's flying the jet and changing the engine in the sky"" said Chandler Guo a crypto industry veteran who leads a group opposing the Merge. ""It's very difficult. It's very dangerous.""Ethereum is a blockchain a publicly viewable ledger on which exchanges of digital coins are recorded. Transactions on the chain are conducted in Ether.The platform was started in 2013 by a teenage programmer Vitalik Buterin who is now regarded as one of the industry's elder statesmen. Buterin wanted to create a crypto system that was more flexible than bitcoin and could instantly execute financial contracts and other complex forms of exchange.Ethereum's design allows it to support a range of financial engineering. Programmers can build applications using the software to perform more complicated tasks than simple money transfers. Thousands of businesses and projects in the experimental world of decentralized finance now use the platform to offer lending borrowing and other sophisticated investment options. Many non-fungible tokens - the unique digital collectibles known as NFTs - are built on ethereum.At its core the Merge is a change to ethereum's verification system. When someone sends money in a traditional transaction a bank serves as the middleman verifying that one person has sufficient funds to pay someone else.Crypto operates without that middleman. In this alternate financial system transactions are verified by a scattered network of computers. Anyone can plug a machine into the network by running software that solves complex puzzles an energy-guzzling process for confirming transactions. Essentially the computers are racing one another: When the puzzle is solved the winning participants are rewarded with new coins in the digital currency they are verifying.This verification process is widely known as crypto mining and has the technical name ""proof of work."" By some estimates the amount of energy consumed each year in mining is comparable to the annual emissions of entire countries.The Merge is set to shift ethereum to an alternate framework called ""proof of stake"" which requires less energy. In a proof-of-stake system computers don't burn energy racing to verify transactions. Instead crypto investors deposit a certain number of digital coins in a shared pool which enters them into a lottery. Each time an exchange happens a participant is selected from the lottery to verify the transaction and win the rewards.The shift is expected to cut ethereum's energy use by more than 99% which crypto boosters hope will make the technology more popular.""The difference in hardware and energy consumption is so significant"" said Preston Van Loon a developer working on the Merge. ""When NFTs were blowing up people were saying 'I'd love to have an NFT but it feels like I'm burning a forest down.' ""Switching to proof of stake could also help solve another of ethereum's biggest problems: the substantial fees required to use the network. Ethereum can handle only a certain amount of activity at a time so when there's demand for the platform the price of using it goes up. Anyone sending ether must pay a ""gas fee"" - a transaction charge that at times has risen as high as $200.The Merge won't eliminate that problem immediately but developers say it will lay critical groundwork for future upgrades designed to minimize fees.But a change on this scale could also make ethereum vulnerable to hacks or other disruptions some crypto experts say. ""Any time you're making changes to a complex system there must necessarily arise unintended consequences"" said Christopher Calicott a crypto venture investor.Much of the criticism is fueled at least partly by self-interest. Many of the Merge's most vocal opponents are businesses that have built expensive data centers to mine ether in the proof-of-work system.The Merge's origins date to the time of ethereum's creation. Buterin raised the possibility of switching to proof of stake in 2014 but at that point the system was untested. The most successful cryptocurrency was bitcoin which uses proof of work.Since then many newer cryptocurrencies have used proof of stake successfully. Ethereum programmers have been working in earnest on the switch for at least four years. The work is complex and progress has been slow. Engineers had to construct a new blockchain and run tests to check for security holes or other technological bugs that might disrupt the transition.A nonprofit called the Ethereum Foundation helps supervise the platform. But in reality ethereum is run by a loose group of engineers across the world; no top-down authority orchestrated the Merge. Periodically programmers get together on publicly streamed video calls to debate technical aspects of the shift.At one point the shift to proof of stake was supposed to happen as early as 2016. As the Merge came together this year crypto enthusiasts expected a June launch date. Then the Merge was pushed back to August. Now it's set for next month.In the crypto world the delays became a kind of joke. Early on engineers installed what's known as a ""difficulty bomb"" in ethereum's code. It was designed to keep them honest: After a set amount of time the bomb was to go off causing disruptions in the ethereum network unless it was switched to proof of stake. But every time the bomb was supposed to go off the engineers created a new bit of code to defuse it somewhat defeating the point.""We're not doing this lightly"" said Danny Ryan an Ethereum Foundation researcher who has worked on the platform since 2017. ""There's been countless amount of engineering and testing and academic vetting.""In December 2020 ethereum programmers took a big step toward the Merge by releasing a crypto platform called the Beacon Chain a proof-of-stake system designed to provide the foundation for an upgraded ethereum. After two years of testing the Beacon Chain is finally set to integrate with ethereum in mid-September - the merge that gives the process its name.As the Merge draws nearer companies and entrepreneurs with a financial stake in ethereum mining are growing increasingly concerned. Crypto mining has become a multibillion-dollar business dominated by publicly traded companies.In a recent corporate report Hive Blockchain a crypto mining firm that draws revenue from both bitcoin and ethereum said a switch to proof of stake ""may render our mining business less competitive or less profitable."" Hive did not respond to requests for comment.Some ethereum miners are fighting back. Guo who used to run an ethereum mining operation in China has mobilized a group of engineers who are working on an alternate currency to rival the upgraded Ether.Despite the pushback the Merge appears close to completion. A final test known as the Goerli merge was finished successfully this month.Ryan said he planned to gather in person with some colleagues to mark the actual Merge the culmination of five years of his professional life.Planning the celebration is complicated. While developers have estimated a Sept. 15 date the Merge's precise timing is uncertain and subject to complex technical factors. Any glitch could cause another delay.""This might happen at 4 in the morning. It might happen at 2 in the afternoon"" Ryan said. ""But I'll definitely be awake.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvcmVuZXdhYmxlcy9nb3Z0LWV4ZW1wdHMtY3BzZXMtaW4tcmUtcHJvamVjdHMtZnJvbS1jaGluYS1jZW50cmljLWltcG9ydC1jdXJicy9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85MzkzNTYwOC5jbXPSAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL2luZHVzdHJ5L3JlbmV3YWJsZXMvZ292dC1leGVtcHRzLWNwc2VzLWluLXJlLXByb2plY3RzLWZyb20tY2hpbmEtY2VudHJpYy1pbXBvcnQtY3VyYnMvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkzOTM1NjA4LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Govt exempts CPSEs in RE projects from China-centric import curbs,"

Making a major exception for Renewable Energy projects by Central Public Sector enterprises CPSEs) the Centre has exempted them from a 2020 financial rule brought in to restrict imports from firms based in China and other countries ‘sharing land borders’ with India CPSEs will now be able to import four categories of items freely from any country including China which heavily dominates the RE supply chain.The exempted categories are 1) solar photo voltaic cells wafers EVA backsheet and frames 2) inverters 3)trackers and 4) battery energy storage system components which include cells battery packs and power conditioning systems.An office memorandum issued by the Department of Expenditure dated August 4 informs of the exemption granted following a request from the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) and consequent deliberations by a Committee of Secretaries.There are over 360 CPSEs in India and several of them like the National Thermal Power Corporation NTPC ) are now working on RE projects as India looks to ramp up to meet ambitious targets.This exemption from Rule 144 (xi) will in effect enable NTPC and other CPSEs engaged in RE projects to cut costs by directly importing from bidders/companies from China without the requirement of their registration in India.The larger aim is to ensure a ‘level playing field’ with other private sector competitors who do not face such import restrictions. Rule 144 (xi) of the GFR was however flagged off by CPSEs as a difficult area for many RE supply chain related items.In July 2020 soon after the Galwan clashes India had tightened public procurement from firms based inChina and other countries that shared a land border with it citing Mission Aatmanirbhar Bharat. The change was introduced through Rule 144 (xi) of the General Financial Rules that govern public procurement in India. Rule 144 (xi) to GFR directed that any bidder from a country –– for any goods/services including consultancy and non consultancy services and turnkey projects –– that shares a land border with India will have to be registered with a competent authority.Government ministries and departments apart this applies to all autonomous bodies public sector banks and financial institutions PPP projects and so on.NTPC the state-owned power and energy behemoth also came under the purview of GFR Rule 144(xi)among other CPSEs engaged in RE projects. However since import dependence is still high in the RE sector and is mainly addressed through Chinese firms the registration requirement put the CPSEs at serious pricing disadvantage vis a vis private sector competitors.CPSEs have largely had to import the same through the engineering procurement and construction(EPC) contractors they engaged. This raised the overall project cost and hit the CPSEs considerably at a time when they are scaling up renewable energy projects.The sector has also come under pressure with domestic manufacture of these items still not in tune with the market demand and the high import duties on items like solar PV cells.The issue was taken up by the MNRE and discussed threadbare in rounds of inter-ministerial discussions this year as reported by ET on April 9.Besides GFR Rule 144(xi) the government has also been discussing various public procurement orders of 2017 issued by the Department for Promotion of Industry & Internal Trade (DPIIT) on similar issues raised by other ministries."

This change is in conjunction with the inaugural sailing of the cruise line’s newest vessel Norwegian Prima which is already serving Coca-Cola beverages.

New Partnership Announced

With Norwegian Prima already serving Coca-Cola products onboard Norwegian Cruise Line president and CEO Harry Sommer officially announced the new partnership with a toast with the iconic Coca-Cola Polar Bear at the ship’s three-story glass-walled Penrose Atrium.

“With the historic debut of Norwegian Prima Norwegian Cruise Line continues to push boundaries across every element of the guest experience so it’s perfectly fitting that we are unveiling and bringing on board a fresh new beverage partnership with Coca-Cola during the christening of Norwegian Prima” Sommer said.

“As a company rooted in history Norwegian Cruise Line is honored to align with a fellow beloved brand Coca-Cola and we look forward to leveraging this relationship to continue to enhance our guest experience.”

Cruise lines often offer exclusive partnerships with beverage companies with carefully negotiated contracts. These contracts may include better pricing and incentives to be an exclusive beverage partner than if multiple brands were offered on a single ship.

Similar exclusive partnerships are common at theme parks hotel chains and sports stadiums. Other cruise lines currently offering Coca-Cola products include Disney Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean International.

Where to Find Coca-Cola Products

The new Norwegian Prima is the first vessel in Norwegian’s 18-ship fleet to carry Coca-Cola as its official soft drink. The remaining NCL ships will all be fully switched over to Coca-Cola products by December 2022.

Guests onboard different vessels have already reported the expanding availability of Coca-Cola drinks including on Norwegian Breakaway Norwegian Epic and Norwegian Joy.

Additional ships will begin offering Coca-Cola beverages as bars and lounges can be adequately supplied but there has been no calendar announced of which ships will have which drinks when. For the next few weeks it is possible that guests on different ships may be enjoying different brands of soft drinks.

It can be a challenge to make the switch even on a single ship since each vessel has many different bars lounges and restaurants that all need to be equipped with adequate supplies and new branding to promote the new partnership.

Norwegian Prima for example features more than 30 bars lounges and restaurants that must be prepared to meet drink needs.

The largest ships in Norwegian Cruise Line’s fleet the Breakaway-Plus vessels – Norwegian Escape Norwegian Joy Norwegian Bliss and Norwegian Encore – have up to 22 bars and lounges all of which have to be supplied with the new drink options not counting restaurants and dining venues.

On some ships minibars in suites or other staterooms must also be fill with appropriate beverages and drinks must also be made available through room service and dining room operations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhZGJpYmxlLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2tlYW51LXJlZXZlcy1jb2NhLWNvbGEtYWR2ZXJ0LTIwMjIwOTAy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Keanu Reeves went from starring in Coca-Cola advert to being the nicest man in Hollywood,"As the actor celebrates his 58th birthday we look at how far he's come

As Keanu Reeves celebrates his 58th birthday today (2 September) a Coca-Cola advert has resurfaced showing just how far the nicest man in Hollywood has come.

In one of his earliest acting jobs in 1983 Reeves played the part of a competitive cyclist in a Coca-Cola ad who is seen crossing the finish line and being presented with a refreshing Coca-Cola by his proud dad. Check it out below:

Since his humble ad days he has risen to unprecedented fame in films such as Point Break The Matrix and the John Wick franchise.

Advert

Several people commenting on his old advert have highlighted how his acting has improved since then.

One person wrote: “He sure has grown as an actor"" while another commented that the ad shows all the hard work he’s done to get to where he is today.

Another said: “Keanu is the real human being in Hollywood.”

And it’s certainly true.

Coca-Cola

Over the years as well as incredible list of films he’s starred in the 58-year-old has also won himself the accolade of nicest man in Hollywood.

Advert

Many stories have circulated about his random acts of kindness as well as what a good person he is and the best part about it is that they’re not something he shouts about himself.

He really seems to be a genuinely nice guy.

In fact his nice guy anecdotes include him waiting in the rain for 20 minutes to go to his own wrap party as well as returning someone’s lost bank card.

There are even tales of him hanging out with homeless people not as some sort of PR stunt but because he simply cared as well as an incident of him driving a girl 50 miles out of his way because her car had broken down.

More recently he turned up to a couple’s wedding in Nottinghamshire and posed for pictures after meeting them at the bar at the hotel he was staying at.

But despite many reports of his good deeds being published it’s something the actor is very modest about.

When he was asked his thoughts on being called the nicest man in Hollywood while promoting The Matrix Resurrections last year he seemed visibly embarrassed and couldn’t stop laughing feeling awkward at the question.

If anything this only makes him even more of a legend.

TIMESOFINDIA.COM Updated: Sep 3 2022 23:29 IST IST

The colas developed marketing as a discipline and perhaps it’s this that Reliance wants to tap into. With a new generation of leaders from the business family soon to take over perhaps they feel that company could use some sprinkling of cola marketing spirit

Mukesh Ambani ’s decision to buy the Campa-Cola brand for a rumoured Rs 22 crore and relaunch it this year has been greeted as a triumph of nostalgia marketing. It gives Reliance ’s fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) portfolio a brand with strong recognition if mostly among a slightly ageing demographic. And it’s got considerable media publicity possibly because many journalists and editors are in that demographic.

Campa’s nostalgia factor has been promoted by films like Ritesh Batra’s romance Photograph (2019) where Miloni one of the leads remembers her grandfather buying her a Campa-Cola every day. But after he died and the Campa factory shut down she never touched another cola and finding her a bottle is a quest for Rafi the other protagonist."

A group of university and college presidents and chancellors who oversee the College Football Playoff on Friday unanimously voted to expand the current four-team model to 12 teams beginning with the 2026 season.

However the College Football Playoff leadership has been tasked with assessing the possibility of beginning the expanded playoff as early as 2024.

""This is an historic and exciting day for college football"" Mississippi State University President Mark Keenum who serves as chairman of the College Football Playoff Board of Managers said in a news release announcing the decision. ""More teams more participation and more excitement are good for our fans alumni and student-athletes. I'm grateful to my colleagues on the board for their thoughtful approach to this issue and for their resolve to get expansion across the goal line and for the extensive work of the management committee that made this decision possible.""

Darron Cummings/AP Georgia head coach Kirby Smart celebrates after his team defeated Alabama in the College Football Playoff National Championship game Monday Jan. 10 2022 in Indianapolis. The Bulldogs won 33-18.

The College Football Playoff Management Committee comprised of the 10 conference commissioners and Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick must still determine the sites and dates of the 11 games.

Under the expanded playoff the six highest-ranked conference champions will receive automatic berths plus the six highest-ranked teams not included among the highest-ranked conference champions.

The four highest-ranked conference champions will each receive a first-round bye while the either other teams will play in the first round with the higher seeds hosting the lower seeds either on campus or at another site designated by the higher-seeded institution.

Wilfredo Lee/AP Alabama celebrates after defeating Ohio State in the College Football Playoff National Championship game Monday Jan. 11 2021 in Miami Gardens Fla. The Crimson Tide won 52-24.

There will be at least 12 days between the conference championship games and the first-round games. Higher-seeded teams will receive preferential placement in the semifinal games.

""I'm very pleased we were able to get this accomplished and I look forward to expansion taking place"" Keenum said. ""The four-team playoff has been highly popular and successful. I believe this new format will be even more popular and successful.""

The ESPN report centered on a 2019 phone call between Paulson and North Carolina Courage owner Steve Malik. Riley was the head coach of the Courage at the time.

During the phone call Paulson told Malik that Riley should withdraw his name from consideration for the position of U.S. women’s national team manager because it would draw attention to the nature of his firing from Portland.

In 2015 the Thorns said Riley’s contract was not renewed due to poor performance but he was terminated for cause after then-Thorns player Mana Shim accused him of sexual harassment and coercion. Her account corroborated by then-teammate Sinead Farrelly only became public in October 2021 via a report published in The Athletic.

Morgan currently stars for the USWNT and the San Diego Wave but she played for the Thorns from 2013-15. While with the club she helped Shim email her complaint about Riley to Paulson per The Athletic.

“We (the players of the NWSL especially players in Portland) deserve so much better than a boys club protecting their own” Morgan said.

The Thorns issued a statement in response to the ESPN report calling it “an extremely biased and misleading article” but Morgan called the team’s statement “just pathetic.”

Shim also commented on ESPN’s story tweeting: “The problem was not just that that they knew and said nothing. They did everything they could to keep the truth from coming out. We need to protect players and hold people accountable when they don’t.”

Shim and Farrelly’s account published in The Athletic spurred a reckoning throughout the NWSL leading to new leadership and a groundbreaking collective bargaining agreement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNoZWNrZXJlZGZsYWcuY28udWsvMjAyMi8wOS9ob21ldG93bi1oZXJvLW1heC12ZXJzdGFwcGVuLXRha2VzLWRyYW1hdGljLXBvbGUtYXQtdGhlLWR1dGNoLWdyYW5kLXByaXgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hometown Hero Max Verstappen takes dramatic pole at the Dutch Grand Prix,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.thecheckeredflag.co.uk', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/09/hometown-hero-max-verstappen-takes-dramatic-pole-at-the-dutch-grand-prix/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016710575210>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNoZWNrZXJlZGZsYWcuY28udWsvMjAyMi8wOS9ob21ldG93bi1oZXJvLW1heC12ZXJzdGFwcGVuLXRha2VzLWRyYW1hdGljLXBvbGUtYXQtdGhlLWR1dGNoLWdyYW5kLXByaXgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Starbucks Corp on Thursday named Laxman Narasimhan as its next chief executive officer choosing an executive credited with revitalizing the maker of Lysol disinfectants to undertake a ""reinvention"" of the world's biggest coffee chain.

Narasimhan was CEO of Reckitt which also makes Durex condoms Enfamil baby formula and Mucinex cold syrup. He announced his departure from that post earlier in the day and FTSE-listed Reckitt's shares fell 4%.

Starbucks faces a turbulent period. More than 200 of its U.S. stores have unionized in the past year with workers pushing for better benefits and wages at a time of surging inflation.

The company is also reworking its business model from a focus on cafes that encouraged long visits to mobile pickup and delivery while facing higher costs for ingredients and labor. Also COVID restrictions in China have slowed the U.S. coffee chain's business in one of its biggest overseas markets.

Narasimhan will join Starbucks in October but will take the helm in April 2023 after spending a few months learning about the company and its ""Reinvention"" plan which includes paying better wages for baristas improving employee welfare and customer experience and re-imagining stores.

Until then interim-CEO Howard Schultz who took back the reins of the company for the third time in April after Kevin Johnson retired will continue to lead the company.

""He is a strategic and transformational leader with deep experience in building powerful consumer brands"" Schultz said in a letter to employees welcoming Narasimhan.

BALANCED APPROACH

Narasimhan joined Reckitt in September 2019 and was the first external candidate to take the helm at Reckitt since it was formed in 1999.

He led the company through the pandemic which boosted sales of its health and hygiene products and more recently navigated a baby formula crisis in the United States culminating in a raise in its annual forecast earlier this year.

The 55-year old who previously worked at PepsiCo as its global chief commercial officer gained plaudits from Reckitt investors for his management style after helping revitalize the company after a sales slump.

""He took a very balanced approach to strategy ... he didn't go in all guns blazing - he took a very systematic approach to get things right"" said Ashish Sinha portfolio manager at Reckitt shareholder Gabelli.

Starbucks said Narasimhan will spend his time with Schultz and the management team spending time as a barista meeting employees and visiting manufacturing plants and coffee farms during the transition period.

""While we are surprised Starbucks chose a successor outside the discretionary sector we are optimistic Mr. Narasimhan's global perspectives as a CEO of a public multinational corporation and background in beverages at PepsiCo will serve Starbucks well into the next chapter"" Cowen analyst Andrew Charles wrote in a note.

The coffee chain's shares were barely changed in after-hours trade gaining less than 1%. They are down 24% since Schultz's return as interim CEO.

We continue to look for targets which are synergistic and make a good strategic fit with our business” he said.While new products account for around 4-5% of the company’s sales the contribution of new products within the overall e-commerce space is close to 10%.“We are very well geared to clock around Rs100 crore of sales from our e-commerce exclusive range this fiscal” Malhotra said adding that the company’s digital spends have grown to one-fourth of total ad spends now.Almost all FMCG companies are scaling up D2C brands through their own web stores and marketplaces amid a mushrooming of startupswhich sell online-only products. Hindustan Unilever  which has an extensive portfolio of online-only brands including Dove Baby Love Beauty and Planet Simple Dermalogica and Lakme said last month it expects Rs 100 croreof sales from its digital-only brands over the next few months.While the D2C brands sell in smaller volumes these brands tend to build repeat-purchase and subscription-based consumption habits.Tata Consumer Colgate Palmolive Marico Adani Wilmar ITC and Parle Products are among the companies which have either acquired stakes in existing D2C brands or have introduced their own digital-only brands. While ITC acquired stake in personal care brand Mother’s Sparsh Colgate Palmolive has invested in men’s grooming products maker Bombay Shaving Company. Emami has a stake in The Man Company and Marico has invested in Just Herbs and Beardo.Internet-only brands are fuelling growth in the e-commerce space with 45% compound annual growth rate and have potential to reach $70 billion over the next few years a joint report by integrated software as a service platform Unicommerce and retail consultancy WazirAdvisors said last month.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lZGlhbmV3czR1LmNvbS92ZWV0LXB1cmUtc3VyZ2VzLXRvLW5vLTQtcG9zaXRpb24tYW1vbmctdG9wLWJyYW5kcy1vZi13ZWVrLTM0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Veet Pure surges to No. 4 position among Top Brands of week 34,"Top Advertisers

But Comcast executives are planning on Disney buying them out — even if they'd prefer otherwise.

Disney owns two-thirds of Hulu and has an option to buy the remaining 33% from Comcast as early as January 2024. Some analysts and industry watchers have speculated Comcast might try to buy Hulu from Disney rather than the other way around. Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts has been a long-time believer in Hulu and has historically pushed to keep the asset rather than sell including in 2013 when Roberts nixed talks with DirecTV according to people familiar with the matter.

Comcast broached the idea of buying all of Hulu from Disney after Disney agreed to acquire the majority of Fox's assets as part of a $71 billion deal that closed in early 2019 said two of the people who asked not to be named because the discussions were private. Disney armed with 66% ownership after acquiring Fox's minority stake in Hulu dismissed the idea the people said.

Blocked from buying all of Hulu Comcast's sustained belief in the business led to the unusual agreement the two companies reached in May 2019 with Comcast agreeing to sell Disney its minority stake as early as 2024. As part of that transaction Disney guaranteed a sale price valuing Hulu at a minimum of $27.5 billion.

That amount spiked earlier in the pandemic giving Comcast some hope that Disney may choose to unload Hulu rather than pay Comcast a huge check for the remainder two of the people said. Offloading Hulu would have allowed Disney to put its focus and money primarily on Disney+.

""I think if Disney could roll back the clock today I'm not so sure they would enter into that deal"" said Neil Begley an analyst for Moody's Investors Services. ""Disney has this huge bill to pay in 2024 at a time when they're already investing a lot of money into Disney+.""

Acquiring Hulu from Disney would also supercharge Comcast's streaming efforts. Hulu would instantly become Comcast's flagship streaming asset replacing NBCUniversal's Peacock which has added just 13 million paid subscribers in its nearly two years of existence. Hulu has 46.2 million subscribers. Peacock could live on as NBCUniversal's free advertising-supported option. Peacock already has a free tier with millions of users.

Several top Comcast executives also think Hulu doesn't make as much sense paired with Disney's assets as it would at NBCUniversal especially with the recent announcement that Disney+ plans to launch an advertising-supported tier in December according to people familiar with the matter. Hulu has been Disney's advertising-supported service for years. Disney could have positioned Hulu as its advertising play going forward but CEO Bob Chapek has chosen to make versions of both Disney+ and Hulu with and without commercials.

Spokespeople for Disney and Comcast declined to comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9jb21jYXN0LWV4cGxvcmVzLWNoYW5uZWxpemluZy1yZXNvdXJjZXMtdHYtMTIwMTAzMzgyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Comcast Explores Channelizing Resources From TV Networks To Boost Growth,"Comcast Corp (NASDAQ: CMCSA) weighed slashing up to $1 billion from NBCUniversal TV networks' budget to boost other parts of the business Bloomberg reports.

NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell urged top deputies to explore savings at its legacy cable and broadcast TV networks.

Executives have explored many ways of cutting costs including layoffs trimming budgets for developing new programs and changing the mix of programs on TV to produce more low-cost shows.

Reallocating money from profitable but slow-growing TV networks could allow Comcast to channel more resources into its streaming service Peacock and theme parks.

Shell encouraged Comcast to prioritize Peacock as evidenced by its higher spending and losses.

Peacock at 13 million subscribers showed no growth in the most recent quarter. Comcast the largest U.S. cable TV provider reported no new customers for its internet access business.

Every major media company strived to cut costs due to Wall Street pressure.

Warner Bros. Discovery Inc (NASDAQ: WBD) is terminating thousands of workers with $3 billion in cost cuts after its big merger. At the same time Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) has slowed the growth of its investment in original programming.

The U.S. wireless carriers T-Mobile US In c (NASDAQ: TMUS) and broadband-internet providers like Comcast fought to win customers from each other.

The wireless threat contributed to the cable industry's worst quarter in years.

Price Action: CMCSA shares traded lower by 0.3% at $36.79 in the premarket on the last check Friday.

That’s exactly what he and many others did during the inaugural Bubba’s Block Party last month at Richmond Raceway located in the suburbs of Richmond Va.

In a partnership between NASCAR and Wallace the event was designed to engage new fan audiences and bring local families to the racetrack ahead of a full weekend of stock car racing action which included the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series and NASCAR Cup Series.

The Block Party was free to the public though it was capped at roughly 2000 fans according to Wallace. At the event those people got to experience NASCAR’s virtual iRacing on simulators pit stop demonstrations and multi-platinum hip-hop artist Wale headlined the event with a live performance. There were also many Black-owned food trucks from the Richmond area.

“It was a deal that was like ‘Why don’t we try this and let it marinate'” Wallace recently said of the Block Party. “NASCAR jumped on it and wanted to see how we could go about it what we could do. It’s a different demographic to be at the racetrack which is really cool. Excited to see me and not from a race fan standpoint but from a person that they’ve heard about in recent years and they’re excited to be there and have Wale there to perform.

“The whole atmosphere was really cool and I actually enjoyed standing out there being a part of it.”

Wallace confirmed there will be another Block Party sometime in the playoffs potentially at a track he’s performed well at in the past. He picked up his first Cup Series win at Talladega Superspeedway last fall.

Xfinity was excited about the event too. Just a few weeks prior the brand announced it will join Coca-Cola Logitech Playseat and Southern Computer Warehouse as a presenting sponsor for the upcoming eNASCAR College iRacing Series.

Qualifying for the series’ first race at virtual Homestead-Miami Speedway runs from Sept. 6-15. The race will be 80 laps beginning at 8 p.m. ET on Tuesday Sept. 20. Competitors will run Xfinity Series cars replicating the look and feel of the real-life series that’s produced many of the current Cup Series stars battling for the championship.

“We agreed to partner with NASCAR as one of the presenting sponsors of their college iRacing tour” Matt Lederer Comcast’s vice president brand partnerships and amplification said. “When we stepped up though we didn’t want to do just another logo slap. While we felt it was a great cause that a lot of the money from the sponsorship elements goes directly to scholarships for the students participating we were working really hard with them to see how is this bringing in new younger fans and expanding it versus talking to the same people.”

The eNASCAR College iRacing Series will be a four-race series this fall. After Homestead students will also tackle virtual Auto Club Speedway (Oct. 18) the Charlotte Motor Speedway ROVAL (Nov. 8) and Nashville Superspeedway (Nov. 29). During a three-race schedule in the spring series students from more than 250 universities across the United States participated.

Xfinity however wanted to make an impact on HBCUs (historically black colleges and universities). As part of its partnership with the eNASCAR College iRacing Series Xfinity will donate one simulator apiece to Bowie State University Delaware State University Texas Southern University and Spielman College throughout its HBCU college campus tour.

The tour is aimed to bring Xfinity directly to students accomplished while working alongside NASCAR to bring a new diverse fan base to racing. Those schools were chosen based on proximity to NASCAR tracks and areas that are important to Comcast as well.

“When we set that out as a mission we brainstormed and said ‘In your iRacing Series how many HBCU participants do you have?'” Lederer recalled. “The answer was zero to not many. So we said the HBCUs from our brand standpoint are very important.

“We pulled all that together and said ‘What if we do something special with the money for HBCUs to garner participation.’ We weren’t naïve to think that just by doing that we were going to get people and change the profiles of participants. But how can we change the profile of participants for next year the year after five years from now? [That’s the goal.]”

Rajah Caruth also an HBCU student at Winston-Salem University learned the sport of racing on a simulator. Currently he sits third in the ARCA Menards Series championship standings 16 points below his Rev Racing teammate Nick Sanchez with a handful of races to go in the 2022 season.

He’s pleased that Xfinity partnered with four HBCU colleges to provide simulators for the eNASCAR College iRacing Series.

“It’s important for me to convey the significance of these donations” Caruth said. “Most people don’t know this but young drivers really hone their skills and learn the basics of the sport on these types of simulators so these simulator donations will go a long way in teaching new fans the little nuances of driving that most people wouldn’t really understand.

“It’s such a great way to captivate HBCU students and encourage their NASCAR fandom by giving them an inside look at how the sport works.”

From support of its partners the eNASCAR Scholarship Fund also returns for the fall schedule awarding the highest finishers a combined $60000 in scholarships.

Xfinity’s HBCU tour will make various stops at different institutions across the country. Events such as giveaways photo opportunities and information about Xfinity products and services will be held delivering a unique and interactive experience to each HBCU campus.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd2hhdi5uZXQvMjAyMi8wOS8wMi9icmVlemVsaW5lLXBsZWRnZXMtZmliZXItdG8tdGhlLWhvbWUtaGlnaC1kZWZpbml0aW9uLXB1YmxpYy1hY2Nlc3MtYW5kLW1vcmUtbW9uZXktZm9yLWhhdmVyaGlsbC10di_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Breezeline Pledges Fiber to the Home High-Definition Public Access and More Money for Haverhill TV,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd2hhdi5uZXQvMjAyMi8wOS8wMi9icmVlemVsaW5lLXBsZWRnZXMtZmliZXItdG8tdGhlLWhvbWUtaGlnaC1kZWZpbml0aW9uLXB1YmxpYy1hY2Nlc3MtYW5kLW1vcmUtbW9uZXktZm9yLWhhdmVyaGlsbC10di_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016710B36B90>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd2hhdi5uZXQvMjAyMi8wOS8wMi9icmVlemVsaW5lLXBsZWRnZXMtZmliZXItdG8tdGhlLWhvbWUtaGlnaC1kZWZpbml0aW9uLXB1YmxpYy1hY2Nlc3MtYW5kLW1vcmUtbW9uZXktZm9yLWhhdmVyaGlsbC10di_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

There's good reason investors fear the economy could slide further into a recession and drag stocks down with it. Persistent inflation rising interest rates and a stumbling housing market are all worrisome indicators that we might have further to fall before we reach bottom.

That's why finding a safe haven now might make sense and utility stocks may be your best bet. They can be the ballast for a portfolio during troubled times and perform well when the storm clouds finally break. There's good reason utilities have long been seen as the ultimate widows-and-orphans stocks.

Pulling your money out of the market is not really a viable option if you want to build generational wealth because if you miss the rebound your long-term returns will be severely harmed. Over the 20-year period between 2001 and 2021 the S&P 500 returned 9.5% annually on average but if you had missed out on just the market's 10 best days your returns would have been cut to 5.3%.

That's why buying now makes sense. The following three utility stocks are ones you'll be happy you own a decade into the future.

American States Water

American States Water (AWR 1.87%) is a utility that's seen it all. Founded in 1929 it's been through the Great Depression two world wars numerous market crashes and recessions and a host of global geopolitical events that have turned the world upside down.

And through it all it has steadfastly paid a dividend to its investors -- 86 straight years in all -- but more importantly has raised the payout each and every year for 68 consecutive years (it just raised it again by 8.9%). While that puts American States Water in that rarified group of stocks called Dividend Kings it's all the more notable because no other stock on the market has as long a track record of raising its dividend than this water utility.

American States Water is primarily tasked with providing clean water and electricity to Southern California which represents about 66% of its revenue but it also has long-term contracts with the U.S. government to provide water to 11 military bases which account for another quarter of total revenue. The rest it gets from generating electricity.

Shares of the utility are down 20% year-to-date as it has missed analyst earnings estimates several times over the past few quarters but that is largely due to California utility regulators failing to approve its rate requests for 2022. That means American States Water is still operating under 2021 rates so if and when the increases do go through they should be retroactive to January.

The water utility is a solid dependable business that has a long history of returning value to shareholders a track record that will undoubtedly continue to 2032 and beyond.

Consolidated Edison

On the other side of the country is Consolidated Edison (ED 0.56%) commonly known as ConEd which provides electricity natural gas and steam to customers in New York state. It has also heavily invested in the renewable energy market and maintains it supports ""a reliable transition from fossil fuels to renewables to reduce carbon emissions"" while also maximizing returns for investors. It operates a network of utility-scale wind and solar energy projects across 20 states that can generate three gigawatts of power.

Yet even though ConEd's stock is up 15% in 2022 management believes that the market is undervaluing its business because of the differences inherent in the fossil fuel and clean energy businesses. It is conducting a strategic review of its clean energy assets though it hasn't said whether a full sale spinoff or asset sale is the desired outcome. Analysts believe the utility will sell the unit as a whole to reduce its equity needs.

ConEd is another dependable dividend-paying stock to own for the long haul that has hiked its payout for 46 consecutive years making it a Dividend Aristocrat but one within reach of soon becoming a Dividend King.

Brookfield Infrastructure Partners

Yes Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP 1.02%) owns traditional utility operations around the globe with electricity transmission and distribution lines in Australia and Brazil and natural gas pipelines in North America South America and India. Yet it also owns and operates a number of ""utility-like"" infrastructure assets too including railroads toll roads ports and liquefied natural gas (LNG) export operations; oil and natural gas midstream assets; and data centers cell towers fiber-optic cables and data transmission assets.

Now Brookfield is getting into computer chips too as it just signed an agreement with semiconductor giant Intel (INTC 0.30%) to jointly fund the chipmaker's new fabrication facility it's building in Arizona. Let's just say Brookfield Infrastructure is a unique play on the utility space.

What's especially distinctive about this infrastructure stock is that it's not especially beholden to any one asset and is willing to sell any one of them off and either reinvest in existing operations or buy a new one. It has called that its ""buy enhance sell repeat"" strategy. Wash. Rinse. Repeat.

While Brookfield doesn't have the same track record as American States or ConEd in dividend payments it has raised its payout every year for 10 years. In another 10 years' time investors will appreciate both its capital investments and its dividend.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlZGV0cm9pdGJ1cmVhdS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS9ib2xsaW5nZXItb2ZmZXJzLWZpcnN0LWxvb2stYXQtc2hpZnQtdG8tY29tbWVyY2lhbC10cnVja3Mtd2l0aC1iNC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bollinger Offers First Look at Shift to Commercial Trucks with B4,"Bollinger Offers First Look at Shift to Commercial Trucks with B4 EV maker pushes into new direction with new chassis cab vehicle.

Bollinger Motors took the covers off its new B4 electric truck showing the world its new chassis cabs that offer supreme flexibility in terms of usage and a reminder the commercial vehicle space is now getting crowded — and competitive.

Bollinger’s shift toward the Class 3-6 commercial vehicle market kicks off with its new B4 chassis cab offering.

As part of the debut Bollinger claims it’s the “only company offering chassis cabs and platforms in classes 4-6.” It notes the vehicles come “upfit-ready” and in different wheelbase lengths to accommodate a variety uses: box truck bucket truck or even a “walk-in van.”

In April Con Edison asked Bollinger Motors to develop a Class 3 prototype of a walk-in van for testing. Con Edison is tentatively planning to integrate Class 3 – 6 vehicles into its fleet by 2024.

“The cab-forward design also increases both overall cargo space behind the cab and critical downward visibility in front” said Kent Harrison chief product officer of Bollinger Motors. “The B4’s 41-foot turning circle will be better than any comparable wheelbase truck — which will improve driving dynamics in both rural and urban settings.”

The company declined to offer pricing details saying that information would come at a later day. It also noted it will be rolling out Class 5 and Class 6 trucks as well.

However it did note buyers of the new B4 should qualify for tax credits made available from the Inflation Reduction Act. The B4 is expected to be eligible for a 30% tax credit  up to $40000 under provisions made for commercial electric vehicles.

The company upgraded the platform used for its initial B1 and B2 vehicles for the B4 and future vehicles.

Making a move

The B4 the company’s first release since formally announcing its temporary shift away from mainstream and medium-duty vehicles is driven by a solid rear-axle e-drive to meet demand for higher payloads. It uses an 800-volt platform with lithium iron phosphate batteries chemistry to ensure safety and cut costs.

Customers may outfit their B4s with either one or two battery packs to accommodate cost and range requirements. Range estimates exceed current customer need according to Bollinger and offer roughly 100 miles per battery pack.

The company announced in May that Roush Industries will be assembling the battery-electric Class 3 through 6 platforms and chassis cab commercial vehicles. Bollinger said it would provide the parts for assembly at Roush’s facility in Livonia Michigan. Bollinger is headquartered near Roush in Oak Park Michigan.

Filling a need

Bollinger officials say the company will be rolling out Class 5 and Class 6 trucks as well.

“The cab-forward design is a radical change from our previous concepts” said Robert Bollinger founder and CEO of Bollinger Motors in a statement. “And that’s on purpose. We listened to our commercial customers and developed what they need for ultimate efficiency.”

At first glance it may appear that Bollinger is attempting to carve out a spot in the commercial vehicle space currently occupied most notably by Rivian with its delivery vans General Motors and its BrightDrop subsidiary and a few others. However CEO Bollinger is thinking a bit more specifically about the B4 and other vehicles.

His company does not plan to target the lighter commercial vehicle market — technically known as Class 2 and Class B trucks which are essentially the offerings mentioned previously.

He told TheDetroitBureau.com earlier this year he expects to provide its chassis and powertrain to upfitters who would then add the body chosen by individual customers. This covers a broad gamut of Class 3 through 6 vehicles such as heavy-duty tow trucks cement mixers or long-haul vehicles for delivery services such as a UPS or FedEx said Bollinger.

In fact the company upgraded the platform used for its initial B1 and B2 vehicles which debuted in 2017 to better accommodate the Class 3-6 vehicles the new B4 chassis cab or cab-over chassis is aimed at.",,,,,,

The CSD behemoth which snapped up energy-drinks brand Rockstar in 2020 struck a deal to buy 8.5% in Celsius for US$550m.

Just Drinks thinks: This mega-investment from PepsiCo values Celsius at an eye-watering US$6.4bn. Energy drinks are hot property in the US right now perhaps somewhat unsurprisingly given the market is predicted to grow at a CAGR of 4.05% in the next five years reaching US$30bn by 2026 according to GlobalData. Following the deal Celsius CEO John Fieldly and CFO Jarrod Langhans hinted the unit could be open to M&A of its own which would raise the prospect of a dynamic not dissimilar to that which exists between The Coca-Cola Co. Monster and CANarchy.

From PepsiCo’s perspective taking on US distribution of Celsius mirrors its ill-fated partnership with Bang Energy owner Vital Pharmaceuticals but the decision to appoint a director to sit on the Celsius board suggests the Rockstar brand owner is determined to learn from its previous mis-steps.

Kirin subsidiary Lion sold its UK craft breweries Fourpure Brewing Co and Magic Rock Brewing Co to Odyssey Inns. The brands had been placed under a strategic review earlier this year.

The deal also includes the Fourpure and Magic Rock breweries and taprooms in London Huddersfield and Holmfirth as well as the Little Creatures craft beer bar in London.

Just Drinks thinks: It’s tempting to look at Lion’s decision to pull back from the UK as symptomatic of the widely talked about ‘craft beer slowdown’ but a closer inspection reveals this particular case is more complex than that.

Yes Lion’s craft beer brands were floundering but the unit has also been refocusing much of its attention (and funds) towards the US market in recent years. Many in the industry spoke of their surprise at the Australian firm’s decision to let go of many of Fourpure’s staff during the height of the pandemic as well as repositioning the brand as a more entry-level proposition. Both gambles failed to pay off with the brewery’s off-premise sales dipping by 30% year-on-year at a time when supermarket alcohol sales were surging.

Poor business performance ultimately led the Little Creatures brand owner to decide to cut its losses and one shudders to think of the hit it will have taken on the investments it made in 2018 and 2019 on what were two of the UK’s hottest brewing prospects at the time. A fresh start under new owners Odyssey Inns may be exactly what these neglected brands need.

Campari Group took a minority interest in Catalyst Spirits’ Howler Head alongside the exclusive rights to distribute the Kentucky Bourbon brand globally. The deal – valued at US$15m – will see the Aperol brand owner buy a 15% stake in Howler Head with a medium-term view to owning the brand outright.

Just Drinks thinks: If there’s one thing we know about Campari it’s the group knows how to spot a shrewd investment when it sees one. Gambling on Bourbon with Wild Turkey in 2009 paid off extremely handsomely for the Aperol brand owner and now the group is making a similar bet on flavoured whiskey with this investment in Howler Head.

Purists may sniff at the idea of a Banana-flavoured Kentucky Bourbon but the fast-growing start-up brand is busy making in-roads securing a lucrative partnership with UFC despite only launching nationally in the US in 2021. This particular partnership has the potential to bring millions of new consumers enticed by current flavour trends into the category and – Campari hopes – convert them to even more premium expressions in its portfolio.

Spirit of Gallo – the dedicated spirits arm of E&J Gallo Winery – invested in the Tequila Komos brand. The brand is the flagship product of New-York based Casa Komos Brands Group (CKBG).

Just Drinks thinks: Spirit of Gallo has had a busy summer. This deal was the second “strategic investment” the spirit’s umbrella unit for E&J Gallo made in the space of a month. In July the unit took a stake in small-batch American whiskey maker Horse Soldier Bourbon. Both deals follow a similar pattern with the unit taking over exclusive US distribution rights as well as an undisclosed stake in the brand.

This deal makes a great deal of sense on paper. Tequila’s rapid growth trajectory barely needs repeating and much of its phenomenal growth in the US has come at the premium end of the spectrum. Komos – with its elegant ceramic bottle and Cristalino Reposado Rosa and Extra Añejo variants – firmly positions itself in this segment of the market.

One possible complication – should Spirit of Gallo wish to up its stake – however is Molson Coors’ recent acquisition of a minority stake in Komos’ parent company Casa Komos Brands Group (CKBG). How this could play out as Tequila continues to fly remains to be seen.

The move will include the US city’s two airports its central library and main water purification plant.

More than 100 cities around the world now get at least 70% of their electricity from renewable sources according to environmental charity CDP.

The US city of Chicago runs more than 400 public buildings including City Hall and two international airports.

Now these buildings and other city operations are to be run on 100% renewable energy.

After signing a new five-year clean energy deal with electricity supplier Constellation the Illinois city has announced that all its facilities and operations will run on renewable energy by 2025.

Chicago says it is one of the biggest cities in the US to make this commitment which is expected to reduce the city’s carbon footprint by more than 290000 metric tons each year.

This is equivalent to the emissions of 62000 passenger vehicles according to estimates from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Chicago plans to power its public buildings and operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025. Image: Chicago 2022 Climate Action Plan

Chicago city buildings go green

Chicago’s two airports its central library and its Jardine Water Purification Plant – the biggest water treatment plant in the world – will run partially on solar energy as part of the deal.

The solar energy will be sourced from a project being developed by Swift Current Energy which is expected to be one of the largest of its kind in Illinois to date.

For other power uses like street lights and small and medium-sized buildings Chicago says it will buy renewable energy credits. These are certificates which show energy bought from the grid is renewable.

The city has committed to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions by 62% by 2040. This and other goals are set out in Chicago’s 2022 Climate Action Plan.

Renewable energy cities

More than 100 cities globally now get at least 70% of their electricity from renewable sources like solar wind hydro and geothermal finds a renewable energy city tracker from environmental charity CDP.

These cities include Bogotá in Colombia Nairobi in Kenya Montreal in Canada Aspen in the United States Inje in South Korea and Reykjavík in Iceland.

Cities are at home to more than half the world’s population and generate more than 70% of global carbon emissions according to the World Economic Forum’s Net Zero Carbon Cities initiative.

This is why reducing the carbon footprint of cities is vital if global warming – which is fuelled by greenhouse gas emissions from human activity – is to be kept to well below 2°C.

The Net Zero Carbon Cities initiative aims to help cities decarbonize across their energy built environment and transport sectors.

City climate targets

As cities wake up to the threat of climate change more of them are developing emission reduction targets and climate action plans.

These cities include South Korea’s capital Seoul which aims to become carbon neutral by 2050 through action in five key areas – buildings mobility forestry clean energy and waste management.

The city of Adelaide in Australia has powered its municipal operations entirely from renewable energy since 2020 and is investing in technologies including battery storage and biogas.

In Cape Town South Africa the government hopes renewable energy will account for 40% of energy use by 2030 up from 8% in 2016. Coal is currently the country’s main energy source. But the city is now looking to procure up to 300MW of renewable energy from independent power producers according to news site Renewables Now.

The spectacular pictures show a scorching hot planet six to 12 times bigger than Jupiter in what are the first images captured by the telescope of an exoplanet (a planet outside our solar system). Named HIP 65426 b the gas giant is thought to be 15 million years old and more than 900°C on its surface.

Scientists say conditions on the planet make it impossible for life to exist there but the discovery has still been described as a “transformative moment” in astronomy. The JWST was also able to catch a glimpse of the planet which has been compared to a “candle flame” as it is over 100 times further from its star than Earth is to the Sun. Located in the Centaurus constellation the planet is 10000 times fainter than its host star making it difficult to observe in great detail. But thanks to the JWST’s sensitive infrared sensors the fainter signatures of the planet have been picked up.

NASA's James Webb telescope has captured images of an exoplanet for the first time

The planet has been compared to a candle flame

Dr Sasha Hinkley from the University of Exeter which led the observations said: “This is a transformative moment not only for Webb but also for astronomy generally.” She added: “James Webb is going to open the door to a whole new class of planets that have been completely out of reach to us and by observing them at a broad range of wavelengths we can study their compositions in a much more in-depth way. “We will be able to detect the presence of weather.” Dr Aarynn Carter an astronomer on the team from the University of California Santa Cruz who analysed the data said: “Obtaining this image felt like digging for space treasure.

“At first all I could see was light from the star but with careful image processing I was able to remove that light and uncover the planet.” The sighting comes after the planet was first spotted back in 2017 by astronomers using the SPHERE telescope in Chile. However thanks to James Webb’s powerful tools fresh data and a unique vantage point have provided new insights. The findings are now under peer-review with the preliminary indications released as a pre-print on arXiv. DON'T MISS

It's unclear yet who will foot the bill for cleanup at those sites and the targeted sites may expand. The DEC is currently evaluating Denison Park where it says ash brick and glass were also detected in soil samples.

The nature of the contaminants identified by the DEC is largely similar to what was reported at sites where Corning Inc. has agreed to conduct cleanup work including the Houghton Plot neighborhood in the city.

Corning Inc. officials said they haven't seen anything from DEC connecting the company to what was found in the parks.

DEC said determining responsibility is the next step of their process. Anyone identified as a responsible party will be given an opportunity to perform the remedial investigation under DEC's oversight according to DEC spokesperson Andrea Pedrick. If the responsible party declines the investigation will be performed by DEC using state environmental cleanup funds.

“Corning Inc. and its engineering and construction contractors continue to diligently efficiently and safely complete investigation remediation and restoration work on properties where information exists connecting Corning Inc. to the property” said Corning Inc. spokesperson Gabrielle Bailey. “No such information has been provided to Corning Inc. by the NYSDEC for these parks.”

Following the completion of the remedial investigation of the three parks a report will be published and released to the public according to DEC.

The parks can continue to be used by the public DEC officials said. While soil collected beneath the surface contained arsenic cadmium and lead above the level allowed in residential areas contact with contaminants in those soils is unlikely unless people dig into the ground there.

Much of the soil in the parks is covered by grass along with materials such as mulch or wood chips in the playground portions according to the DEC. Both grass and mulch provide a cover that prevents contact with the soils beneath.

However people can reduce the chance of exposure to these contaminants by taking reasonable and practical steps to minimize direct and repeated contact with bare soils particularly by young children according to DEC. Children and adults should wash their hands after activities in the parks.

Crews paid for by Corning Inc. continue soil excavation and restoration in Houghton Plot which began in 2018 Bailey said. Corning Inc. expects to have the work in that area completed by the end of 2023 depending on the timing of DEC approvals and property owners agreeing to remediation.

Corning Inc. entered into a consent agreement with DEC in July 2014 to address layers of target fill containing ash brick and glass that contained contaminants including lead cadmium or arsenic at levels above state limits in the Houghton Plot neighborhood.

The Houghton family the founders of Corning Inc. owned the area when it was an undeveloped piece of farmland.

Officials said workers from what was Corning Flint Glass Works and other area glassmaking companies dumped waste glass and ceramics at the site until the early 20th century when the area was covered with topsoil and homes were built.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirAFodHRwczovL21hcmtldHNjYWxlLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyaWVzL3NvZnR3YXJlLWFuZC10ZWNobm9sb2d5L2Nvcm5pbmctYW5ub3VuY2VzLW5ldy1vcHRpY2FsLWNhYmxlLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmctZmFjaWxpdHktc3VwcG9ydGVkLWJ5LWF0dC1hbmQtcmVjb3JkLWluZHVzdHJ5LWJyb2FkYmFuZC1kZW1hbmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Corning Announces New Optical Cable Manufacturing Facility Supported by AT&T and Record Industry Broadband ...,"OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS

CORNING NY | Corning Incorporated | August 30 2022

Additional U.S. manufacturing capabilities will create American jobs to meet multi-year wave of growth for fiber-based networks and help connect the unconnected

Corning Incorporated (NYSE: GLW) announced today that it is expanding manufacturing capacity for optical cable based on a long-term relationship with AT&T (NYSE: T) the nation’s largest fiber internet provider1  as the carrier expands its fiber service. Corning will build a new cable manufacturing facility in Gilbert Arizona located in the Greater Phoenix region adding approximately 250 jobs and extending Corning’s strategic investments in optical fiber cable and connectivity solutions to meet record demand.

The new facility is Corning’s latest in a series of investments in fiber and cable manufacturing totaling more than $500 million since 2020. These investments supported by customer commitments nearly double Corning’s ability to serve the U.S. cable market and connect more people and communities. Public and private investments in broadband 5G and the cloud are accelerating a large multi-year wave of growth for fiber-based networks – and Corning as the world leader in passive optical communications is uniquely positioned to support these network builds.

The Arizona facility expected to open in 2024 will be the industry’s western-most U.S. manufacturing site for optical cable – allowing Corning to serve growing demand in the western U.S. and Canada.

“This investment is a significant step forward for our country and building world-class broadband networks that will help narrow the nation’s digital divide” said AT&T Chief Executive Officer John Stankey. “This new facility will provide additional optical cable capacity to meet the record demand the industry is seeing for fast reliable connectivity. We are also working with Corning to create training programs to equip the next generation of technicians with the skills to build the networks that will expand high-speed internet access to millions of Americans.”

Separately AT&T announced today that it is deploying fiber internet service to the Mesa Arizona area with service expected to be available to Mesa residents in 2023.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo whose agency is spearheading the national “Internet for All” initiative will join today’s announcement at Mesa Community College. Corning and AT&T are supporting the White House’s Talent Pipeline Challenge a program to help employers build training partnerships that connect American workers to jobs rebuilding infrastructure supply chains and manufacturing. Corning and AT&T have created a program to train fiber optic technicians across the industry.

To build and deploy these networks the industry will need another 850000 workers through 2025. Corning and AT&T created the Fiber Optic Training Program focused on equipping thousands of technicians with the skills critical to designing installing and maintaining a growing fiber network. The initial class is currently underway in North Carolina and the program aims to train 50000 American workers over the next five years.

“We believe access to broadband means access to opportunity – from education to healthcare to quality of life” said Corning Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Wendell P. Weeks. “Corning is doing our part to make sure everyone – regardless of where they live – has access to reliable high-speed connections enabled by optical fiber. We are proud to continue partnering with AT&T and to expand U.S. manufacturing capacity and train the next generation of American workers – and we’re grateful for the opportunity to work with our customers and with the U.S. government to make this a reality.”

Birmingham Alabama-based Arlington Properties is looking to build a 319-unit apartment complex with a 4.68-acre lake fronting Summerlin Road and a commercial/retail building at the southeast corner of Winkler and Gladiolus public records show. The developer did not return calls seeking comment.

A Lee County hearing examiner recommended approving the project July 14. The Lee County Board of County Commissioners has yet to vote on the rezoning and a voting date has yet to be set.

The land has been used for farming both plant nurseries and U-Pick produce operations for decades but has been in the works to be something other than a farm for a while.

In 1993 the Lee County commission approved the rezoning of the land from agricultural to mixed-used commercial with “Summerlin Towne Centre” proposed shopping center that never came to fruition.

There are two parcels with two owners that would be combined into one if Arlington Properties decides to purchase the land and proceed with the apartment complex.

The western portion at 8691 Gladiolus is 13 acres and owned by R&K Farms LLC. The eastern portion at 8591 Gladiolus is about 18.55 acres and owned by Margie Geddes who bought it in March 1994 for $1.5 million property records show.

Just to the east an 11.6-acre parcel was bought by Florida Storage Gladiolus LLC for $4 million. That land has been cleared and a new self-storage facility has broken ground there at the southwest flyover intersection of Summerlin Road and Gladiolus.

Rumors circulated that Costco was looking to move from its U.S. 41 location in south Fort Myers to the parcel being considered Arlington Properties. Costco’s parent company based in Washington declined to comment.

But Barry Bland general manager of the Fort Myers Costco store confirmed there’s no news about any imminent relocation of the store.

“We’re not at that point” Bland said.

Bland said the rumors didn’t surprise him adding he has been scouting other locations because the current one has a cramped parking lot and could use more space inside. But there isn’t any alternative for Costco to relocate at this time.

“I think right now for how our business is going when we move it’s always a big deal” Bland said. “Everyone you talk to there’s always a rumor. Until they get something done there’s really nothing to report.”

Big-box retailers are running into challenges in finding land to build new stores especially in the interior of the region west of Interstate 75 area land brokers told Gulfshore Business.

“Obviously 41 is over with” said John Mounce founding partner of the LandQwest brokerage company. “For a box the size that we’re talking about— any of those guys— you’re looking at 20 acres. You cannot find 20 acres with 41 frontage in the corridor you would want to be in. You can’t even assemble it. It’s getting really difficult.”

Mounce pointed to Home Depot getting ready to build a new store not near U.S. 41 but instead near I-75.

Justin Thibaut the CEO of LSI Companies was asked if Costco can’t go on the farmland where can it go?

There aren’t many options.

“My answer to that is I would be shocked if there’s any piece that’s more than 10 acres in all of Lee County that’s not being eyeballed for apartments” Thibaut said. “Costco is a big land eater. That’s not a small parcel that they need for all of the parking that they require. Right now they’re up against the guys who are doing multifamily mixed-use retail. They’re paying more per acre more per square foot than a traditional big-box store does.

“Maybe five-to-seven years ago Costco could have done something there. But we have pressure on available housing now. That’s driving up rents which is driving up what multifamily buyers can pay for the dirt.”"

Smith & Wesson’s CSX new for 2022 stands out as one of the truly interesting pistols released at SHOT Show in January. Rather than a polymer frame it’s aluminum certainly bucking the trend of most new pistols. Rather than striker-fired it’s a single-action-only hammer-fired design. While it deviates from the pack in these regards it’s not as different as you might think. Dimensionally it’s a twin for Smith & Wesson’s other small 9 mm pistol the Shield Plus. Barrel length overall length height and capacity are the same for the CSX as the Shield Plus with the CSX having a slight edge on weight – it’s .7 ounce lighter.

The CSX maintains the bladed-safety trigger we’ve come to expect on a carry handgun to guard against accidental discharge if dropped. In addition to the trigger safety there’s an ambidextrous thumb safety so the CSX can safely be carried with a round in the chamber and the hammer cocked. This is often referred to as Condition 1 and is the same system used by those that carry 1911s or Hi Powers. Adding to the ambidextrous nature of the CSX is a slide-stop lever on the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters and that’s not all. Two magazine releases are available for righties and lefties (right-handed is installed from the factory).

Ten rounds of 9 mm are available in the flush-fit magazine or 12 rounds in a slightly extended version. Opt for the extended version as it will allow a full three-finger grip on the handgun while only adding a fraction of an inch to the overall height. Smith & Wesson borrowed some clever engineering from its M&P line in both the texturing of the CSX’s frontstrap and also in the interchangeable backstraps that allow the pistol to be better fit to the shooter’s hand. It results in a small light gun that’s nowhere near as difficult to shoot as you might think—and that’s a good thing indeed.

Sure the Shield Plus is more along the lines of what we’ve come to expect recently with its polymer frame and striker-fired operation. Smith & Wesson built the CSX for fans of 1911- and Hi Power-style pistols and for those who don’t care for striker-fired handguns. If you’re a 1911 devotee and are looking for something easier to carry or a backup the CSX is an excellent choice. Heck on its own it’s a darn good choice and it’s great to see Smith & Wesson getting back into the metal-frame handgun business again.

Holster: Safariland Model 27 (MSRP: $59)

Highlighting the concealability of the CSX we’ve opted for Safariland’s Model 27 Inside-the-Waistband concealment holster. Constructed of what the company calls Safarilaminate it’s a polymer holster that looks like leather but is molded with an open top for easy re-holstering. Adding to the concealment factor is the J-shaped belt hook that maintains a minimalist presence carried inside the waistband.

Available for a wide variety of handguns the Model 27 isn’t ambidextrous like the CSX but it can be ordered for right- or left-handed shooters. Retention can be adjusted by means of a single screw ahead of the trigger guard and the cant of the holster can be changed as well depending on personal preference.

Knife: CRKT Snap Lock (MSRP: $60)

In keeping with the unique nature of the single-action metal-frame CSX we’ve chosen a fitting pocketknife to round out this kit. CRKT’s Snap Lock offers a minimalist knife with a non-traditional opening mechanism. Rather than coming out of the handle like most pocketknives the Snap Lock swings out from the side by means of a lever. It retracts the same way offering an interesting take on the EDC pocketknife.

The 2.5-inch 420 J2 steel drop-point blade is housed in a stainless steel handle with a reversible pocket clip allowing for right- or left-pocket carry. A paracord lanyard comes with the Snap Lock should you wish to carry it as a neck knife—and at a mere 2.5 ounces in weight it’s not going to add a lot of heft to your EDC gear no matter how you carry it. If it’s something different you seek the Snap Lock should cover that handily.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseWluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvbS9uZXdzL3RocmVlLWRvb3JzLW9wZW4tZm9ybWVyLWNzeC13b3JrZXJzLWJ1aWxkLWZ1dHVyZXMtd2l0aC1vd24tYnVzaW5lc3Nlcy9hcnRpY2xlX2YxNTE3OWJhLTJhMmUtMTFlZC04MzZhLWNiNzhkNGZjMTIyYi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Three Doors Open: Former CSX workers build futures with own businesses,"Ashland KY (41101)

The third-largest automaker in America after General Motors and Ford identified two warranty claims zero customer assistance records and zero field reports potentially related to this problem. The first warranty claim dates back to July 6th. The Vehicle Regulations Committee then determined that a safety recall is necessary for the affected population of workhorses.Documents filed with thereveal that a misaligned capacitor in the control module may cause a short resulting in a loss of communication that leads to a loss of power. The module bears P.N. 68569934AA and – of course – it’s manufactured by Cummins rather than FCA. The Auburn Hills-based automaker promises that the replacement control module doesn’t have a misaligned capacitor.Both dealers and owners will be notified next month on October 15th. Affected 2500 pickups number 2288 units produced for the 2022 model year between June 1st and August 24th. The 3500 numbers 1417 units not including 385 examples of the 3500 chassis cab. Affected 4500 and 5500 chassis cabs total 817 trucks produced between May 31st and August 23rd.Priced at $43415 excluding destination charge the 2500 is the most affordable heavy-duty pickup sold by Ram for the 2022 model year. For the long haul the 3500 can be yours from $45520 sans freight. Finally the chassis cab is rocking a $43540 price tag for the HEMI V8-engined Tradesman 4x2 Regular Cab. 6.7L turbo diesel can be had for an extra $9k give or take a few bucks. In the case of the chassis cab Ram charges an extra $1k for the Aisin AS69RC HD transmission. The 2500 by comparison comes with the 68RFE that's included in the engine's price.Also worthy of note the highest tune available for the inline-six diesel is a simply ridiculous 1075 pound-foot (1458 Nm) of twist and 420 ponies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vdXNyYXJhY2luZy5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXdzX2FydGljbGUuYXNwP05ld3NJRD04NzQyMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cummins Johnson Shipman crowned season champions at Chateau Speedway,"It was the final night of the regular season Friday night at the Chateau Speedway powered by Garlick’s Water in Lansng Minn. That meant track champions were crowned at the end of the night in the USRA Modifieds Medieval USRA Stock Cars and USRA B-Mods.

Coming into the night one of the classes would be decided by a driver who just had to start the feature to clinch while the others could still swing depending on finishing positions. Two of those were separated by two points and six points coming into the night which really put the heat on those drivers to outperform the others.

The tightest of the races was the USRA Modifieds with Ryan Wetzstein of West Conocrd just two markers up on Jason Cummins of New Richland. Wetzstein was looking for his first track championship while Cummins was hunting his seventh.

For the most part the championship was decided when Wetzstein failed to start his heat because of mechanical issues. That put him at the back of the feature while Cummins got into the redraw to start near the front.

After his father Steve Wetzstein of West Concord got the lead it looked like it was going to be another feature win for him but his car faded near the end and Cummins came on strong made a three-wide pass for the lead with six laps to go and went on to take his second feature win of the year and that seventh track title.

Heat wins went to A.J. Hoff of Mantorville Steve Wetzstein and Dwaine Hanson of Lakefield.

Michael Johnson of Rose Creek was looking for his first track championship as he took the track for the feature in the USRA B-Mods. Johnson entered the night up 32 points on Hunter Kennedy of St. Ansgar Iowa.

When Kennedy was a no-show on the night that sealed the deal for Johnson’s championship. Johnson put an exclamation mark on the title as he took his fifth feature win of the year.

Heat wins went to A.J. WIste of Adams Jerry Young of Blooming Prairie Colton Weigel of Glenville and Zach Elward of Hayfield.

The class with the least amount of drama was the Medieval USRA Stock Cars.

The class which was just added this year came into the final night with Travis Shipman of Mason City Iowa up 97 points meaning that just signing in at the gate assured him enough points to claim his first track championship at the Chateau Speedway.

Shipman worked his way into the top three but a charge from Kevin Donlan of Decorah Iowa from row six is what the fans were talking about as he claimed his second feature win of the year.

Shipman got a heat race win with Rodney Schweizer of Kansas City Kan. taking the other.

Two more weeks of racing specials are yet to come at the Chateau Speedway. Next Friday Sept. 9 will be the 25th anniversary of the running of the Mike Guttormson Memorial Modified “Spirit of 83” event. This year's main event will pay $2000 to the winner. The track's other classes will also be on hand for the night.

Then in two weeks on Friday Sept. 16 it will be the season finale for 2022. Check out ChateauSpeedway.com for more information.

The ACLU of Rhode Island is raising concerns over the data CVS is collecting as part of its COVID booster shot program.

In a letter sent to CVS President Karen Lynch ACLU of Rhode Island Director Steven Brown questioned the retail pharmacy’s requirement that demographic data — including gender and ethnicity — be provided in order for a person to be eligible for a booster shot.

“While we can appreciate the utility of seeking and obtaining this demographic data I trust you would agree that it is not in the best interest of public health if even a few people are discouraged from obtaining Covid vaccination because of a request for what is ultimately extraneous information” wrote Brown.

SEE FULL LETTER BELOW

When asked for comment CVS provided the following response.

“We’re committed to providing equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines regardless of an individual’s sex gender race ethnicity or other characteristics not relevant to current vaccine eligibility requirements” said Amy Thibault CVS’ Director for External Communications.

“As a participant in the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for vaccinations we’re required to report certain clinical information to the CDC” Thibault added.

CVS however did not respond to the following questions:

Do you require all of the information -- sex gender race ethnicity -- for someone to get a booster shot?

Is it required by the federal government to collect all of this information -- specifically sex gender race and ethnicity?

Pursuant to these two questions -- if a person does not provide sex gender race or ethnicity information -- are they then not allowed to get a shot?

Thibault provided information on the newly authorized bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccines.

This week scheduling vaccine boosters at CVS was halted temporarily to accommodate the latest development.

“We plan to offer the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccines once authorized by the CDC and once we have received supply. Following FDA authorization on August 31 the government’s distribution of the bivalent boosters started immediately. We expect our pharmacies to begin to receive supply on a rolling basis over the next few days and appointments will be made available at CVS.com and via the CVS Pharmacy app” said Thibault. “We continue to provide our communities with convenient access to vaccines at CVS Pharmacy including the approved COVID-19 primary series as well as flu and a number of other vaccinations such as pneumonia and shingles.”



“As announced by the FDA [Wednesday’ the emergency use authorization (EUA) of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines has been updated to remove the use of the original monovalent Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines for booster administration” said Thibault. “For that reason patients will need to reschedule appointments for COVID-19 boosters to allow for the administration of the bivalent vaccine once approved by the CDC and received by our pharmacies. CVS.com and the CVS Pharmacy app will be updated as doses are received.”

Each wide-body model will feature John Deere's X engine 18L which doesn't need diesel exhaust fluid. The 9000 Series also has a new spout that reduces plugging when chopping high-moisture corn or forages.

With HarvestMotion Plus engine technology the harvesters have a torque-rise curve. As a result the machine can output power at low engine rpm speed which increases power so operators can push through harsh harvesting conditions while maintaining crop quality.

""The ideal performance characteristics of the engine decrease fuel consumption and are perfectly aligned and synchronized for outstanding crop flow through the machine"" says Chase Milem marketing manager with John Deere.

John Deere's integrated technology such as AutoTrac RowSense guidance Active Fill Control with rear unloading and the Generation 4 Universal Display are added options for farmers.

In addition the self-propelled foragers come with the HarvestLab 3000 software which provides on-the-go constituent sensing and documentation of forage quality and kernel using John Deere Premium or XStream KP kernel processors. The software analyzes the crop's NDF crude protein moisture sugar starch crude fiber ash and ADF components.

""Using the documented information farmers can quickly analyze data from worked fields adjust fertilizer use select optimal varieties for the upcoming season and improve water management"" says Milem.

Through the John Deere Operations Center app farmers can access harvest data as well as set up pre-harvest work plans to send to the cab. The app also allows farmers to monitor and analyze harvest in real time.

It's a team-up of two Midwestern titans together to benefit Farm Rescue.

For a limited time both John Deere and Anheuser-Busch will donate one dollar each for every case of Busch Light beer sold in this promotional package. Those donations will go up to $200000 and then be presented to the outstanding farmer support group Farm Rescue.

We're all familiar with Busch Light and John Deere let's get familiar with Farm Rescue

The mission of Farm Rescue is to help family farms and ranches bridge crises so they have an opportunity to continue viable operations. Farm Rescue provides planting haying harvesting and livestock feeding assistance to farm and ranch families that have experienced a major injury illness or natural disaster.

Two years ago I wrote a story about Farm Rescue and in its first 15 years the organization assisted over 700 farmers! In 2022 that number has risen to 850. In every agricultural operation there are pivotal people that are vital to either the planting or the harvest. When family farms suffer a labor loss Farm Rescue comes to their aid all across the Midwest.

John Deere has been on board with Farm Rescue since the beginning.

It all started in Horace North Dakota. What an incredible testament to the solidarity of the farming community. They provide machinery and manpower to make sure that family farms in need are able to maintain their livelihood during tough times. Please take a moment to learn more about this amazing group by clicking here.

So grab a case knowing that $200 grand is being put to good use!

Flights used to be a chance to sit back (albeit a bit cramped) and watch a recently released movie or catch up on some reading. Now they’re just another place to log on.

Delta and United each host more than 1.5 million inflight WiFi sessions a month the airlines told CNN Business while JetBlue said its service is used by “millions of customers” every year. Southwest declined to share specific numbers but said inflight Wifi is “popular.”

Alaska Airlines meanwhile estimates that about 35% of its passengers on average make use of its $8 onboard WiFi services which include surfing the web and streaming.

While most airlines will allow certain messaging apps for free full internet access in the skies usually comes at a premium with Delta charging nearly $50 for a monthly pass on US flights (though the airline plans to switch to a $5 per flight per device offering by the end of this year). But with a market that’s currently estimated at around $5 billion and projected to grow to more than $12 billion by 2030 according to research firm Verified Market Research there’s a lot of room for improvement.

Inflight internet has been around for nearly two decades with aircraft manufacturer Boeing announcing its service known as Connexion in April 2000 and debuting it on a Munich-Los Angeles Lufthansa flight in 2004. Boeing discontinued the service in 2006 saying the market for it had “not materialized” as expected. But the advent of smartphones and subsequent efforts by a host of satellite providers and airlines have helped the technology evolve significantly in the past decade — though it still has some catching up to do in order to compare to home and office networks.

How it works

There are two main types of inflight connections. The first known as air-to-ground or ATG relies on antennae attached to the aircraft that catch the signal from cellphone towers on the ground.

Intelsat which launched air-to-ground services with American Airlines in 2008 currently operates a version of the technology on more than 1000 aircraft across North America.

The one major drawback of this technology is that much like cellphone service on the ground it is dependent on the density and connectivity of towers and so flights over rural areas deserts or large water bodies are likely to suffer drops in connectivity. The maximum speeds for these systems are currently around 5 megabits per second (which is shared by hundreds of passengers) according to Andrew Zignani a research director at technology intelligence firm ABI Research who specializes in wireless connectivity. By comparison median global download speeds for mobile and fixed broadband are around 30 megabits per second and 67 megabits per second respectively according to recent data from monitoring app Speedtest.

“To date the biggest issues have been speed limited availability gaps in coverage dropouts and price” Zignani told CNN Business.

That’s why airlines and providers are increasingly switching to satellite-based connections that are relatively less susceptible to interruptions because they can more effectively cover the entirety of the flight path from space and keep the signal active as it moves through the air.

That includes Intelsat which has a network of over 50 satellites serving airlines such as Alaska American Delta United Air Canada British Airways and Cathay Pacific.

“As regional jet fleets are refreshed we expect the majority to migrate to satellite-based solutions” Jeff Sare Intelsat’s president of commercial aviation told CNN Business.

Viasat another major provider used by several airlines around the world uses its own network of satellites that provide high-speed connectivity and is gearing up to launch another satellite constellation later this year. The company debuted its services with JetBlue in 2013 and now serves more than a dozen airlines around the world.

But even satellite connections are currently capable of around 100 megabits per second per aircraft or around 15 megabits per second per passenger device a far cry from the speeds terrestrial WiFi is capable of.

Many airlines use a combination of WiFi providers and types of technologies depending on the type of aircraft and routes they need to be deployed on.

Newer players such as Starlink the satellite internet service run by billionaire Elon Musk’s company SpaceX are also entering the fray. Earlier this year SpaceX announced a partnership with Hawaiian Airlines to provide high-speed internet through Starlink’s network of low-earth orbit satellites.

“Some of these solutions also adopt a hybrid approach combining the best of both technologies to ensure optimal coverage depending on the specific flight path” said Zignani. “I believe we will see opportunities for all technologies in the coming years and recent partnerships are showing that each technology will have its own part to play” he added.

Challenges and opportunities

There are still gaps between inflight WiFi and the networks you would use in your home office a coffee shop or anywhere on the ground.

While most airline WiFi connections now support messaging and social media functions and some even have live TV and video streaming capabilities providing users with the same level of bandwidth and connectivity mid-air can be a challenge.

“The biggest point of difference for inflight WiFi is the complexity added by the mobility element” Don Buchman vice president and general manager for commercial aviation at Viasat told CNN Business. “The aircraft is traveling at a high rate of speed typically banking during the flight and often flying across large geographical areas that demand consistent coverage for a high-quality in-flight connectivity experience.”

And while satellites solve for some of the restrictions that cellphone towers face expanding the satellite network to keep up with increasing demand is not always straightforward.

As Sare of Intelsat puts it: “It is much faster and cheaper to deploy new cellular towers than to launch a satellite on a rocket.”

In a survey by Intelsat last year of airlines service providers and equipment manufacturers 65% of respondents said they anticipate increases in the number of passengers who expect to be connected while flying. The two biggest impediments to increasing inflight WiFi adoption the survey indicated were the high price of the service and “poor internet connection.”

Companies such as Viasat Intelsat and Starlink continue to expand that capacity however launching more satellites every year in anticipation of the growing demand for their services. That added capacity will not only enhance the online experience for users but could also potentially give airlines more avenues to monetize and lower the price.

“One example is ad sponsored inflight WiFi so passengers can access WiFi for free and use it however they would like” Buchman said adding that Viasat is also exploring ways to use its connectivity services to help airlines with functions such as crew management and aircraft maintenance.

The biggest priority according to Sare of Intelsat is shortening the time it takes to make those technological advances happen and he foresees more partnerships between companies to help move the industry standard forward.

“Our vision is achieved when passengers can’t tell the difference between being connected on the ground and in the air.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYWNpb25hbGRpYS5jb20vZW4vMjAyMi8wOS9kZWx0YS13aWxsLWluY3JlYXNlLWl0cy1kaXJlY3QtZmxpZ2h0cy10by1wdWVydG8tcmljby5odG1s0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly9hdmlhY2lvbmFsZGlhLmNvbS9lbi8yMDIyLzA5L2RlbHRhLXdpbGwtaW5jcmVhc2UtaXRzLWRpcmVjdC1mbGlnaHRzLXRvLXB1ZXJ0by1yaWNvLmh0bWwvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta will increase its direct flights to Puerto Rico from Boston and Detroit,"The executive director of the Puerto Rico Tourism Company Carlos Mercado announced this Friday that as of December 17 Delta Air Lines will increase its direct flights to San Juan from the US cities of Boston and Detroit.

ORLANDO Fla. -- A close call between a small jet and a passenger plane was caught on video.

The near miss comes as pilots take to the picket line on the busy Labor Day weekend.

The video is from inside a single-engine Cessna which had to take quick evasive action avoiding a disaster with a Delta 757 taking off nearby.

""I knew that this didn't look right so immediately I turned right and I climbed as steeply as I could because the Boeing 757 from Delta has a much higher climb rate than the aircraft that I was flying"" said Malik Clarke the Cessna pilot.

It happened above Orlando International Airport last month.

Tower: ""Runway 36l cleared for takeoff. Number 54 kilo contact departure.""

Cessna pilot: ""Going to departure 54 kilo.""

Clarke had just taken off nearby and said he instructed to overfly the runway where the Delta flight was taking off. Both pilots saw each other.

Tower: ""N5254K Orlando approach Roger and what heading did they give you.""

Cessna pilot: ""090 we saw it. We saw the guy coming so we just flew 150 now but they gave us 090 up to 2000.""

Delta pilot: ""Tower we got that traffic that just passed directly above us.""

Now the FAA is investigating but initial reports show the planes were closer than they should have been.

""If I hadn't done that evasive maneuver it's quite likely there would have been a midair collision"" Clarke said.

""The two aircraft got as close as 500 feet vertically and 1500 feet horizontally which means way too close. And it was somebody's error to put them in the same part of the sky"" said ABC News contributor Steve Ganyard.

Delta is also investigating and said ""nothing is more important than safety.""

The scare comes as airlines struggle with staffing and scheduling and with pilots picketing at 14 major airports around the country. However airlines stressed the pilots are off-duty and protests will not lead to delays or cancellations despite the busy weekend.

They Start Inventing ...,"Last week new music Friday was one for the books after DJ Khaled’s “GOD DID” dropped which features Jay-Z.

The OG’s one-take four-minute verse shook up fans even leading to an MSNBC news segment where journalist Ari Melber broke it down.

On Aug. 31 Jay-Z co-hosted a Twitter Space to share his own breakdown of what was his way to make the real “ones” feel seen.

My only goal is to make the real “ones” feel seen  forgive me that’s my passion talking ….. haa . https://t.co/yRzFlyie3f — Mr. Carter (@sc) August 31 2022

""Nobody touched the billi' until Hov did”

A standout line in Jay-Z’s verse is about how Jay-Z not only looked out for himself in building his wealth but for those in his circle. In playing a role in the careers of Kanye West Rihanna and LeBron James ultimately three powerful empires were birthed. Rob Markman noted how 10 years ago he talked of making millionaires to now billionaires.

“And we not gonna stop” Jay-Z declared. “You know Hip-Hop is young. We still growing and we are not falling for that tricknology.”

""Now the weed in stores can you believe this Ty?""

Jay-Z has never shied away from speaking about his past of selling drugs. What used to be a condemned hustle is now a billion-dollar industry which he has tapped into himself with his brand Monogram.

In his breakdown chat he alludes to how the Black community has overcome the harmful systems that have been long-running such as the war on drugs.

“That evolution that you speak of is just real and it’s happening in real time and I’m talking about it. And we are not gonna stop talking about it. You’re not gonna trick us out of and make us feel ashamed to be successful in the place that set up a system for us to be dead at 21. No sir. Not us.”

""Hov is a real n-gga's dream""

During the Twitter Space Jay-Z shared his belief that the American dream was all lies. To him his journey is an example of what living the dream is.

“Before it was the American dream. Pull yourself out of bootstraps and you can make it in America. All these lies that America told us our whole life. And then when we start getting it they try to lock us out of it. They start inventing words like capitalists and things like that. I mean we’ve been called nigg-r and monkeys and sh-t. I don’t care. Those words y’all come up with y’all gotta come up with stronger words.”

What has been taken as him implying that he’s pro-capitalism and that the term was “newly created” has raised eyebrows on social media.

Meanwhile since applying to build these facilities Interxion a subsidiary of Digital Realty has signaled that it is pausing some of its projects in Dublin given the area's much-publicized energy crisis .

An environmental group has protested against two data centers that Interxion is planning to build in Dublin - at a time when the company appears to be pausing some of its future developments.

DCD has contacted Interxion to check that the contested development is currently going forward.

The appeal has been filed at ABP by John Conway and Louth Environmental Group an organization which was active around ten years ago. The limited company Louth Envronmental Group was dissolved in 2013.

Digital Realty-owned Interxion filed for permission to build two 20MW data centers DUB15 and DUB16 next to its existing facilities in Profile Park Clondalkin in August 2021. Despite opposition from some local councilors it was approved by the council on 2 August 2022.

However during the intervening time there has been mounting concern over energy consumption of the data center sector in the area leading to an effective moratorium on future projects in the Dublin area.

The proposal would involve removing an unused wastewater treatment system and building two two-story data centers. The data centers were proposed by Digital Netherlands VIII B. V. a subsidiary of Interxion's parent Digital Realty. The proposals also include a gas-powered generator on the site to provide backup electricity to the two data centers.

The appeal from an environmental group based in Louth says that the area already has a “disproportionate” number of data centers and argues that the facilities' water usage could “divert a valuable resource away from the local community a situation which is likely to get worse as water scarcity becomes more of a problem and population increases.”

EirGrid the Irish electricity grid operator has previously warned that excessive demand by data centers could stress the area's electricity supply leading to the announcement that future facilities won't be approved in the Dublin area until at least 2028.

In May 2022 Seamus Dunne MD of Interxion’s Ireland operations revealed that the company was pausing a $300 million expansion plan in Dublin due to the Eirgrid moratorium on new facilities. He was referring to a proposal to build on eight acres of land in Dublin which Interxion bought in 2022 after the proposal to expand in Clondalkin.

This plot seems to have been earmarked for more facilities after DUB15 and DUB16. In May Dunne said the company was going through with the purchase even though building on it looked unlikely at the moment: “We had already committed to buying the land [for data center expansion] before the moratorium came into being and so we have little choice but to play the long game with it” he told Ireland's Business Post.

Meanwhile the ban on future data centers has been contested by Echelon DC in a legal challenge to South Dublin council",,,,,,,,,,,,

For example prostate cancer becomes resistant to hormone therapy by changing a protein called the androgen receptor (AR) which plays a key role in determining cellular identity. When this change occurs the treatment can no longer get a foothold. Researchers have designed ever more potent AR-targeting drugs to overcome this hurdle but some prostate cancers still escape — and it’s not been clear why.

In the past few years Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) researchers found a startling reason: Some prostate tumor cells completely change their identity to survive. This transformation known as lineage plasticity allows cancer cells to convert to a different cell type.

The reason AR-targeted drugs work in prostate cancer is that the particular cell lineage requires the androgen receptor to survive. When prostate cancer cells transition from adenocarcinoma cells to squamous or neuroendocrine cells the new cancer cells no longer rely on the androgen receptor protein. But how do the cells accomplish this shape-shifting trick?

Now research done in laboratory models and led by physician-scientist Charles Sawyers and Sloan Kettering Institute computational biologist Dana Pe’er has found that the cells enter the plastic state by activating inflammatory signaling pathways called JAK/STAT and FGFR. In addition they showed that blocking these signaling pathways if done early enough can cause cells that were in the transition phase to revert to their original form so they are once again sensitive to AR-targeted drugs. The findings could open the door to new clinical approaches.

This isn't a cancer cell making a minor change to alter a protein that a drug is targeting but instead becoming a fundamentally new thing. Dana Pe'er computational biologist

“While it’s scary to know that a tumor has the ability to once again outsmart our drugs this finding points to a strategy for stopping or slowing the process” says Dr. Sawyers the Marie-Josée Kravis and Henry R. Kravis Chair in Human Oncology and Pathogenesis. “We really understand this at a much better level than we did just a few years ago.”

The findings were reported in the August 18 issue of Science.

“This is a very complex form of drug resistance” Dr. Pe’er says. “This isn’t a cancer cell making a minor change to alter a protein that a drug is targeting but instead becoming a fundamentally new thing. Usually when a cell develops into a specific type that state is permanent — it no longer can change — but we are seeing cells switch their identity.”

A Novel Research Model Shows Transition Happening

Dr. Sawyers first became intrigued by the idea of cells changing type after medical oncologist Charles Rudin Chief of the Thoracic Service noticed similar plasticity in lung cancer cells. During treatment the tumors transformed from adenocarcinoma to small cell lung cancer. Dr. Sawyers knew of the same phenomenon in prostate cancer and wanted to pinpoint when the conversion takes place — and what causes it.

His lab developed an experimental system to watch the process unfold. This included two important parts. One was a genetically engineered mouse model for prostate cancer. The other involved mouse prostate cancer cells put into organoids three-dimensional structures composed of cells grouped together and spatially arranged like an organ or tissue.

“That was the first breakthrough in this research — creating the system” Dr. Sawyers says. “It allowed us to track the changes in the cells at every step.”

The researchers first studied prostate cells in the mouse models which develop prostate cancer in a way that’s similar to the prostate cancer that grows resistant to AR inhibitors in people.

They used a powerful technology called single-cell genomics which enables researchers to look closely at individual cells to determine which genes are expressed or “turned on.” (Dr. Pe’er is a world-renowned expert in this technique.) The analysis revealed that JAK/STAT and FGFR were especially active at the point when cells began transitioning to the new type.

While it's scary to know that a tumor has the ability to once again outsmart our drugs this finding points to a strategy for stopping or slowing the process. Charles L. Sawyers physician-scientist

This suggested JAK/STAT and FGFR might be bringing about the plasticity but it was not clear whether the cells could transform on their own. Inflammation is part of the immune response so it was possible immune cells around the tumor were sending signals to the cancer cells to trigger the plasticity.

The researchers were able to answer this question of causation using the organoids which contained only mouse prostate cells — no immune cells. Single-cell analysis showed the same activation of JAK/STAT and FGFR providing solid evidence that the inflammatory signal was causing plasticity and that this was triggered directly within the prostate cells.

“It takes about four weeks in the organoid system to see the cells start to change with your own eyes” Dr. Sawyers says. “But with single-cell analysis you see the molecular alterations first and then the actual changes in the cell’s morphology [shape and structure] like watching a movie unfold.”

In the organoids the prostate cells did not complete the transition all the way to the final stage — they needed to be put back into the mouse prostate for this to happen. This suggests that signals from other cells play a crucial role as well.

Blocking the Transition to Restore Drugs’ Effectiveness

How might this discovery help patients? In the organoid models the researchers showed that giving JAK/STAT and FGFR inhibitors could cause the prostate cancer cells to revert to a state where they were once again dependent on androgen receptors — and responsive to AR-targeting drugs. This suggests the same approach could work in humans.

“What’s very much next on my list is to take a finding like this and see if we can get something into the clinic that’s smartly designed based on the preclinical data” Dr. Sawyers says.

Patients whose prostate tumors have developed resistance to hormone therapy and have high levels of JAK/STAT and FGFR signaling might receive inhibitors that stop them early in the transition phase. Dr. Sawyers says that in the short term biopsies would be needed to stratify (or group) patients but he hopes a blood-based biomarker can be identified that would make it possible to get the necessary information from a blood test. He sees the current finding dovetailing with prostate cancer research reported in May 2022 by MSK physician-scientist Yu Chen also published in Science.

“They defined four different categories of resistant prostate cancer and one of them really matches this inflammatory-signaling subset we’re describing in our research” Dr. Sawyers says. “There’s a synergy between their story and our story that might lead to a blood-based biomarker.”

Drs. Sawyers and Pe’er praised MSK’s Marie-Josée and Henry R. Kravis Foundation for funding preclinical laboratory research on tumor ecosystems and how they affect cancer cell behavior.

“They deserve tremendous credit for believing in us so much and giving us the resources to answer these questions” Dr. Pe’er says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vbWFsZS1kb2xwaGlucy1wbGF5LXdpbmdtZW4taGVscC0xMjI0NDkzODUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Male Dolphins Play 'Wingmen' To Help Buddies Hook Up Researchers Discover,"(Photo: imageBROKER/Andrey Nekrasov via Getty Images)

Bottlenose dolphins form decadeslong male bonds and work together to help pals find mates researchers have discovered.

The dolphin “wingmen” cooperate in sophisticated alliances to help one another pair off — and ward off competitors.

But most extraordinary is that the dolphins not only form associations within groups but forge intergroup alliances in sophisticated social interactions only previously observed in humans noted the researchers who published their findings earlier this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

“These dolphins have long-term stable alliances and they have intergroup alliances: alliances of alliances of alliances” University of Massachusetts Dartmouth behavioral ecologist Richard Connor one of the paper’s authors told The Guardian. “Before our study it had been thought that cooperative alliances between groups were unique to humans.”

The research findings support the “social brain” hypothesis: that mammals’ brains evolved to be proportionately larger to develop complex social relationships.

Humans and dolphins are the two animals with the largest brains relative to their body size. “It’s not a coincidence” Connor noted.

The scientists reached their conclusions by closely observing and listening to dolphins in intensive boat-based surveys from 2001 to 2006 in Shark Bay Western Australia. They kept close tabs on 202 Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins including during mating season.

They tracked alliances among several “first-order” associations of two or three male dolphins that sometimes grew to 14 members in second-level associations. The groups helped each other find females to herd and mate with. They also helped lure away females from other competing groups of dolphins — and together defended against attempts at “theft” of females by rivals. In addition they joined forces with other groups to pursue mutual goals.

The tighter the group and the more intense the bonds among males the more success they had in attracting females the researchers found.

The groups form when the dolphins are still young. Group members generally don’t reap the rewards of paternity until their midteens researchers found.

Stephanie King affiliate professor of animal behavior at the University of Bristol and another study author noted in a statement: “Not only have we shown that male bottlenose dolphins form the largest known multilevel alliance network outside humans but that cooperative relationships between groups rather than simply alliance size allows males to spend more time with females thereby increasing their reproductive success.”

We have a new paper out in @PNASNews showing that dolphins like humans benefit from intergroup cooperation and that intergroup alliances can emerge directly from a promiscuous mating system without pair bonds or male parental care @ResearchDolphinhttps://t.co/SLbDGVu1bTpic.twitter.com/POojSlC6xb — Stephanie L King (@_StephanieLKing) August 30 2022

King called “cooperation between allies” in human societies “one of the hallmarks of our success” and a strategy clearly employed by dolphins.

Our “capacity to build strategic cooperative relationships at multiple social levels such as trade or military alliances both nationally and internationally was once thought unique to our species” she added.

Connor said it’s amazing how similar — and how different — humans and dolphins are.

“I would say that dolphins and humans have converged in the evolution of between-group alliances — an incredibly complex social system” said Connor. Yet it’s “astonishing because we are so different from dolphins.”

The new chairman of the Senate Republican campaign arm had a mind to modernize the place. One of his first decisions was to overhaul how the group raised money online.

Mr. Scott installed a new digital team spearheaded by Trump veterans and greenlit an enormous wave of spending on digital ads not to promote candidates but to discover more small contributors. Soon the committee was smashing fund-raising records. By the summer of 2021 Mr. Scott was boasting about “historic investments in digital fund-raising that are already paying dividends.”

A year later some of that braggadocio has vanished — along with most of the money.

The National Republican Senatorial Committee has long been a critical part of the party apparatus recruiting candidates supporting them with political infrastructure designing campaign strategy and buying television ads.

By the end of July the committee had collected a record $181.5 million — but had already spent more than 95 percent of what it had brought in. The Republican group entered August with just $23.2 million on hand less than half of what the Senate Democratic committee had ahead of the final intense phase of the midterm elections.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndlZm9ydW0ub3JnL2FnZW5kYS8yMDIyLzA5L2NsaW1hdGUtY2hhbmdlLWxhdGVzdC1zdG9yaWVzLTAyLXNlcHRlbWJlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How are countries cutting emissions? And other top climate change stories | World Economic Forum,"This weekly roundup brings you some key climate change stories from the past seven days.

Top stories this week: How countries are cutting back on carbon; Germany's eco-friendly transport scheme; Great Salt Lake shrinks; US to plant 1 billion trees; How to raise resilience to extreme heat.

1. These regions produce a lot of carbon emissions - here’s what they plan to do about it

Roughly a third of global electricity production capacity currently comes from low-carbon sources with 26% from renewables and around 10% from nuclear power. But the remainder still comes from greenhouse-gas emitting fossil fuels.

The International Energy Agency says annual investment in clean energy must triple by 2030 if the world is to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

Countries around the world are making strides to cut their use of fossil fuels and boost clean energy sources. Consider the US where clean energy comprised 67% of new electric generating capacity during the first half of this year.

2. Germany's €9 transit ticket cuts 1.8 million tonnes of CO2

In response to the rising cost of living and the nation's net-zero commitments Germany started offering monthly public transit tickets for €9 at the start of June. Over 52 million people took advantage of the tickets and the reduction in car use has cut carbon dioxide emissions by 1.8 million tonnes according to VDV the leading public-transport organisation in Germany.

Additionally researchers at the University of Potsdam found that air pollution levels fell by up to 7% in response to this shift in German transport use. The ticket scheme expired at the end of August despite calls for an extension.

3. The Great Salt Lake is getting a little less great - here’s why

The biggest salt water lake in the western hemisphere hit a record low of 1276.9 metres on 10 August. In 1986 the lake was at its highest recorded level with an average water height of 1283.7 metres.

“Though water levels in the Great Salt Lake can fluctuate by year they have generally been declining for decades” warns NASA’s Earth Observatory.

Explore why the Great Salt Lake is shrinking and the impacts this is having.

4. The US is planting a billion trees to fight climate change

Trees have the ability to capture carbon from the atmosphere and store it for generations. They are vital tools in tackling climate change and more and more countries are looking to use this nature-based solution in response to global warming.

The US is among those countries aiming to plant 1 billion trees over the next 10 years.

5. Extreme heat is weakening cities financial services can help build resilience

In the last month alone Spain and Portugal have collectively reported 2000 fatalities due to extreme heat. Despite the dangers of extreme heat more global attention is consistently given to more visible disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes or floods writes Daniel Murphy Risk and Resilience Specialist at the World Economic Forum.

Extreme heat is more deadly than any other extreme weather event in the US. Image: National Weather Service

But a growing body of research is showing the effects of extreme heat. Not only does extreme heat hit cities' infrastructure it also harms the mental and physical health of citizens which inhibits economic growth and individual social mobility and therefore exacerbates existing socio-economic inequities.

A multi-stakeholder approach is necessary if cities are to build heat resilience. Look at Seville which has seen success due to its involvement of leaders in public health finance insurance and academia.

The current environment is entirely different though and has prompted fears of a sustained period of stagflation.

There are few comparable periods in the recent history of financial markets to use as a guide but were this to continue the optimal asset allocation and strategy mix for portfolios would likely be very different from that of the post global financial crisis period.

There are slightly varying definitions of stagflation but it generally refers to a period of slowing growth and rising unemployment (stagnation) together with rising inflation.

These conditions are most challenging for economies and markets when growth is low and inflation is high and when they persist for a long period of time.

Although unemployment has not picked up yet we are clearly seeing a significant slowdown in growth this year and sharp increases in inflation; the annual growth in consumer prices in the UK hit 10.1 per cent in August ahead of expectations yet again and at a 40-year high.

Average incomes have not kept pace so real wages have fallen at the fastest rate in decades. While the UK position is worse than in many other countries for various reasons a similar pattern is playing out across much of the developed world.

There have been very few extended periods of stagflation in recent history but the 1970s was the clearest and most acute and the torrid investment returns over that period explains why the scenario inspires so much fear in markets.

The combination of weaker growth (at least in real terms if not also in nominal terms) and rising prices is generally bad for both equity and bond markets.

For equities sales are falling and costs are rising therefore profits are being squeezed. For bonds rising inflation leads to higher yields and lower prices.

Of course there are some exceptions but broadly speaking these are the effects of stagflation with nominal returns below inflation and in many cases negative in absolute terms.

In contrast real assets which include property infrastructure and commodities have greater inherent resilience. Such physical tangible assets can often benefit from resilient or increased demand or higher prices sometimes through explicit inflation linkage while costs can also be contained.

In the 1970s the standout asset class was commodities. Gold silver and oil to name just a few delivered very strong nominal returns and even double-digit (annualised) returns in real terms while prices of several other hard and soft commodities also outpaced inflation."

44-year-old Jeremy Dewayne McCrary is charged with five felony counts in the case: malice murder felony murder voluntary manslaughter aggravated assault and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.

Walker County Sheriff Steve Wilson says deputies arrested McCrary in his home last Wednesday. He's now in the Walker County Jail.



The road rage incident between two motorcycles and an SUV  east of Chickamauga on Lee Clarkson Road and continued onto Highway 341 before ending in a Dollar General Store parking lot.

Wilson says the motorcycles tried to pass the SUV which then made a move to swerve in front of them.



Sheriff Wilson says the men engaged in a scuffle and that McCrary one of the motorcyclists fired a 9mm weapon hitting Danny Claire who was driving the SUV in the chest.



""I think both parties could be deemed to have been the aggressor almost together"" Sheriff Wilson told us back in March when we reported that authorities were not planning to file charges in this case. That's now changed.



""The investigation revealed...McCrary fired one shot from a handgun striking and causing the death of Claire"" Wilson's release says.

Sheriff Wilson says there's no evidence the suspect and victim knew each other and it's still unclear what touched off the deadly incident.

We are working to obtain McCrary's mug shot and we'll update our story once we do.

Ali and Chase Burmeister bought their dream home in Lafayette Township about eight years ago. Since then they’ve put blood sweat and tears into it.

But now just steps away from their home their new next-door neighbor will be a Dollar General store.

“I’ve spent the last 2 months versing myself in our zoning resolution our comprehensive plan Ohio Revised Code just to educate myself” she said.

They and several other residents have been fighting the proposed store since Lafayette Township Trustees approved the sale of the land.

Burmeister evenstarted an online petition to keep Dollar General out of Lafayette Township. It has more than 600 signatures to date.

Steve Dimonski a resident agreed with their fight to keep the store out.

“I think the stores are ugly looking. I don’t think they belong out here. They don’t fit the area” he said. “I think it harms the ‘Mom and Pop’ stores because these box stores come in and have so much buying power that they just run these ‘Mom and Pop’ stores out.""

Despite their concerns at a special meeting Friday afternoon Lafayette Township Trustees approved the site plans of the store. The approval means the construction can and will begin.

Chris O’Neil is the Township’s Zoning Liaison and one of the three trustees. He said the property is in a commercially zoned area and while he sympathizes with the residents they can’t pick and choose what goes in.

“We keep getting told that there’s absolutely nothing the trustees can do. They’re following the zoning ordinances so we can’t stop this and we keep saying we can stop it. There has to be something we can do” said Dimonski.

Burmeister said after studying the site plans and comparing them to township code she feels like there are violations in the plan.

“They can’t pick and choose what comes in but our zoning code is the tool to uphold our comprehensive plan. If you read up on those and educate yourself on those there are definitely violations on this project and they chose to ignore that.”

O’Neil said the trustees legal counsel and the zoning inspector reviewed the plan and said there weren’t any problems with it.

Burmeister didn’t get a chance to tell them what she has found because Friday’s meeting did not allow public comment.

“It never should’ve passed today without modifications” she said.

Dimonski feels like the meeting lacked transparency and accountability.

“This special meeting here kind of got thrown on us at the last minute. The agenda for this special meeting was not on the township’s website. It’s a Friday on a holiday weekend at 4:00 in the afternoon” he said.

O’Neil said the meeting was moved from Monday because of Labor Day and that they’ve been discussing the Dollar General site for months with the public so there wasn’t anything new introduced at Friday’s meeting.

However Burmeister feels like they’re not listening.

“To shut out the people that they’re supposed to be the voice for out of something that is really big in our township it is really disgraceful” she said. “This fight is not over.”

U.S. operators have shown restraint but according to World Oil’s mid-year forecast a further activity increase is in the offing.

The war in Ukraine has limited Russian oil and gas supplies and has the potential to cause a major shift in the world’s energy market. No one knows how long Russia intends to wage war in Ukraine or how much of its crude will be affected by sanctions or for how long. The uncertainty caused by the supply disruption has driven crude prices to multi-year highs. And anxieties persist that surging oil prices may rise so high that demand destruction will damage the global economy and cause a worldwide recession. However Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is creating a new market for U.S. LNG producers as product flows to Europe to replace Russian natural gas. The longer the conflict persists the more entrenched U.S. LNG will become.

ESG impact. Although the U.S. petroleum industry faces continued pressure from President Biden and environmental groups about the imperative of reducing fossil fuel usage to slow GHG emissions the drive for rapid implementation has lessened. However the transition to renewables and clean energy alternatives has created an unprecedented reduction of investment in hydrocarbon-based energy in favor of developing green resources. During 2021 global oil and gas discoveries hit their lowest level in 75 years. Total global discovered volumes in 2021 were calculated at 4.7 Bboe the lowest tally since 1946. This trend is predicted to continue in 2022. A data-based comparison shows a significant reduction in recoverable oil resources that will drive commodity prices higher and further damage global energy security.

U.S. production surges. Despite a sizeable drop in recoverable resources U.S. oil production remains on track for a record in 2023 even as output grows more slowly than anticipated amid increased costs and labor shortages in America’s shale fields. Output is expected to expand at an average 840000 bopd next year down from a prior forecast of 860000 bopd according to the EIA. While production is still seen reaching an all-time high in 2023 the government revised its forecast slightly lower to 12.7 MMbopd. The current annual U.S. record average is 12.3 MMbopd set in 2019.

At the start of the year production in the U.S. (11.7 MMbopd) Saudi Arabia (10.2 MMbopd) and Russia (11.0 MMbopd) was running at nearly full capacity. Brent and WTI were trading at $86.51/bbl and $83.22 respectively. When Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 2022 the EU and international community reacted quickly by boycotting Russian supply. The embargo quickly pushed prices up and in June Brent was trading for $122.71/bbl and WTI hit $114.84/bbl the highest price since August 2008. Prices retreated in July down to $111.93/bbl for Brent and $101.62/bbl for WTI due to rising interest rates and fear of economic recession despite restricted Russian supply.

Demand to lessen. The global surge in the cost of fuel is starting to weigh on demand according to Vitol Group the world’s largest independent oil trader. Consumers are being impacted by the run-up in gasoline diesel and other oil products said Mike Muller head of Vitol Asia. There is clear evidence of economic stress being caused by high oil and natural gas prices according to Muller.

MACRO U.S. PICTURE

The Baker Hughes rotary rig count stood at 588 units during the week ending Jan. 7 2022. U.S. drilling activity climbed steadily for the next seven months although it slowed in July and August reaching 760 in the week ending Sept. 2 Fig. 1. Although the 172-rig increase represents a Jan.-Sept. increase of 29% U.S. shale operators have resisted ramping-up drilling activity and remained relatively disciplined with their capital expenditures. The speed at which new rigs have been deployed to the field is considerably less than in previous up-price cycles. Most U.S. shale companies are still being conservative as priorities remain focused on protecting balance sheets and generating free cash flow.

This conservative approach along with high oil prices has enabled shale companies to reduce their debt burdens in the second quarter signaling room for them to pay dividends buy back shares or make acquisitions. A metric commonly used to measure companies’ ability to pay down their borrowings has widely improved among oil and gas producers as they repurchase some bonds and pile up cash amid ballooning profits.

Net debt reported by a group of independent operators including ConocoPhillips and Pioneer Natural Resources averaged less than 0.6 times their annual earnings before items such as interest and taxes in the second quarter down from 1.7 times a year earlier. Many companies have reached their debt target. Energy companies have made great strides toward repairing and reinforcing their balance sheets and are in a much stronger position to handle another downturn in commodity prices.

With WTI trading between $85/bbl and $95/bbl U.S. shale producers are on course to generate $200 billion this year enough to make the industry debt-free by 2024 and potentially fund a pivot toward more natural gas production (Deloitte). High oil prices and disciplined capital spending mean U.S. shale producers are on track for their most profitable year on record part of a global trend that will see the oil and gas industry generate a record $1.4 trillion of free cash flow. After paying down debt and rewarding shareholders U.S. producers will likely focus more on natural gas production due to high demand and prices around the world. Producers will also make record profits from U.S. LNG operations. They are expected to generate $59 billion this year double last year’s amount and easily recouping the $45 billion of losses from 2013 to 2020.

OVERALL U.S. FORECAST

Due to sustained higher oil prices World Oil forecasts a noticeable uptick in drilling activity for the remainder of the year projecting 18600 total wells for 2022—a 34% increase from the 2021 count of 13877 Table 1. Total footage is projected to increase from 191.5 MMft in 2021 to 256.4 MMft in 2022—an increase of 34%. During 2022 8769 wells are estimated to have been drilled during the first six months while 9831 are expected to spud in the second half of the year for a half-to-half increase of 12.1%. A 14.9% increase in footage is expected in the last six months.

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS

Oil prices have been rising since the start of 2021 bolstered by restricted Russian supplies and recovering demand. However upstream M&A activity which typically follows oil prices remains well below pre-pandemic levels. The total count and value of U.S. upstream deals during the first eight months of 2021 were down 30% and 46% respectively from the same period in 2019.

While the ongoing capital discipline of operating companies is the primary reason behind the slowdown in upstream M&A activity limited visibility of buyers into the carbon profile of sellers’ assets is a growing factor. Companies pursuing their net-zero goals are either looking to acquire low-carbon-intensity barrels or divest the high-intensity ones implying that there might be an acreage consolidation or portfolio restructuring on the horizon (Deloitte). But a large resource size and an attractive offering price may not be enough to elicit a response from a buyer focused on meeting its net-zero targets. Therefore M&A activities would need not only to be financially accretive but also to support ESG goals.

Devon Energy agreed to acquire Validus Energy for $1.8 billion in cash to expand in the Eagle Ford shale play in South Texas. The deal will add to Devon’s cash flow and earnings in the first year and boost its variable dividend by up to 10% based on current oil futures prices. Devon also said the transaction will enable the acceleration of the return of cash to investors via its existing $2 billion stock buyback program. Buying Validus will add 42000 net acres adjacent to Devon’s existing leasehold in the Eagle Ford. Validus’s production is approximately 35000 boed with volumes expected to increase to 40000 boed over the next year.

EQT to buy Marcellus assets. EQT Corp the largest U.S. natural gas producer agreed to acquire THQ Appalachia a privately held company in a $5.2 billion deal to expand holdings in the Marcellus shale. The company purchased the assets from Alta Resources for $2.9 billion. It also acquired Chevron’s assets in Appalachia for $735 million in 2020. THQ Appalachia produces nearly 800 MMcfgd in West Virginia. The company has about 11 years of inventory at maintenance capital levels. EQT is expected to produce the equivalent of 5.5 Bcfd this year.

OFS COSTS ARE UP

Heading into 2022 most operators expected pricing to increase for nearly all service lines but seismic. Labor tubulars fracturing/stimulation and transportation were the areas of greatest concern. A modest 15% expected pricing to remain stable including nearly 39% for completion equipment 35% for other services and 33% for drilling. Further pricing concessions were expected by a modest few for seismic services and tubulars.

Further pricing increases are expected in the second half of 2022 with limited availability of OCTG and casing potentially curtailing spending revisions. Overall spending in OFS is expected to remain about 25% below 2019 levels until 2025. With margins at the mercy of another price cycle and reduced spending many OFS companies are crafting a new strategy for the future of energy. With a broadening decarbonization mandate across industries companies have an opportunity to lead the way for customers by fully re-engineering traditional OFS business models and solutions outside the traditional oilfield services and to other industries.

Many large service providers have diversified beyond core services. One large company has restructured its business by launching cloud and edge computing services whose rate of growth is expected to outpace that of their O&G business in a few years. Similarly Halliburton and Baker Hughes are partnering with start-ups and academic institutions through their Halliburton Labs and Baker Hughes Energy Innovation Center respectively to accelerate technology development for diverse energy and industrial applications.

However digitalization will only help to a certain extent. Providing integrated solutions for decarbonizing upstream projects implementing subscription-based revenue models or diversifying into the low-carbon space such as hydrogen and CCUS are key to future growth.

LEASING DECLINES

The number of licensed blocks and total acreage fell to near all-time lows as the sector struggles to shake off the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing oil market crash (Rystad). Only 21 leasing rounds were completed globally through August this year half of the 42 rounds held in the first eight months of 2021. The acreage awarded so far this year has shrunk to a 20-year low of 320000 km2. Global leasing rounds are expected to total 44 this year 14 less than in 2021 and the lowest level since 2000.

Global spending on exploration has been falling in recent years as oil and gas companies seek to limit risk by focusing on core producing assets and regions with guaranteed output aiming to streamline their operations and build a more resilient business amid market uncertainty and the threat of a recession. The political landscape is also contributing to the decrease in license awards with many governments pausing or halting leases and encouraging companies to wrap up exploration activity within already awarded blocks. This trend is likely to continue as governments are less eager to invest in fossil fuel production and instead look ahead to a net zero future.

The onshore exploration sector is a significant contributor to the decline in awarded acreage. Total onshore acreage awarded in leasing activity has plummeted from more than 560000 km2 in 2019 to a mere 115000 km2 so far this year. Offshore leased acreage hit a high point in 2019 before dropping off a cliff in 2020 and has remained relatively flat in the past two years. Concluded leasing rounds have dropped significantly in the U.S. driven primarily by the cancellation of Lease Sales 259 and 261 in the Gulf of Mexico and Cook Inlet in Alaska.

EMPLOYMENT

Employment in the U.S. oilfield services and equipment sector rose by an estimated 6865 jobs to 648914 in August according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and analysis by the Energy Workforce & Technology Council. Gains in August make OFS employment the highest since the Covid-19 pandemic began but they are still off the pre-pandemic mark in February 2020 of 706528. Overall U.S. employers added 315000 jobs down from July numbers but still representing a strong pace of growth.

CAPEX FORECAST

North American spending is forecast to increase 33% from 2021 levels which is an acceleration from 20.6% growth projected in a December survey and builds on the modest 1% increase experienced in 2021 according to James West senior managing director at Evercore ISI. The increase is driven by a 1260 bps acceleration in the U.S. to 36% growth which more than offset a 2.8% decline in spending in 2021 excluding the historical capex of distressed companies that have since been acquired or privatized. Private and independent operators are leading the recovery with capex accelerating by 1440 bps and 1550 bps from the December survey to 56% and 42% respectively and also accelerating from 41% and 5% growth in 2021. More modest growth of 25% and 19% are anticipated from the majors and NOCs both of which contracted further in 2021.

While the majors have more than offset declines in 2021 despite recent divestitures—with Evercore’s projected 2022 spending nearly 7% above 2020 levels—spending from the NOCs remains 25% lower to account for less than 1% of total U.S. spending (vs. almost 2% in 2020). Overall the majors account for almost 30% of U.S. capex down from 36% in 2020 while the independents including privates account for 70% of all spending up from 62%. U.S. capex is on track to recover within 25% of pre-pandemic levels and approach levels last seen in 2009 before the start of the oil shale revolution.

There could be modest upside to NAM spending in in the second half of 2022 with current spot prices above the $84/Bbl WTI and $5.18/MMbtu HH average basis for establishing 2022 budgets. While half of survey respondents would maintain their budget regardless of changes in the oil and gas price one-third are willing to flex capex higher for rising cash flow. However Evercore believes upside is likely to remain muted as activity could be constrained by the availability of goods services and labor.

Operators have been highly disciplined over the past year as commodity prices increased. Yet a new round of consolidation may drive spending higher if commodity prices stabilize at a significantly higher range and confidence in the duration of the cycle increases. From a lower base Evercore believes the set-up is positive for growth in 2023 and beyond.

EIA FORECAST

The EIA’s Short-Term Energy Outlook published September 2022 reports that STEO is subject to heightened uncertainty resulting from Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and how sanctions affect Russia’s oil production. Also contributing to uncertainty is the production decisions of OPEC+ the rate at which U.S. oil and natural gas production rises and other contributing factors. Less robust economic activity in the STEO forecast could result in lower-than-expected energy consumption.

Oil price forecast. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has resulted in shifting trade patterns leaving Europe to find substitutes for Russia’s oil. This change has driven up the price of Brent contracts to a level high enough to reduce Asia’s imports of Brent and to retain more oil in Europe. EIA forecasts the spot price of Brent crude will average $98/bbl in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $97/bbl in 2023. The possibility of petroleum supply disruptions and slower-than-expected crude oil production growth continues to create the potential for higher oil prices while the possibility of slower-than-forecast economic growth creates the potential for lower prices.

Crude production forecast. U.S. crude oil production is forecast to average 11.8 MMbopd in 2022 and 12.6 MMbopd during 2023 which would set a record for the most U.S. oil output during a year. The current record is 12.3 MMbopd set in 2019.

Natural gas prices. In August the Henry Hub spot price averaged $8.80/MMBtu up from $7.28/MMBtu in July. Natural gas prices rose in August because of continued strong demand for natural gas in the electric power sector which has kept natural gas inventories below their five-year (2017–2021) average. EIA expects HH price to average $9/MMBtu in in the fourth quarter of 2022 and then fall to an average $6/MMBtu in 2023 as U.S. natural gas production rises.

Natural gas production. Dry natural gas production has been rising relatively steadily since the first quarter of 2022 when it averaged 94.6 Bcfd. EIA forecasts U.S. natural gas production to average 99.0 Bcfd during fourth-quarter 2022 and then rise to 100.4 Bcfd in 2023.

U.S. FORECAST

Given the restricted Russian supply demand recovery and resulting increase in crude prices operators working the various U.S. plays plan to noticeably increase drilling activity for the remainder of 2022. Overall activity in the Texas shale plays will improve in the second half of the year with the exception of District 7B District 8 and District 8A which will suffer slight second-half losses. However drilling on the Texas side of the Haynesville is projected to improve 26% on a y-o-y basis. Gulf of Mexico activity will increase 8.4% but a decline of 70% is forecast offshore California both on a y-o-y basis.

Gulf of Mexico. Higher oil prices should help boost activity slightly in the GOM and it appears that offshore operators are poised to resume limited development in 2022-2023 after last year’s decline Fig. 3. World Oil’s survey results and federal officials’ predicted well counts show a slight increase during second-half 2022. World Oil forecasts that GOM activity totaled 63 wells in the first half of the year with another 65 scheduled to be drilled during second-half 2022. The projected 128-well total will be 8.4% higher than 2021’s figure of 118. Footage drilled should be up 6.6% on a y-o-y basis.

STATE-BY-STATE OUTLOOK

Texas. Most of the shale plays in the Lone Star State are gaining ground during 2022. On a half-over-half basis World Oil predicts Texas wells will gain 11.6% with the 2022 total being 39% more than the 2021 figure. In the Permian basin (Fig. 4) District 8 will be up 8% in the second half buts its total will be 26% higher than wells drilled in 2021. Districts 7C and 8A will enjoy much-improved drilling activity with gains of 33% and 172% respectively compared to their 2021 totals.

The Eagle Ford forecast is also good with District 1 forecast to improve 30% in the second half and up 64% on a y-o-y basis. District 2 will experience a 4% gain in activity in the second half and is also projected to be up 26% on a y-o-y basis. District 4 in the Eagle Ford will experience a 47% increase between the two halves and post a massive 157% gain from 2021’s level. The reason that District 4 is surging is more gas-related activity. Of the 12 Railroad Districts 10 are forecast to experience gains with only two losing ground on a half-over-half basis. Again more gas drilling is a factor especially in RRC 6 with the Haynesville up 36% y-o-y.

DUC wells decline. According to EIA’s July 2022 tally the DUC total stood at 4277 a reduction of 1680 wells since July 2021 a reduction of 28%. In the Permian basin operators have completed 1092 DUC wells during the July 2022-July 2021 interval a reduction of 48%. All other regions declined too with the exception of the Haynesville which added 80 DUC wells up to 477 a y-o-y increase of 20%.

Oklahoma. Although the SCOOP and STACK plays are not as prolific as the Permian or Eagle Ford acreage in Kingfisher Canadian Blaine and Grady counties continues to attract interest for hydrocarbon development. But the region’s inconsistent geology and less-than-ideal shale formations have produced unpredictable results reducing ROI. However with higher oil prices the plays have become more attractive and we predict a major increase in Oklahoma’s activity. World Oil forecasts companies will drill 79% more wells in 2022 than last year’s total. Total footage will also surge forward 75% with operators making 15.7 MMft of hole.

Louisiana. In the state’s northern portion we forecast operators developing Haynesville shale gas will drill 25% more wells in 2022 than they did in 2021 with total footage up approximately 17%. With natural gas prices at near-record highs the increase in activity could continue similar to the Haynesville play in Texas RRC District 6. Despite near-record high natural gas prices DUCs in the Haynesville were up to 477 in July a jump of 20%. In the mature shallow oil plays of southern Louisiana we expect operators to drill 46% more wells compared to last year. Well footage is expected to increase 29% on a y-o-y basis.

North Dakota. The Bakken is running out of steam. Although transportation issues remain a challenge in this oil-rich shale play a greater concern is that the sweet spot has reached maximum infill development Fig. 5. However higher oil prices will help negate the cost of drilling the 21100-ft wells. Considering these factors along with data from state officials and World Oil operator surveys we forecast that drilling will be up a disappointing 4% with footage increasing 2.9% y-o-y in the Peace Garden State.

Northeast (Pa./W.V./Ohio). In the Northeast Marcellus activity is on an upward trend similar to other U.S. shale plays Fig. 6. Improving natural gas prices and increased LNG exports from Dominion Energy’s massive Cove Point facility are helping drive activity higher in the region. According to survey results operators tapping the high-quality reservoir in Pennsylvania will increase the number of wells drilled this year by 18% compared to the number drilled in 2021. Total footage for 2022 is forecast to jump 16.5%.

In Ohio operators working the Utica play plan to focus on growth and capitalize on higher gas prices with this year’s total well count expected to finish 30% higher than last year’s level. Footage is forecast to increase 31%. In West Virginia World Oil forecasts operators will drill 84 more wells than the number spudded in 2021 up 62%. We also forecast a 64% surge in total footage in the Mountain State. Despite surging gas prices operators working the shale fields of Appalachia were able to reduce the region’s DUC count by only eight wells in July on a y-o-y basis a reduction of just 11%.

Midwest (Illinois/Kansas). There are approximately 32100 oil and gas wells 10500 Class II injection wells and 1750 gas storage wells producing from 650 fields in Illinois. These wells are controlled by 1500 operators. There is oil production in 40 of the 102 counties mainly in the southern part of the state. Drilling will surge with a 61% increase in wells forecast for 2022 compared to 2021’s level. Although the wells are relatively shallow they provide work for the oilfield community and the drilling crews. We forecast a 59% jump in total footage.

In Kansas much of the shallow drilling in the Hugoton basin appears to stay below the Baker Hughes rig count radar. But according to the Kansas Corporation Commission drilling in the Sunflower State is projected to increase 24% in 2022 compared to the 1005 drilled in 2021. Total footage is forecast to jump 24%.

Rocky Mountains. The Denver Julesburg basin has experienced a constant decline since production peaked in November 2019. Reversing this trend will depend on the capital allocation from major operators in the region. The DJ basin accounted for 7% of oil and 6.6% of natural gas production in the Lower 48 in 2021 (GlobalData). While other U.S. basins have increased their rig count with the rise in commodity prices. Operators like Oxy and Chevron are earning better returns from investments in other basins but could grow production in the DJ by completing their DUC backlog.

In Colorado officials continue to attempt to ban or severely limit drilling in the state. In 2019 the state passed Senate Bill 118 “which fundamentally altered the oil and gas industry’s future in the state” according to Colorado Governor Jared Polis. However it appears companies intend to push back and continue operations on existing leases as World Oil expects operators in Colorado to drill 40% more wells in 2022 compared to activity during 2021. Total footage is projected to increase by 40% on a y-o-y basis.

In 2019 a federal judge ordered a halt to exploration on 300000 acres in Wyoming saying the government must account for its cumulative effect on climate change. The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by a pair of environmental groups challenging the BLM’s decision to lease federal lands for energy development in the state. Given that nearly 50% of all lands in Wyoming are owned by the federal government a ban on federal leasing would decimate the natural gas industry and Wyoming’s economy. Despite the ongoing lawsuit operators working in the state plan to increase drilling activity by 24% in 2022. World Oil predicts footage will increase 25%.

Canadian Overseas Petroleum received a resource report prepared by Ryder Scott that confirmed its deep oil discovery on lands in Converse and Natrona counties Wyoming. The report confirms the deep discovery has total original oil in place of 993.5 MMbbl. This supports the company’s conclusion that the Frontier 2 and Dakota discoveries are large stratigraphic oil accumulations encompassing the reserves at the company’s Cole Creek field. The report outlines 118 horizontal well locations to exploit the identified Frontier 2 and Dakota reserves. COPL plans to drill one Frontier 1 well and two horizontal Frontier 2 wells as part of its 2022-2023 drilling campaign commencing in fourth-quarter 2022.

Acreage in New Mexico has become as desirable as land on the Texas side of the Permian basin. Increased completion efficiencies in the Bone Springs formation will help support activity as drilling in the Land of Enchantment is forecast to increase 23% on a half-over-half basis and 30% y-o-y for 2022. Total footage will increase 33% y-o-y.

In California we expect onshore operators to spud four fewer wells in 2022 compared to 2021. But with no new discoveries operators working the Golden State are forced to survive by maintaining less-attractive heavy oil fields and residual acreage from long-ago discoveries. However considering the mature nature of these fields onshore footage is forecast to climb 15% (y-o-y) suggesting deeper total depths as operators squeeze out more oil from these old fields. Drilling offshore California will drop dramatically with only three wells expected in 2022 a y-o-y decline of 70%. Accordingly footage is forecast to drop 65%.

In Alaska the U.S. DOJ filed a brief defending the Willow project an energy development within the NPRA on Alaska’s North Slope that has been halted by litigation. The Biden administration announced it would review the Willow plan approved in 2020 by the Trump administration for consistency. The project is proposed by ConocoPhillips and if approved the project will provide 100000 bopd $10 billion in revenue for state local and federal governments during its lifespan 2000 construction jobs and 300 permanent jobs. It appears the prospect of opening new acreage is having the desired effect. Offshore work will surge 109% in 2022 12 more than spud in 2021. Onshore activity on the North Slope is projected to increase 67% with total footage up 67%.

Others. Activity in non-core producing states will also enjoy a jump in activity. Drilling will increase on a y-o-y basis in Alabama Arkansas Montana Nebraska and New York.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyb3pldGdhemV0dGUuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMDIvZGNpLXByZXNlbnRzLWFubnVhbC11cGRhdGUtb24tdGhlLWRvd250b3duLXBsYXphL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DCI Presents Annual Update on the Downtown Plaza,"Developer Frank Stoner discussed the history and current status of his Downtown Crozet Plaza project at the August 11 meeting of the Crozet Community Advisory Committee describing the “eight years it took to get here” and the path ahead.

“I’m happy to report we had a meeting with the county today and the revised 60% plans are going in to VDOT [Virginia Department of Transportation] next week” said Stoner. “Almost all of the design issues have been resolved so the expectation is that the review time will be relatively short. Then VDOT will release the county for the right of way acquisition and utility relocation phases.” The plaza project involves two separate but integrated construction efforts—the system of roads surrounding the future plaza on the former Barnes Lumber property and the plaza buildings and outdoor spaces themselves. The former must come first.

As he reminisced Stoner thanked Ann Mallek and the county Board of Supervisors for their significant support and funding over the long haul. “This all started with a public engagement session in early 2017 or so and since then we have gone through countless meetings with VDOT the county the utility providers and others” he said. “We have literally had a fight at every turn with VDOT over the width of the road over the intersections over the radius of the corners on the intersections over the size of the roundabouts you name it.”

Stoner’s development company Crozet New Town Associates (CNTA) entered into a public-private partnership with the county in 2019 in which the board agreed to provide $3.2 million in cash contributions and future loan forgiveness to finance the plaza project. CNTA has committed to contribute $2 million and to provide discounted rights of way for the roads project which will be matched by a $2.3 million VDOT grant.

Stoner came back to the board in April of this year to ask for another $2.5 million due to increased construction costs and he requested relief again this summer to cover utility expenses. “We lost about six months earlier this year because we got an initial estimate from Dominion Energy to move 900 feet of overhead power line for about $1.2 million” he said. “Together with the county we managed to whittle that number down to hopefully fit within the updated budget.” The board stepped in both times to rescue the project by agreeing to fund the shortfalls.

During his CCAC presentation Stoner displayed aerial graphic designs of the plaza proposal. “There will be a promenade about 20-22 feet wide [between the commercial buildings and the grassy open areas]. “The schema shows a set of moveable benches which capitalize on the railroad theme. They can slide along the rails and could be moved at times and then we’ll have a lighted promenade with outdoor dining and retail store fronts [opening onto] the plaza.

“[The design envisions] market stalls and an art gallery that that would front along the promenade going up to the plaza and then a series of spaces on the ground level that would be retail and small restaurants” he continued. “These spaces can be combined if necessary if a business needs more than the minimum square footage. As you move up we’ll have office space on the second level and then the Crozet performing and art space. On the third floor are more performing arts and additional space that could be residential but I think it’s probably more likely that it’ll end up being offices. We welcome feedback on both the planning and the architecture.”

Q&A

Virtual attendees at the CCAC meeting asked a variety of questions about the plans. CCAC Chair Joe Fore wondered if the road network construction would be going on at the same time as renovations in The Square which involve parking spaces and sidewalks. “Ideally it’ll all be done at the same time” said Stoner. “The timing for submittal [of the site plans to VDOT] looks like it’s going to work out such that the two projects will go within a week of each other which is great.”

Fore also asked about the northbound egress of a roundabout depicted on the planned road connecting The Square eastward to Hilltop Street. “The idea is to put that roundabout in a location that could potentially connect to an underpass under the railroad over to Rt. 240” said Stoner. “We had done some research years ago to figure out what the feasibility [of a crossing] was when we met with the railroad and they surprisingly were very supportive. They were not supportive of an at-grade intersection closer to town but they were very supportive of an underpass. Obviously that is kind of a secondary priority at this point but that’s the intent.”

St. George Avenue resident Clover Carroll asked what kinds of businesses the developer envisions for the mixed-use commercial building in the plaza and whether there has been a commitment for a hotel. “We’re actually going to look at the commercial mixed-use building in a little more detail after we’re finished with the plaza so at that point I can talk about the types of uses we envision in that building” said Stoner.

“With regard to a hotel we do have a commitment from one hotel developer and we have interest from another hotel developer. Two different concepts that I think could complement each other very well—one is a very small boutique-y concept and the other is more of a self-service kind of hotel concept more of a condo-type hotel.”

Other questions concerned the destiny of the existing bike shop (it will hopefully remain downtown in the new space or nearby) parking (there will be a couple of lots to the north and east of the plaza) green energy (they are considering solar panels on the rooftops) and permeable pavement (VDOT rejected the idea due to high maintenance cost and a compromise will be a combination of pavers and asphalt).

Parkside Village resident Sandy Hausman asked “How much does our population need to grow to support the additional stores restaurants hotel and art center? How many more people need to live in Crozet before planners would confirm there are enough people to make these ventures a go?”

“[Our] consultants felt that Crozet could definitely support the amount of additional development that we’re proposing” said Stoner. “Having said that I think it’s really important to point out that the success of downtown will ultimately depend on the Crozet residents. This plaza which I think will be spectacular will be a natural attraction. But as I have said to my team over and over again it doesn’t matter how nice it is if it’s not programmed effectively it’s not going to be successful. And so I think the community’s role is so important in making sure that this space is vibrant and active.”

Board of Supervisors representative Ann Mallek added support for Crozet’s natural appeal. “I was just going to remind people that Crozet is the mecca for people from southern Batesville to Sugar Hollow and all the way to Free Union. When the planning was being done for the library there was a 35-square-mile area that was considered the draw for that place. And I’m hopeful that that same geography will matter for this as well.”

In response to questions about project timing Stoner said they are targeting construction for both The Square and the VDOT road extension for the summer of 2023. “I’d love to say it’ll be May” he said “but the reality is it could be June July or August if everything goes well. Road construction will take six or seven months before we can even start the plaza or any buildings. Building construction is probably six months behind that and phase one [of the plaza] is probably a three- to four-year construction project.”

In reflecting on the long road to get to this point Stoner was sanguine. “You know in some respects maybe it’s a blessing” he said. “If all of this had gone well [from the beginning] we probably would have been opening this commercial building right when the pandemic hit. So sometimes things work out for the best.”",,,

Job losses,"Today’s job report came in better than anticipated with 315000 jobs created. We did have negative revisions of 107000 to the prior two reports combined and the unemployment rate rose to 3.7%. So what does this mean for the labor market and the larger economy?

The job market is still pushing along fine as the need for labor continues in America. Job openings in America are still over 11 million and the jobless claims data has stabilized in recent weeks. Let’s take a look at the American labor market.



From BLS:





Below are the areas where the report says jobs were created and the construction job growth data is encouraging to see. Even though the builders are going to stop producing new single-family homes that aren’t already under contracted they need to have the labor to finish the homes that have been started on or under contract and not started on yet. Also we must be mindful that multifamily construction has been good this year with rental demand still solid.





Here is a breakdown of the unemployment rate and educational attainment for those 25 years and older:

—Less than a high school diploma: 6.2%.

—High school graduate and no college: 4.2%

—Some college or associate degree: 2.9%

—Bachelor’s degree and higher: 1.9%







The unemployment rate did increase for those that don’t have a bachelor’s degree or higher. The labor force growth also rose in this report. When people talk about the unemployment rates rising in a positive jobs report it tends to mean the labor force growth of people looking has also increased as we have seen today.

If the unemployment rate gets below 3% I tend to see that as negative as the labor force growth isn’t very strong. People get fired and hired each month. This is why neither jobless claims nor the unemployment rate can ever really be zero.



For the rest of this century If productivity stays weak and our labor force growth slows even more the need for labor will be transparent in parts of the country that lack younger people.

For me it’s always simple: economics is demographics and productivity and the rest is stamp collecting. Housing economics is demographics and affordability. But for jobs we are short of labor in certain parts of the U.S. with an older population pool that is leaving the workforce. Those immigrants and robots that were supposed to take all the jobs haven’t panned out. Job openings are over 11.2 million and much higher than what we had at the end of the great financial recession which was a tad over 2 million.





Health of the economy?

My sixth recession red flag model was fully raised on the same day as the last jobs report. My model is not designed to be late or raised when we are in a recession: it is created as a progression model to show you the history of economic cycles and when and when not to worry about a recession.

For example I never had the six recession red flags up in the previous economic expansion from 2010 until COVID-19 hit  which was the longest economic and job expansion in history. The economic data was getting better in late 2019 and in February of 2020 housing broke out.

However the shock of COVID-9 was way too much to prevent a brief recession. I had to create a recovery model based on a pandemic; that was crazy and then some. However the America is Back recovery model worked well in 2020 and I retired it on Dec. 9 2020.

So now that all the recession red flags are raised what am I looking for? The next stage is to see total consumption demand be hit so negatively that it sends job openings down and jobless claims higher. Then we can call this a U.S. job loss recession following the pattern of recessions we have had post-World War II.

Why is housing in a recession but not the economy yet? Recessions are very simple to understand. These things tend to fall during a recession and we are already seeing them fall in housing just not in the economy.



– Sales

– Production

– Jobs

– Income



Recently on CNBC I said that I agree with others who say housing is in a recession. I have to — I raised my fifth recession red flag for housing in June of this year.

How does consumption get hit harder? Well interest rates on credit cards home equity lines and mortgage rates are much higher than before 2022. With higher interest rates and higher inflation data this is a test for the United States consumers who haven’t been tested this century because the inflation growth rate had been low before 2021.

I will keep tracking more and more on consumption data and jobless claims data at this stage and will no longer be focusing on those six recession red flags. The last flag raised was that the leading economic index fell for the fifth month in a row. The first month was minor I need to see four to six months of decline to raise it which I did last month.











Overall the labor market is running well. Jobless claims under 300000 using a four-week moving average still show that we don’t have any real stress in the labor market yet.





Traditionally this data line breaks hard to the upside when we are in an actual recession as companies are forced to fire people to ensure they’re in line with their business goals. We aren’t there yet but now is the time to be mindful of it. The last time my six recession red flags were up was late in 2006 and the job loss recession didn’t happen until 2008 so we can have some time until the consumer breaks.

History is not on our side once all six recession red flags are up. – Logan Mohtashami

The Federal Reserve is using the labor market as cover for their aggressive rate hike language which I still believe it’s mostly jawboning. Some are saying that they won’t even cut rates during a recession if inflation is high; remember these people talk a lot to try to communicate to markets. I am telling you this because the Federal Reserve members were very upset that mortgage rates fell and stocks rose. So they decided to have a united front when talking to the media that they’re serious about raising rates and keeping them higher until inflation falls.

One final note: How can we prevent a recession? History is not on our side once all six recession red flags are up. However due to the crazy data that this COVID-19 recovery had given us with the wild bullwhip effect of data I have come up with one plausible theory.

With that in mind here are the two ways we can avoid this recession:

1. Rates fall to get the housing sector back in line.

2. Growth rate of inflation falls and the Fed stops hiking rates and reverses course as it did in 2018.

Can this happen? We have a backdrop that says it can. If the Russian Invasion finds a peaceful resolution and China doesn’t invade Taiwan then some of the X variable factors are removed with supply distribution. For now we take the data one day at a time because we want to be the detective not the troll.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc2hlZC5jb20vOTkxNDA0L3R3aXR0ZXItaXMtaW4tc2hhbWJsZXMtb3Zlci1kb21pbm9zLXB1bXBraW4tc3BpY2UtZmFrZS1vdXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Twitter Is In Shambles Over Domino's Pumpkin Spice Fake-Out,"Twitter Is In Shambles Over Domino's Pumpkin Spice Fake-Out

September may have only just begun but pumpkin spice season is already in full swing. What started with Starbucks' pumpkin spice latte the unofficial VIP of the season has slowly spiraled into a full-fledged fall phenomenon. From Swiss Miss hot chocolate and Oreos to Land O' Lakes butter and LesserEvil popcorn brands across the country are proving that there's no food that can't be pumpkin spiced (via People).

In theory it's possible for every consumable to be transformed into a pumpkin-spiced variety. But let's face it certain combinations just don't make sense and our taste buds would probably concur. For instance Spam hummus hot sauce and water have no business being pumpkin spiced (via Alot). Oh and let's not forget about the autumn-flavored salmon that took fall too far — that's also a no-go.

Another food that may confuse some taste buds? Pumpkin-spiced pizza. While it's only a matter of time before pumpkin-spiced pizzas begin popping up around the country we know of at least one chain that has no plans to debut this flavored pizza. Domino's revealed its disdain for the pumpkin-spiced trend in a tweet that sent Twitter into fits of laughter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpaGVyYWxkLmNvbS9zdG9yaWVzL3RlZW4tc3RhYmJlZC1sYXN0LW5pZ2h0LWluLWJlbGxtb3JlLDE0MzYzMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Teen stabbed last night in Bellmore,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: 403 for url: https://www.liherald.com/stories/teen-stabbed-last-night-in-bellmore,143630 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpaGVyYWxkLmNvbS9zdG9yaWVzL3RlZW4tc3RhYmJlZC1sYXN0LW5pZ2h0LWluLWJlbGxtb3JlLDE0MzYzMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

(Credit: George A. Faella)

For almost half of the players on the Riverhead roster this was their introduction to high school varsity field hockey. Girls meet Ward Melville.

Yes that Ward Melville.

Mighty Ward Melville.

The Ward Melville that reached the Suffolk County Class A final last year. The Ward Melville that is seeded second this year in Suffolk Division I. The Ward Melville that is one of the best teams in the county.

Under just about any circumstances that would be a rough way to christen a season. But taking things a few steps further consider where Riverhead is.

Cheryl Walsh-Edwards said this is the youngest and least experienced of the Riverhead teams she has coached in her 23 years in charge. The Blue Waves seeded 14th among Division I’s 22 teams return only one starter Charlotte Dow from the 2021 team that went 6-8 and barely missed making the playoffs.

Dow is one of only three seniors Vanessa Leon and Ashley Monticciolo being the others. Aside from Dow the only other players with any varsity experience before this year are Kerry Stavracos Morgan Stromski Isabella Vene and Leon. Three players — Emma Kennedy Kyleigh Lennon and Abigail Maaiki — have made the Herculean leap from middle school field hockey straight to the varsity.

And if all that isn’t enough this is the smallest roster Walsh-Edwards has ever had: 15 players.

So enter Ward Melville into the equation Friday at Pulaski Sports Complex and do the math. It added up to a 6-0 Ward Melville win. For a start-of-the-season test this was the field hockey version of an advanced algebra pop quiz on the first day of school.

With only one scrimmage against Southampton behind them the Blue Waves took the field against Ward Melville. “I was shaking” said Lennon.

Walsh-Edwards in a pregame interview said her players were “very excited but again you know it’s like I’ve never had a team where the bulk of them have never played in a varsity game so I don’t think they quite know what to expect.”

She added “You can’t even compare JV to varsity. The speed of the game is just totally different.”

Ward Melville boxed Riverhead in its own half of the field for virtually the entire first quarter. It took only 3 minutes 53 seconds before Alexa Kidd scored the first of her three goals off a scramble with the goalie Stavracos on the ground. Kyra Gianelli (assisted by Grace Mulham) and Peyton Phillips followed with goals to give the girls in green a 3-0 lead through 15 minutes.

Riverhead showed improvement in the second quarter but still conceded goals by Kidd and Julia Rotoli in the final 23.5 seconds of the quarter for a 5-0 score by halftime.

In a show of sportsmanship Ward Melville coach Shannon Sioss had her team ease off and not press the attack in the second half. Kidd scored her third goal off a pass from Phillips with 20 seconds left.

Ward Melville took 20 shots (Stavracos saved 11 of them) and earned 20 penalty corners while holding Riverhead without a shot or a penalty corner.

“Well I knew it was gonna be a tough game but I think the main focus of the game was to improve” said Dow.

As one of the players making the huge jump from middle school to varsity Lennon said: “There’s a big difference like the game was much faster. There’s a lot more running. It’s a lot more but I think we played good considering they’re one of the better teams.”

Riverhead has a true asset in Dow. An all-division forward last year Dow has been moved to center midfield where her high work rate is being put to use. “It’s a lot more running” she said.

Walsh-Edwards spelled out what she is looking for from her young players. “To me it’s just going out and working really hard and not giving up you know regardless of what the score is” she said. “That’s the most important thing to me build the character a little bit and you got to play until the end of the game you know and some games you are gonna win and some you’re not.”

All things considered Dow said “I think for our first game of the season it was exceptional and we definitely have a good season ahead of us a lot to improve upon and I can’t wait to see us at the end [of the season] and how good we become.”"

The action came after a handful of residents spoke against the rezoning during the public hearing.

Builder D.R. Horton made the request to rezone just over 30 acres of land on Mountain Crest Road from suburban residential to semi-urban residential. The change would allow for smaller plots of land for a potential subdivision according to the planning department.

One resident at the meeting said they’d like to see plans for the development so he could know whether or not he supported it.

Council and staff explained that there is a process and it begins with rezoning during which time developers are not expected or required to lay out a plan for what’s to be built. The reason is because plans can change and Council is charged with deciding the best overall zoning for the land prior to any next steps.

While developers are not expected to show schematics or a breakdown of what they have in mind for properties Edwin Suddreth project manager with W.K. Dickson came to the podium first to speak in broad strokes about the project.

Suddreth said the neighborhood which is located about a mile from I-85 and in the shadow of Crowders Mountain would be named Mountaincrest and while it may not follow the city’s current comprehensive land use plan it provides something needed in Kings Mountain.

“The comp plan really speaks to the need for housing” he said.

An added perk for future residents in the subdivision would be city sewer service something most homes in the area do not have he said. To accomplish that D.R. Horton would install the pump station that potentially could be tapped into by neighbors.

Several neighbors to the property said they were concerned about traffic.

Suddreth said that close proximity to I-85 would be a benefit and if the rezoning was approved they would be required to do a traffic study.

The developer started the project last year and anticipated having it complete by March 2025.

After more than an hour of discussion and comments from the public Councilman Jay Rhodes made motion against the rezoning and Councilwoman Annie Thombs seconded it. A few remarks followed including Thombs expressing her and the city's focus on what type of housing is best for Kings Mountain.

“We are very concerned about the density. Housing is a concern for our area. It can be a great economic growth for our area... but also we painstakingly looked at our comprehensive plan and land use plan” said Thombs. “We invite developers to come but we would ask that you would look at our comprehensive land use plan and look at what we want our community to look like.”

Available housing in the vicinity of Intel Corp.’s future development south of Johnstown and northeast of New Albany is scarce and demand is already growing three years before Intel’s manufacturing facility is expected to be operational.

Some local real estate agents say they are fielding calls from current Intel employees and investors from California Oregon and Arizona who are seeking homes right now.

“It’s crazy we’ve never had this before” says Jane Kessler Lennox of New Albany Realty. “There are a lot of people out there who saw what happened in Silicon Valley and know what kind of investment Intel is putting into Columbus.”

Intel has said it will invest at least $20 billion in its facility which will churn out computer chips. Some of the company’s employees and outside-of-Ohio real estate investors are not waiting around.

“People are looking to buy homes now and rent them out because they know in a few years it will be more difficult to find houses” Kessler Lennox says. “Investors are looking for places to put their money and real estate is more secure than stock market options currently.”

Homes in Central Ohio which is considered the fifth hottest real estate market in the nation by Norada Real Estate Investments are already tough to find.

While most developers are reluctant to share details of projects in the area the Pulte Group has a 200-lot site in Johnstown and D.R. Horton is proposing a 302-home subdivision just outside of Heath which is about 25 miles east of New Albany.

Finding available land around the Intel site that can be supported by needed infrastructure for new homes is also going to be a challenge says Sue Van Woerkom president of the Columbus Board of Realtors and an agent with Corcoran Global Living. And the property around the site is expensive.

“Land is a premium out there and I’ve heard some is going for $55000 per acre” she says. “And just because you own acres it doesn’t mean it can be developed. There’s a lot to look into.”

Some of that infrastructure includes the need for road access and the availability of water and sewer lines electricity and phone service.

Intel reportedly paid $148000 per acre for its Central Ohio land. Beside home development the Intel factories will attract other companies to the area but they will face the same issues says Scott Hrabcak an agent with HER Commercial Real Estate.

“Infrastructure is going to drive a lot of the development out there” he says. “At the end of the day it will be interesting to see how we handle the housing stock because a lot of companies will be making announcements in the coming weeks about coming here.”

On Friday Dr. Jazz Atwal announced that some Manitobans — including anyone 65 and older and Indigenous people 18 and older — will be among the first in the province eligible for an updated vaccine from Moderna that targets both the original strain of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and its Omicron variant.

When asked to describe the current spread of COVID-19 in the community Atwal said the focus should be on severe outcomes from the illness rather than the number of active infections.

He drew a comparison to common colds to make his point.

""Before COVID … colds went around. Most people did well. Some people still ended up in hospital back then. That was a severe outcome"" he said at a Friday news conference.

""There's such a focus on infection right now occurring but it's OK to get infected"" said Atwal. ""You're building your natural immunity so that's good.""

Dr. Jazz Atwal deputy chief provincial public health officer announced the initial eligibility for the new bivalent vaccine from Moderna on Friday. He also cautioned against focusing too much on the number of COVID-19 infections in the province saying 'it's OK to get infected.' (Jeff Stapleton/CBC)

Manitoba is not seeing the level of severe outcomes from COVID-19 cases caused by the Omicron variant compared to earlier variants according to Atwal — in part because vaccine uptake in the province has been good.

Focusing on how many people have an active infection in Manitoba rather than severe outcomes ""does not help the situation at all"" he said.

But Dr. Jillian Horton a hospital-based specialist in internal medicine in Winnipeg says there's a risk that comes when health leaders minimize COVID-19 infections.

""The problem I have with framing it that way is it doesn't really give people the full picture"" she said in an interview with CBC News on Saturday.

The province has encouraged COVID-19 vaccination she notes and ""certainly reassurance where appropriate is an important part of communicating with the public.""

But she said ""the bigger picture is it would be much better if you hadn't gotten that infection in the first place.""

A Winnipeg epidemiologist said while getting infected with COVID-19 could bring some immunity it's still best to avoid getting infected at all.

Responding in an interview Friday to the province's recommendation that people wait to get booster shots until the bivalent vaccine becomes available Cynthia Carr the founder of EPI Research in Winnipeg noted that ""the vast majority of us have probably been infected with Omicron at the very least"" which leads to some level of immunity.

""That is not at all a recommendation to become infected — but it is a fact particularly if you've had … at least two or three vaccines with that you have hybrid immunity"" she said.

'Infections do matter': Stanford researcher

Horton said she takes some hope from a well-vaccinated population in Manitoba and more vaccine developments likely on the horizon.

But infections are certain to increase once kids head back to class she said and indoor masking and improving the quality of indoor air should continue to be a top priority heading into the fall.

She fears Atwal's comment may minimize the risk of COVID-19 infection which is not ""helpful to people as they try to navigate what personal decisions are right for them especially knowing that we have really abandoned broad-scale public health strategies to try to mitigate the spread of COVID.""

The comments could have a negative effect on people's behaviour she said.

""So then you have people who previously were concerned … maybe they walk away from that and say 'Well why would I upgrade my ventilation at my own personal expense at my business or my place of work if it's fine? Why would my kid keep masking indoors if it's fine?'""

Dr. Abraar Karan an infectious disease doctor and medical researcher at Stanford University also took issue with Atwal's comments in an exchange with Horton on Twitter.

Infections do matter. Full costs of repeat infections unclear but sig morbidity risk for vulnerable hosts is there; best to have humility re unknowns esp in public comms. Comparisons to common colds also not too helpful. Investing in public infrastructure for clean air is key —@AbraarKaran

""Infections do matter"" he tweeted in a reply to Horton.

There are still significant risks from the illness for vulnerable people according to Karan and it is ""best to have humility"" regarding the unknowns surrounding COVID-19 especially in public communications.

""Comparisons to common colds [are] also not too helpful"" Karan tweeted. ""Investing in public infrastructure for clean air is key."""

DTE has projected power should be restored for 95% of its customers by the end of the day Friday company spokesperson Dana Blankenship said.

The Detroit-based electric company met its goal yesterday for restoring power to 80% of the original 260000 customers who were without power after Monday's storm Blankenship said.

Many of the remaining outages are at houses or businesses that require individual attention she said. Livingston County and northern Wayne County have the most customers still without power.

On Tuesday DTE said the storm knocked over more than 3000 power lines. The downed lines pose a threat to anyone who comes too close to them. Downed lines killed a 14-year-old girl in Monroe and seriously injured an 8-year-old boy in Warren.

More than 1000 external line workers from surrounding states like Ohio Illinois Missouri and Pennsylvania partnered with local crews to get power up and running again in the state.

“Detroit is also vulnerable to extreme summer weather because it may result in infrastructure

failure whether from heat induced or thunderstorm induced power outages” the city’s hazard plan document states.

The power has been out all week for many Detroiters. The National Weather Service described Monday’s storm as a squall line that raced across southern Michigan creating widespread wind damage in its path. Gusts of 60 to 75 mph were responsible for damage to trees power lines and property and left over 375000 customers without power across the state.

Detroiters can seek a $25 credit from DTE if they have experienced an extended power outage or repeated blackouts over a 12-month period. Learn more about eligibility and how to apply on DTE’s website.

Detroit’s Health Department issued a list of tips to stay healthy during extreme heat. Important things to keep in mind include drinking plenty of water; never leaving children seniors or pets alone in closed vehicles; checking on relatives and neighbors; reducing outdoor activities and eating regular meals.

Signs of heat exhaustion and heat stroke include confusion; hot dry flushed skin; cool and clammy skin; lightheadedness; headache; dizziness and nausea.

For more information contact the Detroit Health Department at (313) 876-4000.

Detroiters also are being urged to report fallen trees through an online tool or the Improve Detroit mobile app. Residents are asked to report trees that have fallen on city property by calling (313) 628-0900.

Downed power lines are extremely dangerous and should be reported to an emergency line maintained by DTE Energy at (800) 477-4747. Detroiters should also call 911 to report downed lines so public safety officers can secure the area surrounding a down line until DTE crews arrive.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVwLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzL3BvbGl0aWNzLzIwMjIvMDkvMDIvd2hpdG1lci1kaXhvbi1jYW1wYWlnbi1maW5hbmNlcy1taWNoaWdhbi1nb3Zlcm5vci1lbGVjdGlvbi82NTQ2ODQ4OTAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New filings show financial mismatch continues in Whitmer-Dixon race,"LANSING − Tudor Dixon continues to badly trail Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in campaign fundraising after winning a five-candidate GOP primary Aug. 2 showing that major Republican donors have not quickly united behind her.

The campaign finance reports Dixon and Whitmer filed Thursday cover only about a one-month time period from July 18 through Aug. 22. But the 20 days immediately after the primary were potentially crucial in showing whether GOP financial power brokers were eager to rally around Dixon a Norton Shores businesswoman and former conservative TV commentator.

Dixon didn't even get a check from the Michigan Republican Party records show.

Whitmer raised nearly $2.4 million during the latest period bringing her total fundraising for the election cycle to $31.6 million. She spent just under $3.1 million most of it on TV ads bringing her total spending to $15.8 million. She has $14 million still in the bank records show.

Dixon raised only $686000 bringing her total fundraising to close to $2.4 million. She spent about $700000 leaving her with about $524000 in the bank. Whitmer has nearly 27 times as much.

""It's become clear that the GOP which went from establishment heavy at the top of the ticket in 2018 to outsider activist heavy this year will depend on third party spending or a red wave"" said John Sellek a Lansing-based political and communications consultant.

The amount Dixon has raised from political action committees is far short of what the 2018 Republican nominee former Attorney General Bill Schuette had taken in at the same point during that campaign after his primary win over former Lt. Gov. Brian Calley and two other candidates.

By this stage of the 2018 campaign Schuette had already received 168 donations of $250 or more totaling nearly $786000 from political action committees candidate committees and state and county political parties records show.

Dixon by contrast has received only 11 such donations of $250 or greater totaling $31300. Her extreme stance on abortion favoring no exceptions for rape or incest is seen as hurting her in the general election. But the PAC connected with Right to Life of Michigan which endorsed her exclusively in the primary has only given her $100 records show.

At this point in the campaign Schuette had received donations of $10000 or more from PACs representing the Michigan Realtors Association the Michigan Chamber of Commerce the Auto Dealers of Michigan the Michigan Restaurant Association the Michigan Beer and Wine Wholesalers Association the Miller Canfield law firm Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan DTE Energy the Michigan Bankers Association the Health Care Association of Michigan and the Michigan Petroleum Association among others records show.

By comparison Dixon has received only one PAC check of $10000 from the Capitol Affairs PAC. Of the PACs listed above that had given to Schuette at this point in the campaign only the Michigan Petroleum Association has so far donated to Dixon and that was a $1000 check. Dixon has also received a $7150 PAC check from Associated Builders and Contractors a $7150 check from The Presidential Coalition and a $2000 check from the Michigan Infrastructure and Transportation Association's PAC

Schuette had also received just over $354000 in state matching public funds at this stage in the campaign.

In addition to the public financing he received in 2018 Schuette had raised close to $6 million in private funds at this point in the campaign. But his campaign fund had a balance similar to Dixon's -- about $546000.

Dixon never applied for public matching funds for the primary even though she could have been eligible because she did not exceed the $2 million spending cap.

""We didn't need matching funds from the taxpayers"" and ""our fund-raising strategy isn't at all reliant on developing PAC support"" said James Blair Dixon's chief strategist.

""We are exactly where we need to be.""

Blair said the Michigan Republican Party is sending Dixon a check and is ""a great partner and very supportive.""

Party spokesman Gus Portela confirmed a check to Dixon's campaign is pending. ""It won't be any different from last time"" he said. ""They will get the funds needed from the state party.""

Schuette's gubernatorial campaign received a $100000 check from the Michigan Republican Party soon after the 2018 primary on Aug. 13 records show.

Whitmer's campaign spending could potentially exceed the $35 million that west Michigan billionaire Dick DeVos spent on his unsuccessful 2006 Republican campaign against then-Gov. Jennifer Granholm. A major difference aside from the effects of inflation over the last 16 years is that the money DeVos spent came from his own personal fortune.

Though most of Whitmer's donations continue to come from inside Michigan and most of those from small donors her high national profile and fundraising in other states continue to generate donations from the rich and famous or near-famous around the U.S.

Whitmer's latest report included a $7150 donation from Steve Ballmer the former CEO of Microsoft; and two $7150 donations from filmmaker Lawrence Kasdan co-writer of the Star Wars films and his wife Meg. The report was later amended to show that the Ballmer donation came from Steve Ballmer's wife Connie not from him.

Earlier donors to Whitmer's campaign include Hollywood filmmaker Steven Spielberg Walmart heir James Walton in Arkansas and former congresswoman and former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala in Florida.

A July Free Press analysis found that during the first half of 2022 just over $4 of every $10 Whitmer collected in donations of $100 or more came from outside Michigan. That was up from about $2.40 out of every $10 she collected in donations of that size during her first three years in office.

This comes on the heels of a proposed rate hike by DTE the Detroit-based energy company supplying power to the Southeast Michigan area.

DTE has requested the authority from the Michigan Public Services Commission — the state agency that regulates Michigan utility companies — to hike up electricity rates by 8.8% for customers of the private utility company. The purported reason for the rate increase is “to recover the costs associated with significant investments in distribution generation and customer service.” This could not be further from the truth. While DTE reaped over $2 billion in profits in 2021 routine power outages affect hundreds of thousands of people any time a storm rolls through the area.

The power outage map on DTE’s website shows how DTE’s business operations hit the most exploited workers in the Detroit area the hardest. The decades-old energy infrastructure has well-known problems that are left unaddressed for many residents because it is not profitable to do so.

In accordance with Michigan law DTE has offered a paltry $25 credit to customers suffering from power outages. The Michigan Public Services Commission informed residents that they can request the credit under three extremely stringent conditions: an outage of more than 120 hours under “catastrophic conditions” an outage of more than 16 hours under non-catastrophic conditions or eight or more outages within a 12-month period. This response is not enough to compensate people for the harm they endure during power outages such as inoperable refrigerators and freezers causing food to spoil or critical medical equipment unable to function without power.

There have been calls to bring DTE and other privately-owned utility companies under public control like other cities have across the country. The capitalists have resisted this notion and even lesser demands for decades by spending millions on lobbying efforts to bribe public officials to resist any reform.

Jason Tschantre a resident of the Northend neighborhood of Detroit told Liberation News how the outages affected his family and neighbors. “My entire block was out from Monday night until Thursday afternoon. I lost a fridge and a basement freezer full of food and all my neighbors lost food too. This happens to us at least once a year” Tschantre said. “We have two kids and two full-time working parents so it’s stressful to try and manage without electricity. It turned our life upside-down.”

ST. PETERSBURG Fla. – Rising fuel prices are driving up costs to provide service to Duke Energy Florida customers in January 2023.

“We understand our customers continue facing increased financial demands in all parts of their lives” said Melissa Seixas Duke Energy Florida state president. “We’re connecting customers to available assistance and providing energy-saving tools and programs to help manage their bills and lessen the impact. Please reach out to us. We’re here to help.”

The company works diligently to reduce costs while ensuring safe reliable cleaner energy 24/7 to meet our customers’ growing needs. Through cost management and careful planning Duke Energy Florida has made thoughtful investments to significantly enhance service reliability and reduce emissions while lowering rates for our customers. Our goal is to provide the best possible price for our customers.

Duke Energy Florida does not profit from these increased fuel costs and the company proactively takes measures to insulate customers from volatility. Through past efforts such as 2021’s Rate Mitigation Plan Duke Energy Florida sought to lessen the impact to customers from the fuel price increases. These costs are market-driven and passed through to customers with no markup.

Since the beginning of the year natural gas prices have more than doubled driven by increased domestic demand flat natural gas production strong LNG exports to Europe and Asia and low natural gas storage inventories. The natural gas market has not stabilized and continues to be extremely volatile.

Today’s filing is the result of unprecedented fuel cost increases. Due to the historic rise in the cost of fuel the company is projecting higher fuel costs in 2023 and is under-recovered in 2022. Under-recovery means the actual cost of fuel is higher than the cost customers are paying.

Under these extraordinary circumstances at this time Duke Energy Florida proposes to delay filing for the 2022 under-recovered fuel costs in the 2023 rates in the event the market will stabilize as the year progresses. The company will continue to monitor the market and its impact to determine the appropriate time to file the under-recovered fuel costs.

Beginning January 2023 a typical residential customer monthly bill using 1000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) will see an approximate 13% increase. This rate change includes the projected fuel prices for 2023 but excludes the under-recovered fuel costs from 2022.

Duke Energy Florida will continue to look for creative solutions to provide relief and focus our efforts to deliver the best possible service for our customers.

“Having an innovation center tends to drive the culture forward in a meaningful way.”

“Although it feels like there's no competition in the regulated utilities there are disruptors out there who would love to become closer to our customers than we are.”

“We say don't fall in love with the solution. Fall in love with the problem. That's a motto of ours. And then empathy for whoever is going to be using your software at the end of the day is paramount.”

It’s called the Carolina Long Bay wind energy area.

It covers 110091 acres of ocean roughly 15 miles offshore from Brunswick County. The entire area sits roughly straight out from the North Carolina-South Carolina border.

And it appears North Carolina’s largest electric utility and a French oil company won the auction on Wednesday May 11 to lease a pair of sites wind energy production.

The Department of the Interior says TotalEnergies Renewables USA LLC bid $160 million to win the right to build an offshore wind farm in the westernmost 54937 acre section of the area. Duke Energy Renewables Wind LLC won the bid for the easternmost 55124 acre area with a $155 million bid.

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management says the area together if developed could generate 1.3 gigawatts or more of energy enough to power nearly 500000 homes.

“Investments from the two developers mean increased supply chain investment and recruitment workforce development and thousands of good-paying jobs and infrastructure development that will support other North Carolina industries"" said Katharine Kollins President of the Southeastern Wind Coalition in a statement.

Federal officials called the auction a significant step towards the Biden-Harris administration’s goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030.

“The Biden-Harris administration is moving forward at the pace and scale required to help achieve the President’s goals to make offshore wind energy a reality for the United States” said Interior Secretary Deb Haaland in the announcement of the sale. “Today’s sale is further proof that there is a strong industry interest and that America’s clean energy transition is here.”

North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper has set targets of 2.8 gigawatts of wind energy generated off of the NC coast by 2030 and 8 gigawatts by 2040.

If developed the newest proposed offshore wind farm would not be visible from shore.

Duke Energy officials estimate it will take about 10 years to develop the site. A site assessment plan looking at how Duke will evaluate the wind energy potential of the area will be developed during the next year.

TotalEnergies the French energy company that won the other lease reports it is considering developing floating wind energy platforms. The firm is building similar offshore wind farms in France the United Kingdom and in South Korea.

TotalEnergies is also building an offshore wind project off of the New York-New Jersey coast.

The nonprofit legal group Earthjustice filed the federal lawsuit on Aug. 25 in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs in the case are Statewide Organizing for Community eMpowerment in Tennessee the Indiana State Conference and LaPorte County Branch of the NAACP Hoosier Environmental Council in Indiana Clean Power Lake County in Illinois the Sierra Club and the Environmental Integrity Project.

""Power plant records reveal that about half of the toxic coal ash waste in the U.S. is entirely exempt from any federal health protections"" said plaintiffs' attorney Mychal Ozeta with Earthjustice. ""This is outrageous. The coal power industry is poisoning drinking water sources and the air we breathe while causing global warming.""

Coal ash is the waste left after burning coal for power and contains toxic substances including arsenic lead mercury and radium. The EPA has acknowledged that the risks to humans associated with coal ash exposure include cancers neurological and psychiatric problems cardiovascular damage and anemia.

The EPA regulated coal ash in 2015 following public outcry over the massive 2008 coal ash spill from a Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) power plant near Kingston Tennessee. But when Earthjustice studied databases it found in EPA archives it discovered that the agency exempted from regulation 292 coal ash landfills at 161 plants in 38 states including 12 of the 13 Southern states.* The group says its count of inactive landfills is likely an underestimation but it's also possible that its interpretation of industry data may have resulted in an overcount at particular facilities.

EPA excluded from its oversight those coal ash dumps that stopped receiving new waste before the regulation when into effect as well as those at power plants that had already stopped producing electricity. Earthjustice says the exempted landfills are located disproportionately in low-income communities and communities of color.

But just because a coal ash landfill isn't taking new waste doesn't mean what's in it isn't contaminating the environment. Earthjustice and the Environmental Integrity Project studied industry data and found groundwater contamination exceeding federal health-based standards at 76% of regulated coal ash landfills which tend to be newer and are more likely to have protective liners than the older inactive landfills that EPA exempted from its rule. That means the inactive coal ash dumps are even more likely to be releasing toxic contaminants to groundwater.

""EPA's blanket exemption of inactive [coal combustion residual] landfills allows hundreds of dangerous and leaking toxic dumps to escape critical safeguards including monitoring inspection closure cleanup and reporting requirements"" the lawsuit states. ""Data reveal that the toxic heavy metals leaking from inactive CCR landfills located throughout the U.S. pose an unabated and significant threat to human health and the environment.

'Please protect us'

A third of the nation's unregulated coal ash dumps are in the South. Earthjustice tallied a total of 97 unregulated coal ash dumps at 57 power plant sites across the region. Texas has the most with 27 unregulated dumps at 11 sites followed by West Virginia with 13 dumps at seven sites. Click here for a map and complete list.

These are among the coal ash dumps that the EPA has exempted from regulation:

TVA's Kingston plant in Tennessee  where a 2008 impoundment failure sent over 1 billion gallons of coal ash into the Clinch and Emory rivers has one unregulated landfill. In addition cleanup workers are now in court fighting contractor Jacobs Engineering for damages saying they have been sickened — and some of their colleagues killed — by their exposure to the spilled ash.

Duke Energy's Belews Creek Steam Station in Stokes County North Carolina has one inactive coal ash landfill exempted from federal regulation according to Earthjustice. Residents of the nearby community of Belews Creek have long reported what seem to be unusual patterns of cancer around the plant that they suspect are connected to the facility's pollution.

On Aug. 1 121 national regional and grassroots public interest groups and tribal communities from 30 states the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico wrote a letter to EPA Administrator Regan asking him to immediately take action to close the loopholes in the coal ash rule. Regan formerly served as the top environmental regulator in North Carolina where a 2014 spill from a coal ash landfill at a Duke Energy plant near the city of Eden contaminated the Dan River. Regan was not a state regulator at the time but worked for the Environmental Defense Fund focusing on clean energy. Duke Energy later pleaded guilty to criminal negligence for its handling of coal ash at the plant and paid a $6 million fine.

The lawsuit notes that the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act the federal law that governs the disposal of hazardous waste commands the EPA to review each regulation set forth under the statute — which includes the coal ash regulation — at least once every three years. The EPA has not yet carried out that process for the coal ash rule so the plaintiffs are asking the court to compel the agency to do so ""with an expeditious deadline.""

""I've seen friends poisoned by cleaning up the Kingston coal ash spill suffer and die and felt the grief of their friends and families"" said Todd Waterman of Tennessee's Statewide Organizing for Community eMpowerment. ""The Bull Run coal plant's fly ash contaminates the lovely reservoir that supplies the drinking water to my house and much of Knoxville. Once in our bodies these chemicals can cause permanent damage. Please protect us and our children now not when it's too late.""

The most recently-announced project in D.C.…

More real estate developers are buying office buildings and converting them to residential use. The most recently-announced project in D.C. is the upcoming conversion of two high-profile but older buildings on Connecticut Avenue north of Dupont Circle.

Philadelphia-based Post Brothers a real estate firm that specializes in residential conversions has made its first entry into the D.C. market paying more than $200 million for Universal North and Universal South at 1825 and 1875 Connecticut Ave. It acquired the buildings from longtime owner JBG Smith.

The 1960s-era buildings have a combined total of almost 700000 square feet. The buildings sit on close to 2 1/2 acres.

Post Brothers will begin the redevelopment in about a year and will convert the buildings into hundreds of luxury apartments some of which will be affordable housing units.

But that is not as easy as it might sound. An office-to-residential conversion is generally a complete gut job.

“When we think about a conversion we think about the only elements of the real estate that we’re buying that has continuing value for the purpose of the property or its next use are of course the land and the concrete and steel structure and that’s it” said Matthew Pestronk co-founder of Post Brothers.

Office building infrastructure is not designed for residential conversion either. For example insufficient electrical and plumbing infrastructure.

“You’re going to have 600 bathrooms with 600 hairdryers. Not 60 bathrooms. So you also need to bring in additional domestic water capacity refuse all of those things” Pestronk said.

Post Brothers has had its eye on the D.C. market for several years and said the opportunity to pursue residential conversions in the District is not because of waning demand for office space.

“It is not getting weaker. We’re not in the office building business but if we were I would say the market for new office buildings which is what people want is extremely strong. We noticed that older office buildings were having a hard time being leased a decade ago and we believed there would be an opportunity to buy this real estate and convert it to another purpose” Pestronk said.

The Universal Buildings conversion will retain ground floor retail.

“Keep trying. Don’t go in with the idea you’re going to win” said Billy Joe Heath an 80-year-old showman for Spring Valley Farm.

Heath’s showing career started 70 years ago with pigs. He began showing dairy cattle when he was 16.

He now shows Jersey cattle for Spring Valley Farm located in Westminster Maryland which is owned by his wife’s two brothers. His son is also a part of the farm.

Heath grew up in a rural area and helped on the surrounding farms though he is the son of a carpenter not a farmer. He was also involved in 4-H.

After high school he began working full time on farms. Once he got married he worked on his wife’s family’s farm and started his own livestock photography business Heath Photography which led to him traveling much of the East Coast.

Though his career has not been as long as Heath’s Cooper Kerrick offered similar words of advice for other showman.

“Push yourself to try harder” the 13-year-old FFA member said. He also stressed that you’re not always going to win.

Cooper is the fourth generation on Kenava Farms in Delaware from which he has been showing a variety of dairy cattle since he was 5. He showed Brown Swiss at the Maryland State Fair.

Jenna Morris also stressed that showmen need to put in the work. She bought two Jersey show cattle and has been working with one of them Indie for two years. She focuses on making sure Indie is comfortable walking on the halter.

Morris lives on Morris Family Farm which is a beef cattle operation in Fawn Grove Pennsylvania. She is also a member of 4-H.

Aaron Eaton shows Jersey cows for Glamourview Farms in Walkersville Maryland and his own buying and selling company Eaton Holsteins. Unlike many of the other showman Eaton 38 didn’t get his start in 4-H but he has been showing his whole life. Now he shows for the marketing that it provides.

When not in the show ring Eaton is always prepping for shows working with the cows managing their nutrition trimming their hooves and washing them every day.

Despite his different youth he still offers similar words that ring through the showman at the Maryland State Fair — “Just be humble and take it all in stride.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3VyYW50LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzAyL2RlYWwtcmVhY2hlZC10by1wcmVzZXJ2ZS1mb3JtZXItY29ubmVjdGljdXQtYm95LXNjb3V0LWRlZXItbGFrZS1jYW1wLXRoYXQtd2FzLXRhcmdldGVkLWZvci1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deal reached to preserve former Connecticut Boy Scout Deer Lake camp that was targeted for development,The Biden-Netanyahu relationship is strained like never before.

Authorities in Michigan are investigating how a missing voting machine from the state wound up for sale on eBay last month for $1200.

The machine was purchased by a cybersecurity expert in Connecticut who alerted Michigan authorities and is now waiting for law enforcement to pick up the device. CNN determined the machine was dropped off at a Goodwill store in Northern Michigan before being sold last month on eBay by a man in Ohio.

In an interview with CNN the Ohio man said he purchased the machine online at Goodwill for $7.99 before auctioning it on eBay for $1200.

Election machines are part of the United States’ critical infrastructure and are supposed to be kept under lock and key. It’s an issue that has become increasingly important in recent years as people have sought to gain unauthorized access to election systems in a futile attempt to prove the false notion that the 2020 election was stolen.

News of the sold machine comes as authorities in Michigan Colorado and Georgia are probing apparent efforts to gain unauthorized access to voting machines or obtain data from them following the 2020 election.

Michigan’s Democratic attorney general has called for a special prosecutor to investigate her Republican challenger Matthew DePerno after finding evidence that allegedly links him to a plot to tamper with voting machines used in the 2020 election. DePerno has denied the allegations.

A bargain at the Goodwill

Ean Hutchison a 35-year-old Uber driver in Miamisburg Ohio has an eye for technology and a stellar record as a seller on eBay. He trawls the web looking for deals on computer parts like motherboards and graphic cards and then re-sells them for a profit on eBay often to similarly technically inclined people who are building or upgrading their own computers.

“I have a knack for finding hidden gems really cheap and turning a quick profit” Hutchison said and often finds those gems in online thrift stores and Goodwill.

It was on a recent trawl of a Goodwill website in Michigan that Hutchison said he came across one of those gems.

“AVALUE TECHNOLOGY Touch Panel SID-15V-Z37-B1R” was all the ad read. The pictures accompanying the ad showed a large monitor possibly a touch screen with what looked like a slot for a keycard or credit card. A hand-written sticker on the base of the monitor read “Colfax.” Goodwill was selling it for $7.99.

To the uninitiated it would be hard to know what this product was. A monitor that maybe could plug into a computer perhaps. But why the slot for a card?

Hutchison knew what he was looking at.

It was a piece of election hardware that he reasoned given where it was listed had been used in Michigan’s elections.

“I wasn’t even aware that they were supposed to be sold let alone donated to Goodwill” Hutchison told CNN.

“The sale of voting machines and related equipment is prohibited under eBay’s government items policy” an eBay spokesperson told CNN. “We will cooperate with law enforcement in their investigation.”

“Own a piece of history!”

The machine – a ballot-marking device – arrived in the mail and Hutchison later posted it on eBay. He set the eBay auction bidding to start at $250 but gave potential buyers the option of skipping the auction if they paid $1200 upfront.

“Own a piece of history!” Hutchison’s eBay listing read. “This voting machine was one of thousands used in the 2020 United States presidential election and included in one of the many lawsuits against Dominion that were thrown out.”

Dominion Voting Systems was the subject of baseless claims after the 2020 election that its voting machines were hacked as part of a plot to throw the election in favor of President Joe Biden. Dominion is currently engaged in a billion-dollar defamation suit against a handful of defendants including Fox News who amplified baseless claims its machines were hacked in the 2020 election.

Seven hundred miles away in his apartment in Connecticut Harri Hursti saw the ad.

Hursti is regarded as one of the foremost election machine security experts and organizes an event every August in Las Vegas where hackers are given access to voting machines in a bid to identify and remedy potential vulnerabilities. As a result Hursti has become essentially a voting machine collector – but the machines he can normally buy are old and retired.

This ad was unusual Hursti said because it claimed to sell a device that he thought still might be in use in Michigan.

Hursti bought the machine outright for $1200. After it was delivered to his home last week he contacted the Michigan secretary of state’s office which oversees elections in the state. He says he was instructed not to open the box the machine came in to preserve it for law enforcement who may need to wipe it for fingerprints.

A few days later an official from the secretary of state’s office emailed Hursti. “Thank you again for bringing this to our attention” the email read. “We have determined this device originated in one of our jurisdictions. The jurisdiction has now reported the device to law enforcement as stolen.”

It’s unclear how the voting machine ultimately ended up at Goodwill. It was delivered to Goodwill Northern Michigan’s e-commerce division from a Goodwill location in Cadillac Michigan a Goodwill spokesperson told CNN. Goodwill said in a statement that its team members process thousands of donations a week in Northern Michigan and that they are cooperating with authorities on the investigation of the device.

The clerk for Wexford County which covers Cadillac and includes a town called Colfax like the label on the machine in question told CNN Thursday she was searching for answers.

“I am just as concerned if not more so” said Clerk Alaina Nyman when asked about security concerns expressed by state officials.

The clerk of Colfax Township Becky Stoddard declined to comment on the device specifically citing an ongoing police investigation though she said she keeps elections equipment locked up and added that she does not believe conspiracy theories about Dominion voting machines.

“I’ve never had any trouble with anything” said Stoddard who said she has served as clerk for 22 years.

Security and conspiracy theories

In some states voting machines might only be in use a couple of days a year or every other year. But their secure storage is crucial to ensuring integrity in America’s elections. This can be a challenge given the decentralized nature of voting systems in this country.

In Michigan for instance there are more than 1500 different voting jurisdictions across 83 counties each with its own clerk who is responsible for the security of its voting machines according to the secretary of state’s office.

Jocelyn Benson Michigan’s secretary of state told CNN in an interview in Detroit on Thursday that voters should rest assured that the state’s elections are secure.

She said her team contacted law enforcement as soon as they learned about the machine on eBay and she also pointed out that there are multiple checks of machines both before and after Election Day to ensure accurate results.

That’s a point that was echoed by Hursti who tries to find vulnerabilities in election systems for a living.

He told CNN that while the appearance of a Michigan voting machine on eBay raises concerns about how machines are stored the real threat is what election conspiracy theorists could do.

Over the past two years people trying to prove the false claim the 2020 election was stolen have sought or gained unauthorized access to election systems.

Michigan State Police have been investigating a series of voting machine breaches that occurred last year in multiple counties in the state.

“What you really have is individuals who don’t seem to understand the technicalities of the elections process or election security trying to gain access to machines to keep the misinformation alive” Benson said.

As for the machine that showed up at the Goodwill how it got there is a mystery police are trying to solve – as of Thursday evening Hursti still had this piece of critical infrastructure in his home waiting for someone to pick it up.

You might think you're a video game enthusiast but you've got nothing on Kaori30. This noted member of the game collecting community has decided to unload his impressive collection of game consoles on eBay but the price tag is out of reach for most of us. Kaori30 is looking for almost a million dollars -- €984000 to be exact. For this lofty sum you get roughly 2400 different game consoles comprising what may be the single largest collection in the world.

According to the translated listing from French eBay Kaori30 began collecting game consoles in the 1990s but he tried to get out of the hobby around 2000 by selling off the collection. Still he continued to pick up the odd piece of hardware here and there before stopping due to time constraints in 2011. Then came a fateful visit to Tokyo in 2018 that rekindled his need to have all the consoles in the world. Since then Kaori30 has assembled a truly amazing collection including most of the items he sold off 20 years ago.

Even if you don't have a million dollars sitting around to buy the collection (Opens in a new window)  exploring the photos is fascinating. This collection features all the names you know like the NES Xbox Game Boy and PlayStation along with more obscure devices like the NEC TurboGrafx handheld the Atari Jaguar CD and the Watara Supervision. There's even a Nokia Ngage a pre-smartphone mobile device with a gamepad and emulator support. Success is not a requirement to be included as evidenced by the presence of the Ouya microconsole . The thoroughness of the collection is genuinely impressive.

The collection doesn't just feature one copy of each console -- in the interest of completeness Kaori30 has sought out every

variation

of the hardware. For example the collection includes the NES Action Set with the light gun that was so popular in the early 90s but he also has the European Super Set that came with a controller hub. Not rare enough? How about the original Japanese NES that shipped with a robot? Or maybe you want to get your hands on one of the handful of Nintendo-licensed Famicom clones from Sharp. Kaori30 has those too.

On the more modern side Kaori30 has almost every color variation and special editions of consoles like the N64 Xbox 360 and Game Boy -- Nintendo really pumped out special editions of the DS so there's a whole wall of those in the pics.

Kaori30 believes some of the items in his collection are basically impossible to find for sale elsewhere. He suggests a museum might be interested in displaying the collection but only if there's one with a million dollars to spend and shipping is probably going to be spendy as well. Naturally Kaori30 does not accept returns.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vbmVyZGlzdC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9ldmVyeS12aWRlby1nYW1lLWNvbnNvbGUtZXZlci1tYWRlLWViYXktMS1taWxsaW9uLWRvbGxhcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Every Video Game Console Ever Made Selling on eBay for $1 Million,"Video games as we know them have only been around for half a century give or take. But in that time we’ve seen a metric ton of game consoles released to the public. And there is one person out there who actually managed to buy nearly all of them. We’re talking over 24000 different machines. And now via DesignTaxi we’ve learned that after accumulating such an incredible collection the owner has decided to sell the whole thing on eBay for a considerable sum of $1 million dollars. You can see a photo from the eBay listing of just a portion of this jaw-dropping collection right here:

kariaure

This is all happening thanks to a French collector going by the handle K ariaure. And according to their eBay listing they’ve had quite an intense journey with their console collecting. This hobby all began in the early’90s. As the 2000s rolled in they sold it all. Sometime later they picked up the hobby anew and then in 2011 they stopped again. Finally in 2018 while on a trip visiting Japan the itch came back even stronger. And they bought every game they once sold off. And thus the collection grew to its current size containing just about every console known to humankind.

If they do manage to sell it all we think they’d have a hard time ever coming close to amassing such a collection again. And really where does one even store such a thing? We really can’t blame them for selling it off. For some avid gamer out there though this is going to be too good an opportunity to resist. If you’re a wealthy video game historian with a disposable income and you want this truly legendary collection from Kaori30 you can head over to eBay to check out its listing. The current “Buy It Now” price is set at €984000 EUR a.k.a a million bucks American."

Artists Aren't Happy. (Published 2022),"This year the Colorado State Fair’s annual art competition gave out prizes in all the usual categories: painting quilting sculpture.

But one entrant Jason M. Allen of Pueblo West Colo. didn’t make his entry with a brush or a lump of clay. He created it with Midjourney an artificial intelligence program that turns lines of text into hyper-realistic graphics.

Mr. Allen’s work “Théâtre D’opéra Spatial” took home the blue ribbon in the fair’s contest for emerging digital artists — making it one of the first A.I.-generated pieces to win such a prize and setting off a fierce backlash from artists who accused him of essentially cheating.

Reached by phone on Wednesday Mr. Allen defended his work. He said that he had made clear that his work — which was submitted under the name “Jason M. Allen via Midjourney” — was created using A.I. and that he hadn’t deceived anyone about its origins.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjIvMDkvMDIvbWlkam91cm5leS1hcnRpZmljaWFsLWludGVsbGlnZW5jZS1zdGF0ZS1mYWlyLWNvbG9yYWRvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,He used AI to win a fine-arts competition. Was it cheating?,"When Jason Allen submitted his “Théâtre D’opéra Spatial” into the Colorado State Fair’s fine arts competition last week the sumptuous print was an immediate hit beating 20 other artists in the “digitally manipulated photography” category to win the first-place blue ribbon and a $300 prize.

What Allen had only hinted at however was that the artwork had been created in large part by an artificial-intelligence tool Midjourney that can generate realistic images at a user’s command. The portrait of three figures dressed in flowing robes staring out to a bright beyond was so finely detailed the judges couldn’t tell.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3RvcC5jb20vYXJ0cy8yMDIyLzA5L2FpLXdvbi1hbi1hcnQtY29udGVzdC1hbmQtYXJ0aXN0cy1hcmUtZnVyaW91cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AI won an art contest and artists are furious,"Jason M. Allen was almost too nervous to enter his first art competition. Now his award-winning image is sparking controversy about whether art can be generated by a computer and what exactly it means to be an artist.

Jason M. Allen was almost too nervous to enter his first art competition. Now his award-winning image is sparking controversy about whether art can be generated by a computer and what exactly it means to be an artist.

In August Allen a game designer who lives in Pueblo West Colorado won first place in the emerging artist division’s “digital arts/digitally-manipulated photography” category at the Colorado State Fair Fine Arts Competition. His winning image titled “Théâtre D’opéra Spatial” (French for “Space Opera Theater”) was made with Midjourney — an artificial intelligence system that can produce detailed images when fed written prompts. A $300 prize accompanied his win.

“I’m fascinated by this imagery. I love it. And it think everyone should see it” Allen 39 told CNN Business in an interview on Friday.

Allen’s winning image looks like a bright surreal cross between a Renaissance and steampunk painting. It’s one of three such images he entered in the competition. In total 11 people entered 18 pieces of art in the same category in the emerging artist division.

The definition for the category in which Allen competed states that digital art refers to works that use “digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process.” Allen stated that Midjourney was used to create his image when he entered the contest he said.

Midjourney is one of a growing number of such AI image generators — others include Google Research’s Imagen and OpenAI’s DALL-E 2. Anyone can use Midjourney via Discord while DALL-E 2 requires an invitation and Imagen has not been opened up to users outside Google.

The newness of these tools how they’re used to produce images and in some cases the gatekeeping for access to some of the most powerful ones has led to debates about whether they can truly make art or assist humans in making art.

This came into sharp focus for Allen not long after his win. Allen had posted excitedly about his win on Midjourney’s Discord server on August 25 along with pictures of his three entries; it went viral on Twitter days later with many artists angered by Allen’s win because of his use of AI to create the image as a story by Vice’s Motherboard reported earlier this week.

“This sucks for the exact same reason we don’t let robots participate in the Olympics” one Twitter user wrote.

“This is the literal definition of ‘pressed a few buttons to make a digital art piece’” another Tweeted. “AI artwork is the ‘banana taped to the wall’ of the digital world now.”

Yet while Allen didn’t use a paintbrush to create his winning piece there was plenty of work involved he said.

“It’s not like you’re just smashing words together and winning competitions” he said.

You can feed a phrase like “an oil painting of an angry strawberry” to Midjourney and receive several images from the AI system within seconds but Allen’s process wasn’t that simple. To get the final three images he entered in the competition he said took more than 80 hours.

First he said he played around with phrasing that led Midjourney to generate images of women in frilly dresses and space helmets — he was trying to mash up Victorian-style costuming with space themes he said. Over time with many slight tweaks to his written prompt (such as to adjust lighting and color harmony) he created 900 iterations of what led to his final three images. He cleaned up those three images in Photoshop such as by giving one of the female figures in his winning image a head with wavy dark hair after Midjourney had rendered her headless. Then he ran the images through another software program called Gigapixel AI that can improve resolution and had the images printed on canvas at a local print shop.

Allen is glad the debate over whether AI can be used to make art is capturing so much attention.

“Rather than hating on the technology or the people behind it we need to recognize that it’s a powerful tool and use it for good so we can all move forward rather than sulking about it” Allen said.

Cal Duran an artist and art teacher who was one of the judges for the competition said that while Allen’s piece included a mention of Midjourney he didn’t realize that it was generated by AI when judging it. Still he sticks by his decision to award it first place in its category he said calling it a “beautiful piece”.

“I think there’s a lot involved in this piece and I think the AI technology may give more opportunities to people who may not find themselves artists in the conventional way” he said.

Allen won’t yet say what the text prompt was behind his winning image — he’s planning to keep it a secret until he publishes a larger related work that he hopes will be finished later this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vZ2FkZ2V0LmNvLnphL2JhdHRsZWZpZWxkLTIwNDItZGVidXRzLW1hc3Rlci1vZi1hcm1zL9IBQmh0dHBzOi8vZ2FkZ2V0LmNvLnphL2JhdHRsZWZpZWxkLTIwNDItZGVidXRzLW1hc3Rlci1vZi1hcm1zLz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Battlefield 2042 debuts Master of Arms,"With Master of Arms the latest season of the Battlefield 2042 sub-franchise the Electronic Arts and Battlefield teams have delivered a new wave of content.

The grant will help the University launch a week-long residential summer camp with the aim of expanding already existing educational programming for Hoosier youth who might not yet realize the benefits of higher education or don’t see a place for themselves within higher education.

The initiative is designed to help Indiana colleges and universities to engage youth ages 5 to 18 in high-quality on-campus enrichment programs that can help young people envision a future for themselves in college.

For one week in the summer students in grades eight through ten will stay on the University’s campus where they will receive programming geared toward career exploration showing the possibilities that higher ed can bring in five key industry areas: healthcare STEM education business and the arts & humanities. A corporate partner for each pillar will present relevant career information and students will visit campus locations corresponding with UIndy majors related to the careers. In some cases students may take field trips to employer partner locations for tours when appropriate. Each student will also participate in a number of career exploration and college readiness activities.

“We welcome any opportunity to bring Hoosier youth to our campus” said University of Indianapolis Interim President Phil Terry. “As we all aim to increase the higher education attainment rate within the state it is critically important to reach our young people and demonstrate both the value of higher education as well as remove barriers of entry to those populations who are traditionally underrepresented in the higher ed landscape.”

“We are incredibly grateful to Lilly Endowment for its generous support of these goals both at UIndy and throughout the state” added Terry.

Lilly Endowment launched the initiative in part to respond to the significant decrease in the number of Hoosiers pursuing higher education degrees. In 2015 65 percent of Indiana high school graduates were going straight to college. The college going rate has dropped steadily since. In 2020 only 53 percent of Hoosiers were attending college the year after high school. Goals for the initiative include increasing the number of Indiana youth who obtain valuable postsecondary degrees and credentials and to help schools strengthen how they recruit students especially students who have been traditionally underserved by higher education institutions.

About Lilly Endowment Inc.

Lilly Endowment Inc. is an Indianapolis-basedprivate philanthropic foundation created in 1937 by J.K. Lilly Sr. and sons J.K. Jr. and Eli through gifts of stock in their pharmaceutical business Eli Lilly and Company. While those gifts remain the financial bedrock of the Endowment the Endowment is a separate entity from the company with a distinct governing board staff and location. In keeping with the founders’ wishes the Endowment supports the causes of community development education and religion and maintains a special commitment to its hometown Indianapolis and home state Indiana.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maWVyY2VwaGFybWEuY29tL3BoYXJtYS91c2UtbGlsbHktcmVnZW5lcm9uLWNvdmlkLTE5LWFudGlib2RpZXMtd2lkZXNwcmVhZC1hZnRlci1mZGEtYmFuLXBvdGVudGlhbGx5LWNvc3RpbmctdXMtbW9yZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Use of banned antibodies remained ubiquitous this winter,"Staring down waning efficacy in the face of the coronavirus’s omicron variant the FDA early this year put the kibosh on a pair of monoclonal antibody (mAb) combo therapies from Eli Lilly and Regeneron. Even still the meds' use remained “widespread” in the U.S. this past winter potentially costing the nation tens of millions for treatments that were unlikely to offer much benefit to patients.

Use of Eli Lilly’s bamlanivimab-etesevimab and Regeneron’s casirivimab-imdevimab peaked during the week of Dec. 22 2021 when 91036 total doses were reported according to a new JAMA Network study. While mAb use “gradually declined” after FDA deauthorization and dropped throughout the remainder of the study period—which ran until June 29—Lilly's and Regeneron’s antibody combos continued to be administered after FDA deauthorization on Jan. 24 the study authors note.

Despite the FDA revising Lilly's and Regeneron’s authorizations however hospitals and health systems administered more than 158000 doses of these mAbs in early 2022 the JAMA study contends. Given that Medicare mAb payments range from $450 to $750 per dose spending on these deauthorized treatments likely eclipsed $71 million the study continues.

“Whether deauthorized treatments will be covered by payers and whether the FDA will take regulatory action against entities violating its guidance remains unknown” the study authors continued.

As for why use of Lilly's and Regeneron’s banned antibodies remained so ubiquitous the JAMA study pinned the blame—in part—on conflicting state government guidance and lack of hospital awareness of the deauthorization.

The study authors note that “although the FDA announcements clearly stated that these mAbs were no longer authorized for use” it didn’t fully revoke the meds’ emergency nods “because of the possibility that future COVID-19 variants could retain susceptibility.” This could have in turn led to “misinterpretation” by healthcare professionals.

Overall there was “wide variability in mAb administration by state” the study found. New York and Florida for instance were the biggest users accounting for 20% and 24% of mAb administration for the period respectively. Wisconsin and Arizona were next in line but handed out less that half of New York's total whiles states like Vermont and New Hampshire logged no prescriptions.

Looking at the variability in a different way by assessing use as a percentage of each state's remaining supply 15 states administered up to 10% of their supply while 11 states doled out more than 50% of their leftover antibody stocks.

JAMA ran its study from Oct. 27 2021 to June 29 2022 collecting data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and state hospitals. All U.S. hospitals and health systems must report the number of therapeutic mAb courses administered in the prior week as well as the amount currently on hand the study authors explained.

All is not lost for Lilly on the COVID-19 front meanwhile. Lilly nabbed authorization for its omicron-busting antibody bebtelovimab back in February and it recently laid plans to deploy the drug on the commercial market.

Regeneron for its part recently axed a clutch of trials weighing its antibody combo dubbed REGEN-COV across a range of patients and clinical stages. The company terminated the trials which ranged from early to late stage because of “[e]merging SARS-CoV-2 variants impacting susceptibility to study drug” recent updates on ClinicalTrials.gov state.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndmeWkub3JnL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvbm90LWV2ZXJ5b25lLXdoby1uZWVkcy1pbnN1bGluLXdpbGwtYmUtaGVscGVkLWJ5LXRoZS1pbmZsYXRpb24tcmVkdWN0aW9uLWFjdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Not everyone who needs insulin will be helped by the Inflation Reduction Act,"Molly King of Covington Indiana has Type 1 diabetes and takes two forms of insulin to help control her blood sugar. She pays more than $1000 a month for her medication.

Molly King was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when she was 18. Her body can’t create insulin so she’s spent every day since navigating her insulin regimen.

Not all diabetics take insulin but for those who do the medicine is the difference between life and death. Insulin helps control blood sugar and without it people with diabetes can suffer serious medical problems including blindness comas or even death .

“Anytime I eat food of any kind I have to inject myself with insulin” said King 30 a special education teacher who lives in Covington a city in western Indiana.

King takes two forms of insulin to help control her blood sugar: one long-acting form she takes twice a day and the short-acting form for when she eats. The types of insulin she takes hasn’t changed over the years but the price of the medication has.

From 2010 to now the price of her monthly insulin has skyrocketed from around $300 to over $1000 a month. The financial burden became so much that she had to move back in with her parents just to afford her medication.

King’s story isn’t unique. The price of insulin has more than tripled in the past two decades ; A one-month supply of Eli Lilly’s Humalog has jumped from $21 in 1996 to about $275 in 2019.

That’s why King and many others had some hope when Inflation Reduction Act talks began.

The $750 billion economic package that was signed into law Aug. 16 creates a $35 insulin co-pay cap for people on Medicare starting in 2023. Biden touted the package as a big win for Americans but many who rely on insulin were disappointed by the final product.

About 37 million Americans – or 1 in 10 people – have diabetes.

“This bill helps a minority of people it does not help the majority of people with insulin needs” King said.

Some lawmakers rejected the Inflation Reduction Act

The initial version of the Inflation Reduction Act called for a similar $35 co-pay cap for people also on private insurance. That would’ve been huge for King.

But most Senate Republicans voted against the cap  including Indiana’s.

Both Sens. Todd Young and Mike Braun declined interview requests for this story but a spokesperson for Braun said in an email that the senator voted against the cap because it violated Senate budget rules.

“Had that vote passed it would have overruled the Senate parliamentarian and expanded the scope of the budget reconciliation process to allow for price controls on private companies” the spokesperson said.

The spokesperson said Braun would continue pushing his bipartisan bill to help expand access to low-cost generic forms of medicines and stop pharmaceutical companies from stifling competition through “parking.”

One of the ways brand-name pharmaceutical companies maintain control of the market is by agreeing to not sue a generic drug company if it agrees to delay production of the generic drug.

Shaina Kasper policy manager for T1International a nonprofit that advocates for affordable insulin access said “parking” has become a major issue for all drugs but particularly insulin affordability – especially considering three companies produce 90 percent of the global supply of insulin: Sanofi Novo Nordisk and Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly.

“They have this captive market so they can charge whatever they want and rake in extraordinary profits” Kasper said.

The companies have said their prices are due to the complicated medical landscape in the U.S. and people generally don’t have to pay the full list price.

In an emailed statement an Eli Lilly spokesperson said the company was in favor of the private $35 co-pay cap that failed in the Senate. They also said anyone can buy their monthly prescription of insulin for no more than $35 through its discount programs .

“Our solutions have helped lower the average monthly out-of-pocket cost for Lilly insulin to $21.80 a 44 percent decline over the past five years” the spokesperson said.

Co-pay caps help some but leave others out

Advocates for insulin cost control say a co-pay cap for private insurance would be another step in the right direction.

But even that is still far from what Kasper’s group is calling for: a true cap on insulin prices.

While an expanded co-pay cap would help uninsured people – who often need the most financial assistance – would still be left to pay full prices she said.

“One out of four patients with diabetes has rationed insulin due to cost ” Kasper said. “And we think that number is probably even an undercount because a lot of folks don’t recognize that what they’re doing is rationing.”

King the schoolteacher knows the dangers of rationing insulin: Years back she experienced diabetic ketoacidosis after she tried to make her medicine last and ended up in the hospital for a week.

“I was completely unconscious” she said. “I don’t remember like six days of my life.”

And while discount programs such as Lilly’s are available not everyone is able to access all of their benefits.

Hena Shah  a nurse practitioner with IU Health Southern Indiana Physicians who works with diabetes patients said she has seen patients get insulin from other countries at a cheaper price.

“If you are not already established with a primary care provider or if you’re not already seeing a diabetes specialist elsewhere [discount programs are] difficult to access because most people can’t navigate those resources on their own” Shah said.

If patients struggle to access affordable insulin Shah said she works with them to navigate patient assistance programs online or use resources like GoodRx.com to figure out where they can get the medication with the lowest out-of-pocket cost.

King isn’t on a Lilly brand of insulin and she’s exhausted the discount options available to her. So she’ll continue paying $1000 a month for her medication.

She’s happy to see Congress take some action on insulin prices but said it’s a long way from making a difference for people in her situation.

“[We’re] being majorly penalized by our health care system because our bodies don’t make insulin” King said. “We’re being charged this astronomical price simply for an organ not working.”

The American Diabetes Association says it plans to continue advocating for relief this fall including capping monthly insulin costs for more patients.

An announcement from the District Attorney's office on Thursday September 1 2022 outlined the charges and investigation.

Shot Spotter Notification July 5th City of Newburgh

The City of Newburgh Police Department received a Shot Spotter notification indicating shots were fired in the area of Farrington Street on July 5th 2022 which prompted a police investigation.

DA Hoolver indicated in a report released on September 1st that during the investigation regarding the gunshots a resident of a nearby building had found a backpack with a gun inside. Once the backpack was recovered by police a loaded .45 caliber handgun was found.

Further investigation by City of Newburgh Detectives led police to surveillance video in the area that showed two people entering the building without a backpack. The two were later identified as 23-year-old Deon Patterson and 22-year-old Deandre Peacock. Police identified Patterson as the party exiting the building wearing the backpack which was then placed under a box.

Additional video footage shows the other suspect Peacock handing a second firearm to Patterson who then disposed of the weapon into a nearby garbage can. Police were able to recover the gun that was put in the garbage can a loaded .38 caliber revolver.

Raytheon and Northrop Grumman each received contracts for Phase 2 of the Fast Event-based Neuromorphic Camera and Electronics (FENCE) programme with $16.27 million and $8.71 million awards respectively.

DARPA expects each company to complete the work by June 2024.

In July 2021 DARPA selected Raytheon Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems to lead teams on Phase 1 of FENCE.

The US defence R&D agency hopes the end result will be an event-based IR focal plane array plus a new class of digital signal processing and learning algorithms to handle dynamic scenes.

But now the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye is its newest and most technologically advanced version yet. It includes various features and enhancements such as a radio suite integrated satellite communications and the AN/APY-9 radar capable of detecting fighter-sized stealth aircraft.

Other features include a mission computer flight management system a glass cockpit enhanced T56-1-427A engines and aerial refueling.

Game Changer for the Navy

According to the aircraft's manufacturer the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye is a ""game changer"" in how the Navy operates its battle management command and control.

This improved aircraft is essential to advancing any mission because it acts as the ""digital quarterback"" to oversee the mission sweep ahead of the strike and keep net-centric carrier battle groups safe according to Northrop Grumman.

""The E-2D gives the warfighter expanded battlespace awareness especially in the area of information operations delivering battle management theater air and missile defense and multiple sensor fusion capabilities in an airborne system"" the company added.

According to estimates Northrop Grumman produced a total of 51 of those aircraft between June 2013 and January 2022 under several contracts.

The company delivered the AA-53 successfully on January 21 2022 the 51st US Navy E-2D Advanced Hawkeye production aircraft.

Two-Generation Leap

Furthermore the Advanced Hawkeye will provide combined forces and first responders with vital usable data thanks to a two-generation leap in radar sensor capability and a strong network-enabled capability.

The time between initial awareness and active combat is also shortened thanks to these developments since they give warfighters the situational awareness they need according to Northrop Grumman.

Earlier contracts for the delivery of the aircraft included a $113.7 million deal for five E-2D Advanced Hawkeye aircraft for full-rate production Lot 2 for June 2013 a $617 million deal for five E-2Ds until full-rate production Lot 1 in August 2013 and a $3.6 billion deal for 25 more E-2D in August 2014.

The maiden flight of an E-2D equipped with aerial refueling in December 2016 marked a significant advancement in the aircraft's development doubling the aircraft's time on station to five hours and lengthening mission duration from four to seven hours.

However the 46th aircraft was the first to have this refueling modification which added $2 million to each aircraft's cost. Later the Navy planned to spend $6 million per plane to retrofit the function on all older Hawkeyes.

And elegant. So much so that I'm sort of in shock.

Norwegian Cruise Line has been promising to take things up a notch with its new ship Norwegian Prima — to ""elevate"" the experience as compared to earlier Norwegian vessels as its executives have been saying. But in typical journalist fashion I've been skeptical.

After five days on board Norwegian Prima in advance of its first sailing with paying passengers I am skeptical no more.

The 3100-passenger ship is loaded with stylish upscale bars and restaurants. Its cabins are sleek and modern. Its suite complex is next-level.

It has an array of onboard entertainment and amusements that is as impressive as ever too.

In short it's like nothing you've seen before in the Norwegian fleet. And I say this as someone who has sailed on every one of the 18 ships operated by Norwegian except two (Norwegian Sun and Norwegian Spirit).

That isn't to say Norwegian Prima is perfect. There are a few things about its design that leave me scratching my head — things that maybe the line can change before it moves ahead with the rollout of five sister ships that already are on order.

But mostly they are quibbles. The bottom line is that Norwegian Prima takes Norwegian cruising to new heights. If you're a fan of the line this is the new ship you can't wait to book.

Here are my first impressions of Norwegian Prima after getting a sneak peek at it this week in advance of its first official sailing on Saturday.

Norwegian Prima has an elegant look

From the moment you step on board Norwegian Prima you notice the difference from past Norwegian ships. It's an elegant vessel of the sort you find in the fleets of Norwegian's higher-end sister brands Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises — albeit on a bigger scale.

The entryway to the ship deposits you at the three-story-high Penrose Atrium which may be the most beautiful atrium of any big ship at sea. It has a curvy sculptural feel as if the entire space were an art piece.

Studio Dado the design firm behind the Penrose Atrium studied great piazzas around the world such as St. Mark's Square in Venice to come up with its layout and look. The design includes offset entrances from other parts of the ship on each level that — like the narrow streets of Venice opening up into that grand gathering spot — give you the sense of stumbling onto something wonderful when you arrive.

The elegant feel of the Penrose Atrium carries over to the many restaurants bars and entertainment venues that spread out from its three levels (decks 6 7 and 8). You'll find the equally sculptural Onda by Scarpetta a high-end Italian eatery right off its top level and a string of stylish restaurants with new-for-Norwegian themes not far from its midlevel.

The eateries include Nama a new sushi restaurant for Norwegian with a high design that is as sophisticated as the sushi it serves.

Also created by Studio Dado Nama boasts a cream-and-orange color palette and suspended light fixtures subtly inspired by masago (fish eggs) and a reception desk that hints at the marbling pattern found on fish. Among the small touches in the seating area are raised Japanese-style platforms where diners can tuck their shoes underneath before being seated on floor cushions.

Among other nearby outlets with elevated design is Cagney's Steakhouse. The venue pays homage to 20th-century architecture icon Frank Lloyd Wright with patterned concrete walls and other bold modern architectural elements.

Also striking is Norwegian Prima's version of Le Bistro Norwegian's signature French eatery. It's built around three massive crystal chandeliers costing nearly $100000 that hang down all the way to the floor — a showstopper of a design element. Gold-leaf wallpaper lines its booth seating. The overall feel is upscale Parisian apartment.

Notably the public areas that include these restaurants feel more spacious than many of the other 17 ships in the Norwegian fleet. And indeed they are. Norwegian Prima was built with a higher ratio of space to passengers which itself is an upscale touch.

The ship has a higher crew-to-passenger ratio than many Norwegian ships as well.

Both measures are often used as shorthand for the luxury level and service level of a ship.

This more upscale feel is a sharp turn for Norwegian — but perhaps it should come as no surprise. Norwegian Prima is the first Norwegian vessel designed from the keel up since cruise industry veteran Frank Del Rio became CEO of parent company Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. Del Rio who built the upscale Oceania brand from nothing into a major player in the industry in the 2000s is particularly known for his high-end leanings when designing ships.

This big ship feels intimate

The public areas of Norwegian Prima may feel spacious. But the ship itself isn't ridiculously giant in the way that many recent megaships from big-ship lines have been — and it doesn't carry the same sort of massive number of passengers.

Going against the always-go-bigger trend of recent cruise ship building Norwegian has made Norwegian Prima about 14% smaller than its last new ship Norwegian Encore.

It's designed to carry just 3100 passengers at double occupancy. That's 22% fewer people than Norwegian Encore.

The result is that you don't feel like you're sailing with the tourist hordes quite as much as you do on some of the other recent big ships to debut.

This is all relative of course. Three thousand people on a ship is still a lot of people. But consider that rival Royal Caribbean's newest vessel Wonder of the Seas is designed to sail with 5734 passengers at double occupancy. It can hold 6988 passengers with every pull-out sofa and pull-down bunk filled. Wonder of the Seas measures 235600 tons — 62% larger than Norwegian Prima.

By that measure Norwegian Prima is downright small and uncrowded for a big ship with a lot to offer (see more on that below).

If you love big ships with a lot going on but you're squeamish about the idea of sharing it with 6000 or 7000 people Norwegian Prima could be the perfect ship for you.

Prima is packed with activities

Perhaps the greatest design triumph of Norwegian Prima isn't the elevated style of its public spaces. It's that the ship's designers were able to pack so much on the vessel.

Despite its smaller footprint Norwegian Prima has more food outlets not fewer than the last few Norwegian ships. It also has just as robust an array of onboard entertainment including a real Broadway show (the Tony Award-nominated ""Summer: The Donna Summer Musical"") in a stunner of a theater that converts late at night into a dance club. In what is a technological marvel to watch the entire lower deck of seating in the theater slides away to create a giant dance floor.

Norwegian Prima's top deck also still is loaded with family fun zones including the largest go-kart track at sea (yes this is a thing ever since Norwegian began adding them to ships in 2017).

Despite being 14% smaller than Norwegian Encore Norwegian Prima has a go-kart track that is 22% larger than the one on that ship. It spreads over parts of three decks — one more than on earlier ships.

In addition the top of Norwegian Prima has a new-for-the-line open-air games zone called The Stadium with a pickleball court foosball tables pingpong bar-style hand shuffleboard tables and other amusements.

There's also a new electronic darts venue called The Bull's Eye where you rent a space to play with your friend a souped-up miniature golf course a bowl-style waterslide a kiddie splash zone and two giant dry-slide drop attractions where you plunge from the top of the ship to the promenade deck below.

In other words while the interior of the ship has taken an elegant turn for sure this isn't a vessel that's just for couples on an upscale getaway. It's still very much a family-focused ship as Norwegian ships have long been.

My only quibble with all the aforementioned deck-top attractions is that it may be too much. Norwegian has packed so much onto the top of Norwegian Prima that given its smaller size I suspect it'll feel a little cramped once the vessel starts sailing with a full complement of passengers. This is in contrast to the spaciousness of the public areas in the interior of the ship.

One factor contributing to what was a ""Woah there's maybe way too much jammed up here"" feeling upon first seeing the top deck of Norwegian Prima is that as has increasingly been the case with Norwegian ships in recent years large chunks of it are closed off to regular passengers. A not-insignificant part of the top of the vessel is devoted to outdoor lounge areas that are exclusively for use by passengers staying in the ship's Haven suite area. Another portion of the top deck is devoted to the private Vibe Beach Club lounge area. The latter area only is accessible to passengers who pay extra.

One noticeable issue created by the large number of things put up top on the ship is that it's confusing to get around while up there. The deck-top space is broken up into too many sections without a lot of ways to walk between them. To get from the main pool to the entryway to the go-kart track for instance you have to walk through the top-of-the-ship Surfside Cafe buffet. There is no side way around the buffet to reach it.

This in turn requires you to run the gauntlet of Norwegian staff at the buffet entrance wanting you to wash your hands every time you want to move between the pool area and the go-kart area. They think you're there for dining.

Unfortunately I suspect this will create some traffic jams in the buffet once the ship is fully up and running.

The suite complex is the best of any big ship

Speaking of the Haven suite area on Norwegian Prima there's really nothing like it.

Norwegian has been at the forefront of the trend of big-ship operators putting exclusive ""ship within a ship"" suite complexes on their vessels and the line has taken the concept to the next level with Norwegian Prima.

Instead of just covering a couple of decks at the front of the ship the Haven on Norwegian Prima — designed by the celebrated Italian design firm Lissoni — now fills eight floors of the back end of the ship. The added floors mean it has more suites (107) as well as more expansive interior public lounge bar and restaurant areas than previous Haven complexes. The new location also allows for a more elaborate and comfortable outdoor lounge and pool area.

This is another part of the ""elevation"" of Norwegian Prima. For a greater percentage of passengers on this ship than any other big-ship vessel at sea Norwegian Prima can offer a truly upscale experience in a private hidden-away complex.

For cruisers who want the sort of luxury experience that normally only is found on small luxury ships but also access to all the amenities that big ships have to offer this is now the premier offering at sea.

The outdoor lounge area at the Haven includes a stunning infinity pool that appears to flow right off the back of the vessel. Its lounge chairs are plush and upscale. It offers private cabanas.

Inside the complex there's a private restaurant so you never have to eat in the same room with non-Haven passengers.

I didn't get to spend the night in the Haven this week or experience its amenities firsthand so I don't know if its bigger size results in any service issues. Will there be more queues for the Haven's private concierge desk than on other Norwegian ships with smaller Haven complexes for instance? But with roughly 214 guests staying in the complex at any given time assuming two passengers per suite it's still an intimate venue.

If you think of it as a luxury ship plopped down on top of a big mass-market ship it's still smaller and more intimate than most. For comparison Seabourn Venture the new ship that just debuted from luxury line Seabourn is built for 264 passengers.

An unusual new bar promotes 'zero waste'

The Metropolitan bar is billed as the first sustainable bar at sea and it offers a fabulously odd mix of handmade drinks that incorporate leftover food items on the ship such as day-old croissants and banana peels.

I tried three of these cutting-edge cocktails during my strange night out at Norwegian Prima's new Metropolitan Bar and I can attest the drinks taste better than you might first imagine.

Cabins are sleek and modern

It's not just the public areas of Norwegian Prima that are more stylish — its cabins are too.

Also designed by Studio Dado they have a clean-lined minimalist look of the sort you find at sophisticated contemporary hotels on land. The colors are muted with warm light browns and creams punctured with cool blue accents — a sharp departure from the bold color palettes found on many earlier Norwegian cruise ships. Furniture features luxurious stone and light-wood finishes and texture plays a big role.

In standard balcony cabins the wall behind the bed is lined with a striking art piece featuring nature and butterflies — a focal point.

Standard balcony cabins also have spacious and modern bathrooms. You won't feel cramped in them the way you do in entry-level rooms on some big ships. I was impressed.

But as lovely as they are the basic rooms on Norwegian Prima do draw one quibble from me: their lack of adequate storage space.

In their effort to make the rooms as minimalist and spacious feeling as possible the designers seem to have overlooked the real need for lots of hanging space and drawers in cabins on a ship that will likely be operating seven-day sailings for much of its life.

In my basic balcony cabin there was just a relatively small area of built-in closet space. It's enough for me this week as I'm traveling solo. But it would be tight if my wife were here with me and we both had suitcases full of clothes for a week.

The ship has an innovative food hall

Indulge Food Hall is one of the only food halls at sea and it's fabulous — if a little tight spacewise. (In a perfect world Norwegian would make it even bigger on the next ships in this series). It offers a wide range of quick-serve food venues offering everything from Mexican to Indian cuisine.

A noodles bar called Nudls is among the options at Indulge Food Hall. GENE SLOAN/THE POINTS GUY

You can mix and match what you want from any of the venues and order them to your table with a few taps on the tablet that you'll find at every table.

The promenade deck is one of the best at sea

A notable element of Norwegian Prima (and the sister Prima-class ships that will follow) is that it has an unusually wide wraparound promenade that is filled with resort-like outdoor lounge areas.

Dubbed ""Ocean Boulevard"" and located on Deck 8 — much closer to the waterline of the ship than the lounge areas at the vessel's top which are located on decks 17 and 18 — it offers unusually luxurious lounge chairs in some places (think: extra-thick cushions) sunbeds and swinging seats.

On both sides of Ocean Boulevard there are infinity pools as well as shallow dipping pools.

There's also alfresco seating for several of the ship's restaurants including Los Lobos Onda by Scarpetta The Local and Indulge Food Hall.

Norwegian has had promenades on earlier ships that have offered outdoor restaurant seating and additional features. The line has been a pioneer among big-ship lines in taking promenades to a new level by making them wider and adding venues to draw passengers out onto them. But nothing Norwegian has done yet compares to this.

Not only is the Ocean Boulevard on Norwegian Prima roomier than ever but it'll absorb a lot of passengers on sea days who otherwise would be packing the top decks of the ship. From a practical point of view that's a big deal.

Bottom line

Norwegian Cruise Line isn't meant to be a high-end brand but its new Norwegian Prima offers a lot of high-end touches. From the massive Haven suite complex at its back to its stunning sculptural central atrium and the striking designs of many of its eateries the ship is home to an array of venues and experiences that truly are elevated as compared to what you know from previous Norwegian vessels.

[Editor’s note: “Find Bear Market Shelter and Mega Upside With ‘Divergence’ Stocks” was previously published in May 2022. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]

This year has been defined by bear market turmoil.

The reality is that the entire global financial market is built on the back of super low interest rates. If those rates go way higher in 2022 stocks are due for more pain.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News Stock Advice & Trading Tips

But if you think that’s a reason to sell everything let me ask you this. Did you know that a certain group of stocks has a proven history of soaring during market crashes?

It’s true. And we uncovered those stocks thanks to a rare market phenomenon we recently discovered called the “divergence” — a phenomenon that repeatedly appears during bear markets and scores savvy investors huge returns (even if the broader markets keep crashing).

This phenomenon just started to appear recently for the first time since 2008. It’s going to score savvy investors huge returns. And investors who miss this opportunity could get crushed by a bear market.

Here’s what I’m talking about.

Divergence Stocks Soar Even in a Bear Market

As many of you know we’ve been studying this divergence phenomenon for months now.

To recap the divergence is not something you’ve probably ever heard of elsewhere. It’s this ultra-rare phenomenon which occurs only about once a decade wherein certain individual stock prices diverge significantly from their true stock prices as determined by the company’s fundamentals.

The divergences always end with those individual stocks snapping back to their true stock prices resulting in enormous returns for investors who bought during the divergence window.

We’ve made a lot of interesting discoveries about these divergences. They usually revolve around growth stocks. They usually last a few months. And they usually result in 100%-plus gains in less than 12 months.

But one of the most interesting and relevant discoveries we’ve made is that divergence stocks tend to soar even if the broader markets crash.

Take for example the Great Divergence of 2001. At the time internet stocks were undergoing an enormous divergence wherein their stock prices were collapsing yet many of them still had rapidly growing revenues and earnings.

A few stocks that experienced this divergence phenomenon in 2001 were Amazon (AMZN) F5 Networks (FFIV) and eBay (EBAY).

Look what happened to those stocks throughout 2001 and 2002. While the broader market kept reeling during that period — the Dow Jones dropped 16% the S&P 500 dropped 24% and the Nasdaq collapsed 27% — these divergence stocks soared by an average of more than 90%. While folks invested in the market lost more than 20% of their wealth divergence stock investors basically doubled their money!

Story continues

But this isn’t an isolated example.

It is a repeating pattern that proves the bear market protection that divergence stocks provide.

Let’s zoom to the Great Divergence of 2008. At the time all stocks were crashing due to fallout from the Great Financial Crisis. But certain stocks were crashing at the same time their companies were rapidly growing their revenues and earnings. Some examples included Amazon Netflix (NFLX) and Booking (BKNG).

From November 2008 to March 2009 those divergence stocks soared between 56% and 94%. Over that same stretch the Dow Jones dropped 11%.

Yet again we see that market investors lost money while divergence stock investors scored huge returns.

This is the power of the divergence. It is such a powerful market phenomenon that is has the ability to send a small group of divergence stocks significantly higher in a short amount of time even if the market crashes.

From an investment perspective there’s no better value proposition than that.

But divergence stocks aren’t just about scoring huge near-term returns. These stocks have a track record of scoring investors 1200%-plus returns in the long run too.

The Best Buying Opportunity in History?

I’d argue that the divergence market phenomenon offers investors the best buying opportunities in stock market history.

And I’d make that argument because the data would have my back.

Per our analysis there have been three Great Divergences over the past 40 years: 1988 2001 and 2008. Each time they offered investors the chance to buy world-changing companies at blockbuster discounts.

We’re not talking about buying GameStop (GME) or AMC (AMC) and taking on huge risk. We’re talking about buying Microsoft (MSFT) at 40 cents in 1988 buying Amazon at $5 in 2001 or buying Salesforce (CRM) at $6 in 2008.

Obviously those are fantastic long-term investments. But to hammer the point let’s go over the numbers.

Based on data from over 20 stocks through three different divergences stretched over 40 years we’ve found that the average forward 12-month return in these divergence stocks was about 135% across all the examples. Forward five-year returns were almost 1000%. Forward 10-year returns were in excess of 3000%. And forward lifetime returns were more than 20000%!

So we’re not just talking about stocks to buy today and sell tomorrow.

Yes divergence stocks tend to double in 12 months. But they also tend to rise 10X in five years and more than 30X in 10 years.

We’re talking about stocks to buy today and hold forever — stocks with the chance to turn meager $10000 investments into multi-million-dollar paydays.

But that chance only comes around about every so often when the divergence phenomenon emerges.

Well folks today another Great Divergence is emerging. And we’re ready to capitalize on it for huge returns.

The Final Word

We sit on the precipice of a truly unprecedented money-making opportunity.

A rare stock market phenomenon is emerging as you read this. Historically speaking investors who have capitalized on this phenomenon had the chance to double their money in 12 months 10X their money in five years and 30X their money in 10 years… even if the broader markets crashed!

These are opportunities that could simultaneously soar and offer you protection from any bear market turmoil.

Can you see why I’m so excited right now? It doesn’t get any better than this!

Throughout my stock-picking career wherein I jam-packed more than twenty 10X picks into just a few years I’ve never been more bullish than I am right now.

And I really don’t want you to miss out on this opportunity.

Our models suggest the perfect moment to buy could come at any time. When it does we will immediately broadcast our message — and reveal of top divergence stocks to buy.

Needless to say you should sign up for that alert. If you don’t you could miss out on one of the biggest opportunities in stock market history.

Instead see how you can turn today’s market pain into your personal fortune.

Nvidia noted in an SEC filing that the U.S. government had imposed new export restrictions on two of its most advanced AI chips to China including Hong Kong its second-largest market after Taiwan making up 26% of its revenues in 2021.

The ban could cost Nvidia as much as $400 million in potential sales to China in the third quarter the firm said.

The export control also bars Nvidia from shipping the chips to Russia though the company said it doesn’t currently sell to the country.

The U.S. government said the move “will address the risk that the covered products may be used in or diverted to a ‘military end use’ or ‘military end user’ in China and Russia.” But the ban is in practice crimping a wide array of businesses and organizations using the silicons beyond military purposes.

The two chips in question are the Nvidia A100 and H100 graphic processing units. A100 is designed to provide high-performance computing storage and networking capabilities for industries spanning healthcare finance and manufacturing explains Chinese e-commerce and cloud computing giant Alibaba a user of A100.

H100 is the firm’s upcoming enterprise AI chip that is expected to ship by the end of this year and has part of its production done in China.

Complexities

There’s a silver lining — Nvidia’s engagement with China won’t be completely severed. The U.S. government has granted permission for the firm to keep manufacturing H100 in China Nvidia said in a later filing  though purchases by Chinese customers will still be restricted.

The updated authorization also allows Nvidia to keep exporting A100 to its U.S. customers with data centers in China through March 1 2023.

The more ambiguous terms concern the role of Hong Kong which is included in the original ban. “The U.S. government authorized A100 and H100 order fulfillment and logistics through the Company’s Hong Kong facility through September 1 2023” the document reads. It’s unclear whether Chinese customers can access these chips through the former British colony.

Ripple effects

The U.S.’s move to bar China’s access to its high-end technologies has in turn accelerated the latter’s pursuit of independence. Huawei has been doubling down on smartphone chip development ever since Washington put it on an export blacklist over national security concerns in 2019. A swathe of domestic semiconductor startups is netting hefty investments from VCs and government-guided funds.

While China may still be a generation behind in producing the most sophisticated chips the country is gradually sharpening its edge in lower-end specialized semiconductors such as neural processing units meant to boost phone camera capabilities.

The licensing requirement may also trigger an exodus of Nvidia’s China-based talent which would likely go on to work for domestic alternatives if they weren’t able to relocate overseas. As the firm noted in its filing the ban “may require the Company to transition certain operations out of China.”

Taiwan’s TSCM the world’s largest contract chip maker also stands to lose from the export control as it does a lot of manufacturing for Nvidia.

The Chinese government has condemned the ban described as “sci-tech hegemony” by foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin in a regular press conference on Thursday.

“The US seeks to use its technological prowess as an advantage to hobble and suppress the development of emerging markets and developing countries. This violates the rules of the market economy undermines international economic and trade order and disrupts the stability of global industrial and supply chains. China firmly rejects it.”

American officials ordered the company to stop exporting two of its top computing chips to China.

But the U.S. followed up by giving the firm a little breathing room – for now.

Nvidia revealed in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing on Wednesday that the U.S. informed the company last week of a new licensing requirement for its current highest-performing artificial intelligent chip the A100 and its forthcoming next-generation AI chip currently in development the H100.

The move effectively prohibits the company from exporting both chips to Chinese customers as the U.S. seeks to limit the spread of technology to China that could be used to make weapons amid escalating tensions between the two nations.

US REGULATORS TO VET ALIBABA OTHER CHINESE FIRMS' AUDITS

Nvidia said the licensing requirements could delay its development of the H100 hinder its ability to provide A100s to customers and might require the firm to move some of its operations out of China where it has forecasted doing $400 million in sales in its third fiscal quarter ending October.

The news sent Nvidia shares tumbling.

Then on Thursday the company filed an amended disclosure saying that the government had provided some reprieve by agreeing to allow the exports necessary to continue the development of the H100 through March 1 of next year and authorized Nvidia to continue any exports needed to provide support for U.S. customers of the A100 until the same date.

The share decline offered a buying opportunity for Cathie Wood. The CEO and CIO of Ark Invest sold shares of Tesla to buy Nvidia Barron's reported.

Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis told Barron's the selloff was an ""overreaction"". Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill had a different view calling the license a ""significant headwind"" for the company.

The U.S. also agreed to allow Nvidia to fulfill orders through its Hong Kong facility through Sept. 1 2023 meaning the company can ship outside China.

""We are working with our customers in China to satisfy their planned or future purchases with alternative products and may seek licenses where replacements aren’t sufficient"" a Nvidia spokesperson told FOX Business in an emailed statement. ""The only current products that the new licensing requirement applies to are A100 H100 and systems such as DGX that include them.""

This isn't surprising given the power of this 4K-ready graphics card. The GPU was first announced at a virtual event at Computex 2021 where Nvidia revealed both the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and GeForce RTX 3070 Ti to bolster its range of Ampere-based graphics cards.

While it isn't as beefy as the RTX 3090 or RTX 3090 Ti the RTX 3080 Ti is absolutely no slouch in terms of raw computing power. It can make the best PC games look and run at their very best.

For most of the time since its debut it's been difficult to find where to buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080. This is why I opted to get a pre-built PC with the elusive GPU inside. It was a better option than paying the exorbitant prices scalpers demanded for RTX 30 series cards. However these availability issues may now be a thing of the past. The top GPUs just fell below MSRP — and it may be time to buy one now.

With all that in mind here’s what we know about the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti.

Revealed on May 31 the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti was released on June 3 2021. Given the popularity of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 since its launch the RTX 3080 Ti hasn't been easy to find unless you're very fast and lucky. It always sells out quickly.

This is all thanks to the semiconductor shortages that have caused a graphics card shortage while also making it difficult to spot a promising PS5 restock or Xbox Series X restock.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti price

(Image credit: Nvidia)

As the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is a supercharged version of the GeForce RTX 3080 it’s got a starting price tag of $1119. That's a good bit pricier than the $699 RTX 3080 but cheaper than the $1499 RTX 3090.

However the demand for GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is as we've said very high; that’s been the case with all new Nvidia and AMD graphics cards during most of 2020 and all of 2021. Retailers and scalpers have cranked up the price of the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti. Nvidia has tried measures to ensure the RTX 3080 doesn't appeal to cryptocurrency miners but more general scalpers are a separate problem for Team Green. Thus far efforts to curb these individuals haven't worked.

With that said the price of graphics cards has dropped in recent months. Unfortunately GPUs are still difficult to find thanks to the supply chain shortages.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti performance

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti targets 4K resolution gaming much like the GeForce RTX 3080 though aiming to deliver faster frame rates this time. It's targeted at PC gamers looking to upgrade from the old GeForce RTX 1080 Ti or the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti which the RTX 3080 Ti is 1.5x faster than.

The GeForce RTX 3080 Ti enables you to not only crank all the graphics settings up in demanding games like Cyberpunk 2077 but also switch on full ray tracing and potentially game at 120 frames per second or above.

That's a big ask. But the extra memory CUDA cores and higher clock speeds give the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti a boost over its less powerful sibling.

In short the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti sits between the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 targeting PC fans who want a graphics card that delivers stellar 4K gaming performance but isn’t overkill for the resolution of their desktop setup.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti outlook

(Image credit: Nvidia)

There's an argument that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti isn’t really needed when the RTX 3080 is more than enough for most games. But as game developers continue coming to grips with the capabilities of the PS5 and Xbox Series X they’ll start to push graphics further meaning PC games with everything dialed up to the max could demand a lot for even the most powerful GPUs.

As powerful as the RTX 3080 is it will still struggle to run the most demanding games at 60 frames per second with ray tracing enabled. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti provides a boost to make smooth high-fidelity 4K gaming beyond 60 fps an achievable target. And now that high refresh rate monitors are more readily available gamers who want compromise-free graphics and performance will see the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti as a tantalizing prospect.

It's unfortunate that the RTX 3080 Ti has been plagued with shortages and has fallen victim to the ongoing graphics card shortage. With that said it's certainly a graphics card to get excited about (as I can personally testify). If nothing else you could just buy one of the pre-built rigs from our best gaming PCs roundup."

The USRA B-Mods presented by BSB Manufaturing went green to checkers with USRA national points contender Gabe Hodges at the front and only challenged by his teammate Reece Solander.

Once Hodges saw the nose of Sollander's car he quickly changed lines and protected his position to take the win with Solander second and Kenton Allen nabbing third.

The USRA Modifieds brought to you by Alternative Pest Management had trouble staying green but up at the front the No. G3 of Brendon Gemmil was checking out on the field.

With “Sally” under the hood he looked good cruising into O'Reilly Auto Parts Victory Lane with Paden Phillips second and Tad Davis third.

As the regular season heads to the checkers we want to thank everyone that has helped out. We hope the lights will have some resolution soon but until then we will continue with temporary lighting. We also thank you all that attended raced or crewed. See ya at the races…

For the Republic

The Trains Planes & Automobiles event is an annual celebration in Geneseo and for the second year will include a remembrance of those who lost their lives in the terrorist attack on the United States on Sept. 11 2001.

Each year the TPA event offers something for all ages from period aircraft overhead antique cars lining the downtown streets and tours of the canal to activities for the younger set.

“Trains Planes & Automobiles” (TPA) on Thursday Friday and Saturday Sept. 8-10 is sponsored by the Geneseo Chamber of Commerce. For information call the Chamber 309-944-2686.

Festivities get underway Thursday Sept. 8 when the Geneseo Airport pilots host the annual National Stearman Fly-In. Public can experience the sights and sounds of the World War II Stearman Bi-Planes land and take off from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Gen-Air Park east of Geneseo on U.S. Route 6. It is requested that there be “absolutely no pets at the airport.”

The trip to the Geneseo Airport is part of the National Stearman Fly-In celebration that takes place each year in Galesburg.

The Gen-Air Park Airport is located east of Geneseo on U.S. Route 6.

The fall event also features “Cruise the Canal” tours of the historic Hennepin Canal on Friday Sept. 9.

Zack Sullivan executive director of the Geneseo Chamber said “The tours started at Trains Planes & Automobiles a few years ago and are a popular annual attraction along the Hennepin m Canal. They are a great asset to the weekend activities and give people an opportunity to see and hear all the Hennepin has to offer along with facts about the history of the canal.”

“The Chamber works to remind people that we have a State Park right here in our back yard” Sullivan said. “It is important that efforts are made to showcase the canal as a local tourism attraction. The canal tours are popular and the fall foliage tours regularly sell out.”

The guided tours last approximately 90 minutes departing at 9 and 11 a.m. and at 1 p.m. on Friday Sept. 9 from Lock 24 north of Geneseo and continue west. Parking is available where the tours begin. Cost is $25 per person which includes a provided golf cart to be driven by the guests. Cart drivers must have a valid driver’s license.

Those planning to take the tours should take their bug spray and sunscreen and pets are not allowed on the tours.

Reservations are required and may be made by calling the Chamber office 309-944-2686. There will be 15 golf carts available for each tour and Sullivan said “The reservations are filling up fast so I encourage anyone interested to contact the Chamber as soon as possible.”

Sullivan said a portion of the proceeds from Cruise the Canal tours go toward preservation upkeep and maintenance of the canal

On Saturday Sept. 10 the Geneseo Firefighters Association will host a 9/11 Memorial Stair Climb at the Bob Reade Football Field at Geneseo High School.

Registration for the Stair Climb begins at 7 a.m. on Sept. 10 and participants can climb the stairs (bleachers) or walk the track anytime between 8 and 11 a.m. Event T-shirts will be available to purchase at $20 each at the site and in the downtown area. All proceeds will benefit the families of Fallen First Responders.

There will be tickets for a 1911 Gun Raffle and Grill Raffle with the purchase of an event T-shirt.

The Memorial Stair Climb is open to the public free to participate or to come as a spectator. For more information visit geneseo911stairclimb@gmail.com; face book.

Festivities on Sept. 10 also include music in the downtown area provided by 3-D Sound airplanes on display in front of the Geneseo Historical Museum along with model airplanes and trains and a car show. Dash plaques will be presented to the first 300 entries.

Sullivan said “This is one of the largest annual car shows in the Sate of Illinois and will feature approximately 350 antique vehicles.

The car show is sponsored by Maple City Cruisers with registration beginning at 7 a.m.

Members of the Geneseo Model Railroaders will showcase displays at the Geneseo Communications building East Exchange St.

There also will be a train engine on display in the downtown area. The locomotive is being provided courtesy of Iowa Interstate Railroad LLC.

At 12 noon there will be a Salute to Veterans when the VFW Color Guard will walk through downtown Geneseo.

The Salute to Veterans will include a National Anthem Performance a 21-Gun Salute by the Geneseo VFW a moment of silence and an airplane fly-over.

Food vendors also will be part of the downtown celebration serving a variety of items form pork chops and steak sandwiches to funnel cakes.

Sullivan said the Trains Planes & Automobiles event has grown over the past 16 years “and essentially takes over downtown Geneseo and is family fun.”

“Visitors can get up close to see hundreds of classic cars and even some airplanes"" he said. “Car enthusiasts can interact with other car enthusiasts; it is a great networking opportunity and our downtown businesses will celebrate the event.”

The origin of Trains Planes & Automobiles happened in 2005 when the Chamber worked with Quad-City officials to have a special steam engine make a stop in Geneseo and Sullivan said ”At that time local car collectors were invited to park their cars in the downtown area to add more excitement to the day and the annual celebration was born form there.”

In addition to activities listed for Saturday Sept 10 there also will be:

2 p.m. trophy awards for antique cars – ceremony at stop light.

2 p.m. drawing for the Geneseo Chamber annual 50-50 raffle.

3 p.m.– live music at the Central Bank Pavilion will feature Class of “82 from 3 to 6 p.m. followed by live music from Lynn Allen.

The company has transferred its 10.1% stake in the Lucius Field located in the US Gulf of Mexico’s Keathley Canyon blocks 874

875 918 and 919 and the Hadrian North Field located in KC blocks 918 and 919 to Anadarko US Offshore LLC (a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation) Murphy Exploration & Production Company – USA and Eni.

INPEX joined the Lucius Project in June 2012 and has been engaged in the development production and marketing of crude oil and natural gas under the operatorship of Anadarko.

""However with a view to optimize the INPEX Group’s global asset portfolio INPEX reached a decision to transfer its participating interest in the Lucius Project to the project partners. The impact of this matter on INPEX’s consolidated financial results is minimal"" Inpex said.

The sale comes after Inpex in 2021 acquired 2.3546% interest in the Lucius and Hadrian North fields previously held by ExxonMobil.

This acquisition increased Inpex's participating interest in the Lucius and Hadrian North fields from 7.75309 percent to 10.10769 percent.

The company at the time said that the ""acquisition of additional interest in the Lucius and Hadrian North fields contributes to the sustainable growth of oil and natural gas E&P activities one of the business targets outlined in the company’s Vision 2040 announced in May 2018.""

The Lucius field is located about 380 kilometers offshore Louisiana where the water is approximately 2200 meters deep. Production of crude oil and natural gas at the Lucius Field began in January 2015. The Hadrian North Field which lies in the vicinity of the Lucius Field was unitized with the Lucius Field in 2017 and has been jointly developed with the Lucius field using the Lucius field’s spar platform.

Production of crude oil and natural gas at the Hadrian North Field began in April 2019. The crude oil and natural gas produced from the two fields are processed at a production facility positioned offshore with a daily processing capacity of approximately 80000 barrels of crude oil and approximately 4.5 million cubic feet of natural gas transported and shipped to an onshore facility in Louisiana via subsea pipelines.

(AP) — Blake Watson scored on a 1-yard run with 33 seconds to play and Old Dominion beat Virginia Tech for the second time in as many tries on its home field 20-17 on Friday night.

The Monarchs made a big splash in their debut as a member of the Sun Belt Conference and spoiled the debut of Hokies coach Brent Pry. He was coaching against a longtime colleague at Vanderbilt and Penn State Ricky Rahne.

When it was over as they had in 2018 when the Monarchs knocked off the then-No. 13 Hokies 49-35 fans streamed on to the field in celebration. ODU is 2-12 in its history against Power Five programs but 2-2 against Tech.

Keshawn King ran for 111 yards and caught a touchdown pass from transfer quarterback Grant Wells for the Hokies. Wells also ran for a score but threw two first-half interceptions and then one to set up the decisive drive.

The Hokies were driving and trying to put the game away when Wells’ pass from ODU’s 40 bounced off of Jalen Holston to the Monarchs’ Ryan Henry. A 15-yard penalty against ODU moved the ball back to their 26 with 2:58 left but a long completion by Hayden Wolff and then a defensive pass interference call near the goal line on Dorian Strong set the Monarchs up at the 1-yard line.

Wolff finished just 14 for 35 for 165 yards but connected with Ali Jennings for 24 yards to start the winning drive ran for eight yards on a fourth-and-1 from midfield and threw the pass to Jennings that made Strong draw the huge flag.

“Tonight was frustrating for them because they knew they could play better” Rahne said. “You know I think part of it was that they wanted to come out and play so well that they played a little tight. And that’s not who we are.”

Watson needed two tries to make it but tumbled in with 33 seconds left.

There was no question that he was getting the ball Rahne said.

“Not only was it his ball but it was our offensive line’s ball” he said. “I’ll put it in their hands as many times as I can.”

SLOPPY

Wells who threw a fourth interception on a desperation pass in the final seconds wasn’t the only one with an auspicious debut for the Hokies. They were whistled for 14 penalties for 100 yards and had five turnovers.

“I am surprised we were sloppy and I felt like they pressed and you know attention to detail which showed up in the last scrimmage a little bit just more penalties than we’ve been having” Pry said.

“You want to make people earn it and we didn’t do that.”

THE TAKEAWAY

Virginia Tech: Wells showed ability with both his big arm and feet bit that arm also had him overthrowing receivers by a lot including the interception that led the ODU’s first field goal. He had 34 TDs and 22 interceptions in 23 starts at Marshall and Pry will want him to get more consistent quickly.

Old Dominion: The Monarchs lone touchdown before the decisive run by Watson was a gift when the snap on a 38-yard field goal try by Virginia Tech sailed well over the holder’s head and in the scramble to recover the ball ended with Robert Kennedy scooping it and taking it the final 25 yards.

UP NEXT Virginia Tech: The Hokies open their Atlantic Coast Conference schedule at home against Boston College.

Old Dominion: The Monarchs go on the road to play at East Carolina.

The plan calls for a maximum of 110 residential units on just under 24 acres on property owned by retired veterinarian Martin Schulman. Dr. Schulman sold his Crozet Veterinary Care Center practice in 2020. The clinic which now operates as Old Dominion Animal Hospital will become the centerpiece of the development. Without the rezoning the owners could have developed about 11 residences on the property by right.

The two adjoining parcels lie on the north side of Rt. 240 just east of Music Today and west of Park Ridge Drive. Along with the proposed Montclair development next to Wickham Pond Old Dominion Village is one of several sections of Crozet where the new “middle density residential” land use category—strongly opposed by many community members—was nonetheless imposed by county planners and supervisors in the recent Crozet Master Plan update. Middle density allows 6-12 units per acre and up to 18 units per acre if certain housing type requirements are met.

Over 50% of the acreage for Old Dominion Village is unbuildable due to flood plain buffers critical slopes and dedicated amenities so the 110-unit projection results in a density of 8 to 9 units per acre for the planned townhomes and single-family dwellings. The county’s vehicle trip generation estimator forecasts about 795 additional trips per day in and out of Old Dominion Village due to the new development.

Albemarle County estimates that about 50 students would be added to the public school system across all grades (at Crozet Elementary Henley Middle and Western Albemarle High schools). To compensate for the development’s impact on schools and local roads the proposal includes proffers of $3000 for every single-family detached unit and $2500 for each attached unit which could total $283000 if the development is built out as designed. The applicant also committed to providing 20 of the 110 residences as affordable units for sale or rental and will proffer the amenity areas to the neighborhood’s HOA.

Schulman and his team requested a rezoning of the rural land to accommodate the increased density of the development as well as a special exception to reduce the minimum required separation between animal confinements and residential lot lines from 200 feet to 50 feet. The special exception is necessary because the house lots will surround the existing veterinary office on three sides and will be substantially closer than 200 feet away.

The Planning Commission in February recommended approval of the rezoning but denial of the special exception as several commissioners felt that the latter was an important homeowner protection. “We’re taking this [veterinary] facility and making it the centerpiece [of the neighborhood] and then reducing the buffer around it” said commissioner Luis Carrazana “and it’s truly incompatible with the idea of the center of a village which is what we’re calling this.”

During their August 17 meeting the Board of Supervisors heard the results of a sound study presented by a consultant from Acentech that found that barking noises from the vet’s kennel did not exceed the county ordinance limit of 55 decibels. Supervisors also asked about green space preservation public versus private interior roads in the development and whether the proffered funds were sufficient to address the project’s impact on local roads and schools.

After the presentation Supervisor Ann Mallek double-checked that there would not be any disturbance of the designated greenways for digging sewers or any other reason. “I’m asking for clarification on this because the community in Crozet is very jumpy about the ‘oops’ factor of ‘Oh my the bulldozer just took down fifteen 20-inch diameter trees in the buffer where they weren’t even supposed to go’” she said.

Mallek also asked specifically about protections for the Beaver Creek Reservoir. “It seems as though [the developers] have pulled back in the plan from [the critical] slopes and have given good protection to that area because really the entire project is in the watershed of Beaver Creek and it’s only a mile downstream” she said. “And whatever gets in the water there will go straight into the reservoir and so we want to avoid siltation at all costs.”

The applicant Martin Schulman spoke briefly about the project. “It’s very meaningful to me having worked and lived at this site for 40 years to be in a position to move forward priorities such as having a greenway trail that will hopefully eventually connect to the downtown area and to have affordable housing [in the plan]” he said. “In fact in the proffer that we signed and updated with Kevin we are offering fully 20% or 22 units based on the development before you. I think that is a rare and diminishing resource in our modern world.”

The board led by a motion from Mallek approved the rezoning and special exception unanimously. The next step will be the preparation of a site plan to be approved by county officials.

NORFOLK Va. – Lightning does strike twice.



Quarterback Hayden Wolff engineered a dramatic Old Dominion rally in the final three minutes leading the Monarchs on a 74-yard touchdown drive that gave ODU a 20-17 victory over Virginia Tech.



The victory comes four years after the Monarchs upended the Hokies 49-35 at old Foreman Field in the biggest victory in ODU football history.



That victory was ODU's first over a Power 5 school and Tech was ranked 13th nationally. This Tech team is rebuilding and ODU has a veteran team. The Hokies were only 6-point favorites whereas they were 29-point favorites four years ago.



But beating a program that has won four ACC titles has the largest following in the state and played for a national championship was the most consequential victory in coach Ricky Rahne's tenure at ODU.



The game was witnessed by a sellout crowd of 21944 the largest since 2019 at S.B. Ballard Stadium and the crowd was electric. At game's end most of the nearly 5000 ODU students in attendance charged the field and celebrated with the players.



""That's what college football is all about right there"" said Rahne ODU's Thurmond Family Head Coach. He dripping wet from a Gatorade bath he received at game's end.



""Monarch nation came out and supported us tonight in a big way. The entire Hampton Roads area came out and supported us.



""This was an awesome atmosphere. I told our guys to go out and soak it up. This was a special night. I know a lot of these kids are never going to forget it.""



The game matched programs with close ties. Rahne and first-year Tech coach Brent Pry were both coordinators at Penn State and nearly two dozen members of both staffs worked together at Penn State or other schools.







Jen Rahne and Amy Pry wives of the head coaches tailgated just outside S.B. Ballard Stadium along with Fumi Franklin wife of Penn State coach James Franklin.



The game was the place to see and be seen. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin a Norfolk native; and Attorney General Jason Miyares who is from Virginia Beach both attended. It was ODU's first game as a member of the Sun Belt Conference and Sun Belt Commissioner Keith Gill participated in pregame activities.



Washington Commanders quarterback Taylor Heinicke the best player in ODU history was on the ODU sideline as were former Tech All-Americans and NFL stars Bruce Smith and Michael Vick. Blake LaRussa the former walk-on quarterback who engineered ODU's 2018 victory was there along with a number of his former teammates.



The game itself wasn't artful. Tech quarterback Grant Wells had four passes intercepted and ODU scored its first touchdown when a Hokie long snapper hiked an attempted field goal over the head of the holder.



The ball bounded 56 yards to the Tech 25 where cornerback Robert Kennedy III scooped it up and ran for the touchdown.







ODU had just 245 offensive yards and half came in the fourth quarter while Virginia Tech had 14 penalties.



""There were plays available all night and we just didn't make them"" Rahne said. ""That's fine. That happens sometimes. But at the end Hayden Wolff made some huge plays.""



Tech led 17-10 when the Monarchs had only their second sustained drive of the game marching from the Tech 48 to the 3 before settling for an Ethan Sanchez 20-yard field goal the second of the game for the freshman from Dallas Georgia.



Wolff completed a 27-yard pass to Ali Jennings III on the big play of that drive to foreshadow what would be a dramatic end to the game.



Tech was milking the clock and driving into ODU territory when linebacker Ryan Henry intercepted a Wells pass at the ODU 41. A personal foul drove the ball back to the 26 and with 2:58 to go the Monarchs had to score a touchdown to win.



Wolff found Jennings for 24 yards on the first play and the crowd was on its feet the rest of the game.



On third and six Wolff took off out of the pocket and was drilled by a Tech linebacker a yard short of the first down.







Initially refs ruled that he fumbled but when the replay was shown on the TowneBank Scoreboard the crowd cheered because they knew he was down before he fumbled.



Facing fourth and 1 offensive coordinator Kevin Reihner called on senior running back Blake Watson to get the first down and he bulled past a linebacker to keep the drive alive.



Watson's stats – 19 carries for 56 yards and a touchdown – weren't spectacular but most of his yards came as he dragged Hokies with him.



On third and 7 from the 39 Wolff found Jennings on the left side of the field a yard short of a touchdown with a minute left to play.



ODU then milked the clock forcing Tech to burn two timeouts before Watson carried for the touchdown on second down.



Tech had 37 seconds left to get into field goal range but LaMareon James the sophomore from Indian River High School intercepted Wells on third down to clinch the victory.



Wolff said that this victory was different than the 2018 win in which he celebrated on the field with students while on recruiting trip to ODU.



""It was a big win"" he said. ""A lot of people are talking about how we shocked the world that this was a big surprise.



""We don't see it like that. We know what we went through during the offseason what we're capable of. We expected to win this game. We full heartedly believed that and went out and got it done.







""I know they're a Power 5 school but we're a program on the rise.""



The defense Wolff said won the game.



""Grant Wells is a great quarterback and our defense intercepted him four times"" he said. ""They gave us a chance to win.""



Rahne paid tribute to Reihner for orchestrating the final drive.



At 30 he is among the nation's youngest offensive coordinators.



""For coach Rehiner to be able to find what was going to work on that last drive that's pretty awesome"" Rahne said.



Rahne acknowledged that ""I know people may not think it was a beautiful game.""



""But"" he added ""I've never experienced an ugly victory.""

After many months of anticipation it's finally time for new head coachand the Hokies to officially kick off their 2022 campaign.Below are some storylines Hokie Nation should keep an eye out for during tonight's game between Virginia Tech and Old Dominion at 7 p.m. ET on ESPNU.The most notable storyline coming out of the offseason is the hiring of head coach. Pry takes over Virginia Tech's football program after spending the last eight years at Penn State under James Franklin. Pry is tasked with bringing Virginia Tech Football back to its roots instilling a culture of winning while staying true to tradition. Pry has already become a fan favorite being heavily involved around the community participating in the Annual Cadet vs. Civilian snowball fight attending other Virginia Tech sporting events and more. While this first game won't decide his fate all eyes are on Pry to see how he kicks off his era at Virginia Tech.Virginia Tech has seen a carousel of quarterbacks the past few seasons with a different Week 1 starter for the past five years. The same stands true for the 2022 season with Marshall transfer. On August 17 it was announced thatwon the starting job and will be heading Virginia Tech's offense run by offensive coordinator. The redshirt junior comes to Blacksburg after 5626 yards and 34 touchdowns with the Thundering Herd. Wells has been one of the most productive passers in college football over the past two years and he was recognized for that in 2020 when he became the first freshman to be named to the All-Conference USA first-team. The gunslinger will look to bring stability to the quarterback room and that starts Friday night in Norfolk.An iconic symbol in Virginia Tech football makes its return in 2022. Pry's goal is to bring Virginia Tech Football back to its core and he took one step in that direction by bringing back the Lunch Pail. The Lunch Pail was introduced by legendary defensive coordinator Bud Foster back in 1995 and has been a staple of the program ever since. Since its introduction Foster's defense ranked in the top ten nationally 11 times up until 2013.The Lunch Pail isn't anything new to Pry as he was a graduate assistant under Foster from 1995-97. Pry stated that it left a lasting impression on him and always wanted his defensive unit to embody the traits of a Virginia Tech Lunch Pail Defense. The Lunch Pail is a symbol of hard work and toughness representing not just the defense but the people of Southwest Virginia and will be welcomed back with open arms this season. Fifth-year defensive back and team captainwas recently given the honor of carrying the Lunch Pail onto the field beginning with tonight's game.A bunch of now-Hokies will make their return back to Norfolk a place where they called their stomping grounds before making the transition to Blacksburg. That crew entails receivers coach(2021) senior director of strength & conditioning Dwight Galt (2019-21) and assistant director of player engagement Joe Joe Headen (2017-21) who has actually played in all three Tech-ODU games as a cornerback for the Monarchs. The head coach of ODU Ricky Rahne also has ties to Pry with both of them working together as the offensive and defensive coordinators at Penn State. Pry also has worked with a number of other Penn State staff members who also came with Rahne to Norfolk. Lastly ODU tight ends coach Justin Harper was a standout receiver for the Hokies from 2004-07.Another one of Pry's goals as head coach is to focus on recruiting within the Commonwealth of Virginia. Some of the Hokies' most heralded players – Michael Vick Bruce Smith Tyrod Taylor – have all hailed from Virginia. Another thing that all these players have in common is that they are all proud natives of the 757 (area code for Hampton Roads metropolitan area). The 757 area has been known to develop high-quality players over the years and a dominant performance Friday can certainly help Tech in that regard for luring top recruits from the area.Heading into this game Tech has history on its side owning an 89-38-1 mark in season openers. While they are 56-64-6 in when opening a season away from home the Hokies are 63-40-5 against Virginia FBS opponents. This will be the first time since 2016 that Tech has opened against a team from Virginia defeating Liberty 36-13 at home. The last time the Hokies opened a season on the road at Virginia was back in 1982 when they beat Richmond 20-9."

Even in politics she has experimented taking a year off from Coke in the year 2015 to assist Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.Known for supporting liberal causes Clark most recently tweeted her support for Stacey Abrams' bid for governor of Georgia. Clark a former agency employee who has seen many countries and now calls Atlanta her home.In his previous role as president and CEO of DDB North America Clark expanded his connections with companies such as Johnson & Johnson Conagra and State Farm. Most notably she led the development of We are Unlimited a customised agency for McDonald's. In the end Wieden+Kennedy received the account and the two firms later combined to form DDB Chicago.It looks like she left DDB abruptly as well. Omnicom Group Chairman-CEO John Wren mentioned Clark's departure during an earnings call in April 2020 that was held in the midst of the pandemic of COVID-11 and perhaps a few client losses saying that they were a bit surprised and put off when she made the decision that she was going to relocate in the middle of a crisis.Dentsu International and Dentsu Japan Network are the two agency networks owned by Dentsu Group.Operations outside of Japan have been controlled by Dentsu International formerly Dentsu Aegis Network in London. Included in this are the assets of Aegis Media which were bought out in March 2013.

Industry sources said that Clark’s move was following planned restructuring at Dentsu.

Adgully had reached out to Dentsu but were yet to get any confirmation at the time of publishing this report.

With over 30 years’ of industry experience as a delivery-focused leader Clark had joined Dentsu from Omnicom Group where she held the role of Global President & CEO for DDB Worldwide.

Somebody was doing pretty well at Dentsu International – presumably CEO Wendy Clark although there are other candidates Merkle execs on earn-outs for example – with a pay package of £13.5m. £7.1m in “remuneration” £6.3m from “long-term incentive schemes” and a £100000 pension contribution according to Campaign. Dentsu isn’t saying.

Now however Gideon Spanier reports in Campaign that “multiple sources” have told the magazine that Clark is stepping down at the company despite its strong recent performance under her high profile leadership.

Clark who joined from Omnicom’s DDB following a long marketing career at Coca-Cola – certainly seems to have steered DI onto the right path piling its creative offer into Dentsu X (binning the awful denstsumcgarrybowen in the process) and focusing on the latest ad goldmine customer experience. Its media agencies the foundation of the group outside Japan don’t seem to be doing much more than hanging in there though which may be a worry.

Running a big part of a Japan-based empire is hardly a cakewalk for any outsider as these latest developments may indicate. Jerry Buhlmann who came from Carat seemed to do a pretty good job at DI with the buy of performance marketing agency Merkle probably the highlight.

Clark seemed an odd choice for what was then a primarily media agency-based business. Charismatic she certainly seemed to open client doors at DDB although its brave new model for handling McDonald’s – a variation on the ‘better faster cheaper’ model – only lasted a couple of years. But she’s succeeded already in raising the profile of Dentsu outside its media heartland.

If she is indeed on her way there’ll be gasps of astonishment elsewhere in adland. We’ll keep you posted.

A whole new world... A new fantastic point of view. A dazzling place.""

Tuesday’s Prime-X super event was a magic carpet ride for the audience as Primedia’s Group CEO Jonathan Procter spelt out the group’s 2025 vision. The gala affair held in Sandton and attended by Anele and the Club Afternoon Drive’s Thando the industry’s crème de le crème Primedia’s executive staff partners and clients was a long-awaited burst of fresh air and a highly welcomed celebration after the world restraints of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The evening was a ‘shining shimmering and splendid’ affair as Procter passionately spoke on how the future is a whole new world for those who invest in and actively participant in collaboration and innovation. Procter is clear on where the group is headed and how to get there. The man at the helm of Primedia unveiled a growth strategy for Primedia which is firmly rooted on an acute understanding of the media horizon. Procter said “We are cognizant of the ever-changing and evolving South African and global media landscape and we recognise the seismic shifts in market tectonics and we have fully embraced this whole new world.” The new world according to Procter will be a cosmos of collaboration and innovation. “If we don’t innovate and create and collaboration we will be left behind. We have to re-invent ourselves continuously to stay relevant.”

The new world of Primedia will see it becoming a hot house of radio television and video content within and beyond South Africa and the eight African countries in which the group operates. For Procter investing in and actively participating in the “new world of global creative genius” and “brilliantly curated content” will ensure that Primedia continues to enthrall and build audiences for years to come.

The audience at the Prime-X event broke out in full cheer when it was announced that Primedia has acquired the rights to The Masked Singer one of the world’s most popular television shows. The Masked Singer a celebrity singing competition where well known personalities perform under the cover of flamboyant costumes and facial masks to conceal their identities has proved to be a winning formula which has attracted voluminous audiences worldwide.

Procter announced to the delight of the audience that “We (Primedia) have bought the exclusive rights to one of the world’s biggest shiny floor shows which we will co-produce with our very own Anele and her production company Rose and Oaks”. The partnership between Primedia and Anele Mdoda’s multimedia company will see the show tailored for local audiences and will be broadcast in three languages.

This is just a taste of things to come. Other Primedia new world innovations include bringing other top international shows to South Africa including a South African version of Deal or No Deal in collaboration with local television players. The group will always be exploring talk of the town opportunities in partnership with global players and competitors. The development of indigenous language news and content is high on the Primedia broadcasting agenda as is high technology futurist inspired mall and mobile advertising in the retail space for its outdoor operations. And this is just part of Primedia’s new world.

“We don’t want to be Spotify or You Tube or Twitter or TicTok or Facebook or Instagram or Netflix or Disney"" Procter says “but we can make and own the compelling content that those platforms need so desperately if they want to be relevant on this continent. We know how to tell our stories in ways that resonate with the audiences of South Africa and Africa. This content also has massive relevance for global audiences and is in very very short supply at the moment so Primedia is well positioned to leverage its skills in market demanding local content. The appetite for content from Africa is going to grow exponentially as more and more of our music and our stories find their rightful place in the global demand for compelling content that delivers accretive audiences.”

The Group’s vision is crystal clear and as the lyric of the song goes “Through an endless diamond sky. A whole new world (don't you dare close your eyes). A hundred thousand things to see (hold your breath it gets better). With new horizons to pursue.” For Primedia it looks as if the best of times lies ahead.

But to hit this target it needs to re-think its approach to the manufacturing of microchips and focus on its strengths.

Evolving regulation in the EU and US is promising and Europe's healthy academic field mean it is well placed to power its digital advances with home-made microchips.

Europe is undoubtedly on the cusp of a transformation that will shape its future. Technology will power this transformation. Artificial intelligence pervasive computing ubiquitous computing and cloud-to-edge infrastructure will be critical in Europe reaching its digitization potential. At the core of these technologies is the semiconductor chip. This technology powers innovative ideas and technology and it accelerates our understanding of the world around us.

Europe’s digital transformation is interwoven with the revitalization of the semiconductor industry which was ravaged by global shutdowns shipping disruptions and geopolitical tensions.

Four ways to build a next-gen semiconductor industry

Europe must revitalize its semiconductor industry to be fit for the future. Fixing this issue is not easy — but it is critical.

The EU has targeted an increase in its share of the global semiconductor industry from 9% now to 30% by 2030. Here are four key steps the bloc can take now to meet that ambitious goal:

1. Double down on collaboration

No single organization or government can transform a global industry alone so the importance of collaboration cannot be overstated. Open ecosystems and deep partner relationships are required to drive Europe’s semiconductor industry forward.

But manufacturing semiconductors in Europe faces significant cost disadvantages. It can cost 40% to 50% more to operate a semiconductor fabrication plant — known as a “fab” — in Europe compared to other areas of the world where governments may subsidize manufacturing. Similar subsidies within Europe would certainly help balance the playing field.

The good news is that the EU Chips Act is on its way. There is also an appetite for supporting collaboration across Europe’s value chain particularly among manufacturers that may be too small to operate globally. In addition to collaboration within Europe and the EMEA region we should also look across the pond. The recent passing of the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act set to supercharge the American semiconductor industry is a welcome step in the right direction. More importantly it shows coordination on both sides of the Atlantic.

2. Bring the lab and the fab together

One of Europe’s key strengths historically has been laboratory research and academia but production has taken place at semiconductor fabrication plants elsewhere. We must aim to bring research and manufacturing closer together. By harnessing some of the world’s greatest talent in Europe we can translate the region’s existing excellence in research into industrial innovation for consumers globally. In fact Kearney estimates that the overall European economy would experience between €77 billion and €85 billion in additional GDP over the next decade through chip investment alone.

Legislation is the first step to making this a reality. The EU Chips Act is now going through the EU’s legislative procedure and aims to mobilize more than €43 billion of public and private investments to provide manufacturers the tools necessary to thrive in Europe: investment into research and development building talent pipelines and supporting infrastructure.

3. Have the right skills for the job

Behind every product is people. While investment and innovation are key without the right talent they will take Europe only so far.

Europe is one of the most diverse regions in the world. With more than 50 countries it boasts a talent pool across manufacturing R&D software and more. To realize the EU’s ambitions for the technology and manufacturing sectors the industry must invest in STEM education and develop innovative ways to engage with traditionally underrepresented groups. For a start this means being committed to D&I efforts with current and prospective employees in the region. Governments universities and private sector companies must ensure employees have the skills to succeed in the workforce of tomorrow.

This is about more than just chips. Technological innovation is rapidly reshaping lives and careers alike making skills in Artificial Intelligence software development and engineering increasingly important across various sectors. It is crucial that no one is left behind as we adapt to this new landscape.

4. Prioritize sustainability in the semiconductor industry

It is no secret that the chip industry is energy-intensive and work is needed to ensure the manufacturing process aligns with Europe’s green transition and goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Europe must rebuild its chip industry in a greener sustainable way ensuring that the reconstruction of this industry does not come at the cost of the climate. There are several examples to draw from: from water conservation recycling and reclaiming projects to using renewable energy for manufacturing operations and working toward achieving zero total waste to landfills.

Working with suppliers can help European fabs achieve this goal. Partnerships can help reduce supply chain greenhouse gas emissions to 30% by 2030 — lower than they would be without investment and action. In addition working with industry partners and customers can support efforts to increase energy efficiency and lower the total carbon footprint of the technology industry.

Building sustainability into the manufacturing process is a vital stepping stone for sustainable manufacturing and one that will usher us through the Fourth Industrial Revolution without serious and lasting consequences for our planet.

Toward Europe's digital future

Making Europe’s semiconductor industry and supply chains resilient and sustainable won’t be simple or quick. But it is necessary for Europe to realize its ambitions of remaining a leading technology powerhouse while also boosting its GDP.

They say the best time to start something is yesterday and the second-best time is today. Some companies such as Intel are readying themselves for the challenge and preparing to bolster EMEA’s digital sovereignty and make this region the home to a sustainable profitable and cutting-edge next-generation semiconductor ecosystem.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVjZi5lZHUvbmV3cy91Y2YtcmVjZWl2ZXMtOC04bS1mb3ItZGlnaXRhbC10d2luLWluaXRpYXRpdmUtYXMtcGFydC1vZi1mZWRlcmFsLWJ1aWxkLWJhY2stYmV0dGVyLXJlZ2lvbmFsLWNoYWxsZW5nZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UCF Receives $8.8M for Digital Twin Initiative as Part of Federal Build Back Better Regional Challenge,"UCF is part of a local collaboration selected to receive a major national investment in semiconductor research design and manufacturing in the Central Florida region.

The funding which was announced today is from the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration through its Build Back Better Regional Challenge.

Osceola County — in partnership with UCF Orlando Economic Partnership BRIDG the Florida High Tech Corridor and SkyWater Technology — is one of 21 awardees selected out of 529 applicants to receive the funding and the only Florida awardee. The total award amount is $50.8 million with UCF receiving $8.8 million for its project Digital Twin.

Digital twin encompasses digital replications of any real-world objects or systems — such as the human heart — that can be altered to understand impacts on an original item. Digital twins could be scaled to entail entire cities or large transportation or health care systems with constantly updated data and conditions allowing designers builders and architects to test and prove their ideas and concepts before production.

The investment will expand the semiconductor manufacturing potential of NeoCity a 500-acre technology district in Kissimmee. It will establish a hub for semiconductor reshoring benefitting aerospace engineering healthcare and other industries nationally. UCF is already a national leader in modeling and simulation research and education.

“UCF is committed to unleashing potential in people organizations ideas and the communities we serve through partnerships” says UCF President Alexander N. Cartwright. “With this grant we will have the opportunity to leverage the expertise of outstanding faculty to expand our novel digital-twin technology to train the next generation of innovators with the skills necessary to fuel the growth of NeoCity and central Florida’s economy.”

UCF’s Microelectronic Design and Production Digital Twin project will be completed through collaboration between UCF’s School of Modeling Simulation and Training (SMST) and the College of Engineering and Computer Science. SMST Director Grace Bochenek ’98PhD will provide strategic guidance on the project.

With an investment in new modeling and simulation equipment UCF will develop a digital twin of NeoCity’s Center for NeoVation which is a world-class sensor and research development city for academic and commercial use.

Through the Center for NeoVation’s digital twin UCF will replicate its production line increasing microchip reliability and productivity lowering maintenance costs reducing risk creating new business improving supply and delivery chain efficiency and enabling cross-discipline collaboration to foster innovation. UCF’s participation in this project expands its efforts to be at the forefront of the cutting-edge field of digital twin which the university committed a separate research initiative to earlier this year.

“Digital twin is transformative technology that holds the potential to improve everything from manufacturing plants to medical procedures” Bochenek says. “With the innovative research being done by UCF faculty and the support of Osceola County and Orlando Economic Partnership and all of our partners digital twin technology like what we are building at NeoCity stands to be this century’s next game changer.”

A Partnership that Bolsters Central Florida’s Economy

Orlando is ideally located for a digital twin hub as Bochenek notes the city already has a thriving modeling simulation and training community with 200+ small- to midsize companies. The industry produces a $21.1 billion regional and statewide economic impact — making Central Florida the world hub for modeling simulation and training. With SMST and an expanding Central Florida Microelectronics Regional Cluster UCF is positioned to supply the qualified talent and innovative research needed to grow this field.

In addition to its Center for NeoVation NeoCity will include a magnet STEM high school urban farm central plaza for community and corporate events neighborhood parks and other sustainability infrastructure elements. The multi-billion-dollar venture will provide workforce housing and create more than 25000 jobs.

“Not only is this the first major federal semiconductor investment in the United States but the site they selected for this historical investment was right here in NeoCity” says Osceola County Commission Chairman Brandon Arrington. “This is a significant validation of Osceola County’s grand vision to create high-wage hi-tech jobs at NeoCity. The federal government’s investment accelerates our focused efforts to create more economic opportunities at a higher level than ever before.”

Funded by President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan and administered by the U.S. Commerce Department’s Economic Development Administration (EDA) the Regional Challenge provides each award winner resources to rebuild regional economies promote inclusive and equitable recovery and create thousands of good-paying jobs in industries of the future such as clean energy next-generation manufacturing and biotechnology.

“As we invest and grow critical industries in the U.S. we want to create industry hubs in diverse communities across the country” said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo in a press release from the White House. “These grants will provide critical and historic funding directly to community coalitions to invest in new infrastructure research and development and workforce development programs while creating good-paying jobs supporting workers and prioritizing equity.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvc3RldmViYW5rZXIvMjAyMi8wOS8wMi9xdWFsY29tbXMtYW5zd2VyLXRvLXRoZS1jaGlwLXNob3J0YWdlLWEtZGlnaXRhbC10cmFuc2Zvcm1hdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Qualcomm's Answer To The Chip Shortage?

Semiconductors or computer chips have attracted much attention lately. Nowadays they power a wide array of products and devices which are becoming more interconnected through the internet of things. Further the lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic sparked a huge surge in demand for laptops and other electronic devices causing a major shortage in the chip supply – a problem widely reported in the media and felt by consumers worldwide.

From an equities market perspective Nasdaq’s PHLX Semiconductor Sector IndexSM (SOXSM) has become one of the best-known and most widely tracked subsector indexes in the technology sector. Market participants not only invest in the underlying stocks in this industry but also ETFs that track SOX. Now they are also empowered to manage their exposure using the new CME Group E-mini PHLX Semiconductor Sector futures contract (ticker: SOX).

“Our partnership with CME Group continues to provide more choice and versatility for investors looking to manage risk and meet their investment objectives” says Sean Wasserman Vice President Global Head of Index & Advisor Solutions at Nasdaq. “As with our existing futures contracts we’re excited for the launch of the SOX futures and value the important role CME Group plays in the investment community.”

Nasdaq’s SOX index comprises companies primarily involved in the design distribution manufacture and sale of semiconductors including the top 30 securities by market capitalization in the semiconductor industry with U.S. listings. The top 10 holdings are Texas Instruments (TXN) Intel (INTC) Broadcom (AVGO) Nvidia (NVDA) Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Qualcomm (QCOM) KLA Corporation (KLAC) Analog Devices (ADI) Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM) and ASML (ASML). The index is modified market cap-weighted (8% capping for the top five constituents with the rest capped at 4%) on a quarterly rebalancing schedule. Constituents must have a listing in the U.S. on either the Nasdaq NYSE or CBOE exchanges. They are also required to meet minimum thresholds for market cap ($100 million) and liquidity (1.5 million shares traded in each of the last six months).

According to Paul Woolman Executive Director – Head of EMEA Equity and Alternative Index Products at CME Group sector dispersion is a key use case for the SOX futures contract. At any given time broad market indexes such as the S&P 500 Russell 2000 or Nasdaq-100 may be trending in one direction. However some sectors within those indexes may be performing very differently from each other and can move in the opposite direction. This dynamic presents an opportunity to trade one sector against another sector a sector against a broad index or a sector against one or more stocks in the sector.

“You’re expecting one sector to outperform or underperform the other exposure depending on your view” he explains. “In addition to this relative value trading opportunity sector futures also provide the ability for clients to go long or short in order to express a directional view to put on an overlay strategy or to risk manage a specific sector within their portfolio. These are all potential user cases for the new E-mini PHLX Semiconductor Sector futures.”

To this end it is not surprising that sector-based futures volumes and the number of participants using the contracts have increased with average daily volume up 56% since 2019. The main users are asset managers pension funds insurance companies and hedge funds who use the contracts typically for one of the use cases described above. Market makers and proprietary trading firms help to provide liquidity on the central limit order book whilst banks facilitate access to these contracts on behalf of their clients and provide both block and on-screen liquidity.

As of Aug. 8 2022 SOX futures may be traded on screen or as outright blocks. Block trades are privately negotiated transactions that meet certain quantity thresholds and are permitted to be executed apart from the public auction market.

However sometimes the block quantity may be too large and require a longer reporting period to allow the counterparties to hedge their exposure. As such SOX futures are eligible for derived block trading like the other 18 sector-based Equity Index futures contracts listed at CME Group. A derived block is a block trade consummated by eligible contract participants in which the price and quantity of the trade depends on hedging transactions in an eligible related market. Parties agree to the predefined notional or number of contracts and the market in which the hedging transaction will take place. Additionally a basis price is agreed to be added to the index price of the resultant hedge in the related market. Permitted hedging instruments include stock baskets and other eligible related market instruments such as ETFs.

“Derived blocks allow market participants to source liquidity in the underlying stocks in the index or in ETFs that track the index and then transfer the liquidity into the futures contracts” says Woolman.

Additionally SOX futures are eligible for Basis Trade at Index Close (BTIC) under the ticker SOT. These transactions enable market participants to trade futures contracts at a fixed spread or basis relative to the official index cash close. Market participants may also migrate their existing exposure into the futures contract through an Exchange of Futures for Physical (EFP). This is a private agreement between two parties to trade a futures position for the basket of underlying stocks or an ETF. EFPs can be used to open or close a futures position or switch a futures position for the underlying asset.

SOX futures are cost- capital- and tax efficient. Market participants can get exposure to the semiconductor subsector by putting up a small percentage of the notional amount as margin which can be offset against positions in other products at CME Group. Under section 1256 of the U.S. tax code profit and loss on these transactions are entitled to be taxed at a rate equal to 60% long-term and 40% short-term capital gain or loss. Finally SOX futures are UCITS eligible which is beneficial for EMEA-based investors.

CME Group has had great success partnering with Nasdaq on futures products. Woolman points out that the E-mini Nasdaq-100® Index (NDX®) futures contract is an important part of the equity ecosystem because the technology sector is a driver of equity markets and market cap. This is evidenced by the liquidity of the contract continuing to grow strongly over the last few years. Further technology tends to be one of the more volatile sectors.

“Clients who like trading tactically like to trade the Nasdaq-100” he says. “SOX will have its own unique risk profile and it will give clients greater choice.”

Nowhere have these shifting dynamics been brought into sharper view than in the semiconductor market.

Demand for semiconductors has never been higher and Deloitte projects chip purchases to grow by a record 10% globally in 2022 to $600 billion. Coupled with the historic semiconductor shortage estimated to last well into 2024 the cornerstone of manufacturing components from electronics to medical devices to automobiles appears to have a crack in its foundation.

There is some good news — industry and the U.S. government alike are responding to the gap between semiconductor supply and demand. On August 9 President Biden signed the CHIPs and Science Act of 2022 a $280 billion bill designed to help mitigate the impact of disruption in chip production.

Manufacturers are reassessing their strategies to support a migration from just-in-time inventory management models and offshore production. According to the Kearney 2021 Reshoring Index 92% of surveyed CEOs view reshoring positively and a growing number of manufacturers are reshoring and constructing manufacturing facilities across the U.S.

Another action manufacturers are taking is the purchase of large quantities of chips to help insulate their production cycles from future disruptions. Following are two additional steps they should consider to optimize production and working capital.

Consider the advantages of advance purchasing chip inventory. Given the high demand for chips and volatility of the semiconductor market stockpiling of supply is becoming a more widespread tactic for manufacturers. The large volume purchase of chips is an ideal solution for multiple manufacturing scenarios including products with standard production cycles such as electronics bulk orders necessary for end-of-life production and products with longer lifecycles requiring extended service support. In addition stockpiling helps manufacturers safeguard against lead-time delays and ensures disruption-free manufacturing throughout the production cycle.

There are also financial benefits for manufacturers who elect to stockpile chips. Bulk purchasing safeguards chip inventory against component price inflation particularly where the same chips are in demand across multiple industries and each additional round of chip production entails increases in price and delivery times. Advance buffer stock purchases also open the door to purchasing discounts not available in a just-in-time-inventory model.

Deploy the optimal solution for chip storage. Once manufacturers purchase chips in bulk (which often requires an inefficient use of working capital) they must determine the optimal storage solution to protect their semiconductors. Chips are delicate and sensitive to environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. Storage in the wrong environment may cause irreparable damage and a complete investment loss.

Some types of semiconductor chips are often delivered in trays inside vacuum-sealed packaging and typically require a more sophisticated fulfillment and warehousing environment than what’s available in many storage facilities. In addition the chips and some electronic components (including sub-assemblies) must be maintained in a cooled environment. This eliminates a high percentage of manufacturing and third-party logistics companies with storage areas that aren’t air-conditioned or humidity-controlled.

Manufacturers in this scenario have a few options. The first and generally most expensive one is investing in significant and often time-consuming upgrades to their own infrastructure to store the chips. The other is aligning with electronics manufacturing service (EMS) partners or other facilities with the appropriate temperature-controlled environment and experienced staff with the training and expertise to handle semiconductors.

In either case the storage facility should maintain appropriate environmental controls for humidity and temperature and meet industry and regulatory standards for quality management efficiency and customer satisfaction including ISO 9001 and AS9120B.

Inflation and the supply chain disruptions that are fueling the semiconductor shortage will likely continue into the foreseeable future. However manufacturers that draw on alternative financing and storage options for protecting their semiconductor investment and maintaining their production commitments are well-positioned to meet these challenges.

The ideas all aimed at shoring up its cash position and extending its runway in tough market conditions were laid out in an internal memo first reported by Bloomberg and also viewed by TechCrunch. The internal memo which was intended for the board ahead of its August 3 meeting was mistakenly sent to all Aurora employees which today numbers around 1600 people.

Following the Bloomberg report Aurora shares jumped as much as 27%. Shares closed up 15.17% to $2.43.

Aurora has a “cash runway” that will allow it to continue operations through mid-2024 according to its second-quarter letter to shareholders and noted in the memo. However Aurora is still a pre-revenue company. And the memo written by co-founder and CEO Chris Urmson acknowledged a two-fold problem: a challenging financial market that makes it difficult to raise additional capital and shifting timelines by its OEM partners that delays revenue.

Aurora which has prioritized commercializing self-driving trucks has pilot partnerships with FedEx Paccar Schneider Werner and Xpress.

Aurora held a board meeting after the email was shared. An Aurora spokesperson declined to comment on what was discussed during the meeting. The company did provide an emailed statement stating“Given the current macro conditions every company should be going through the exercise of evaluating its options and long-term strategy. We think that thinking through things like this is a positive sign and a mark of good governance.”

Urmson noted that market conditions make it unlikely that the company could raise $1 billion. Instead he laid out a long list of options — each one noting pros and cons as well as his biggest concern of maintaining employee morale — and said there was value in finding a “path to raise $300 million in the next year to add around six months to our runway.”

Extending the runway Urmson’s internal memo reads more like a financial and strategic exercise than a plan of action. The lengthy memo which was sent ahead of its August 3 board meeting lays out virtually every option the company could take to extend its cash position. The memo’s more eye-catching ideas include selling itself to Big Tech companies like Apple or Microsoft or a Tier 1 supplier. However the memo provides zero hint that discussions with any company have even begun.

There are a number of other options which fall under cash-savings and cash-generating measures laid out in the memo. The cash savings methods run the gamut including a hiring freeze and even job cuts although Urmson cautioned against the latter. “I believe that a RIF (reduction in force) will be damaging to morale” Urmson wrote noting that teams are feeling understaffed. “Though the board (and I) might believe that the team will be more efficient if smaller we expect that the negative morale impact and follow-on increase in attrition of valuable talent would be challenging. Unless the layoffs are substantial we should think of this primarily as an improving efficiency tactic rather than a substantial increase in runway once we consider the severance costs.” On the workforce front Urmson recommended two options: “aggressive performance management of poor performers” and “more intensive de-duplication and prioritization.” Cutting through the jargon this could mean laying off poor performers and eliminating duplicated positions or simply not filling those positions once vacated. Those measures Urmson wrote may not have the operational simplicity of a RIF or hiring freeze but would result in meaningful efficiency improvements and cost savings. He estimated a savings of $7.5 million. Other cash-cutting measures such as eliminating the CEO equity grant reducing software licenses by 20% suspending annual bonuses and stopping food service were also included in the memo. Urmson also threw out a variety of cash-generating options that ranged from the sale of its test track and building to bigger moves such as spinning out or selling its lidar or simulation assets acquiring other AV companies that are trading at or near the cash on their balance sheet “in the neighborhood of $150 million to $300 million” taking Aurora private or selling itself to a bigger tech company or Tier 1 supplier. Acquiring another AV company would eliminate another competitor reduce the dilution of funding in the marketplace and allow Aurora to “aggressively reduce redundancies” according to the memo. Aurora doesn’t name any potential companies on that acquisition list. However there are a few such as Embark which has a market cap of $204 million that might qualify. Aurora hired Allen & Co to analyze the acquisition path according to the memo. Of all the options Urmson seemed most interested in exploring whether there was a viable path to spinning out tech pursuing an acquisition and investigating a small capital raise.

Urmson said in the memo he was disinclined to sell the company at this time unless there was a strong offer from a “very compelling strategic purchaser.”

Buzzy startup to SPAC

Aurora went from buzzy startup to publicly traded company-via-SPAC in a span of four years. The company was founded in 2017 by Sterling Anderson Drew Bagnell and Urmson all whom have a history of working on automated vehicle technology.

The three co-founders who hailed from Google’s self-driving project Uber ATG and Tesla helped attract high-profile investors and a stack of capital.

Aurora’s co-founders doubled down in December 2020 when they reached an agreement with Uber to buy the ride-hailing firm’s self-driving unit. The complex deal that at the time valued the combined company at $10 billion helped Aurora double the size of its workforce.

Under the terms of that acquisition Aurora did not pay cash for Uber ATG. Instead Uber handed over its equity in ATG and invested $400 million into Aurora. Uber received a 26% stake in the combined company according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Aurora made at least one other acquisition following the Uber deal. In February 2021 Aurora bought OURS Technology the second lidar startup it had acquired in less than two years. Aurora acquired Blackmore a Montana-based lidar startup in May 2019.

Against that backdrop dozens of startups across industries that were keen to unlock more capital turned to mergers with special purpose acquisition companies. These SPAC mergers offered a quicker yet often more costly path to the public marketplace.

Aurora jumped on the SPAC train announcing in July 2021 that it would go public via a merger with Reinvent Technology Partners Y a special purpose acquisition company launched by LinkedIn co-founder and investor Reid Hoffman Zynga founder Mark Pincus and managing partner Michael Thompson.

A year later the promises of what a high-flying public marketplace could offer has come back down to earth forcing frontier tech companies like Aurora to find ways to extend their capital runways long enough to reach commercialization.",,,,,,

Anand Oswal Senior Vice President Network Security at Palo Alto Networks says “SaaS apps have given organisations the freedom to have their workforce work from wherever they are most productive.

""The vast amounts of sensitive data being created held and shared via SaaS applications however expose a serious risk of data breach due to SaaS misconfiguration. Simply put the world needs a SASE solution that can manage the configuration and security of SaaS applications.

""With today's Prisma SASE updates we are significantly strengthening the security posture of SaaS apps through the Palo Alto Networks Next-Gen CASB which allows customers to easily view and configure security settings for multiple SaaS apps in a single place.

In addition to SSPM the company announced new ZTNA 2.0 security inspection capabilities including ML-powered Advanced URL Filtering and Advanced Threat Prevention as well as the industry's first natively integrated artificial intelligence for IT operations (AIOps) solution for SASE simplifying networking and security operations for customers.

The full set of product announcements are:

SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM): Powered by Palo Alto Networks Next-Gen CASB the SaaS Security Posture Management capabilities go beyond CIS and NIST compliance checks and move to comprehensive security allowing customers to configure security settings for multiple SaaS apps in one location.

In an effort to reduce remediation time SSPM can help fix misconfigurations with a single click and helps prevent configuration drift by allowing users to lock critical security settings in place.

Advanced URL Filtering: Prevents new highly evasive phishing attacks ransomware and other web-based attacks through the use of inline deep learning rather than a URL database preventing 40% more threats and detecting 76% of malicious URLs up to a full day before traditional web filtering solutions.

Advanced Threat Prevention: Provides the only intrusion prevention system (IPS) solution that can stop unknown command-and-control (C2) attacks in real time 48% more than other IPS solutions. New capabilities bring security analysis from offline to inline using machine learning techniques improving detection rates for zero-day threats without sacrificing performance.

AIOps for SASE: Palo Alto Networks natively integrated AIOps into its secure access service edge to significantly reduce manual operations and enable faster troubleshooting. AIOps for SASE provides automated root cause analysis rapid problem remediation and guided best practice adoption. Predictive analytics enable more efficient capacity planning and anomaly detection preventing business disruptions. A simple query-based interface empowers the IT service desk with automated troubleshooting and change analysis.

In addition to these software enhancements Palo Alto Networks is introducing new hardware appliances ION 1200-S and ION 3200 to help organisations modernise their small to midsize branches.

These new appliances include a fully integrated switch and Power over Ethernet (PoE) ports to connect and power endpoints within the local area network. Additionally integrated WAN capabilities like 5G and LTE on the ION 1200-S and fibre ports on the ION 3200 allow customers to improve WAN availability performance and speed.

ION 1200-S and ION 3200 can help significantly reduce operational complexity by eliminating multiple point products while providing power redundancy with a built-in dual power supply that ensures network uptime and consistent connectivity.

John Grady ESG senior analyst says “The usage of SaaS applications continues to expand at a faster rate than security teams can keep pace with. As more applications are introduced and ownership becomes distributed across organisations the risk of misconfigurations grows which increases the likelihood for security incidents to occur.

(PLDT) and its wireless unit Smart Communications (Smart) to bolster the capabilities of the the two telcos’ Child Protection Platform and establish a safer online experience for children.

Angel Redoble first vice president and chief information security officer at PLDT and Smart said in a recent online press briefing the platform has blocked more than 1 billion attempts to access URLs with child sexual abuse material (CSAM) since November 2021.

A recent report revealed that in 2020 an estimated 2 million children in the Philippines were exposed to content that is considered inappropriate. The same report also highlighted that one in five children in the Philippines aged 12 to 17 encountered CSAM while using the Internet. PLDT and Smart’s Child Protection Platform is a cybersecurity solution developed to address these problems by blocking illegal CSAM traffic at the content level thereby effectively restricting access to CSAM that have found their way into legitimate domains.

Redoble said PLDT and Smart have long been at the forefront of the global fight against online child abuse and human trafficking as part of its efforts to uphold the child protection principles of Republic Act No. 9775 or the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009.

He pointed out that PLDT and Smart have also joined peers and other stakeholders from the private and government sectors in calling for the immediate passage of the Anti-OSAEC bill. The proposed law will institutionalize the taking down of web sites that stream or host CSAM as well as impose stiffer penalties against parties involved in child abuse cases.

“Protecting children online is of paramount importance to PLDT and Smart—it’s in our DNA. As the Philippines’s leading wireless provider we wanted to engage with a partner with deep technical expertise and a shared mission to build a safe Internet for children” Redoble said.

“Palo Alto Networks demonstrated the capabilities to be at the core of our platform and provide consistent security and visibility across our network. Since it was imperative that the solution needed to be tailor-built to suit our needs we were on the lookout for an innovative cybersecurity partner which we found in Palo Alto Networks.”

Powered by Palo Alto Networks’ technology Redoble said PLDT and Smart’s Child Protection Platform blocks traffic at the content level and comply with regulatory requirements pertaining to illegal CSAM. Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs) and Cloud-Delivered Security Services including Threat Prevention Advanced URL Filtering and WildFire scrutinize the content and convert URLs for redirection if CSAM-related traffic is found. Through the matching of blocked URLs against the blocked listing policy the solution put in place will then alert PLDT and Smart that the user is trying to access CSAM.

“As the attack surface for children is expanding due to increased time spent online for academics and entertainment a scalable cybersecurity solution is needed to be implemented to ensure their online safety” said Oscar Visaya Philippine country manager at Palo Alto Networks. “Providing the technological infrastructure for the Child Protection Platform our collaboration with PLDT and Smart and their extensive network coverage will accelerate our vision of protecting the next generation from CSAM content.”

Visaya said the Palo Alto Networks solution it provides to the PLDT and Smart Child Protection Platform has the scale and speed to integrate any future challenges that may arise in fighting perpetrators of online sexual abuse and child exploitation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNybi5jb20vbmV3cy92aXJ0dWFsaXphdGlvbi8xNS1ob3QtcHJvZHVjdHMtZnJvbS12bXdhcmUtZXhwbG9yZS0yMDIy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,15 Hot Products From VMware Explore 2022,"15 Hot Products From VMware Explore 2022 AWS Intel and Aisera were among the companies to showcase new offerings on the expo floor.

Final Thoughts

The bundling of streaming services continues as Disney+ Hulu HBO Max and discovery+ are in the midst of their own bundling efforts.

This is the natural progression of a streaming landscape that saw an initial race to market to claim cord-cutting customers turn into an effort to retain customers for the long term. Services teaming up or being consolidated by industry heavyweights is an effort to provide “value” for the price of a subscription in hopes of cementing long-term relationships with customers.

It’s harder to hit the “cancel button” on a bundle when there’s a greater chance that someone in the household is enjoying content from one of the services in the bundle.

Paramount Global which owns both Paramount+ and Showtime likely saw that Showtime had a tough road ahead as a stand-alone product as the popularity of premium cable packages wanes. Bringing it under the Paramount+ umbrella both strengthens the Paramount+ product and creates a space where Showtime can flourish in the streaming era.

The danish appeared to have been bitten into it several times which one follower pointed out writing: “So it took ar minimum 3 bites to realize the mold in it?”

Dani snapped back: “Bitch I was not looking at it.”

The receipt in the photo displayed the Starbucks store number as 27563 which the company’s customer service confirmed is likely located inside a Fort Lauderdale airport in Florida (via The Shade Room).

The Starbucks Care Twitter account has since responded to DaniLeigh’s tweet thanking her “for reaching out and bringing this to our attention.” The Starbucks representative added: “Please DM us with the provided link I’d like to get additional information regarding your experience.”

It is not clear whether DaniLeigh got her request for free Starbucks for the rest of her life but the singer did retweet the messages from Starbucks.

Elon Musk's friend David Sacks lost a bid to quash a Twitter subpoena because of his tweets.

Sacks's lawyers said the subpoena was too burdensome and duplicated a previous request.

Sacks only hired legal counsel because he told his podcast listeners he would the judge said.

One of Elon Musk's friends subpoenaed in the Twitter acquisition lawsuit has lost an appeal to quash the request because of his behavior on Twitter and his podcast a judge has ruled.

David Sacks the CEO of Craft Ventures and member of the ""PayPal mafia"" lost his appeal after being subpoenaed by Twitter for correspondence with Musk according to court documents from Chancellor Kathleen McCormick.

Sacks said on his ""All-In"" podcast on August 5 that he had been subpoenaed by the social media platform over his comments on the Twitter acquisition which he said was too broad.

""I have no involvement in this thing but they sent me the broadest ever subpoena. It's like 30 pages of requests. And now I gotta hire a lawyer to go quash this thing"" the former PayPal executive said.

Musk backed out of his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter saying he was misled on the number of fake accounts on the platform sparking suits and countersuits from the two parties. Musk appeared on Sacks's podcast in the middle of his takeover bid in May.

One of Sacks' tweets that caused his subpoena was thought to be a checklist of targets for Musk to address if and when he took control of Twitter.

Sacks a prominent venture capitalist had taken out a non-disclosure agreement to evaluate a potential investment in connection with Musk's acquisition of Twitter the filing said.

Sacks' lawyers said the Delaware requests from Twitter were inappropriate because they were ""unduly burdensome because they were duplicative of the California subpoenas and the return dates were too soon."" Sacks also complained about having to hire lawyers.

Sacks initially responded to the subpoena by tweeting a picture of a middle finger from a Mad magazine cover and posting a follow-up video from ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" of a character urinating on a subpoena.

This behavior prompted a complaint by Twitter and was cited by McCormick as the reason the subpoena could not be quashed. Sack's complaint about needing lawyers was also unnecessary she said and only appears to have occurred because Sack told his podcast listeners he would do so.

""In other circumstances I might view entirely duplicative subpoenas served for such tactical purposes as problematic. Where as here the subpoena recipient tweets the subpoenaing attorneys the middle finger and a video of someone urinating on subpoenas I am less bothered by it.







""In an apparent effort to keep Sacks's promise to his podcast listeners the movants created the very burden of which they now complain.""

McCormick's ruling may have implications for serial-tweeter Musk who has repeatedly used the platform to antagonize Twitter. Columbia Law professor Eric Talley told Insider she was likely to take antagonistic tweets into consideration in her ruling.

Whether you’re looking to consolidate your holdings on one platform or to boost your HODLing setup transferring between both platforms can be extremely useful.

In July 2022 PayPal finally released a long-awaited feature: allowing users to send crypto to external wallets. This feature wasn’t allowed a few months ago however. When PayPal decided to add support for cryptocurrencies in 2020 you could only buy and sell crypto within PayPal but not send it to external wallets.

This article will guide step-by-step on how to transfer crypto from PayPal to Coinbase and vice versa.

How to Transfer Crypto From Coinbase to PayPal

Transferring from Coinbase to PayPal is a straightforward process as outlined in the steps below:

After logging in to your PayPal account head to the crypto section on the dashboard. Select the cryptocurrency you want to receive. Click on the Transfers button —the little icon with two arrows— and then “Receive.” Complete the ID verification process (which is only necessary if you’re using the service for the first time). You will get a crypto address that you’ll use for the particular asset you want to receive. Now you have to access your Coinbase account and click on Send/Receive choose Send and select the crypto you want to transfer.

Paste the crypto address from PayPal into Coinbase’s “to” section and click on “Continue” to confirm the transaction.

That’s essentially what you have to do. As a side note: always double and triple check that the address of each particular coin is correct and that the network corresponds to each crypto. Using a mistyped address or the wrong network (for example: sending an ERC-20 (Ethereum) token to a TRC-20 (TRON) network) will result in the loss of your funds.

It’s worth pointing out that PayPal does not support every cryptoasset Coinbase does and as a result options are limited when it comes to transferring crypto from Coinbase to PayPal. Nevertheless it’s possible to transfer major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

How to Transfer From PayPal To Coinbase

The process is pretty much the same if users want to transfer from PayPal to Coinbase. In short:

Once you log in to your Coinbase account click on the Send/Receive tab at the top header and then click on Receive.

Copy the address in this case Ethereum. Head over to PayPal’s crypto section and choose the asset you want to receive. Paste the address from Coinbase and click on Continue.

Your funds should be available depending on the currency’s network congestion.

In essence you can send crypto from any personal crypto wallet to PayPal (as long as PayPal supports the currency). You just need the PayPal address and paste it into the sender’s wallet or vice versa.

While PayPal doesn’t charge fees for sending crypto to external wallets you will have to pay a network fee which PayPal will show you on the confirmation screen. Network fees depend on the network you’re using — Bitcoin network Ethereum network etc. – and are used to reward miners and validators.

FAQ

Can I Use the Same Address For Each Crypto Deposit?

It’s not recommended to re-use the same crypto address to move your funds due to security and privacy reasons. PayPal will provide you with a different address for each coin each time you want to move your funds.

Can I Send Crypto From PayPal to Any Exchange?

You can transfer crypto from PayPal to a valid wallet address whether a personal hot storage wallet or an exchange.

What Currencies Does PayPal Support?

PayPal supports four cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC). We will have to wait and see if PayPal decides to add support for more cryptoassets with its decision likely being based on a number of factors including demand from its users.

Can I Retrieve My Funds If I Send Them to the Wrong Address?

It’s highly recommended users « always triple check the address and the correct network for each coin. Note that PayPal supports each crypto on their native networks while cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase and Binance can support tokenized versions of a coin on another blockchain – for example wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on the Ethereum network.

The stock market has investors on a roller coaster of emotions in 2022. The S&P 500 index got off to its worst start since 1970 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index is down by more than 26% from the all-time high it touched in November.

Investing during volatile markets can be difficult especially when you see many of your investments declining in value. However billionaires know that down markets can present excellent opportunities. Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates the world's largest hedge fund (as ranked by assets under management) added several stocks to its portfolio in the second quarter. Here are three that caught my eye.

1. PayPal Holdings

PayPal Holdings (PYPL 1.00%) was a big winner from the pandemic which shifted many people toward greater use of digital payments. The company added over 122 million accounts in 2020 and 2021 and its revenue grew by 43%.

However 2022 has been less favorable to the payment company and management has cut its revenue guidance multiple times this year. Through the first six months of the year the company's revenue growth was 8% far below management's initial expectations for 18%. The stock price is down 70% from its all-time high. But it has attracted the interest of other billionaire investors including activist investor Elliot Investment Management.

PayPal CEO Dan Shulman called the second quarter the company's ""low-water mark for the year."" Management is looking to slash $900 million in costs this year and invest these savings into high-conviction growth opportunities to improve profit margins and increase customer engagement. The company remains a huge player in the digital payments industry and its current price has billionaires scooping up the stock. Bridgewater added over 1.1 million shares of PayPal in Q2 increasing its position by 1000%. Its stake is currently worth $116 million based on Tuesday's closing price of $91.80.

2. WisdomTree Investments

WisdomTree Investments (WT -1.71%) provides investors with exchange-traded products (ETPs) including exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Customers can buy WisdomTree's ETPs for investment exposure to equities commodities fixed income cryptocurrencies and alternative investments. It has $74.3 billion in assets under management (AUM) including $47.3 billion in U.S. ETFs.

WisdomTree is a relatively small player in the ETP industry ranking 15th in the world in a business dominated by BlackRock's iShares funds which have $3.3 trillion in AUM. Vanguard and State Street round out the top three.

Still investors piled into WisdomTree's products in the second quarter. Inflows into its products were $3.9 billion its best quarter of inflows since 2015 mainly driven by its fixed income products.

WisdomTree is in a fast-growing space but it has failed to keep pace with its bigger counterparts and Bridgewater may be betting on the company continuing to see strong inflows into its fixed-income products. In the second quarter Bridgewater Associates added more than 2 million shares of WisdomTree an investment of about $11 million based on Tuesday's closing price of $5 per share.

3. Interactive Brokers

Interactive Brokers (IBKR -0.49%) provides tech-savvy investors with electronic brokerage services allowing its customers to trade stocks options futures bonds ETFs and other products. The company has worked for over 40 years automating its trading platform and becoming a low-cost provider of broker-dealer services to investors.

In the first half of this year the company's revenue fell by 21% and its net income fell 27% due in part to tough year-over-year comparisons. Last year it experienced significant gains from selling its investment in Up Fintech Holding Limited along with active trading amid the meme stock frenzy.

On a positive note its customer accounts grew 36% from last year to 1.9 million. Growth over the last five years has been solid for the broker too with revenue and net income increasing at 15% and 25% compounded annually. In the second quarter Bridgewater added 1 million shares of Interactive Brokers bringing its total stake to $75 million based on Tuesday's closing price of $60.74 per share.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBseW1vdXRoaGVyYWxkLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvdWstd29ybGQtbmV3cy93YXJuaW5nLW5ldy1wYXlwYWwtc2NhbS1kaXNndWlzZWQtNzUzNzM1MNIBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBseW1vdXRoaGVyYWxkLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvdWstd29ybGQtbmV3cy93YXJuaW5nLW5ldy1wYXlwYWwtc2NhbS1kaXNndWlzZWQtNzUzNzM1MC5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warning as new Paypal scam is disguised as Tesco giftcard,"Get the stories that matter to our community straight to your inbox with our Daily Newsletter

Get the stories that matter to our community straight to your inbox with our Daily Newsletter

A new type of email phishing scam disguised as an enticing Tesco gift card offer is preying on shoppers during the cost of living crisis. Experts have warned this new scam could see Paypal user’s bank accounts emptied rapidly.

This latest scam emails Paypal users offering a legitimate-looking £500 Tesco voucher through a user's Paypal account. Once logged in scammers will have access to bank accounts and any cards associated with the account.

This works in the same way as the ‘Royal Mail scam’ from last year. Fraudsters text individuals posing as the Royal Mail and asking for a £1.99 payment to reschedule a delivery. Once paid scammers gain access to the Paypal account and personal information.

Naveed Islam Chief Information Security Officer at payment provider Dojo  has rounded up five top tips on spotting a phishing email: “Scammers are getting more creative with their deceit. With the rise in e-commerce accelerated by the global pandemic seasoned fraudsters are seizing the opportunity to exploit the vulnerable and less-tech savvy.”

“For the many people adopting technologies such as online banking and shopping for the first time during COVID-19 these frauds are incredibly convincing and traumatic. This rise is being monitored and managed by the UK police’s dedicated team Action Fraud.”

How to avoid the fraudsters

Check the sender’s email address

Often scammers will use a suspicious email address that includes words that don’t relate to the company they impersonate or lots of numbers.

Often scammers will use a suspicious email address that includes words that don’t relate to the company they impersonate or lots of numbers. Check for poor spelling and grammar or mistakes to the company’s name

Although some fraudulent emails are highly sophisticated many of them can be poorly worded and there are some tell-tale signs they’re not legitimate.

Check the formatting of the email

A lot of companies send legitimate emails from a templated third-party system. Your favourite brands will often spend a lot of money making their emails branded and it can be difficult for scammers to replicate these email templates.



So if you see plain-text emails with no branding – or brand logos replicated in low resolution look back at your inbox to see if this matches the company’s typical communication designs.

Don’t rush to action their demands

Often scammers thrive from creating a sense of urgency and panic from the recipient. They will use scare tactics or threatening language to make you rush into doing something.



Whether it's clicking a suspicious link or providing your personal data you should take some time to review the email and research its legitimacy before taking any actions.



If you’ve already clicked the link check the URL straight away and do not login anywhere as scammers can capture your details to take over your account.

Never send sensitive data via emails or online links from emails or SMS

If you do suspect you’ve been sent a phishing email do not click on it and try not to open the email at all - especially if you’re using your work email. Scammers often leave malicious links within the email that once clicked allow them to enter your computer’s system.



If you accidentally click on one of these emails you should change your passwords immediately and check your bank accounts regularly to make sure no money has disappeared. If this happens you should alert your bank immediately and they will guide you on further action.



If you’re concerned about your work email account or laptop you should contact your information security team straight away and flag your concerns. It’s always better to be cautious and vigilant when dealing with online security.

Contact the company implicated

Whether you’re unsure or you’re totally convinced that you’ve received a scam email pretending to be a company reach out to that company to inform them and see further information. They will be able to let you know within an instant if the communication you received was legitimate.



And often large brands will have dedicated teams investigating frauds affecting their customer base and damaging their brand reputation so they will undoubtedly appreciate any information you can provide that can stop these fraudulent activities going forward.

Naveed added: “Your bank or any other business or organisation will never ask you to share personal information over email or text. The best advice is to confirm if it’s genuine by contacting them directly using contact details from their legitimate website.

“One of the more concerning aspects about these latest scams is that scammers are making it less obvious by not informing you about fees or payment until you click through on the link meaning more people may unknowingly fall for the scam. If you have fallen victim to a scam contact your bank immediately - your bank or building society will then be able to provide specialist support from their scam unit.

“Ultimately if you have any doubt about the authenticity of a text message or email it’s probably a scam. Take a minute to think about the message - were you expecting it have you checked for spelling mistakes and double-checked the sender's address.”

Coca-Cola Co. McDonald’s Corp. Starbucks Corp. and Yum! Brands Inc. to the growing list of companies suspending some operations in Russia over that country’s invasion of Ukraine.

Ramon Laguarta chief executive officer of PepsiCo Inc. Purchase NY said in an email to employees on March 8 that the company would suspend the sale of beverages like Pepsi Cola 7UP and Mirinda as well as capital investments and all advertising in Russia.

“As a food and beverage company now more than ever we must stay true to the humanitarian aspect of our business” Mr. Laguarta wrote. “That means we have a responsibility to continue to offer our other products in Russia including daily essentials such as milk and other dairy offerings baby formula and baby food. By continuing to operate we will also continue to support the livelihoods of our 20000 Russian associates and the 40000 Russian agricultural workers in our supply chain as they face significant challenges and uncertainty ahead.”

Mr. Laguarta added that PepsiCo has suspended operations in Ukraine and is working to provide aid to Ukrainian refugees in neighboring countries through donations to aid agencies and the ramping up of production at other PepsiCo manufacturing plants in Europe.

The Coca-Cola Co. Atlanta released a brief statement March 8 that it was “suspending its businesses” in Russia but did not provide details.

McDonald’s temporarily will close all its restaurants in Russia and pause all operations in that market according to an email sent March 8 by Chris Kempczinski CEO to employees and franchises.

On the same day Kevin Johnson president and CEO of Starbucks wrote employees saying the company was suspending all business activity in Russia. The company has approximately 130 locations in the country.

“Our licensed partner has agreed to immediately pause store operations and will provide support to the nearly 2000 partners in Russia who depend on Starbucks for their livelihood” he wrote.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine also drew a reaction from Yum! Brands. The owner of the KFC Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands suspended all investment and restaurant development in Russia.

In Russia McDonald’s at the end of 2021 had 847 restaurants with 84% operated by the company. The chain had 108 in Ukraine all operated by the company. The two countries accounted for 2% of McDonald’s systemwide sales in 2021.

“We understand the impact this will have on our Russian colleagues and partners which is why we are prepared to support all three legs of the stool in Ukraine and Russia” Mr. Kempczinski said of restaurants closing in Russia. “This includes salary continuation for all McDonald’s employees in Russia.”

Chicago-based McDonald’s also is paying full salaries to Ukrainian employees has donated $5 million to an employee assistance fund and is supporting relief efforts by the International Red Cross.

“Across the rest of Europe we will stay focused on how McDonald’s can best help those in need both now and in the future” Mr. Kempczinski said. “We have already seen extraordinary leadership by our Ukrainian and Russian teams and I know the rest of the McDonald’s system stands ready to support the large number of refugees who have been displaced by this conflict.

“As we move forward McDonald’s will continue to assess the situation and determine if any additional measures are required. At this juncture it’s impossible to predict when we might be able to reopen our restaurants in Russia. We are experiencing disruptions to our supply chain along with other operational impacts. We will also closely monitor the humanitarian situation.”

Louisville Ky.-based Yum! has about 1000 KFC restaurants and 50 Pizza Hut locations in Russia. Independent operators run nearly all the restaurants under license or franchise agreements. Yum! is donating $1 million to the Red Cross is activating a disaster relief fund to support Ukrainian franchise employees and is matching donations from employees to charities providing relief in Ukraine.

“McDonald’s and other fast-food outlets are under pressure to withdraw from the Russian market” said Ramsey Baghdadi a consumer analyst for GlobalData March 8. “However this is easier said than done for the fast-food industry. Russia represents approximately 0.7% of the global fast-food restaurant’s value in 2020. Such a small proportion of value generation in Russia tells us that fears of losing sales is not the main factor at play here.

“The challenge that foodservice providers have is the very nature of their business model. Fast-food chains such as McDonald’s and KFC often have complicated agreements with their outlets as a large proportion of them are franchises and are not enterprises. So it becomes a much more challenging negotiation to completely stop operations compared to other industries.”

A GlobalData consumer survey released in March showed consumer concern for social causes however.

“As 72% of consumer purchases are driven by a brand’s ethics or support shown toward a social cause it becomes difficult for these companies to balance consumer expectations and their operational needs putting pressure on international fast-food restaurants” Mr. Baghdadi said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9jb21wYW55L2NvcnBvcmF0ZS10cmVuZHMvc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWdldHMtYS10YXN0ZS1vZi1pbmRpYS13aXRoLWxheG1hbi1uYXJhc2ltaGFuLWFzLWJvc3MvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTM5NTkxOTMuY21z0gGVAWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NvbXBhbnkvY29ycG9yYXRlLXRyZW5kcy9zdGFyYnVja3MtZ2V0cy1hLXRhc3RlLW9mLWluZGlhLXdpdGgtbGF4bWFuLW5hcmFzaW1oYW4tYXMtYm9zcy9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTM5NTkxOTMuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks gets a taste of India with Laxman Narasimhan as boss,"Empower Your Corporate Journey with Strategic Skill Courses Offering College Course Website IIM Lucknow Chief Executive Officer Programme Visit Indian School of Business ISB Chief Technology Officer Visit Indian School of Business ISB Leadership in AI Visit

On June 17 2022 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) amended the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for mRNA COVID-19 vaccines to include children aged 6 months–4 years for receipt of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) (administered as 3 doses 3 μg [0.2 mL] each) and children aged 6 months–5 years for receipt of mRNA-1273 (Moderna) (administered as 2 doses 25 μg [0.25 mL] each) (12). In preauthorization clinical trials the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was administered to 3013 children aged 6 months–4 years (3) and the Moderna vaccine was administered to 5011 children aged 6 months–5 years (4). Most adverse events reported in these trials were mild to moderate in severity and no serious vaccine-related adverse events were reported. To characterize postauthorization safety of COVID-19 vaccine primary series among young children CDC reviewed adverse events and health impacts after receipt of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines that were reported to v-safe a voluntary smartphone-based U.S. safety surveillance system established by CDC to monitor adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination (https://vsafe.cdc.gov/en/) and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) a U.S. passive vaccine safety surveillance system managed by CDC and FDA. During June 18–August 21 2022 approximately 599457children aged 6 months–4 years received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 440773 aged 6 months–5 years received the Moderna vaccine*; approximately 23266 children were enrolled in v-safe after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. The most frequent systemic reactions reported to v-safe after receipt of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines were irritability or crying among approximately one half of children aged 6 months–2 years. Among children aged ≥3 years systemic reactions after vaccination were less frequently reported; injection site pain was the most frequently reported reaction among these older children. VAERS received a total of 1017 reports of adverse events after Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccination among children aged 6 months–4 years and children aged 6 months–5 years; 998 (98.1%) events were classified as nonserious and 19 (1.9%) as serious. No reports of myocarditis after vaccination were reported. These initial safety findings are similar to those from preauthorization clinical trials (34). Health care providers and parents of young children should be aware that local and systemic reactions are expected after vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine and that serious adverse events are rare.

On June 20 2022 v-safe was modified to allow parents and guardians to enroll children aged 6 months–4 years after any mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose. Text message reminders are sent to parents or guardians to complete online health surveys for their child.† Health surveys sent in the first postvaccination week include questions about local injection site and systemic reactions (i.e. mild moderate or severe) and health impacts.§ Specific questions were included for children aged 6 months–2 years who might not be able to describe reactions or who might experience reactions that are different from those experienced by children aged ≥3 years.¶ CDC’s v-safe call center contacts registrants who indicate that medical care was received after vaccination and encourages completion of a VAERS report.

VAERS is a national passive vaccine safety surveillance system managed by CDC and FDA that monitors adverse events after vaccination (5). VAERS accepts reports of postvaccination adverse events from health care providers vaccine manufacturers and members of the public.** Signs symptoms and diagnostic findings in VAERS reports are assigned Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities preferred terms (MedDRA PTs) by VAERS staff.†† Reports of serious events to VAERS§§ were reviewed by CDC and FDA physicians to form a consensus clinical impression based on available data. Using selected MedDRA PTs a search was performed to identify possible cases of myocarditis a rare adverse event that has been associated with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (6).

Local and systemic reactions and health impacts reported to v-safe during the week after vaccination were described for children aged 6 months–4 years who received Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and children aged 6 months–5 years who received Moderna vaccine during June 18–August 21 2022. VAERS reports were described by serious and nonserious status demographic characteristics and MedDRA PTs. Analyses were conducted using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute); p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. These surveillance activities were reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶¶",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YWxncmVlbnNib290c2FsbGlhbmNlLmNvbS9uZXdzLW1lZGlhL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzLzIwMjIvd2FsZ3JlZW5zLW5vdy1vZmZlcmluZy1hcHBvaW50bWVudHMtZm9yLXVwZGF0ZWQtY292aWQtMTktcGZpemVyLWFuZC1tb2Rlcm5hLWJvb3N0ZXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walgreens Now Offering Appointments for Updated COVID-19 Pfizer and Moderna Boosters,"DEERFIELD Ill.

In his LinkedIn post Varma mentioned excitement for the new chapter and continued inspiration from his former rare disease colleagues. “I will always root for rare disease and remember I won’t be going very far” he wrote.

Varma has been at Pfizer for 21 years and served as head of a number of sectors including consumer healthcare and hospital business.

The rare disease department is now led by Kevin Sullivan who is currently global specialty care president the Pfizer spokesperson told Fierce Pharma.

“Pfizer has made a series of leadership moves within its commercial structure to best facilitate its primary goal swiftly delivering breakthroughs that change patients’ lives while also continuing to provide colleagues with opportunities for growth and development” the spokesersperson said.

Pfizer's oncology portfolio is in need of some rejuvenation lately. Its flagship breast cancer drug Ibrance is under pressure from newer CDK4/6 inhibitors from Novartis and Eli Lilly. And the drug just failed to extend lives in newly diagnosed HR-positive HER2-negative breast cancer in the final analysis of a long phase 3 trial.

In the hot immuno-oncology space Pfizer's Merck KGaA-partnered PD-L1 inhibitor Bavencio has basically only managed to carve out a bladder cancer niche. The New York pharma is also late to the cell therapy race—if it can get to the finish line at all—and it doesn't have much in the antibody-drug conjugate approach which has lately gained steam.

By comparison Pfizer's rare disease portfolio is thriving. The company's Vyndaqel/Vyndamax franchise in transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis is on a fast-growth trajectory. And Pfizer is in the process of buying out sickle cell disease specialist Global Blood Therapeutics for $5.4 billion beating out Johnson & Johnson in a bidding war.

Varma's and Schmeltz's changes came just as Pfizer has brought on Andreas “Drew” Panayiotou as biopharma global chief marketing officer.

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

The first thing Hidalgo was asked elicited some laughter from the live audience to nobody’s surprise.

Hidalgo is appointment viewing on and off the court.

“My teammates call me a gnat because I’m all over them” Hidalgo said when asked if she has a go-to nickname.

There were a couple other quick-hitting questions thrown Hidalgo’s way. She said the high point of her career so far was Notre Dame winning the ACC Tournament in March. The low point was Notre Dame losing to Oregon State in the Sweet 16. She gave props to her parents and coaches for getting her to where she is today.

Here’s everything else Hidalgo said at the summit.

On arriving at Notre Dame and becoming one of the best players in the country as a true freshman…

“I know what God instilled in me. I know the gifts that he’s placed in me even from a young age. I’m big on my faith. I know God as blessed me with a talent so it’s so easy to be able to just go out there and just play my game. Also I have coaches and teammates that have so much confidence in me. When they tell me to go score the ball we need you to score we need you to play defense like you do it just makes everything so easy to just go out and do it when they give you the keys to do so.”

On Notre Dame head coach Niele Ivey being a players’ coach…

“It’s definitely a blessing to be able to have that connection with your coach to be able to go to her and say ‘This isn’t working’ or ‘What do you see? I don’t know what to do in this situation.’ It just makes the game so much easier and it makes me as a player want to run through a wall for a coach like that who gives everything and instills everything in you. It’s truly a blessing to be able to have that connection with her.”

On Notre Dame’s chances of winning the national title in the next few seasons…

“Absolutely. Absolutely. Not to be cocky but we have a lot of talent. Women’s basketball in general has a lot of talent. You can find it all over. But we have a lot of injuries coming back and transfers especially players like Olivia Miles coming back. A lot of people might have forgotten but she’s going to come back and shock the world with the talent she has. Emma Risch Cassandre Prosper. We just have so much firepower coming back. It’s going to be exciting.”

On someone she looks up to…

“[Skylar Diggins-Smith] for sure. Obviously she went to Notre Dame but she is just a dog on the court. Her being a smaller guard and just the defensive firepower that she brings I’m able to look at that and kind of model my game after that.”

More on what Ivey means to her…

“Just to persevere. Obviously Coach Ivey went through some stuff during the season and just to be able to see her come out on the court with all the stuff that she had gone through and was still going through and still to be able to come to practices and talk to recruits even through everything that she had been through it was amazing to see. I saw how much she persevered through all the stuff she was going through.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmNpbm5hdGkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWFwcGVhbHMtYnJpYmVyeS1leHRvcnRpb24tY29udmljdGlvbnMvNzM2MjY1NjAwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PG Sittenfeld appeal: What's criminal when it comes to campaign contributions?,"An attorney for P.G. Sittenfeld asked a federal appeals court on Thursday to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion saying he didn't commit a crime.

If the convictions are allowed to stand attorney Yaakov Roth told a three-judge panel during oral arguments it could expose every elected official in the country to prosecution for accepting campaign contributions.

Sittenfeld a former Cincinnati city councilman was found guilty of the charges in 2022 and sentenced last year to 16 months in prison. He's five months into that sentence now. But he is appealing his convictions and the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments Thursday.

The roughly 40-minute hearing took place in a courtroom packed with Sittenfeld supporters as well as attorneys interested in the outcome of the appeal which partly centers on what is corrupt when it comes to a politician accepting campaign contributions.

Sittenfeld himself was not in the courtroom.

Roth began his argument by pointing to amicus briefs filed by 16 former federal public corruption prosecutors as well as a bipartisan group of former attorneys general and federal judges.

All of them Roth said are trying ""to tell this court that something has gone wrong.""

Judges question both sides

The judges − John Bush John Nalbandian and Eric Murphy − continuously asked questions of both sides throughout.

Many questions focused on whether Sittenfeld's actions were sufficient to be considered crimes. The judges also asked about topics that were raised repeatedly throughout the trial and in post-trial court filings.

Some questions centered on whether there was clear and unambiguous evidence of an exchange of money for official action − a quid pro quo.

At one point Nalbandian pointed out that Sittenfeld had promised to ""deliver the votes"" and get a ""veto-proof majority"" of City Council to support a development project in exchange for a $20000 donation to his political action committee.

Why couldn't the jury conclude that was evidence of corruption? he asked Roth.

Roth responded that prosecutors had strung together Sittenfeld's statements ""to make it into something it's not.""

Judges focus on conversation with developer

Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Singer spent much of his 15 minutes of argument time responding to questions from the judges.

Two judges asked specifically about a recorded conversation between Sittenfeld and a local developer during which they talked about supporting Sittenfeld's then-planned mayoral campaign.

As Sittenfeld and the developer Chinedum Ndukwe talked about campaign donations Sittenfeld said: ""You don't want me … to be like 'Hey Chin like love you but can't.'""

Prosecutors at trial said Sittenfeld was threatening to withhold support for the project unless Ndukwe contributed. But Roth argued that the statement wasn't sufficient evidence of a crime and said it seemed as if prosecutors had stopped focusing on it.

During arguments Thursday Nalbandian asked Singer if prosecutors were ""running away"" from the ""love you but can't"" comment.

Singer said the statement was one part of a ""corrupt solicitation"" that involved multiple statements. It was ""evidence the jury could consider"" he said.

What's next

A decision is not expected to come for some time possibly not until after Sittenfeld completes his prison term.

Roth on Thursday asked the court to consider releasing him from prison while it considers the appeal. The judges did not indicate whether they will consider that. The decision impacts Sittenfeld's future because a felony conviction prevents him from holding public office ever again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0aWNvLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9maW5hbmNlLzIwMjQvZmlubGV0ZS1vZmZlcnMtcGctdmVyc2lvbi1vZi1vbmx5ZmFucy10aHJvdWdoLWF0aGxldGUtaW52ZXN0aW5nLTEyMzQ3NzgyNTUv0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3BvcnRpY28uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2ZpbmFuY2UvMjAyNC9maW5sZXRlLW9mZmVycy1wZy12ZXJzaW9uLW9mLW9ubHlmYW5zLXRocm91Z2gtYXRobGV0ZS1pbnZlc3RpbmctMTIzNDc3ODI1NS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Finlete Offers ‘PG Version of OnlyFans’ as Pro Investing Grows,"Rob Connolly’s first athlete-related start-up was Meetlete a sports-star version of Cameo. Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDE5LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L3BnLXNpdHRlbmZlbGQtY29ycnVwdGlvbi1jYXNlLWZlZGVyYWwtYXBwZWFscy1jb3VydC1oZWFyLWFyZ3VtZW50cy10aHVyc2RheS_SAXxodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxOS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWNvcnJ1cHRpb24tY2FzZS1mZWRlcmFsLWFwcGVhbHMtY291cnQtaGVhci1hcmd1bWVudHMtdGh1cnNkYXkvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P.G. Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

I loved it. But something didn’t click. In the lab I was clumsy nervous and honestly a bit terrified of some of the experiments which variously involved chemicals that could burn you blind you or turn you radioactive. But although I may not have been cut out for a career at the laboratory bench I never lost my fascination with scientific research and its power in helping us understand the processes that drive all living things.

When I joined the Bureau I quickly noticed the parallels between investigative journalism and academic research. Like scientists investigative journalists work on a hypothesis-based approach. As Mark Lee Hunter and Luuk Sengers write “Every investigation begins with a question and a hypothesis is a provisional answer to that question.”

Just as a researcher in a lab conducts experiments and analyses the results a journalist undertakes reporting to uncover information. This is not about collecting the evidence to support your hypothesis but collecting evidence weighing it up and testing it to see whether it supports the hypothesis.

Whatever the investigation we collaborate and work closely with experts in different fields – people who are open and generous with their time experience and knowledge. And we make use of data and work that others have done.

For one Big Tobacco investigation we published recently though evidence was thin on the ground. We couldn’t find many scientific papers on the topic that were independent of the tobacco industry.

For many swimming in college is a lifelong dream that is pursued with dedication and determination. Fitter and Faster is proud to honor these athletes and those who supported them on their journey.

Noah Sech from San Clemente California has announced his verbal commitment to the application process* at Princeton University. He will join the class of 2027 with Ethan Harrington Connor Buck Daniel Li and Parker Lenoce next fall.

He told SwimSwam:

“Academics and learning have always been as important to me as swimming. I was looking for a school that had a combination of excellent academics and a swim team with high aspirations. After meeting Matt and Abby and listening to their explanation of the team’s culture and goals Princeton became my top choice. I was elated when given the opportunity to verbally commit to the application process.”

Sech is a senior at San Clemente High School. He swims club with Mission Viejo Nadadores and has been on an absolute tear this year. Coming into the SCY season with only two Futures cuts (LCM 200 free and 400 IM) he competed at Carlsbad Sectionals and went best times in the 200 free (1:42.13) 500 free (4:38.08) 1000 free (9:46.15) 200 IM (1:51.49) and 400 IM (4:00.63). Then came high school season where he earned his first Summer and Winter Juniors cuts winning the 100 breast and 200 IM at the league championship meet and breaking school records with new PBs of 55.38 and 1:50.10. A few days later he placed 5th in the 100 breast (56.16) and 6th in the 200 IM (1:49.90) at CIF-SS Division I Championships. After California CIF State Championships where he came in 12th in the IM Sech swam at a series of meets in Southern California (Grand Challenge PSS Mission Viejo So Cal Invite – where he went a 1:02.93 PB in the 100 breast) eventually obtaining two Senior Nationals cuts. At Phillips 66 Nationals he finaled in the 100/200 breast and 400 IM and walked away with PBs in the 200 breast (2:17.22) 200 IM (2:06.02) and 400 IM (4:30.25).

Sech told SwimSwam that until 2021 he had focused mainly on 500 free and 200/400 IM. But in refining his breaststroke with Coach Jonny Dray he found a new main event. After his outstanding long course season Sech hopes to build on his success in SCY. So far his best times are:

100 breast – 55.38

200 IM – 1:49.90

400 IM – 4:00.63

100 free – 47.48

200 free – 1:42.13

500 free – 4:38.08

Sech is bilingual (English/Spanish) plays the piano and loves to surf. When he is not swimming himself he is on the sidelines cheering for his nine-year-old sister “who just completed her first Summer Junior Olympics and dropped time in all of her events!”

U.S. operators have shown restraint but according to World Oil’s mid-year forecast a further activity increase is in the offing.

The war in Ukraine has limited Russian oil and gas supplies and has the potential to cause a major shift in the world’s energy market. No one knows how long Russia intends to wage war in Ukraine or how much of its crude will be affected by sanctions or for how long. The uncertainty caused by the supply disruption has driven crude prices to multi-year highs. And anxieties persist that surging oil prices may rise so high that demand destruction will damage the global economy and cause a worldwide recession. However Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is creating a new market for U.S. LNG producers as product flows to Europe to replace Russian natural gas. The longer the conflict persists the more entrenched U.S. LNG will become.

ESG impact. Although the U.S. petroleum industry faces continued pressure from President Biden and environmental groups about the imperative of reducing fossil fuel usage to slow GHG emissions the drive for rapid implementation has lessened. However the transition to renewables and clean energy alternatives has created an unprecedented reduction of investment in hydrocarbon-based energy in favor of developing green resources. During 2021 global oil and gas discoveries hit their lowest level in 75 years. Total global discovered volumes in 2021 were calculated at 4.7 Bboe the lowest tally since 1946. This trend is predicted to continue in 2022. A data-based comparison shows a significant reduction in recoverable oil resources that will drive commodity prices higher and further damage global energy security.

U.S. production surges. Despite a sizeable drop in recoverable resources U.S. oil production remains on track for a record in 2023 even as output grows more slowly than anticipated amid increased costs and labor shortages in America’s shale fields. Output is expected to expand at an average 840000 bopd next year down from a prior forecast of 860000 bopd according to the EIA. While production is still seen reaching an all-time high in 2023 the government revised its forecast slightly lower to 12.7 MMbopd. The current annual U.S. record average is 12.3 MMbopd set in 2019.

At the start of the year production in the U.S. (11.7 MMbopd) Saudi Arabia (10.2 MMbopd) and Russia (11.0 MMbopd) was running at nearly full capacity. Brent and WTI were trading at $86.51/bbl and $83.22 respectively. When Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 2022 the EU and international community reacted quickly by boycotting Russian supply. The embargo quickly pushed prices up and in June Brent was trading for $122.71/bbl and WTI hit $114.84/bbl the highest price since August 2008. Prices retreated in July down to $111.93/bbl for Brent and $101.62/bbl for WTI due to rising interest rates and fear of economic recession despite restricted Russian supply.

Demand to lessen. The global surge in the cost of fuel is starting to weigh on demand according to Vitol Group the world’s largest independent oil trader. Consumers are being impacted by the run-up in gasoline diesel and other oil products said Mike Muller head of Vitol Asia. There is clear evidence of economic stress being caused by high oil and natural gas prices according to Muller.

MACRO U.S. PICTURE

The Baker Hughes rotary rig count stood at 588 units during the week ending Jan. 7 2022. U.S. drilling activity climbed steadily for the next seven months although it slowed in July and August reaching 760 in the week ending Sept. 2 Fig. 1. Although the 172-rig increase represents a Jan.-Sept. increase of 29% U.S. shale operators have resisted ramping-up drilling activity and remained relatively disciplined with their capital expenditures. The speed at which new rigs have been deployed to the field is considerably less than in previous up-price cycles. Most U.S. shale companies are still being conservative as priorities remain focused on protecting balance sheets and generating free cash flow.

This conservative approach along with high oil prices has enabled shale companies to reduce their debt burdens in the second quarter signaling room for them to pay dividends buy back shares or make acquisitions. A metric commonly used to measure companies’ ability to pay down their borrowings has widely improved among oil and gas producers as they repurchase some bonds and pile up cash amid ballooning profits.

Net debt reported by a group of independent operators including ConocoPhillips and Pioneer Natural Resources averaged less than 0.6 times their annual earnings before items such as interest and taxes in the second quarter down from 1.7 times a year earlier. Many companies have reached their debt target. Energy companies have made great strides toward repairing and reinforcing their balance sheets and are in a much stronger position to handle another downturn in commodity prices.

With WTI trading between $85/bbl and $95/bbl U.S. shale producers are on course to generate $200 billion this year enough to make the industry debt-free by 2024 and potentially fund a pivot toward more natural gas production (Deloitte). High oil prices and disciplined capital spending mean U.S. shale producers are on track for their most profitable year on record part of a global trend that will see the oil and gas industry generate a record $1.4 trillion of free cash flow. After paying down debt and rewarding shareholders U.S. producers will likely focus more on natural gas production due to high demand and prices around the world. Producers will also make record profits from U.S. LNG operations. They are expected to generate $59 billion this year double last year’s amount and easily recouping the $45 billion of losses from 2013 to 2020.

OVERALL U.S. FORECAST

Due to sustained higher oil prices World Oil forecasts a noticeable uptick in drilling activity for the remainder of the year projecting 18600 total wells for 2022—a 34% increase from the 2021 count of 13877 Table 1. Total footage is projected to increase from 191.5 MMft in 2021 to 256.4 MMft in 2022—an increase of 34%. During 2022 8769 wells are estimated to have been drilled during the first six months while 9831 are expected to spud in the second half of the year for a half-to-half increase of 12.1%. A 14.9% increase in footage is expected in the last six months.

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS

Oil prices have been rising since the start of 2021 bolstered by restricted Russian supplies and recovering demand. However upstream M&A activity which typically follows oil prices remains well below pre-pandemic levels. The total count and value of U.S. upstream deals during the first eight months of 2021 were down 30% and 46% respectively from the same period in 2019.

While the ongoing capital discipline of operating companies is the primary reason behind the slowdown in upstream M&A activity limited visibility of buyers into the carbon profile of sellers’ assets is a growing factor. Companies pursuing their net-zero goals are either looking to acquire low-carbon-intensity barrels or divest the high-intensity ones implying that there might be an acreage consolidation or portfolio restructuring on the horizon (Deloitte). But a large resource size and an attractive offering price may not be enough to elicit a response from a buyer focused on meeting its net-zero targets. Therefore M&A activities would need not only to be financially accretive but also to support ESG goals.

Devon Energy agreed to acquire Validus Energy for $1.8 billion in cash to expand in the Eagle Ford shale play in South Texas. The deal will add to Devon’s cash flow and earnings in the first year and boost its variable dividend by up to 10% based on current oil futures prices. Devon also said the transaction will enable the acceleration of the return of cash to investors via its existing $2 billion stock buyback program. Buying Validus will add 42000 net acres adjacent to Devon’s existing leasehold in the Eagle Ford. Validus’s production is approximately 35000 boed with volumes expected to increase to 40000 boed over the next year.

EQT to buy Marcellus assets. EQT Corp the largest U.S. natural gas producer agreed to acquire THQ Appalachia a privately held company in a $5.2 billion deal to expand holdings in the Marcellus shale. The company purchased the assets from Alta Resources for $2.9 billion. It also acquired Chevron’s assets in Appalachia for $735 million in 2020. THQ Appalachia produces nearly 800 MMcfgd in West Virginia. The company has about 11 years of inventory at maintenance capital levels. EQT is expected to produce the equivalent of 5.5 Bcfd this year.

OFS COSTS ARE UP

Heading into 2022 most operators expected pricing to increase for nearly all service lines but seismic. Labor tubulars fracturing/stimulation and transportation were the areas of greatest concern. A modest 15% expected pricing to remain stable including nearly 39% for completion equipment 35% for other services and 33% for drilling. Further pricing concessions were expected by a modest few for seismic services and tubulars.

Further pricing increases are expected in the second half of 2022 with limited availability of OCTG and casing potentially curtailing spending revisions. Overall spending in OFS is expected to remain about 25% below 2019 levels until 2025. With margins at the mercy of another price cycle and reduced spending many OFS companies are crafting a new strategy for the future of energy. With a broadening decarbonization mandate across industries companies have an opportunity to lead the way for customers by fully re-engineering traditional OFS business models and solutions outside the traditional oilfield services and to other industries.

Many large service providers have diversified beyond core services. One large company has restructured its business by launching cloud and edge computing services whose rate of growth is expected to outpace that of their O&G business in a few years. Similarly Halliburton and Baker Hughes are partnering with start-ups and academic institutions through their Halliburton Labs and Baker Hughes Energy Innovation Center respectively to accelerate technology development for diverse energy and industrial applications.

However digitalization will only help to a certain extent. Providing integrated solutions for decarbonizing upstream projects implementing subscription-based revenue models or diversifying into the low-carbon space such as hydrogen and CCUS are key to future growth.

LEASING DECLINES

The number of licensed blocks and total acreage fell to near all-time lows as the sector struggles to shake off the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing oil market crash (Rystad). Only 21 leasing rounds were completed globally through August this year half of the 42 rounds held in the first eight months of 2021. The acreage awarded so far this year has shrunk to a 20-year low of 320000 km2. Global leasing rounds are expected to total 44 this year 14 less than in 2021 and the lowest level since 2000.

Global spending on exploration has been falling in recent years as oil and gas companies seek to limit risk by focusing on core producing assets and regions with guaranteed output aiming to streamline their operations and build a more resilient business amid market uncertainty and the threat of a recession. The political landscape is also contributing to the decrease in license awards with many governments pausing or halting leases and encouraging companies to wrap up exploration activity within already awarded blocks. This trend is likely to continue as governments are less eager to invest in fossil fuel production and instead look ahead to a net zero future.

The onshore exploration sector is a significant contributor to the decline in awarded acreage. Total onshore acreage awarded in leasing activity has plummeted from more than 560000 km2 in 2019 to a mere 115000 km2 so far this year. Offshore leased acreage hit a high point in 2019 before dropping off a cliff in 2020 and has remained relatively flat in the past two years. Concluded leasing rounds have dropped significantly in the U.S. driven primarily by the cancellation of Lease Sales 259 and 261 in the Gulf of Mexico and Cook Inlet in Alaska.

EMPLOYMENT

Employment in the U.S. oilfield services and equipment sector rose by an estimated 6865 jobs to 648914 in August according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and analysis by the Energy Workforce & Technology Council. Gains in August make OFS employment the highest since the Covid-19 pandemic began but they are still off the pre-pandemic mark in February 2020 of 706528. Overall U.S. employers added 315000 jobs down from July numbers but still representing a strong pace of growth.

CAPEX FORECAST

North American spending is forecast to increase 33% from 2021 levels which is an acceleration from 20.6% growth projected in a December survey and builds on the modest 1% increase experienced in 2021 according to James West senior managing director at Evercore ISI. The increase is driven by a 1260 bps acceleration in the U.S. to 36% growth which more than offset a 2.8% decline in spending in 2021 excluding the historical capex of distressed companies that have since been acquired or privatized. Private and independent operators are leading the recovery with capex accelerating by 1440 bps and 1550 bps from the December survey to 56% and 42% respectively and also accelerating from 41% and 5% growth in 2021. More modest growth of 25% and 19% are anticipated from the majors and NOCs both of which contracted further in 2021.

While the majors have more than offset declines in 2021 despite recent divestitures—with Evercore’s projected 2022 spending nearly 7% above 2020 levels—spending from the NOCs remains 25% lower to account for less than 1% of total U.S. spending (vs. almost 2% in 2020). Overall the majors account for almost 30% of U.S. capex down from 36% in 2020 while the independents including privates account for 70% of all spending up from 62%. U.S. capex is on track to recover within 25% of pre-pandemic levels and approach levels last seen in 2009 before the start of the oil shale revolution.

There could be modest upside to NAM spending in in the second half of 2022 with current spot prices above the $84/Bbl WTI and $5.18/MMbtu HH average basis for establishing 2022 budgets. While half of survey respondents would maintain their budget regardless of changes in the oil and gas price one-third are willing to flex capex higher for rising cash flow. However Evercore believes upside is likely to remain muted as activity could be constrained by the availability of goods services and labor.

Operators have been highly disciplined over the past year as commodity prices increased. Yet a new round of consolidation may drive spending higher if commodity prices stabilize at a significantly higher range and confidence in the duration of the cycle increases. From a lower base Evercore believes the set-up is positive for growth in 2023 and beyond.

EIA FORECAST

The EIA’s Short-Term Energy Outlook published September 2022 reports that STEO is subject to heightened uncertainty resulting from Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and how sanctions affect Russia’s oil production. Also contributing to uncertainty is the production decisions of OPEC+ the rate at which U.S. oil and natural gas production rises and other contributing factors. Less robust economic activity in the STEO forecast could result in lower-than-expected energy consumption.

Oil price forecast. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has resulted in shifting trade patterns leaving Europe to find substitutes for Russia’s oil. This change has driven up the price of Brent contracts to a level high enough to reduce Asia’s imports of Brent and to retain more oil in Europe. EIA forecasts the spot price of Brent crude will average $98/bbl in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $97/bbl in 2023. The possibility of petroleum supply disruptions and slower-than-expected crude oil production growth continues to create the potential for higher oil prices while the possibility of slower-than-forecast economic growth creates the potential for lower prices.

Crude production forecast. U.S. crude oil production is forecast to average 11.8 MMbopd in 2022 and 12.6 MMbopd during 2023 which would set a record for the most U.S. oil output during a year. The current record is 12.3 MMbopd set in 2019.

Natural gas prices. In August the Henry Hub spot price averaged $8.80/MMBtu up from $7.28/MMBtu in July. Natural gas prices rose in August because of continued strong demand for natural gas in the electric power sector which has kept natural gas inventories below their five-year (2017–2021) average. EIA expects HH price to average $9/MMBtu in in the fourth quarter of 2022 and then fall to an average $6/MMBtu in 2023 as U.S. natural gas production rises.

Natural gas production. Dry natural gas production has been rising relatively steadily since the first quarter of 2022 when it averaged 94.6 Bcfd. EIA forecasts U.S. natural gas production to average 99.0 Bcfd during fourth-quarter 2022 and then rise to 100.4 Bcfd in 2023.

U.S. FORECAST

Given the restricted Russian supply demand recovery and resulting increase in crude prices operators working the various U.S. plays plan to noticeably increase drilling activity for the remainder of 2022. Overall activity in the Texas shale plays will improve in the second half of the year with the exception of District 7B District 8 and District 8A which will suffer slight second-half losses. However drilling on the Texas side of the Haynesville is projected to improve 26% on a y-o-y basis. Gulf of Mexico activity will increase 8.4% but a decline of 70% is forecast offshore California both on a y-o-y basis.

Gulf of Mexico. Higher oil prices should help boost activity slightly in the GOM and it appears that offshore operators are poised to resume limited development in 2022-2023 after last year’s decline Fig. 3. World Oil’s survey results and federal officials’ predicted well counts show a slight increase during second-half 2022. World Oil forecasts that GOM activity totaled 63 wells in the first half of the year with another 65 scheduled to be drilled during second-half 2022. The projected 128-well total will be 8.4% higher than 2021’s figure of 118. Footage drilled should be up 6.6% on a y-o-y basis.

STATE-BY-STATE OUTLOOK

Texas. Most of the shale plays in the Lone Star State are gaining ground during 2022. On a half-over-half basis World Oil predicts Texas wells will gain 11.6% with the 2022 total being 39% more than the 2021 figure. In the Permian basin (Fig. 4) District 8 will be up 8% in the second half buts its total will be 26% higher than wells drilled in 2021. Districts 7C and 8A will enjoy much-improved drilling activity with gains of 33% and 172% respectively compared to their 2021 totals.

The Eagle Ford forecast is also good with District 1 forecast to improve 30% in the second half and up 64% on a y-o-y basis. District 2 will experience a 4% gain in activity in the second half and is also projected to be up 26% on a y-o-y basis. District 4 in the Eagle Ford will experience a 47% increase between the two halves and post a massive 157% gain from 2021’s level. The reason that District 4 is surging is more gas-related activity. Of the 12 Railroad Districts 10 are forecast to experience gains with only two losing ground on a half-over-half basis. Again more gas drilling is a factor especially in RRC 6 with the Haynesville up 36% y-o-y.

DUC wells decline. According to EIA’s July 2022 tally the DUC total stood at 4277 a reduction of 1680 wells since July 2021 a reduction of 28%. In the Permian basin operators have completed 1092 DUC wells during the July 2022-July 2021 interval a reduction of 48%. All other regions declined too with the exception of the Haynesville which added 80 DUC wells up to 477 a y-o-y increase of 20%.

Oklahoma. Although the SCOOP and STACK plays are not as prolific as the Permian or Eagle Ford acreage in Kingfisher Canadian Blaine and Grady counties continues to attract interest for hydrocarbon development. But the region’s inconsistent geology and less-than-ideal shale formations have produced unpredictable results reducing ROI. However with higher oil prices the plays have become more attractive and we predict a major increase in Oklahoma’s activity. World Oil forecasts companies will drill 79% more wells in 2022 than last year’s total. Total footage will also surge forward 75% with operators making 15.7 MMft of hole.

Louisiana. In the state’s northern portion we forecast operators developing Haynesville shale gas will drill 25% more wells in 2022 than they did in 2021 with total footage up approximately 17%. With natural gas prices at near-record highs the increase in activity could continue similar to the Haynesville play in Texas RRC District 6. Despite near-record high natural gas prices DUCs in the Haynesville were up to 477 in July a jump of 20%. In the mature shallow oil plays of southern Louisiana we expect operators to drill 46% more wells compared to last year. Well footage is expected to increase 29% on a y-o-y basis.

North Dakota. The Bakken is running out of steam. Although transportation issues remain a challenge in this oil-rich shale play a greater concern is that the sweet spot has reached maximum infill development Fig. 5. However higher oil prices will help negate the cost of drilling the 21100-ft wells. Considering these factors along with data from state officials and World Oil operator surveys we forecast that drilling will be up a disappointing 4% with footage increasing 2.9% y-o-y in the Peace Garden State.

Northeast (Pa./W.V./Ohio). In the Northeast Marcellus activity is on an upward trend similar to other U.S. shale plays Fig. 6. Improving natural gas prices and increased LNG exports from Dominion Energy’s massive Cove Point facility are helping drive activity higher in the region. According to survey results operators tapping the high-quality reservoir in Pennsylvania will increase the number of wells drilled this year by 18% compared to the number drilled in 2021. Total footage for 2022 is forecast to jump 16.5%.

In Ohio operators working the Utica play plan to focus on growth and capitalize on higher gas prices with this year’s total well count expected to finish 30% higher than last year’s level. Footage is forecast to increase 31%. In West Virginia World Oil forecasts operators will drill 84 more wells than the number spudded in 2021 up 62%. We also forecast a 64% surge in total footage in the Mountain State. Despite surging gas prices operators working the shale fields of Appalachia were able to reduce the region’s DUC count by only eight wells in July on a y-o-y basis a reduction of just 11%.

Midwest (Illinois/Kansas). There are approximately 32100 oil and gas wells 10500 Class II injection wells and 1750 gas storage wells producing from 650 fields in Illinois. These wells are controlled by 1500 operators. There is oil production in 40 of the 102 counties mainly in the southern part of the state. Drilling will surge with a 61% increase in wells forecast for 2022 compared to 2021’s level. Although the wells are relatively shallow they provide work for the oilfield community and the drilling crews. We forecast a 59% jump in total footage.

In Kansas much of the shallow drilling in the Hugoton basin appears to stay below the Baker Hughes rig count radar. But according to the Kansas Corporation Commission drilling in the Sunflower State is projected to increase 24% in 2022 compared to the 1005 drilled in 2021. Total footage is forecast to jump 24%.

Rocky Mountains. The Denver Julesburg basin has experienced a constant decline since production peaked in November 2019. Reversing this trend will depend on the capital allocation from major operators in the region. The DJ basin accounted for 7% of oil and 6.6% of natural gas production in the Lower 48 in 2021 (GlobalData). While other U.S. basins have increased their rig count with the rise in commodity prices. Operators like Oxy and Chevron are earning better returns from investments in other basins but could grow production in the DJ by completing their DUC backlog.

In Colorado officials continue to attempt to ban or severely limit drilling in the state. In 2019 the state passed Senate Bill 118 “which fundamentally altered the oil and gas industry’s future in the state” according to Colorado Governor Jared Polis. However it appears companies intend to push back and continue operations on existing leases as World Oil expects operators in Colorado to drill 40% more wells in 2022 compared to activity during 2021. Total footage is projected to increase by 40% on a y-o-y basis.

In 2019 a federal judge ordered a halt to exploration on 300000 acres in Wyoming saying the government must account for its cumulative effect on climate change. The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by a pair of environmental groups challenging the BLM’s decision to lease federal lands for energy development in the state. Given that nearly 50% of all lands in Wyoming are owned by the federal government a ban on federal leasing would decimate the natural gas industry and Wyoming’s economy. Despite the ongoing lawsuit operators working in the state plan to increase drilling activity by 24% in 2022. World Oil predicts footage will increase 25%.

Canadian Overseas Petroleum received a resource report prepared by Ryder Scott that confirmed its deep oil discovery on lands in Converse and Natrona counties Wyoming. The report confirms the deep discovery has total original oil in place of 993.5 MMbbl. This supports the company’s conclusion that the Frontier 2 and Dakota discoveries are large stratigraphic oil accumulations encompassing the reserves at the company’s Cole Creek field. The report outlines 118 horizontal well locations to exploit the identified Frontier 2 and Dakota reserves. COPL plans to drill one Frontier 1 well and two horizontal Frontier 2 wells as part of its 2022-2023 drilling campaign commencing in fourth-quarter 2022.

Acreage in New Mexico has become as desirable as land on the Texas side of the Permian basin. Increased completion efficiencies in the Bone Springs formation will help support activity as drilling in the Land of Enchantment is forecast to increase 23% on a half-over-half basis and 30% y-o-y for 2022. Total footage will increase 33% y-o-y.

In California we expect onshore operators to spud four fewer wells in 2022 compared to 2021. But with no new discoveries operators working the Golden State are forced to survive by maintaining less-attractive heavy oil fields and residual acreage from long-ago discoveries. However considering the mature nature of these fields onshore footage is forecast to climb 15% (y-o-y) suggesting deeper total depths as operators squeeze out more oil from these old fields. Drilling offshore California will drop dramatically with only three wells expected in 2022 a y-o-y decline of 70%. Accordingly footage is forecast to drop 65%.

In Alaska the U.S. DOJ filed a brief defending the Willow project an energy development within the NPRA on Alaska’s North Slope that has been halted by litigation. The Biden administration announced it would review the Willow plan approved in 2020 by the Trump administration for consistency. The project is proposed by ConocoPhillips and if approved the project will provide 100000 bopd $10 billion in revenue for state local and federal governments during its lifespan 2000 construction jobs and 300 permanent jobs. It appears the prospect of opening new acreage is having the desired effect. Offshore work will surge 109% in 2022 12 more than spud in 2021. Onshore activity on the North Slope is projected to increase 67% with total footage up 67%.

Others. Activity in non-core producing states will also enjoy a jump in activity. Drilling will increase on a y-o-y basis in Alabama Arkansas Montana Nebraska and New York.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Report of woman handing out money leads to bank robber's arrest

A 43-year-old woman was sentenced Friday to 63 months in federal prison for robbing a Denver bank less than a year ago.

Georgiana Jones's arrest was helped greatly by a tipster who told an undercover officer that a woman was ""handing out money"" to tenants at an East Colfax motel in the days following the robbery.

The woman bragged to those tenants as she passed out the money that she had recently robbed a bank according to the case's arrest affidavit.

The robber entered the PNC Bank on northeast of the Cherry Creek shopping district at around 9 a.m. on October 25 2021.

The robber made inquiries to a teller about deposits left for half an hour then returned with a baseball cap and sunglasses.

The robber presented a note written on the deposit slip that the teller had provided minutes earlier.

The note stated ""Put all large bills and no tracers or die sticks immediately in bag. You have 20 seconds.""

The robber left the note at the bank. Investigators were able to compare the writing on the note to a letter Jones had written to a judge regarding a 2018 case in Denver. The handwriting particularly the loop around the 'G' and the fact every 'A' was capitalized ""appeared to match"" the Denver detective observed.

After the robbery Denver Police Department investigators gathered surveillance video from the area around the Westerner Motel located at 8405 E Colfax Avenue. In it they found images of Jones wearing the same distinctive jacket that the robber wore and driving the same black Audi which the robber drove to and from the bank.

They also found her driving a Jeep Grand Cherokee that she told a friend she had just purchased. That friend told detectives he wasn't aware of Jones having a job.

DPD also recorded bodycam video of Jones wearing the same jacket the night before the bank robbery when officers stopped a stolen vehicle.

If reading the title stirs up memories of Dolly Parton Olympia Dukakis and Shirley MacLaine then you are in for a treat with local performers Lynne Christian Diane Walker and Lorraine Bouchard tackling the same witty heartfelt roles as those iconic actors.

""Steel Magnolias"" runs two weekends through Sept. 11 at Community Players Theatre in Bloomington.

By day Penny Wilson is a busy Realtor hustling in Bloomington’s hot real estate market. But at night she’s a theater director.

Wilson spoke with WGLT just before the curtain went up on Thursday.

“I’ve been out here since about '89” Wilson said marking Community Players’ 1989 Christmas pageant called “Holiday on Robinhood Lane” as her first production with the company. Favorite shows since then include “Of Mice and Men” in 2014 and “Camelot” in 2004.

Since that first Christmas pageant Wilson has come back again and again and not just as a director — she’s also acted designed costumes done wigs and hair and painted sets.

“I think we put on great productions and that draws the public in” she said.

The 1989 film adaptation of “Steel Magnolias” put Julia Roberts on the map earning the young actress her first Oscar and Golden Globe for her performance as Shelby.

But the stage production came before the movie. Penned two years earlier “Steel Magnolias” originally opened off Broadway at the WPA Theatre. Jason Moore directed the Broadway version that opened in 2005 at the Lyceum Theatre and ran for more than 150 performances.

The play is notably different from the film.

“It stays in the beauty salon” said Wilson adding the six women central to the plot are the only performers on stage. “But every single line you hear will be familiar.”

“Steel Magnolias”' late-1980s vintage comes across in the sets and costumes as does its fictional location in a Louisiana parish outside Shreveport. But Wilson said the themes explored in the play resonate with today’s audiences.

Shelby is a new bride and mother who dies of complications from diabetes. The plot is based on the true story of Harling’s sister Susan.

“This about friendship and what we do in times of joy and times of sadness and heartache” Wilson said.

Key to those friendships is the inter-generational experiences of the six women who seem to have little in common with one another apart from frequenting their neighborhood salon.

Likewise each Community Players cast member is a different age and brought various levels of experience to the rehearsal process.

“We have veteran actors we have actors that have done a few shows — we have an actress that has done no shows prior to this” Wilson said. “They bonded early on and have worked so hard... I’m so pleased with what they’re going to present.”

Steel Magnolias runs Sept. 2-4 and 9-11 at the Community Players Theatre 201 Robinhood Lane in Bloomington. Tickets are $9-$17 at communityplayers.org.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjQxN21hZy5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL3RyYXZlbC90YWtlLWEtdHJpcC10by1zdC1sb3Vpcy1mb3ItdGhlLWdyZWF0LWZvcmVzdC1wYXJrLWJhbGxvb24tcmFjZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Take a Trip to St. Louis for the Great Forest Park Balloon Race,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjQxN21hZy5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL3RyYXZlbC90YWtlLWEtdHJpcC10by1zdC1sb3Vpcy1mb3ItdGhlLWdyZWF0LWZvcmVzdC1wYXJrLWJhbGxvb24tcmFjZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016711427280>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjQxN21hZy5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL3RyYXZlbC90YWtlLWEtdHJpcC10by1zdC1sb3Vpcy1mb3ItdGhlLWdyZWF0LWZvcmVzdC1wYXJrLWJhbGxvb24tcmFjZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Throughout the past month the multimillion-dollar pool has been a construction site instead of a recreation opportunity like it was built for in 2018.

Mitchell Mayor Bob Everson said the latest issue that's caused the pool closure is due to the surfacing that’s been ""falling apart.”

“There is a coating that is kind of like a plaster and it’s been coming off in areas around the pool. Water was getting in behind it and causing more to come off” Everson said of the surfacing problems. “We have completely taken the old surface off the competition and the recreation pool. We’re down to the old concrete base. We are evaluating why it was delaminating to figure out what the issue is.”

The 22635-square-foot facility that sits next to the Recreation Center is in its fourth year of existence and there have already been a handful of structural issues that have prompted city officials to close the pair of pools for repair work.

Considering the pool project came with an $8 million price tag Everson said the ongoing problems with the Indoor Aquatic Center are frustrating. As he put it “The city paid for a finished product that isn’t finished.”

Puetz Build + Design was the contractor tabbed to oversee the construction of the new pool in 2018. Puetz selected Acapulco Pools a Canada-based company with over four decades of experience in concrete pool building to take on the construction of the leisure and competition pools. MSH Architects also had a hand in the design of the project.

Mark Puetz CEO of Puetz said the issue with the plaster surfacing is currently being repaired. The plaster that was applied by a subcontractor to the pool surfacing is also under warranty according to Puetz.

While there was plenty of excitement when the new aquatic facility was being built the finished product experiencing problems early on wasn't exactly what some city leaders hoped for. In the first year of operation Everson said plaster along the pool surfaces began experiencing problems and delaminating.

“The initial delamination began when the pool was under the first year of the warranty” Everson said.

Initially the repair work was anticipated to take roughly a month according to a July memo from the Parks and Recreation Department. However that changed when crews began working on the surfacing.

“Puetz Construction went forward looking at things and found out that this might be a little bit of a bigger issue than we initially thought” Everson said.

Walls are beginning to rise from the construction site just south of the Mitchell Recreation Center on North Main Str...

The Parks and Recreation Department notified the public this week of the new issues discovered in the pool in an apologetic-toned memo stating “Getting these issues corrected will unfortunately take more time than was originally anticipated.”

Who is on the hook?

As crews have been working on repairing the pool for over a month who will be on the hook for footing the bill? And what’s the cost of the latest repair work?

City Attorney Justin Johnson said he’s been working through the process of establishing how the costs of repair work will be paid. In addition Johnson said the details of the pool warranties — which are written agreements that promise a manufacturer of a product will repair or replace it for a respective purchaser — are also in the process of being worked out.

Puetz said the ongoing repair work that's being done on the pools will be covered by contractors.

The totality of repair work and costs have yet to be determined Everson noted. Regardless of the final costs when the repairs are wrapped up Everson emphasized that the city should have “no financial duty” to pay for any of the work.

“We paid for a perfectly good pool and we’re not getting a perfectly good pool. Therefore the city has no financial duty to pay for this” Everson said.

The indoor aquatic center has seen a fair share of use among swimmers since opening according to city officials. The competition pool also serves as the home pool of the Dakota Riptide swimming club that consists of Mitchell and Huron area competitive swimmers. But the avid pool-goers have been without the indoor aquatic facility for a little over a month.

The longer the pool is shut down the longer it eliminates its ability to generate any revenue.

Although the addition of the pool was met with strong support among city leaders the project had its fair share of opponents when the aquatic facility was proposed in 2015 by the Mitchell Aquatic Club — a group that has since merged with Dakota Riptide.

The Mitchell City Council approved the funding package in August 2015 but the decision was referred by residents to a special election. The project narrowly passed later that year with 54% of voters casting ballots to approve it. A total of 2653 ballots were cast during the special election for the pool project marking less than 30% of Mitchell’s voters at the time.

The project was funded with $4.8 million in city surplus funds along with $750000 from community project reserves. A loan payment of $500000 from the Mitchell Area Development Corporation and contributions from the Mitchell Aquatic Club and increased Business Improvement District taxes covered the final $2 million. The city is on pace to have the indoor aquatic center completely paid off in 2023.

As for when the pool will reopen Everson said it’s yet to be determined adding that it hinges on how the investigation into the surfacing issues concludes.

“It may not be an easy fix or it may not be a hard fix. We don’t know yet” Everson said. “They are working towards getting it done to meet the pool standards and city’s standards.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvbWlrZWthcHBlbC8yMDIyLzA5LzAyLzUtcmVhc29ucy13ZS13ZW50LXJlbW90ZS1hbmQtc3RheWVkLXRoYXQtd2F5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Reasons We Went Remote—And Stayed That Way,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.forbes.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /sites/mikekappel/2022/09/02/5-reasons-we-went-remote-and-stayed-that-way/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016711ACB100>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvbWlrZWthcHBlbC8yMDIyLzA5LzAyLzUtcmVhc29ucy13ZS13ZW50LXJlbW90ZS1hbmQtc3RheWVkLXRoYXQtd2F5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkdmlzb3JodWIuY29tL2JyZWFraW5nLXVicy13ZWFsdGhmcm9udC1jYWxsLW9mZi1tZXJnZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UBS Wealthfront Call Off Merger,"UBS Group AG and robo advisor Wealthfront Inc. have agreed to scrap their planned $1.4 billion merger the companies said on Friday.

UBS announced the deal for Wealthfront in January as a way to tap into a pool of mass affluent and next-generation investors. The Swiss bank will instead be providing almost $70 million in financing for Wealthfront at the same $1.4 billion valuation.

“I am incredibly excited about Wealthfront’s path forward as an independent company” Wealthfront Chief Executive David Fortunato said in an announcement.

A spokesman for UBS did not immediately return a request for additional comment. UBS Group Chief Executive Ralph Hamers on the company’s July earnings call said the deal was still on course.

“UBS remains committed to its growth plans in the US and will continue the build-out of its digital wealth management offering” the company said in a separate statement late Friday about the abrupt halt of the deal.

The Swiss bank in July named Naureen Hassan a veteran wealth executive who worked on digital advice at Charles Schwab Corp. and Morgan Stanley to be president of UBS Americas effective October 3.

“We have an ambitious plan for the U.S.” Hamers said at the time. “Not only for the digital proposition but also to support the financial advisors as crucial and Naureen brings that experience.”

The company’s second quarter earnings fell short of analyst expectations a period that Hamers called one of the “most challenging” for investors in a decade.

UBS Wealth USA had its own digital advice offering through SigFig Wealth Management. Executives had said the Wealthfront deal would compliment its retirement services and corporate stock plan business offerings in the U.S.

UBS’s Wall Street competitors have been pushing into the self-directed market including Morgan Stanley with its 2020 purchase of E*Trade Financial and Merrill Lynch with its consumer-bank based Merrill Edge unit. JPMorgan Chase is rolling out a call center-based advice offering for customers with at least $25000.

In Loving Memory ~

It is with very heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Michael (Mike) Robert Procter 79 of 150 Mile House BC on February 6 2024.

In North Vancouver BC Mike was the first of three children born to Mary and Peter Procter. Mike grew up in Williams Lake BC after the family moved there in 1951.

After graduating school he followed in his father's footsteps by becoming an Electrician. Working for his father's company Procter Electric he worked throughout the Cariboo-Chilcotin and Mike and his father were instrumental in creating novel systems to generate electricity at remote ranches and locations throughout the region.

He moved on to working in the industrial sector and became highly skilled in his trade. High in demand he worked in the construction of new sawmills and in various plants all throughout BC. Later he worked at several local sawmills and contracted throughout the area.

Over all those years Mike made many friendships that endured for the rest of his life.

He went on to marry Cheryl Midnight and they had two children Chris and Jody.

Mike had a penchant for fast cars nice trucks and fine guns. He enjoyed hunting fishing and classic car restoration. He traveled to horse shows throughout BC AB and briefly the US winning many trophies with their champion Arabian show horse Star-Sirza.

In the mid-80's Mike met his life partner Betty Johnson and in the 90's they settled in the 150 Mile area. Mike and 2 good friends purchased the 150 Mile Hotel a rich piece of history in the Cariboo. Together they revived it into the 150 Mile Roadhouse & Pub. For years the establishment was a notable and lively gathering place where many good times were had.

Mike was a hardworking generous man who was always willing to help his friends and family.

He had a great sense of humour he was always up to something and he was entertaining to be around. Throughout his life he was fortunate to have made many friends many acquaintances and to have many great stories to tell. Mike will be sorely missed by his family and friends.

Mike was predeceased by his parents Mary and Peter and his stepfather John Ailport.

He is survived by his life partner Betty brother Chris (Sherri) sister Andrea son Chris (Jenica) daughter Jody (Joey) stepson Bryan (Dawn) three nieces (Susie Mia and Alison) five grandchildren (Jayden Utah Talon Pyper and Keyfer) and many friends.

Mike wished for his ashes to be spread at his favorite mule deer hunting spot a beautiful area overlooking the Fraser River.

New automobiles start to depreciate in value the moment your car leaves the lot. If you sell your car even after owning it for just a year its resale value is typically as much as 20% less than its original value according to the Insurance Information Institute or Triple-I. While supply chain issues in the US are shaking up this calculus (meaning in some cases you could make a profit on a used car right now) it’s still an accurate rule of thumb.

That sudden depreciation means that if you’re financing or leasing your new vehicle there may be a time where the amount you owe on the car is greater than the market value of the car itself. For example you may owe $9000 on your car loan but find your car’s depreciated value is now only $7000. In this case if your car gets totaled you’re on the hook for paying more than the car is actually worth to cover your auto loan.

What about car insurance? Although your auto insurance policy would likely kick in if this happened the standard insurance policy would only pay for your vehicle’s current value which means there’s still a sum of money -- a gap -- you’d be obliged to pay. Gap insurance can protect you in this situation.

For more on car insurance be sure to check out our list of the best car insurance companies and best companies for cheap car insurance.

What is gap insurance and when do you need it?

Sometimes referred to as loan or lease payoff insurance gap insurance can cover the difference between your vehicle’s market value and the amount you owe on it in the event of an accident that totals your car.

If you’re leasing your vehicle this coverage is typically required according to Mark Friedlander director of corporate communications at Triple-I. But if you’re financing your vehicle it’s voluntary. So how do you decide whether you should get it?

Here’s a good rule:

“If you put down less than a 20% payment on your car and you’re financing the rest of it -- at least 80% -- throughout four or five years or longer that’s criteria for gap insurance” Friedlander said. “Additionally our recommendation is that you purchase gap insurance through your auto insurer versus buying it from the car dealer or leasing company. The latter is more expensive.”

Buying gap insurance through your current auto insurance company may be difficult however because not all carriers offer gap insurance. In fact many major national insurers like Geico USAA and State Farm don’t.

If you’re financing or leasing a new car here’s a list of major insurers that offer gap insurance coverage.

Allstate View Rates Allstate is one of the oldest and largest car insurers in the US founded in 1937 and ranks fourth in total market share in the US according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. This insurance giant includes gap insurance in its robust list of coverage options though this coverage tends to come at a pricier premium compared to other insurers. While it services all 50 states and Washington D.C. it doesn’t offer gap insurance in New York. Progressive View Rates Progressive offers something similar to gap insurance called “loan/lease payoff insurance.” It works in much the same way as gap insurance covering the difference between your vehicle’s market value and the amount you owe on it. The main difference is that Progressive’s payoff coverage is limited to no more than 25% of your vehicle’s actual cash value though the limit varies by state. For example if your car is worth $5000 and is totaled in an accident and you owe $7000 Progressive would cover $1250. Progressive offers middle-of-the-line rates generally making it potentially a good option to include in your search if you’re looking for a carrier with gap insurance (or something similar enough). Amica View Rates Amica is another major US insurer operating in every state except Hawaii. Amica is known for its high customer satisfaction scores with residents in New England noting particularly positive experiences with the carrier’s service. The insurer provides more than just car insurance policies; it also offers flood condo life home and small business insurance. If you buy gap insurance at Amica it will show up on your bill as “auto loan/lease coverage.” This coverage isn’t available in all states. Nationwide View Rates Nationwide’s gap coverage costs approximately 5% of the total cost between both comprehensive and collision on the customer’s policy according to a Nationwide spokesperson. This carrier sells gap coverage in all states except New York and it operates in all states except Alaska Hawaii and Louisiana. To purchase this coverage you must request it within six months of buying or leasing your new vehicle and hold both comprehensive and collision coverage. Gap insurance at Nationwide is available until the vehicle turns six years old. Liberty Mutual View Rates Liberty Mutual headquartered in Boston Massachusetts is another major carrier that provides gap insurance. The carrier offers auto home and life insurance policies in all 50 states plus Washington D.C. making Liberty Mutual’s gap coverage one of the most accessible across the country. That noted the carrier receives a high number of complaints nationally filed with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and below average scores in J.D. Power customer satisfaction surveys. The Hartford View Rates The Hartford offers a list of car insurance coverage that includes gap insurance. But this carrier isn’t for all drivers. The Hartford’s auto policy is geared towards drivers over the age of 50 who are members of the American Association of Retired Persons. Along with gap insurance Hartford also offers car replacement coverage which will give you money for a new car of the same make and model if your car is totaled instead of paying out the depreciated value of your car.

Gap Insurance FAQs

FAQs

Can you get gap insurance from a different company than your main insurance provider? Yes but it’s much more expensive. The other option if you’re not getting it through an insurer is to buy gap insurance through the lender or dealership you bought the car with. Again this is more expensive than getting it through your main insurance provider as an add-on to your policy.

Do I need gap insurance if I have full coverage? Yes. If you want to insure the gap between your car’s market value and the amount you owe on it you’ll need gap insurance. Full coverage won’t cover that gap on its own.

Can you add gap insurance to your policy at any time? No. More often than not you’ll need to add gap insurance immediately or soon after buying your new car. For example Nationwide requires that you buy gap insurance within six months of getting a new car.

Best for Minimum Coverage: Geico

Geico is one of the nation’s largest insurance companies and it’s acknowledged by many for providing affordable car insurance. Besides offering Californians initially competitive rates on liability-only coverage motorists may save even more money with Geico’s many discounts. You’ll enjoy price reductions for having good driving habits like using a seat belt driving defensively and maintaining an unblemished motor vehicle record for five or more years.

Geico also discounts policyholders who are military service members Federal employees senior drivers and those who are affiliated with partnering organizations—including alumni associations professional networks and more. It’s these money-saving opportunities that drive down the cost of liability insurance for California drivers.

However Geico isn’t just for drivers who are only interested in minimum coverage. In fact those in the market for full coverage or add-on protections may save money on their policies too. Geico’s mechanical breakdown coverage will pay to repair all parts of a new car that is less than 15 months old and with fewer than 15000 miles. This policy can be renewed for up to seven years or 100000 miles whichever comes first.

Best for Full Coverage: Mercury Insurance

Mercury is a no-frills auto insurance provider operating in California and a handful of other states. In addition to the standard coverages one expects to see Mercury also provides 24/7 roadside assistance rental car reimbursement and ride-hailing insurance—which is a nice bonus for California gig workers who rideshare with their vehicles.

If you’re on the hunt for affordable full coverage insurance Mercury could be your cheapest option. You may be able to save even more with MercuryGO and RealDrive which are the provider's usage- and behavior-based programs that use an app to track both the number of miles driven and your driving habits. Motorists who drive safely and don’t log too many miles stand to save upwards of 10 percent on their premiums.

Moreover Mercury also offers customers the chance to further cut costs with multiple discounts. Policyholders with good account management practices will earn discounts for enrolling in autopay paying in full and signing documents digitally. Both good drivers and good students get rewarded with savings too—as do those who insure multiple cars install an anti-theft device and bundle their homeowner’s or renter’s insurance with Mercury.

Mercury was recognized for providing Californians with excellent customer satisfaction in the most recent J.D. Power survey but it has more complaints than expected with the NAIC.

Pros

Low-cost coverage

Savings with multiple discounts

Cons

Quotes not available online

Has complaints listed with NAIC

Takeaway

California drivers who want more than liability-only coverage have a lot to like with Mercury Insurance. This underwriter is noted for providing cheaper-than-average rates for full coverage in The Golden State.

Best for Good Driving Records: Wawanesa

Wawanesa exclusively underwrites insurance policies for experienced drivers in California and Oregon. Because of this specialization Wawanesa often undercuts the insurance rates of its larger competitors. This is especially true for good drivers with no more than one at-fault accident or moving violation in the past three years. Indeed Wawanesa prioritizes experience and only those who’ve carried a driver's license for three or more years are eligible for its coverage.

This local underwriter provides all of the usual auto protections but it also offers add-ons like roadside assistance and rental car reimbursement. Plus Wawanesa will also insure after-market upgrades including custom carpeting furnishing stereo equipment rims and tires paint jobs engine accessories and anti-theft systems. It provides peace of mind for owners of wheelchair-accessible vehicles custom or vintage cars and other types of specialized automobiles.

Drivers over the age of 55 who take an approved defensive driving course can earn a discount as do those who renew their policies maintain a good driving history and insure multiple vehicles. Aside from these several savings opportunities Wawanesa doesn’t offer as many discounts as its competitors do.

Although it has an above-average number of complaints lodged with the NAIC Wawanesa is accredited by the Better Business Bureau where it maintains an A+ ranking.

Pros

Low-cost coverage for good drivers

Cons

Drivers with multiple traffic violations ineligible

Fewer discounts than most

Takeaway

Responsible drivers in California who are chasing cheap car insurance may find a friend in Wawanesa. This local insurance provider specializes in low-cost coverage for those with clean driving records but its high volume of complaints may cause some to think twice.

Best for Poor Driving Records: The General

Drivers with insurance lapses or multiple infractions on their driving records will often see their rates soar and Californians with a DUI are lucky to find a provider at all. Essentially the more risk you carry as a motorist the more likely you are to pay extra for coverage. The question is just how much extra.

The General is a non-standard insurance provider that specializes in underwriting auto insurance for high-risk drivers. Even those with more than two at-fault accidents in the past three years or a DUI-related suspension may still qualify for coverage with The General.

Keep in mind that this is not budget insurance. Rather this is second-chance auto insurance for those with few options. Still when it comes to high-premium auto insurance for repeat offenders The General’s pricing is competitive. It will even provide SR-22 forms for motorists who need to submit proof of insurance to the California Department of Motor Vehicles.

The General has a troubling amount of complaints with the NAIC but this may be par for the course considering its clientele. For what it’s worth The General does maintain a superior A+ rating with AM Best despite its volume of complaints.

Pros

Coverage for high-risk drivers

Provides SR-22 filings

Cons

High volume of complaints with the NAIC

Few discounts available

Takeaway

If at-fault accidents and moving violations have sent your car insurance premiums through the roof you may find relief with The General. Yet those with a good driving record will probably find lower rates elsewhere.

Best for Military Households: USAA

Established in 1922 to provide low-cost coverage to military households the United States Automobile Association (USAA) is technically not an insurance underwriter. Instead USAA has contracted Progressive to handle its policies. The good news is that eligible Californians will beat Progressive’s lowest price point by 5 percent. It’s one of many ways Uncle Sam thanks those who honorably serve their country.

USAA claims that its members save an average of $725 on their auto insurance when transferring their policy from another underwriter. Besides offering savings for policy bundling and smart account management this provider also discounts the premiums of motorists with a good driving record and those who complete a defensive driving course. Californians can also use the USAA SafePilot App to further discount their premiums based on driving frequency and behavior.

USAA offers the standard protections one would expect from an auto insurer and its several add-on options are nothing you wouldn’t find from similar nationwide providers. Still its focus on military families makes it a top contender for eligible drivers. It’s easy to see how USAA claims the top spot for customer satisfaction in the J.D. Power and Associates 2021 report.

Pros

Low-cost coverage

Coverage available to children spouses and former spouses of military service personnel

Cons

Coverage not available to the general public

Takeaway

Although the general public isn’t eligible for auto coverage through USAA veterans active-duty military personnel and their families will likely find the cheapest car insurance with this government-backed provider.

Average Cost of Insurance in California

By most accounts the average monthly cost of car insurance in California is generally around $50 for minimum coverage and $180 for full coverage—that’s $600 to $2160 respectively for an annual premium.

The cost of insuring a vehicle in California is 63 percent higher than the national average of $1321 according to some sources. This dramatic difference in insurance rates between The Golden State and the rest of the country is presumably due to congested traffic and clogged motorways—both of which lead to a higher probability of accident claims.

In addition to its dense population California is also geographically large. Hence average estimates take into consideration the costs of insuring a vehicle in overpriced Beverly Hills and affordable Fresno—two cities that possess vastly different auto insurance risk profiles.

Keep in mind that the price of your premium will depend largely on the value of your car your motor vehicle record and insurance claims history and other cost variables that we discuss in detail below.

How to Save on Insurance

The best way to save money on car insurance is to comparison shop. Requesting quotes from three to five companies will undoubtedly yield both the highest and lowest insurance rates.

Many owners assume prices are fairly consistent and will take the first insurance quote they get but this is a common mistake. Insurance costs vary significantly between providers because each assesses risk differently. So comparison shopping will help you save hundreds of dollars if not thousands over the life of your policy.

Plus shopping your insurance rate with multiple providers gives you leverage to negotiate. While an insurance agent is under no obligation to negotiate with you there’s nothing stopping you from asking one to beat your lowest quote.

Thankfully there are additional money-saving strategies California motorists can use to reduce the cost of their premiums. Here are a few of the more effective techniques.

Increase your deductible. Your deductible is the amount of money you pay before your underwriter will pay for damages in a claim. When you raise your deductible from $250 to $1000 you’ll have to pay more out-of-pocket after an accident but you’ll also cut the price on your insurance premium.

When you raise your deductible from $250 to $1000 you’ll have to pay more out-of-pocket after an accident but you’ll also cut the price on your insurance premium. Don’t pay for coverage you won’t use. Underwriters offer a selection of appealing coverages that those on a budget can forgo such as disappearing deductibles roadside assistance gap coverage and custom parts and equipment (CPE) coverage to name a few.

Use a pay-as-you-go program. Many providers offer usage-based insurance that tracks your driving behavior through a telemetric device and only charges based on how much you drive. A few examples of usage-based programs are Progressive’s Snapshot Allstate’s Drivewise and State Farm’s Drive Safe & Save.

Discounts are price reductions insurance companies offer to encourage loyalty and reduce driver risk. Each carrier will have their own set menu of discounts and policyholders can significantly reduce the cost of their premiums by qualifying for as many of them as possible.

Common Insurance Discounts for California Drivers

The best car insurance companies in California will offer multiple discounts to help customers lower the cost of insurance premiums. While the titles guidelines and availability of these discounts vary by provider here are common insurance discounts you’ll find in California.

Safe driver: Drivers with good driving records save money and those with no at-fault accidents or motor vehicle violations will save even more.

Drivers with good driving records save money and those with no at-fault accidents or motor vehicle violations will save even more. Continuously-insured drivers: Motorists who have been insured for six months or more will be considered “continuously insured” and receive a modest discount. But those who have held this status for multiple years may receive even more savings.

But those who have held this status for multiple years may receive even more savings. Good student: Young drivers with good grades could get rewarded with lower premiums. Typically a grade-point average of a “B” or better will qualify for these types of discounts.

Young drivers with good grades could get rewarded with lower premiums. Typically a grade-point average of a “B” or better will qualify for these types of discounts. Safety features: Providers discount vehicles with safety features like anti-lock brakes and daytime running lights. Similarly policyholders who install anti-theft devices may also earn a discount.

Payments and billing: Those with good account-management skills can potentially enjoy discounts for enrolling in paperless billing setting up automatic payments and paying their premiums in full.

Essential Cost Variables for Insurance

As with everything there are a host of variables that will affect the cost of your insurance as no two people are exactly alike. With that in mind here are the variables that’ll change the cost of your insurance.

Age

Insurance carriers will use a policyholder’s age as a proxy for driving experience. Since young drivers and teen drivers both lack the practical knowledge of a more mature motorist they often pay higher rates early on in their driving careers.

Furthermore multiple studies have shown that younger people are not only the cause of more accidents than their older counterparts but that accidents involving young drivers are also more severe. In a recent report the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) found that 25 percent of young drivers had been involved in one or more crashes.

This increased risk translates into higher premiums. But the good news is that age-based rates begin to balance out around age 25 for most drivers provided they maintain a clean driving record. Most motorists pay the least for car insurance between the ages of 40 to 60.

Gender Credit Score and Location

In other states traits such as a motorist’s gender ZIP code and credit score are all used by insurance underwriters to estimate the risk a policyholder carries. As an example men with bad credit who live in a congested city would pay higher insurance rates than women with good credit who reside in the suburbs.

However California has laws that prevent insurance providers from using any of these traits to determine how much you’ll pay for car insurance.

Vehicle/Model

Providers use details about your car to evaluate insurance costs. They will look at the make and model of your vehicle its accident rates along with its age value and safety features to establish the cost of your premiums.

Some car models including Subarus Toyotas and Hondas are often cheaper to insure than other brands. Similarly sports utility vehicles (SUVs) are also frequently more affordable to insure than pickup trucks and sports cars.

Type of Coverage

More so than any other cost variables the type of coverage its deductible and its policy limits all have a pronounced impact on the cost of your insurance premiums. These are the standard types of car insurance policies you’ll find in California.

Liability: Liability is the minimum coverage required in California and this policy protects you in two ways. Bodily injury liability covers someone else’s medical costs when you’re at fault in an accident and property damage liability covers the damage to somebody else’s car also when you’re at fault.

FAQs

You’ve got questions. The Drive has answers.

Q. How much is car insurance in California?

A. The average annual cost of car insurance in California is about $600 for minimum coverage and $2160 for full coverage. This translates to $50 to $180 for those who prefer to pay their premiums monthly. Most estimates place the annual cost of insuring a car in California to be roughly 60 percent more than the national average.

Still the cost of your insurance premium will be determined by variables such as your driving record claims history age and the value and safety of your car.

Q. Who has the cheapest car insurance in California?

A. The cheapest car insurance in California is typically Geico Mercury Wawanesa and AAA NorCal. Many authorities ballpark minimum coverage costs for older drivers is between $32 to $46 per month with any of these providers. But these premiums can be as much as four times higher for teen drivers and those with a DUI.

Mercury may have the cheapest insurance rates for full coverage and the company claims that its California customers save an average of $677 with their price points and discounts. Full coverage policies often include a blend of liability collision comprehensive medical payments and uninsured/underinsured motorist protections.

While California only requires drivers to carry liability to legally operate a car full coverage is highly recommended for those who can afford it.

Q. How much coverage do you need in California?

A. California requires motorists to carry liability insurance to lawfully drive a car. The minimum coverage requirement is 15/30/5 for bodily injury liability and property damage liability. That pays $15000 per passenger and $30000 per accident for someone else’s medical costs when you are liable for a traffic accident. It also pays up to $5000 to cover damage to their vehicle.

Bear in mind that if you purchased a vehicle with an auto loan your loan servicer will most likely insist you carry full coverage until the balance is paid. Similarly when you are leasing a car in California the dealership or rental car company may require a liability policy of 100/300/100 that pays $100000 $300000 and $100000 respectively.

Q. Is California a no-fault state?

A. No. California is an at-fault state rather than a no-fault state. This means that the motorist who is assigned fault in a traffic accident is liable for paying medical and property damage expenses sustained by the victim. On the other hand no-fault states require drivers to file claims directly through their providers after an accident regardless of fault. This is why some states require personal injury protection (PIP) and others like California do not.

Big money—increasingly laundered through independent groups that do not disclose their donors—is corrupting our politics. In this election season alone the Wesleyan Media Project reports nearly 60 percent of the ads aired in Democratic House primaries were purchased by groups that offered only partial disclosure of their donors—or none at all. Progressive challengers in contested primaries were often the leading targets of these dark money groups.

Democrats have long condemned the Big Money corruption of our politics—but reforms passed by the House of Representatives have repeatedly been torpedoed by Republican filibusters in the Senate. This month however Democrats could—if they choose—crack down on dark money poisoning their own primaries. And small-d democrats across the country should join in calling for them to act. Since the courts treat the Democratic National Committee and the party essentially as a club with free association rights the party can make and enforce its own rules for how its candidates are selected—without the need for Republican cooperation. A resolution introduced by Judith Whitmer chair of the Nevada Democratic Party—along with 33 of her fellow DNC members—calls on the party to “ban the use of ‘dark money’ funding during any and all Democratic primary elections.” DNC Resolution 19 also calls for mechanisms to investigate the use of dark money explore possible disciplinary action and empower states to set rules in their primaries to ensure transparency.

As Democrats from Joe Biden on down have argued campaign finance reform is long overdue. This primary season has dramatized just how corrupt and corrosive the current system is.

Perhaps the most egregious example has been provided by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee—AIPAC—and its various independent expenditure fronts. Republican megadonors Bernie Marcus and Paul Singer gave one of AIPAC’s fronts the United Democracy Project $1 million apiece prior to the Democratic primaries. UDP then boasted about the millions it spent to target progressive Democratic candidates—primarily progressive women of color.

Throwing over $2.7 million of largely Republican donor money into negative ads against Summer Lee a progressive champion in Pennsylvania the UDP had the chutzpah to accuse her of not being “a real Democrat.” Lee the overwhelming favorite before the UDP waded in barely survived the onslaught. But other progressives that AIPAC targeted—including Jennifer Cisneros in Texas Nina Turner in Ohio Donna Edwards in Maryland—went down to defeat in the face of literally millions in negative ads by the UDP alone.

Dark money also contributed to the defeat of Andy Levin one of the great progressive champions of labor and the environmental movement in the Congress in his primary against Haley Stevens the establishment favorite. Levin is pro-choice but Emily’s List spent an astonishing $3 million against him—money that was likely seeded by a few targeted big grants by anonymous donors. Levin who is Jewish and a committed Zionist was apparently not ardent enough for AIPAC which spent $4 million in negative ads through affiliated groups to attack him. (J Street the progressive pro-Israel group backed Levin but without Republican and right-wing support could ante up only $700000 in independent expenditures).

Cryptocurrency billionaires are becoming another source of big money as part of a campaign to insulate their Ponzi schemes from regulation. The crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried virtually invented the primary candidacy of Carrick Flynn in the new Sixth Congressional District of Oregon spending $11 million through his super PAC Protect our Future to boost a previous unknown against State Representative Andrea Salinas who had the backing of Planned Parenthood the Working Families Party and local labor unions. Bankman-Fried’s contribution of another $6 million to the House Majority PAC no doubt “encouraged” the group to endorse Flynn—who became the beneficiary of $1 million in PAC funding—over the objections of local Democratic committees. Flynn also received $1 million from the so-called Mainstream Democratic PAC supported largely by Linked In founder Reid Hoffman. Salinas won decisively but only a remarkable mobilization of local activists enabled the progressive candidate in Oregon’s Fifth Congressional District Jamie McLeod-Skinner to overcome the dark money onslaught aimed at protecting the incumbent blue dog Democrat Kurt Schrader.

Big money will continue to flood into primaries because deep pocket donors aren’t stupid. Thanks to partisan gerrymandering only about 14 percent of congressional districts are ever contested. In the rest the primary determines the winner—at far less cost than a general election campaign. Unless checked corporate and financial interests will continue to view funding primaries as a relatively inexpensive means to protect their interests. As Nevada chair Judith Whitmer stated in an interview the level of dark money intervention in primary elections has become “very alarming.” The “avalanche” of dark money is getting to the point where “people lose their right to choose their own candidates” Whitmer said.

This corporate thumb on the scale is particularly pernicious at a time when Democrats are engaged in a pitched battle over their direction and agenda. Will they become the party that helps midwife the progressive era that is long overdue? Will they champion the interests of working and poor people? Or will they remain an economically neoliberal party of Wall Street Silicon Valley and Hollywood anchored in the affluent suburbs abandoning working people to be misled by demagogues like Trump and his successors?

Senator Bernie Sanders has formally called on the DNC to act writing that “Dark money is dark money whether it is funded by Republican billionaires or Democratic billionaires.”

“The continuation of super PAC money in Democratic primaries” warns Sanders “will demoralize the Democratic base and alienate potential Democratic voters from the political process.” More From Robert L.

The decision this week by the DNC thus has profound implications. Will Democratic rules reflect the party’s stated values? As DNC member Larry Cohen the chair of Our Revolution noted “every leader of the Democratic Party has condemned dark money and Citizens United. Now is time to do something about it.”

Whitmer’s resolution will go before the Resolutions Committee on September 7 or 8. The Committee will decide then whether to report out the resolution—either separately or in a package to the full DNC which meets on the 9th. Backstage maneuvers have already begun. Since simply torpedoing the resolution wouldn’t look good suddenly a competing resolution has been introduced (and listed as Resolution 18 just before the genuine reform). As Whitmer noted it merely repeats the party’s toothless call to repeal Citizen’s United and changes nothing.

The DNC is controlled from the top. Fewer than half of its members are elected. The DNC head—in this case Jamie Harrison–generally comes into each meeting armed with a 100 or so proxies from members who won’t attend ensuring that he controls all outcomes. His position on issues is defined by what the party leaders—in this case the White House—want to happen. (One of the resolutions that the DNC will likely consider at this meeting would make any resolution involving party rules passed by the national convention inoperative unless adopted by a majority of the DNC. The DNC chair could thus block reforms passed by the most democratic body of the party—the delegates meeting every four years at the convention—simply by ignoring them.)

Most DNC meetings pass without much notice. And Harrison may well seek to bury Resolution 19 without a discussion or a recorded vote. Democrats across the country—activists donors local party officials volunteers—should make it clear to Harrison and to the White House that this issue can’t be buried quietly. It is time to curb the role of dark money in Democratic primaries before the party itself is too corrupted to redeem or repair.

Increasing net worth is predicted to make the Asia-Pacific the second largest wealth hub over the next five years.

This surge in affluence has been particularly notable in Singapore where the population of HNWIs soared 126 per cent between 2016 and 2021 . Increasing at an even faster clip in the city state is the UHNWIs group which grew 158 per cent over the same period.

In fact The Wealth Report 2022  a study by Knight Frank also found the number of billionaires in the Asia-Pacific is on the rise with one-third of the world’s total predicted to reside in the region by 2026.

In the Asia-Pacific the number of high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) – people with a net worth of at least US$1 million – and ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs) – those with a net worth of at least US$30 million – is set to increase faster than in any other part of the world.

According to the Knight Frank report  there has been an upswing in younger self-made UHNWIs in 2021. They comprise 21 per cent of the total a trend which will likely drive new investment preferences.

Due to their relatively young age these newly rich individuals are expected to focus on accumulating more wealth by capitalising on the long-term investment horizon. They are also more likely to be conscious of the potential impact of their investments on society and the environment.

At the other end of the spectrum are the baby boomers those born between the mid-1940s and mid-1960s who have retired or will soon do so. This group may include entrepreneurs or company founders who are looking to protect their legacy as well as successful executives planning to transfer wealth to their children and grandchildren.

Post-Covid-19 investment attitudes have also shifted across the board. The Affluential Wealth Report for 2020-21 found that steady capital growth and a stable income flow are the two top financial goals for this segment reflecting a lowered appetite for investment risk.

A multipronged approach

An innovative investment-linked plan recently launched by Prudential has been designed to meet the various needs of this growing group of affluent individuals. PRUVantage Wealth is an investment-linked plan that focuses on accelerating wealth accumulation while opening up opportunities for regular income streams. It is also designed to be a valuable tool for legacy planning.

Accelerating wealth

To maximise wealth accumulation the plan offers a generous welcome bonus that allows investors to receive up to 70 per cent¹ in additional units within the first year. Thereafter a loyalty bonus pays an additional 0.8 per cent² every eight years. Costs for the customer are kept to a minimum – there is only one administration charge determined upfront so investors need not worry about additional fees.

Another feature of the plan is flexibility. It allows investors to choose from a selection of professionally managed PRULink funds according to their preferences and risk appetites. Premium top-ups³ withdrawals4 and fund switches can also be carried out when required allowing investors to capitalise on the changing market conditions.

Investors have the option to generate a stream of income when they invest in dividend-paying PRULink funds. This allows them to receive dividends at regular intervals5  giving them a sense of security about their future.

Building a legacy

The plan is designed to make legacy planning easier with the account value of the plan permitted to grow uninterrupted over the years. Purchasing the plan with a joint owner or appointing a secondary life-assured will allow for a planned transfer.

The protection component is offered at no additional cost. In the case of death nominees will receive up to 105 per cent6 of total premiums paid or the account value whichever is higher.

Finally the plan can minimise probate delays in the case of death by allowing the policyholder to nominate specific beneficiaries. Doing this will give them swifter access to proceeds.

The plan is expected to appeal to the broad range of today’s HNWIs. Those with families will be able to build their wealth generate dividends7 on a regular basis and plan the transfer of wealth to the next generation. Other individuals such as the single and newly rich will be able to enhance their wealth while receiving a stream of dividends8

Data of surrendered claims from the Insurers indicates that there is a fourfold increase in the number of surrendered claims in 2021-22 in the case of LIC.

A ‘Life Insurance’ policy (LIP) provides financial security to the immediate kin in case of death. It also provides financial support after the maturity of the policy. There are various LIPs offered by organizations that provide additional benefits during and post the policy period. Hence apart from providing financial security in the aftermath of a death a LIP also acts as a savings plan as the Income Tax act also allows for the deduction of the insurance premium up to a certain limit.

While the intent of taking an insurance policy is that it comes to rescue in case of emergency there could be situations where-in the policyholder intends to surrender or withdraw from the policy. The reasons could include the inability to pay premiums the requirement of money due to emergencies the shortfall in financial resources for survival etc. Life Insurers provide the option to surrender the policy and claim the benefits subject to certain agreed terms & conditions.

At a macro level trends in new policy subscriptions and surrender act as proxy indicators of the state of the economy especially the status of insured households. In this context we look at the trends in ‘Surrendered’ or ‘With-drawn’ Life Insurance Policies over the last 10 years and analyse the correlation if any with various factors that could have influenced these trends.

The data is sourced from the Public Disclosures by the Life Insurance companies as available with the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI). There are 24 Life Insurance Companies in India that are authorised to provide Life Insurance Policy services including Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). For this analysis we have considered top-10 life insurers in terms of surrendered policies.

Increase in the surrendered claims in recent years across most companies

“L-7- Benefits Paid Schedule” from the Public Disclosures of Life Insurers provides details of the benefits paid out by the companies through various policies. Apart from the benefits related to matured claims claims on death etc the information also includes the benefits paid for surrendered or withdrawn policy claims.

There is a huge variance in the total value of the policies surrendered across the insurers with few of them holding the major share in the market. Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) is the Public Life Insurer in the country and also the largest life insurer. This is also reflected in the quantum life insurance policies surrendered.

In 2013-14 the total value paid out by LIC for surrendered policies was Rs. 59.63 thousand crores. This reduced in the ensuing two years followed by a year-on-year increase from 2016-17. The highest annual increase was in 2018-19 and 2021-22.

Among the Private insurers ICICI Prudential HDFC Standard & SBI Life are among the largest Life Insurance companies. These three insurers show varying trends over the past 10 years (2012-13 to 2021-22) but a common trend is the higher increase in the pay-out of surrendered policies in the year 2021-22.

ICICI Prudential paid out Rs. 20.4 thousand crores in 2021-22 compared to Rs. 16.2 thousand crores in 2020-21. However unlike LIC there was a fall during 2018-19 which broke a three-year increasing trend in the benefits paid for surrenders.

HDFC reported an exponential increase in the benefits paid from Rs. 8.86 thousand crores in 2020-21 to Rs. 13.7 thousand crores in 2021-22. In the case of SBI Life it increased from Rs. 8.43 thousand crores to Rs.11.24 thousand crores during the same period.

A similar increase for 2021-22 is observed in most of the other insurers. India First Life a comparatively smaller life insurer has a manifold increase in the pay-out for surrenders from Rs. 19.75 crores to Rs. 2.98 thousand crores between 2012-13 & 2021-22. Meanwhile other Life insurers like Aviva and Reliance Nippon reported a considerable decline in the value of benefits paid out for surrenders. While these along with Bharti AXA and Star Union Dai-Chi have had a lower surrender benefit in recent years there is a visible increase seen during 2016-17 to the 2018-19 period.

While the trends across individual insurers vary two specific trends were observed across most of the insurers. There is a higher increase in the value of benefits paid by the insurers post-COVID-19 pandemic i.e. after 2019-20. Prior to that there is an increase in the surrendered benefits paid during & post-2016-17. This could be an after-effect of Demonetisation. In the case of a few insurers the increase is observed even prior to that especially during 2014-15.

A fourfold increase in the number of Surrender Claims for LIC

While the value of the surrendered and withdrawn claims is influenced by various factors like the age of the policy surrendered the value of the policy the actual payout of the life insurer etc the number of claims surrendered provides a better understanding of the trend.

As was the case in the total value of benefits paid out for surrenders there is an increase in the number of surrendered claims post the pandemic especially in 2021-22. This is more evident in the case of LIC. While there is a considerable increase in the value of benefits paid by LIC for the surrendered claims in 2021-22 there is an exponential increase in the number of claims. In 2020-21 a total of 53.35 lakh surrendered claims were settled by LIC which increased to 2.12 crores during 2021-22.

The Statement of Claims Data (L-40) submitted by the Life Insurers indicates an increase in the number of surrendered claims settled by a few of them during 2021-22. In the case of the HDFC standard it increased from 1.44 lakh claims in 2020-21 to 3.34 lakh claims in 2021-22. So is the case with Max Life.

However in the case of ICICI there was a fall in the number of cases settled in 2021-22 with 3.2 lakh surrendered claims compared to 5.26 lakh in 2020-21. It ought to be noted that the number of surrendered claims in 2019-20 and 2020-21 is in contrast to the declining trend in the number of surrendered claims for ICICI Prudential. Meanwhile as highlighted earlier there is an increase in the value of these claims during this period. The same is the case with SBI life which reported a decreasing number of surrendered claims settled over the years.

Most of the insurers had an increase in the number of surrendered claims settled during 2016-17 & 2017-18 irrespective of the prevailing trend. Data across the life insurers indicated that nearly most of the surrendered claims received are settled.

Increasing trend of Average value per claim settled

The average value per claim is derived by dividing the total paid value of the surrendered claims by the total surrendered claims paid in the year by the respective insurers. Barring a few exceptions a common trend that is observed across the life insurers is the increase in the average value per claim over the years.

In the case of LIC it was Rs.70.6 thousand in 2012-13 which increased to Rs. 1.5 lakhs in 2020-21. In 2021-22 it fell to Rs. 44.76 thousand. The exponential increase in the number of surrendered claims in 2021-22 seems to have reduced the average value. While there could be various factors influencing this and there are no clear reasons highlighted certain observations can be made. The increase in the average value over the years across most of the Life Insurers could be due to the increase in value of the surrendered claims due to a higher ageing of the policy or the higher value of the policy itself.

The fall in the value in the case of LIC could be due to a high number of new policyholders surrendering their policy due to the prevailing situation. However this is not so evident in the case of Private insurers. The impact of COVID-19 could have been more pronounced in the case of households with lower earnings which is reflected in the huge increase in the number of surrendered LIC policies.

The trends for surrendered claims are influenced by various factors and is not entirely possible to zero down on specific reasons for these trends. However certain broad influencing factors could be highlighted. One major influencing factor could be the economic slowdown resulting in the surrender of policies by households with lower earnings especially in the case of LIC policyholders. The years in the aftermath of Demonetisation as well as the COVID-19 pandemic reported an increase in surrender claims.

Meanwhile the Monetary Board has raised the minimum capital for rural banks to P50 million from as little as P10 million compliance to which the affected entities must do within the next five years.

According to Rural Bankers Association of the Philippines (RBAP) the industry is embracing the advantages of digitalization in order to remain relevant in a business environment that has been reshaped by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Digital transformation as the buzzword goes makes “deploying financial services as easy as tapping on a screen while [the rural banking industry remains] grounded in its role as a vital provider of financial services that uplifts the lives of our countryside’s economic drivers—the farmers the fisherfolk and the microentrepreneurs” RBAP said in a statement.

As of Aug. 31 the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) lists 380 licensed rural banks across the archipelago. The latest list of RBAP members counts 358 such banks.

In January then RBAP president Albert Concha Jr. said the group was anticipating an upward push this year on countryside incomes especially with the upcoming national elections in May that brings “immense multiplier benefits to the local economies.”

In Circular No. 1151 dated Aug. 24 the BSP said its policymaking body approved last Aug. 4 Resolution No. 1145 which approves the increase of minimum capital requirements for rural banks.

This is part of initiatives under the Rural Bank Strengthening Program intended to enhance operations capacity and competitiveness of these banks.

“A strong capital base enables rural banks to enhance their risk management systems upgrade resources and manage operational costs meet prudential standards and accelerate digital transformation” Circular 1151 stated.

The requirements set the minimum capital for rural banks with a head office only as well as those with up to five branches at P50 million (from P10 million); those with six to 10 branches at P120 million (P15 million); and those with more than 10 branches at P200 million (P20 million).

“The revised minimum capital requirements shall result in stronger and well-capitalized rural banks underpinning a Philippine banking system that is stable sound resilient and inclusive for Filipinos” BSP Governor Felipe Medalla said in a statement."

Sep 2 2022 10:00 AM ET

Originally published on PSEG ENERGIZE!

It seemed like a normal work day in Gas Distribution & Field Construction a few weeks before the 2020 pandemic hit but when a coworker entered Office Administrator Liz Sylvester’s office on a routine matter – Sylvester knew something was wrong. That encounter turned into a blessing that has earned Sylvester a new title “God sister” after she donated her kidney to her coworker Bernice Rivera Adams’ elder sister Marilyn and likely saved her life.

“Liz is just a super human being all around” said Bernice project controls manager Gas System Modernization who has known Liz for more than 5 years. “It took my breath away just the thought of her offering so quickly.”

Liz Sylvester didn’t know Marilyn Rivera who had been on dialysis for nearly 5 years before the successful kidney transplant took place in May 2021. She didn’t know of her depression or anxiety or belief that she would never receive a kidney.

“I can’t even explain why I did what I did. When I was talking to Bernice I just felt at that moment it was something I had to do” Sylvester said. “It is life changing. It’s a good feeling I have. Every day I wake up and say ‘Wow I really helped somebody.’ Maybe this is what I was put on this earth to do.”

Helping somebody

Liz Sylvester said she may have been more inclined to help because of her 12-year experience taking care of her own mother Gerri Kuo who needed a heart transplant but had too many complications to receive one. Kuo passed in 2014 three months after surviving a stroke while in surgery.

“It was a traumatic time and my kids were young” Sylvester said. “It didn’t end well for my mother but I knew this was something I could do for somebody.” She also said she has a 53-year-old brother who was born with only one kidney which never kept him from living a “perfectly fine” life.

This isn’t the first time Sylvester has made a quick life changing decision. When she was 24 after losing a good job Sylvester saw a commercial signed up and spent 4 years as a “radio man” in the U.S. Navy before joining PSE&G. And it’s at PSE&G where she met her husband of 20 years Scott Sylvester senior customer operations supervisor Harmon Cove District Operations.

“My wife has a huge heart” Scott Sylvester said. “She has all of the characteristics that I love. She is task oriented smart attractive…and she’s a great role model for our daughter. I’ve told my wife this ‘People have heroes you are my hero. I just can’t believe you would do this for somebody.’ It just boggles my mind. I have so much respect love and awe of this because I’ve got to tell you I’m not sure I could do it.”

Never back out

The first complication the couple had was thinking about whether either of their teen children might need a kidney one day. But Sylvester’s doctor told them it would be rare for the need to arise before decades and at that point Sylvester’s kidney wouldn’t be viable to donate.

The next complication was COVID-19. It distracted medical staff and added extra tests and delays to an already arduous process to the point where Sylvester was hounding the hospital for test results and next steps. It also meant that Sylvester had to go through very difficult procedures alone because visitors weren’t allowed in medical facilities. Even after COVID-19 started waning this spring before Scott put up a fuss the hospital told him he wouldn’t be allowed to accompany Sylvester for the transplant procedure and recovery.

It gave Sylvester plenty of time and excuses for backing out – but she said her resolve only wavered once the night before surgery. She asked Scott if she was doing the right thing and he provided just the comfort and support she needed.

Even Bernice told Sylvester that she wouldn’t hold her to her commitment.

“There were times my sister didn’t even know if she wanted to do this and Liz would cheer her on and say ‘Yes we’re going to do this’” Bernice said. “Even after the transplant Liz was up and moving and trying to get my sister up and moving. She’s just incredible. She’s just that extra strength we needed to get through this.”

A giving nature

District Manager Regulatory Policy & Procedure Chris LaRossa who remembers overhearing Liz say she would get tested to see if she was a donor match was surprised to learn after a year that things had progressed to the point of surgery.

“The first time they met was a few days before the transplant” LaRossa said. “It’s an incredible story and we need to celebrate Liz.”

Sylvester said she didn’t tell many people before the surgery allowing herself room to change her mind but never needing that space.

“If you can help somebody why wouldn’t you especially nowadays when you know how things are and you can live a normal healthy life without a second kidney” Sylvester said.

Sylvester’s manager Gas Administrative Manager Ben Sieradzki said that he wasn’t surprised when Liz informed him she was moving forward with this not just because of the experience with her mom but it is just her nature to help people anyway she can.

“Liz is all about action and getting things done – it’s her passion” Sieradzki said. “This goes above and beyond anyone’s expectation and just shows what extraordinary people we have all around the company.”

Of course no one is more thrilled than Marilyn who now chats with Sylvester as often as she can.

“I know it’s a healthy kidney because Liz is a strong beautiful healthy person. The kidney to me right now is gold” Marilyn said. “She gave me a second chance at life. I truly love her as a sister my God sister.”

A Manhattan-based storage company is poking fun at Prince Andrew’s sex abuse scandal and the multimillion-dollar settlement he paid to keep it in the closet — with massive new billboards around the Big Apple.

“Safe Secure Protected with minimal charges. Just like Prince Andrew” the Manhattan Mini Storage ads declare.

The snarky billboards were rolled out on several Manhattan high-rises and buildings including on the West Side Highway near 45th Street in Hell’s Kitchen and the old New York Post building on the FDR which is now a Manhattan Mini Storage.

On the firm’s website another version of the ad proclaims “Who says protection is a privilege reserved for the 1 percent?”

The disgraced Duke of York’s reputation went up in flames after he was accused of having sex with then-17-year-old Virginia Giuffre while she was trafficked by late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein in 2001.

Prince Andrew gave a disastrous BBC interview in 2019 defending his friendship with the prolific perv and Giuffre sued the royal for the alleged sex abuse in August 2021. He has never been criminally charged.

He was later stripped of his public duties and paid an her an estimated $12 million in an out-of-court settlement.

Manhattan Mini Storage’s billboards are known for being controversial and political including a 2007 ad that declared “Your closet space is shrinking as fast as her right to choose.”

Birmingham Alabama-based Arlington Properties is looking to build a 319-unit apartment complex with a 4.68-acre lake fronting Summerlin Road and a commercial/retail building at the southeast corner of Winkler and Gladiolus public records show. The developer did not return calls seeking comment.

A Lee County hearing examiner recommended approving the project July 14. The Lee County Board of County Commissioners has yet to vote on the rezoning and a voting date has yet to be set.

The land has been used for farming both plant nurseries and U-Pick produce operations for decades but has been in the works to be something other than a farm for a while.

In 1993 the Lee County commission approved the rezoning of the land from agricultural to mixed-used commercial with “Summerlin Towne Centre” proposed shopping center that never came to fruition.

There are two parcels with two owners that would be combined into one if Arlington Properties decides to purchase the land and proceed with the apartment complex.

The western portion at 8691 Gladiolus is 13 acres and owned by R&K Farms LLC. The eastern portion at 8591 Gladiolus is about 18.55 acres and owned by Margie Geddes who bought it in March 1994 for $1.5 million property records show.

Just to the east an 11.6-acre parcel was bought by Florida Storage Gladiolus LLC for $4 million. That land has been cleared and a new self-storage facility has broken ground there at the southwest flyover intersection of Summerlin Road and Gladiolus.

Rumors circulated that Costco was looking to move from its U.S. 41 location in south Fort Myers to the parcel being considered Arlington Properties. Costco’s parent company based in Washington declined to comment.

But Barry Bland general manager of the Fort Myers Costco store confirmed there’s no news about any imminent relocation of the store.

“We’re not at that point” Bland said.

Bland said the rumors didn’t surprise him adding he has been scouting other locations because the current one has a cramped parking lot and could use more space inside. But there isn’t any alternative for Costco to relocate at this time.

“I think right now for how our business is going when we move it’s always a big deal” Bland said. “Everyone you talk to there’s always a rumor. Until they get something done there’s really nothing to report.”

Big-box retailers are running into challenges in finding land to build new stores especially in the interior of the region west of Interstate 75 area land brokers told Gulfshore Business.

“Obviously 41 is over with” said John Mounce founding partner of the LandQwest brokerage company. “For a box the size that we’re talking about— any of those guys— you’re looking at 20 acres. You cannot find 20 acres with 41 frontage in the corridor you would want to be in. You can’t even assemble it. It’s getting really difficult.”

Mounce pointed to Home Depot getting ready to build a new store not near U.S. 41 but instead near I-75.

Justin Thibaut the CEO of LSI Companies was asked if Costco can’t go on the farmland where can it go?

There aren’t many options.

“My answer to that is I would be shocked if there’s any piece that’s more than 10 acres in all of Lee County that’s not being eyeballed for apartments” Thibaut said. “Costco is a big land eater. That’s not a small parcel that they need for all of the parking that they require. Right now they’re up against the guys who are doing multifamily mixed-use retail. They’re paying more per acre more per square foot than a traditional big-box store does.

“Maybe five-to-seven years ago Costco could have done something there. But we have pressure on available housing now. That’s driving up rents which is driving up what multifamily buyers can pay for the dirt.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb2xpY2UxLmNvbS9wb2xpY2UtcHJvZHVjdHMvcG9saWNlLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kvcG9saWNlLXNvZnR3YXJlL2FydGljbGVzL3doeS11c2luZy10aGUtY2xvdWQtaXMtYWJvdXQtbW9yZS10aGFuLWp1c3QtZWZmaWNpZW50LXN0b3JhZ2UtVGhES0Nrc2hYeGZpa2Z6eS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why using the cloud is about more than just efficient storage,"By Police1 BrandFocus Staff

When used to its fullest capabilities by police departments the cloud can be one of the most powerful efficient and effective weapons in the law enforcement arsenal.

Storing data on password-secured records management systems (RMS) cloud platforms optimizes information sharing between law enforcement agencies. This boosts their ability to work with each other on police cases expanding the reach of their investigations beyond individual jurisdictions in an efficient accurate and cost-effective manner. Given that criminals tend to work across jurisdictions it only makes sense for law enforcement to do the same – while staying entirely within the letter and intent of the law.

Within a department itself storing records in the cloud ensures full access to all authorized members of the force whether they are in patrol cars using mobile data terminals tablets or laptop computers; at the station using desktop computers; on foot using smartphones or tablets or even at home or out of town using whichever authorized devices are at hand.

THE MANY BENEFITS OF CLOUD-BASED POLICE WORK

When police data is stored shared and made accessible in the cloud investigators can quickly identify and correlate patterns of crime. They can collaboratively examine every piece of evidence from different departments to form a larger more detailed picture of a perpetrator’s actions plans identities and errors – all of which can be analyzed to solve crimes more quickly.

But a cloud-based RMS can do much more for police departments. It can streamline their operations from end to end making them more effective accountable and transparent. Additionally when law enforcement agencies deploy cloud-based solutions like CivicEye’s CivicRMS the chance of officers making input errors is significantly reduced.

This speeds up police productivity and prosecutorial success in court. And when this data is centrally secured monitored and defended by a dedicated provider like CivicEye it stays safe from hackers and other hostile players.

Real-time access to data on the cloud also allows officers to work more efficiently and effectively reducing time spent on paperwork and letting them spend more time fighting crime. These results enhance officers’ feelings of job satisfaction and making a difference in their communities.

In turn enhancing morale throughout the department creates a trickle-down effect that aids in reducing officer burnout and improving employee retention. Meanwhile officers who feel better about their working conditions and work lives are more likely to be in a better frame of mind to interact with the public. This improved attitude means fewer complaints from citizens and a more positive image for the department within the community.

AN END-TO-END CLOUD SOLUTION

CivicEye’s CivicRMS is an end-to-end cloud-based platform that integrates organizes stores shares and makes accessible to authorized users all allowable aspects of a police department’s records management system.

Storing data on the cloud is what makes CivicRMS so useful to law enforcement as the system can integrate with a jurisdiction’s computer-aided dispatch (CAD) system prosecutor and court data systems and jail information system (JIS).

Using interactive web-based dashboards that constantly refresh with real-time information CivicRMS supports a full range of police investigatory and record-keeping functions. For instance it can integrate CAD data to add incident scene maps into the files including time-based data on who was where during the events.

The system can also let officers search all accessible police records using qualifiers such as person contacts identification scars tattoos and locations. As well vehicles and their registration tags can be checked using master license and law enforcement activity databases – all while officers are on foot in their cars or at the station.

A MODULAR APPROACH

To simplify the record-keeping process CivicRMS is built as a series of interconnected modules covering multiple areas of police activity all to instill efficiency and boost accuracy.

The CivicRMS training module is one effective administrative tool that keeps track of each officer’s educational requirements and fulfilments making it easy for the department to report this data to state and federal officials.

In the same vein of efficiency and accuracy the CivicRMS evidence module ensures that all collected information is properly stored with a solid chain of custody in place and with the ability to support appropriate authorized access by law enforcement and court officials.

Finally the CivicRMS field interview module provides a step-by-step recording process to officers in the field for asking and answering all necessary questions to suspects and witnesses the first time they interview them. This kind of electronic record taking reduces an officer’s reliance on manual note taking while ensuring that all recorded data is compliant with National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) standards.

Because the field questioning process acts as a checklist to ensure no detail is forgotten it significantly reduces the need for follow-up interviews and allows evidence to be compiled sooner. In turn this allows investigators to draw accurate conclusions faster and solve crimes quicker concluding with reports that take less time to prepare.

THE BIG PICTURE

The use of cloud-based records management systems can make a real difference in a police department’s overall productivity. By storing and sharing records in the cloud departments can raise their case-solving capabilities to the next level harnessing the power of information technology and the web to do much more with the people and financial resources that they have.

Taking a big picture view of this situation the improvements made possible to law enforcement through the cloud are as substantial and transformative as the replacement of horses with police cars whistles with two-way radios and voice-only one-way dispatch with multimedia two-way CAD. Moving to cloud-based RMS is a must for today’s agencies and a platform like CivicEye’s CivicRMS is a fast cost-effective and easy-to-learn way to do so.

Brooks Chadwick is proposing to build 29 homes on nearly 18 acres of the Powers property which includes a 13-acre lake.

But the developer isn’t seeking a change from the present R-20 zoning so there won’t be any public meetings.

Todd Thrasher a managing partner at Brooks Chadwick Capital LLC told East Cobb News that although there’s a denser R-15 neighborhood nearby “we feel like our future community will be prettier and allow for a better development as an R-20 community than if we were to rezone and cramming for density on our site.”

The issue of density has come up about the project and Thrasher said “I wanted the community to know that we’re not putting up apartments.”

Density has become a hot topic in recent months in an area of Northeast Cobb that’s been undergoing substantial development.

Cobb commissioners last fall approved a 92-home subdivision on Ebenezer Road despite objections from nearby residents over density and stormwater issues but the developer Pulte Homes later pulled out of the project.

The forthcoming redevelopment of a corner of the Johnson Ferry-Shallowford intersection for East Cobb Church and housing is still in plan review with the county with the density of residential units still at issue.

Also last year commissioners approved the redevelopment of the Sprayberry Corners Shopping Center that includes senior apartments. A plan to include market-rate apartments was scotched by the developer Atlantic Realty after commissioner JoAnn Birrell opposed them.

The Powers property is is in an area that is strictly single-family residential.

The homes being planned by Brooks Chadwick in its 23rd residential development in East Cobb would start at around 4000 square feet with prices starting around $1 million.

Thrasher said they’re just inside the Lassiter High School attendance zone and will have one access point on Shallowford Road.

“A lot of our properties have been in the Lassiter area” he added including an 81-home subdivision on either side of Wesley Chapel Road near Garrison Mill Elementary School that was rezoned in 2020.

Brooks Chadwick sold off those 49 acres to other developers and Thrasher said his firm is likely to follow suit with the Shallowford Road property.

“We’ll buy the land put the street in” as well as other basic infrastructure before selling off to another homebuilder Thrasher said.

The Powers property includes 42 acres and he said that land along the north side bordered by Eula Drive is being sold to another builder for nine residential lots.

While in some ways the move is business as usual — the Quest 2 is powered by the Snapdragon XR2 chipset — it could provide insight into Meta's compromises as it faces declines in revenue and tries to keep the spiraling expenses of Mark's metaverse project in check.

What the Qualcomm deal shows is that Meta's upcoming headsets which reportedly include a high-end headset codenamed Cambria and later new versions of its cheaper Quest headset won't run on completely customized Meta-designed silicon.

This is despite competing companies like Apple Amazon and Google making product decisions around custom chip designs like M2 Graviton3 and Tensor — and the fact that Meta's had a team dedicated to doing the same since 2018. This press release says the chips will be ""customized"" for Meta's needs. Still we don't know how much space that can put between its ""premium"" devices and other manufacturers' hardware that hews closely to Qualcomm's Snapdragon XR reference designs.

In April The Verge reported that Meta employees were working with semiconductor fabs — the companies that actually produce the physical chips — to make custom chips for its as-of-yet unannounced AR headset. That same month The Information reported that some of Meta’s efforts to create custom chips were hitting roadblocks pushing it to use a Qualcomm chip for its second-gen Ray-Bay smart glasses instead of its own silicon.

Related Mark Zuckerberg confirms new Meta VR headset will launch in October

Tyler Yee a Meta spokesperson said that the company doesn't discuss details about how its roadmap has evolved and wouldn't comment on any specific plans it may have had for custom chips for Quest products. However Yee did share a statement on the company's ""general approach to custom silicon"" saying that Meta doesn't believe in a ""one-size-fits-all approach"" for the tech powering its future devices.

""There could be situations where we use off-the-shelf silicon or work with industry partners on customizations while also exploring our own novel silicon solutions. There could also be scenarios where we use both partner and custom solutions in the same product"" he said. ""It is all about doing what is needed to create the best metaverse experiences possible.""

Meta’s betting big on the metaverse but some of its projects have reportedly run into roadblocks

There are other signs showing where Meta has scaled back its VR / AR ambitions. The company currently uses Android to power the Quest but it was reportedly working on its own operating system for its virtual and augmented reality devices. According to a report from The Information it suspended work on a specific project called XROS though the company responded to that article by saying that it was ""still working on a highly specialized OS for our devices."" Still the ""microkernel-based operating system"" that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said was in the works in 2021 hasn't appeared yet.

The backdrop to all this is a company facing a lot of pressure. Meta's revenue has dipped for the first time (thanks in part to Apple's changes to how apps are allowed to track users) and Zuckerberg explicitly stated plans to turn up the heat on employees while admitting ""I think some of you might just say that this place isn't for you. And that self-selection is okay with me."" At the same time he's making a massive bet on the metaverse — the company is spending and losing billions of dollars per year on the project which includes AR and VR headsets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMDIvbWV0YS1hbmQtcXVhbGNvbW0tc3RyaWtlLWRlYWwtdG8tbWFrZS1jdXN0b20tdmlydHVhbC1yZWFsaXR5LWNoaXBzLmh0bWzSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMi8wOS8wMi9tZXRhLWFuZC1xdWFsY29tbS1zdHJpa2UtZGVhbC10by1tYWtlLWN1c3RvbS12aXJ0dWFsLXJlYWxpdHktY2hpcHMuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meta and Qualcomm strike deal to make custom virtual reality chips for metaverse applications,"Facebook parent Meta and Qualcomm will work on making virtual reality chips for various metaverse applications.

Meta and Qualcomm are teaming up to develop custom chipsets for virtual reality products the companies announced on Friday.

The two U.S. technology giants have signed a multi-year agreement ""to collaborate on a new era of spatial computing"" using Qualcomm's ""extended reality"" (XR) Snapdragon technology. Extended reality refers to technologies including virtual and augmented reality which merge the physical and digital world.

""We're working with Qualcomm Technologies on customized virtual reality chipsets — powered by Snapdragon XR platforms and technology — for our future roadmap of Quest products"" Mark Zuckerberg CEO of Meta said in a press release.

The Quest products are Meta's line of virtual reality headsets. The Meta Quest 2 headset currently uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon XR2 chipset.

Since its rebrand in 2021 Facebook-parent Meta has staked its future on the metaverse — a term that encompasses virtual and augmented reality technology — with the aim of having people working and playing in digital worlds in the near future.

In the smartphone field companies ranging from Apple to Samsung have designed their own custom processors to differentiate from competitors and create better products than they might have using off-the-shelf chips.

A focus on custom chips by Meta makes sense as it looks to differentiate its headsets and possibly create unique experiences for users.

""Unlike mobile phones building virtual reality brings novel multi-dimensional challenges in spatial computing cost and form factor"" Zuckerberg said. ""These chipsets will help us keep pushing virtual reality to its limits and deliver awesome experiences.""

The length of the deal between the companies and financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

It comes as Meta gears up to launch a new virtual reality headset in October even as losses widened in its Reality Labs division which includes its VR business in the second quarter of the year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvYWR0b3ZyLmNvbS9tZXRhLXF1YWxjb21tLXhyLXNuYXBkcmFnb24tcGFydG5lcnNoaXAtYXBwbGUtc2lsaWNvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meta & Qualcomm Partner on XR Chips Likely Defending Against Apple,"Two of the biggest names in XR—headset maker Meta and chip maker Qualcomm—today announced a “multi-year broad strategic agreement” to collaborate on “customized virtual reality chipsets” for future devices.

Qualcomm a leading provider of smartphone processors was an early mover in the XR space by pushing variants of its Snapdragon mobile processors as ideal for use in both AR and VR headsets—a play which now sees the company’s product in the vast majority of standalone headsets available on the market today.

Meta has used Qualcomm processors in all of its standalone headsets to date—Go Quest and Quest 2—and is expected to do the same in its forthcoming Project Cambria headset.

Today Meta and Qualcomm jointly announced they have entered into a “multi-year broad strategic agreement” to work together on XR platform development. The agreement was a big enough deal that the CEOs of both companies made the announcement together during the IFA 2022 conference.

“We’re working with Qualcomm Technologies on customized virtual reality chipsets— powered by Snapdragon XR platforms and technology—for our future roadmap of Quest products” said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. “As we continue to build more advanced capabilities and experiences for virtual and augmented reality it has become more important to build specialized technologies to power our future VR headsets and other devices.”

With the companies having already worked together over the last several years it’s a curious announcement—what gives?

On its face the announcement likely represents a commitment by Qualcomm to make Meta a top priority client over the next several years devoting more time to the company and offering it more influence over future Snapdragon XR chips from Qualcomm. And with Meta believing that it’s going to take a complete rethinking of the typical computing architecture to make the sci-fi vision of XR a reality the companies will probably be prototyping together on that front as well.

But there’s likely another major reason for this partnership—it brings two allies together against a common threat: Apple.

Though Apple hasn’t formally announced any XR products yet all signs point to a long history of R&D and a desire for the company to dominate the space. For Meta which itself wants to control the destiny of XR that’s a problem. Mark Zuckerberg has been eyeing this potentiality since at least as far back as 2015 which drove him to buy Oculus in the first place—in an effort to get out ahead of companies like Apple and Google in the nascent XR space.

But Apple is a problem for Qualcomm too… Apple is sure to use its own custom processors (colloquially referred to as ‘Apple silicon’) in its XR products. By definition then the greater marketshare that Apple has in the XR space the fewer Snapdragon chips Qualcomm will sell.

Apple has long been building its own custom processors for its smartphones which has given the company and edge over competitors using commodity chips. In the last few years Apple has also begun phasing out third-party processors in favor of its own chips in its PC products signaling a maturation of the company’s microprocessor design and fabrication capabilities.

For Meta the partnership with Qualcomm buttresses a strategic vulnerability by giving the company a committed ally that can make chips that are highly specialized for XR devices.

For Qualcomm the partnership with Meta is an effort to ensure that Apple doesn’t easily dominate the XR market and snuff out the company’s opportunity to sell chips to a wide variety of non-Apple XR device makers.

Ultimately the partnership is a maneuver in a fight for early ground in a market that the companies expect will one day be worth trillions of dollars."

Signed into law in July by Governor Gretchen Whitmer the passage of Senate Bill 134 means it is now a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail and a $1000 fine for someone to “distribute deliver sell or possess with intent to distribute deliver or sell a drug masking product.”

Synthetic urine human urine and any substance designed to be added to human urine hair or saliva fall for the purpose of defrauding a drug test falls under the category of a “drug masking product” as defined by the law.

This new law targets smoke shops where these products are sold more than directly at cannabis consumers.

However Leah Skylar Dotson interim chair of the Michigan Democratic Party Cannabis Caucus said it does muddy the water on where Michigan is heading regarding marijuana regulations.

“With marijuana being legal we’re still in a weird spot in our state where a lot of businesses are still requiring you to drug test and be cannabis free” Dotson said. “Some of the conversation a lot of us have been having is that we need to update all of our laws in our state because we’re fighting against the stigmatization in a lot of these businesses.”

THC the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana may be detected by urine screens for up to a month after the user’s high has faded and it’s been legal for any adult in Michigan to buy grow transport or use since 2018.

According to the latest report by the state Marijuana Regulatory Agency recreational dispensaries made over $2.4 billion in sales during the month of April alone. Even with more and more people using marijuana in Michigan many company and government human resource departments are slow to alter their own policies and often still treat THC use the same as illicit drugs alongside heroin cocaine opiates and benzodiazepines.

In May Jamie Callahan spoke on behalf of the bill’s sponsor Sen. Curt VanderWall R-Ludington at a House Health Policy Committee meeting where he said it’s unfortunate some people have taken steps to mask their drug test results in the workplace.

“This has led to the rise of a market where some substances can be acquired to skirt the test” Callahan said. “I think we can all agree that we don’t want people endangering others on the job or even themselves and we would hate to see someone get hurt because they faked their drug test.”

Synthetic urine is sold under brand names like UPass Synthetix5 and Quick Fix with descriptors like “novelty” or “fetish urine” possibly to obscure the intended use especially in states where masking products are banned.

The liquid appears indistinguishable to urine made of creatinine coloring sometimes uric acid or other chemicals and mimics the characteristics of urine usually rendering its fraudulent nature undetectable to the standard urine screen.

Barry Sample the senior science consultant with Quest Diagnostics Employer Solutions also testified in support of the legislation at the May 19 committee meeting on behalf of Quest Diagnostics.

Quest Diagnostics is an American clinical laboratory that has performed workforce drug testing since 1988 according to Sample. He said in his testimony that the national overall positivity rate for drug tests performed by the company has decreased from 13.5% in 1988 to 4.6% today.

While this could be because of a decrease in drug use by workers Sample said a rise in products to deceive drug tests may also be culpable.

“As laboratories enhanced their tests for specimen validity the anti-drug testing industry responded with a continual evolution and sophistication of the products and devices used to defeat the drug testing process” Sample said. “It is a continual ‘cat and mouse’ game and unfortunately this industry is developing systems that may be undetectable by laboratories.

“As a scientist who has pursued drug test cheaters I can tell you how frustrating it is to encounter technology being used to subvert the drug testing process.”

Rick Thompson executive director for the cannabis advocacy group NORML of Michigan said in a written statement to MLive that people should be judged by the quality of their job performance “not the content of their bloodstream.”

“Correlation is not causality; the presence of cannabinoids in one’s body should never be assumed to be an indicator of their reliability performance or danger level they present to employers” he wrote. “When lawmakers use 1950′s fearmongering to justify attacks on the common people in 2022′s Michigan it shows how little they understand about how cannabis affects the human body- and how widespread its use is in society.”

Dotson said outlawing the distribution of products to defraud urine tests won’t prevent people from finding and using alternative methods.

“There are certain cleanses that you can drink and things that will cleanse your system quicker” Dotson said. “Those to my knowledge... are not necessarily targeted so there would still be loopholes available.”

Senate Bill 135 was initially tie-barred to Senate Bill 134 and would have upped the punishment for commercially selling these products from a one year misdemeanor to an up to five year felony.

That piece of legislation has remained in the Senate Health Policy and Human Services since first being introduced last February.

Dotson said this punishment was too harsh for a cannabis regulation when there are more serious crimes that need law enforcements attention.

“If you’re telling me that somebody who owns a convenience shop is selling synthetic urine and we’re going to put them in prison for five years... it’s not the direction we need to go” Dotson said.

Dotson believes it’s time consuming cannabis in ones own home should start to be treated like alcohol consumption and that a conversation needs to be had at the federal level for businesses who have to test for cannabis in order to receive federal funding.

There were a few glaring differences between reporters' return to the place that houses the heartbeat of our coverage and the last time we walked down the hallway of the Quest Diagnostics Training Center and into what doubles as both the players' escape from the football field and the clubhouse in which every team hopes team chemistry and a winning culture foster.

The last time at the end of the 2019 season Pat Shurmur was the head coach. That was two head coaches ago.

The last time Eli Manning was on the team. He retired a month later and in his place nowadays is a plaque honoring Manning as a two-time Super Bowl champion above the name plate at the stall that was his one that now belongs to defensive lineman Nick Williams.

The starting quarterback of this team Daniel Jones has slid down the row to one of the ""luxury"" lockers as former Giants first-rounder Justin Pugh once called them now that Manning has traded in his helmet and shoulder pads for the team's business office and ""Monday Night Football"" shenanigans with Peyton.

Jones now has Kadarius Toney to his left and Sterling Shepard is next to Toney - the longest-tenured Giant having shifted to the opposite side of the room from where he was his first four seasons.

Schoen:Daniel Jones expectations and more in Joe Schoen's state of the Giants

""Welcome back"" Blake Martinez quipped as he walked to the exit the opposite direction of the media crowd. As we found out a few hours later the Giants had released Martinez a two-time captain who never had the chance to hold a single interview at his locker during his tenure.

A new era of Giants football is here and beyond the stories that unfold on the field it's the perspective gained face-to-face being able to have a conversation and promise accountability with our presence that's why being back matters.

Quarterback Davis Webb was seated a few lockers down from where he was when Manning was infamously benched by Ben McAdoo and Jerry Reese five years ago. He joked about again being in a prime spot for all the action considering Saquon Barkley is directly to his right and Kenny Golladay to his left.

""Busy part of the neighborhood"" Webb said with a laugh before sharing his excitement about having tickets to the U.S. Open for the next two days which includes another prime time showcase for Serena Williams. He's always been a tennis fan given his mother Donna was a decorated player in college and admitted to screaming at the TV when Williams prevailed in three sets to advance.

The Giants still have elements befitting a players' lounge: a ping pong table and a putting mat. Once grouped by position the entire team is seemingly interspersed throughout. The rookies - first-rounders Kayvon Thibodeaux and Evan Neal included - are still in temporary lockers in the center of the room.

You could tell that Thursday was a bit of a feeling-out period and admittedly that was the case for me. I had the opportunity to meet former Jets safety Jason Pinnock claimed by the Giants after being released Tuesday.

Pinnock told me he got the call from his agent at 12:10 p.m. Wednesday learning the Giants had claimed him.

His response: ""I'm good to go. What's the address? I look good in blue.""

Giants:The road to their 53-man roster and how it all shakes out

Pinnock did not have far to drive. Coincidentally he was just here a week ago and I asked if he had any sense the Giants might be interested when he was here for the Jets-Giants joint practice.

""No idea"" Pinnock said before adding with a smile: ""But I thought I saw T-Mac eyeing me a little bit.""

That's Giants special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey who will likely have Pinnock as a mainstay on his units.

Same for Giants newcomer Tony Jefferson who was open about considering retirement a while back. He had come back from a severe knee injury and multiple surgeries. Now?

""I'm all in man. It's the Big Apple. See the skyline from the field"" Jefferson said. ""I think I'm ready to play the best ball of my career.""

Jefferson said he knew the Ravens wanted him back after releasing him earlier this week. Why not return?

He saw the same path to the field that led him to be cut with high-priced and highly-valued safeties ahead of Jefferson on the depth chart so why not go for a better opportunity with defensive coordinator Wink Martindale who coached him in Baltimore.

""When we saw each other"" Jefferson said ""Adoree' Jackson told me they haven't seen Wink smile that much all summer.""

A reminder of just how fast this game moves for a rebuilding team desperately seeking upgrades: both Pinnock and Jefferson had makeshift name plates above their lockers their names and numbers scribbled in marker. They weren't here Wednesday but could play significant roles in just over a week when the Giants open the season in Nashville against the Titans.

There were free agents who participated in tryouts getting dressed in lockers in the same area as undrafted rookie cornerback Darren Evans with the Giants since May. Evans was cleaning out his locker after being waived Thursday.

These are the scenes that often unfold the reality of the world many of these players live in. This is a game they have played all their lives but this is their job too as it is for us.

Sterling Shepard recently asked about my daughter whose first day of middle school was Thursday. I remember being at his locker when his oldest daughter Cali Clay was born and he talked about late nights on the couch and changing diapers.

Been there done that I told him.

One of my favorite stories on the beat would have never come to be had we not been in the locker room. Former Giants wide receiver Russell Shepard had a backpack in his locker that had a ton of stadium security tags still attached.

So I asked him about it. The story: Shepard wanted it that way six seasons' worth of games and ups and downs in the league (and those tags) as he fought to earn his keep and keep his job. ""Every once in a while I had to beg the security on the road games to not cut them off"" he told me. ""Every one is the story of my NFL journey.""

The NFL journey is told in stadiums and practice fields across the league in front offices and in tryouts for players doing everything to get back in. We were back inside Thursday and it's a game-changer.

Football is a game often won inside-out and the same can be said for football reporting.

Because it's a privilege to have the chance for 45 minutes every day to go inside a locker room and make the most of the relationships created by trust talent and hard work and not without appreciation of those you are writing about.

It's great to be back inside and not just through text messages Zoom meetings and analyzing from afar.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZWhlYWx0aGNhcmUuY29tL2hlYWx0aC10ZWNoLzk4cG9pbnQ2LXJhaXNlcy0yMG0tcGFydG5lcnMtbXVsdGljYXJlcy1pbmRpZ28taGVhbHRoLWV4cGFuZC1hY2Nlc3MtY2FyZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,98point6 raises $20M partners with MultiCare's Indigo Health to expand access to care,"MultiCare’s Indigo Health the urgent care division of the health system announced a collaboration with on-demand virtual primary care company 98point6.

The partnership marks 98point6’s first venture as a third-party software provider an endeavor supported by the $20 million raised to scale the offering from existing investors including L Catterton and Activant Capital. The text-based digital primary care service will now offer its platform to Indigo Health’s hybrid ambulatory care program. Since its founding in 2015 Indigo Health has expanded to 35 urgent care clinics across Washington state along with a virtual care component and primary care services. 98point6 was founded in 2015 with the goal of providing text-based primary care.

“We started with a simple idea: to make a visit to the doctor as convenient and satisfying as going to your favorite coffee shop” said Ryan Fix president of retail health at MultiCare in a statement. “Our strategic partnership with 98point6 will help us scale our digital capabilities to meet community demand and bring a new level of meaningful engagement to our customers. The health care landscape is changing quickly with big players in the technology and healthcare sectors making significant investments in this direction. We know customers are eager to see the healthcare industry evolve and enhance digital capabilities for better care.”

MultiCare Health is the largest health system in Washington state. The Tacoma-based company was founded in 1882 and now encompasses 11 hospitals comprehensive specialty care and the urgent care division Indigo Health. The health system has continued to grow with recent small milestones including the acquisition of a family health center previously run by the University of Washington Medicine’s Valley Medical Center and breaking ground on a community emergency room.

""Indigo Health’s strategic partnership is a major milestone toward our vision to make achieving optimal health a reality for everyone"" said Jay Burrell president of 98point6 in a statement. ""Labor shortages lagging technologies and a dynamic market have placed tremendous pressure on health systems to innovate across their customer journey technology infrastructure and operating models.""

Through primary care in all 50 states 98point6 connects users with clinicians and AI-powered chatbots texts and digital images. In 2021 the platform expanded into behavioral health and collaborated with Quest Diagnostics to incorporate patient labs into its platform. The Seattle company saw membership rocket 274% in 2020 due to a pandemic-era move to virtual healthcare.

The platform provides virtual primary care and integrated behavioral care with a belief that its text-based model circumvents barriers to care reaching new patients who might not otherwise seek assistance. Aug. 17 the company announced the expansion of its behavioral health care to adolescents.

Nearly 1 in 5 children and teens in the U.S. have a mental emotional or behavioral disorder according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Only 20% of children with such diagnoses receive care from a specialized mental health care provider. The CDC cited a lack of physical proximity to care as a reason for a shortage of treatment. For these reasons the department is promoting the expansion of digital health programs.

Related 98point6 expands into behavioral health with rising demand for mental health support

“Healthcare is in a period of radical transformation—the previous growth and cost reduction strategies of healthcare organizations particularly health systems will no longer serve them” Burrell said. “Our team has learned a tremendous amount in the past seven years as a standalone virtual clinic. I’m tremendously excited about this next stage of our business as health systems leverage the 98point6 platform to deliver value to their patients and their organizations in new ways.”

98point6 raised $118 million in series E funding in 2020 and had raised $250 million total as of July 2022. While the company told GeekWire it is still in a growth phase it laid off 10% of its workforce in July amidst a slew of similar cutbacks across the tech industry.

MultiCare has seen its own recent challenges including a June data breach originating at Avamere Health Services LLC a third-party entity. The breach is estimated to have compromised the health information of over 18000 patients.

Tuesday Moody's Investors Service downgraded MultiCare’s revenue bonds to A1 from Aa3 with no mention of the data breach but a focus on $2 billion in outstanding debt. The outlook of the health system’s bonds has been revised from stable to negative. Moody’s foresees operational improvement in the second half of 2022 with faith placed in MultiCare’s robust ambulatory program.",,,,,,

For openers it's possible that the No. 25-ranked BYU Cougars will be the best team on USF's schedule — better than the Florida Gators or Louisville Cardinals better than any of the American Athletic Conference front-runners such as Houston Cincinnati and UCF.

BYU is a veteran team with 18 returning starters. The Cougars have size speed and guile. But when the Bulls examine what's required to beat BYU in Saturday's game at Raymond James Stadium the discussion should start with one player:

Cougars quarterback Jaren Hall a 6-foot-1 205 pounder.

He's on everyone's short list for the nation's best signal-callers. He passed for 2583 yards and 20 touchdowns in 10 starts in 2021 — and he didn't play in last season's 35-27 victory against the Bulls due to injury.

USF fans might remember the freshman version of Hall who got his first start on Oct. 12 2019 against the Bulls. Hall was 15-for-23 passing for 148 yards along with 83 yards rushing and a 29-yard score (he did not play in the fourth quarter due to injury and USF prevailed 27-23).

Hall is a problem.

""The hardest thing to prepare for as a defensive coach is a quarterback who can throw and run the traditional dual-threat quarterback'' USF first-year defensive coordinator Bob Shoop said. ""The quarterbacks who can run but can't throw create certain challenges. Quarterbacks who throw and can't run create certain challenges. But the guy who can do both is very very challenging for a defensive coach and a defensive unit.''

Shoop said he's confident that USF's defensive line will show significant improvement from last season when the Bulls' defense struggled to apply pressure (nine sacks all season). BYU's offense showed efficiency last season (55 red-zone trips 49 scores 41 touchdowns).

Shoop is wary of BYU's overall offensive talent. The Cougars have a pair of offensive linemen on the Outland Trophy and Lombardi Award watch lists — Blake Freeland (6-8 305) and Clark Barrington (6-6 305). Running back Tyler Algeier has graduated but BYU attracted Cal transfer Chris Brooks (6-1 230) who rushed for 1734 yards and 14 touchdowns in 40 games with the Golden Bears. BYU also has standout wide receivers in Gunner Romney (6-2 195) and Puka Nacua (6-2 205) but their availability for the opener has been questioned due to injuries.

""We've seen all the same things about Romney and Nacua'' Shoop said. ""I anticipate they're going to play but if they've don't if you follow their storyline during training camp some of their younger receivers really stepped up and had a great camp.

""They have a great connection between their quarterback and receivers. Whoever they have I don't think it's going to significantly change what they do. They're really good.''

And it all starts with Jaren Hall the BYU quarterback the focal point and the No. 1 priority for USF's defense.

Previous Meetings

USF and BYU are tied 1-1 in career meetings.

BYU downed USF 35-27 last Sept. 25 in Provo Utah. USF trailed 21-0 just 11 minutes into the game then outscored the Cougars 27-14 the rest of the way. USF's Jaren Mangham scored on a 1-yard run with 5:41 remaining to cap a 19-play 94-yard drive. But USF was out of timeouts and opted for an onside-kick attempt. BYU recovered and ran out the clock.

USF defeated BYU 27-23 in Tampa on Oct. 12 1979. On BYU's final drive the Cougars had third-and-10 at the USF 12-yard line but backup quarterback Baylor Romney was sacked for an 8-yard loss by linebacker Antonio Grier (one of seven current USF players to appear in the 2019 game). Romney's fourth-down pass attempt was incomplete.

Connections

It's a stretch to find commonalities between USF and BYU. The Cougars have one player from Florida — freshman wide receiver Dom Henry from Ponte Vedra Nease High School.

Trivia Time

From 1976-2019 BYU lost its first eight games in the state of Florida before finally winning. Which opponent did the Cougars defeat to end their 0-for-the-Sunshine-State streak?

Trickett Time

When the USF Bulls face the Cougars Saturday first-year Bulls offensive coordinator Travis Trickett will be calling plays for the first time since 2018.

""It's just like riding a bike'' Trickett said. ""It's nothing new.''

Trickett has seven seasons of play-calling experience during offensive-coordinator stints at Samford (2012-15) Florida Atlantic (2016) and Georgia State (2017-18). Trickett said the Bulls will be an attacking offense that will look to exploit matchups and get the ball in the hands of its playmakers.

Who will make those plays?

The game against BYU will be the first evidence of how Trickett plans to deploy his weapons. Veteran quarterback Gerry Bohanon  a transfer from Baylor who helped the Bears to last season's Big 12 Conference championship has a deep receiving corps led by holdovers Xavier Weaver  Jimmy Horn and Omarion Dollison  while featuring newcomers such as Khafre Brown (North Carolina) and Ajou Ajou (Clemson).

The running game is paced by powerful Jaren Mangham (671 yards and 15 touchdowns last season) and speedy Brian Battie  while Clemson transfer Michel Dukes should be a factor as well (holdover Kelley Joiner is injured and not expected back until mid-season).

Trickett's play-calling personality — from pace of play to what look he prefers on third-and-3 — will begin to reveal itself against BYU. However the game unfolds though Trickett emphasized that it's all about the USF players.

""You go over everything with a fine-tooth comb making sure your substitutions are right for whatever you want on certain plays'' said Trickett who works from the press box where the vantage point is generally better than field level. ""You're making sure that the play sequencing is what you want. You have the game plan and you get into a routine.

""Yeah you can get hot (while calling plays) but you're not playing. It's the kids. It's the players who are hot. What we have to do if they're hot is find ways to keep them hot (by calling favorable plays). If they're not hot you try to get them back on track.''

Feeling A Rush

Since USF hired Bob Shoop as defensive coordinator in December a major point of emphasis was improving the pass rush and getting more pressure on the quarterback (after registering just nine sacks in 2021).

With a combination of returning players and newcomers Shoop said he believes the Bulls will have a much-improved pass rush.

Shoop said he has been impressed with holdovers such as defensive tackle Rashawn Yates and defensive end Tramel Logan .

""We use the word 'havoc' — and that means tackles for a loss and sacks'' Shoop said. ""Those are areas we need to greatly improve from 2021.

""That's in the past. This is the 2022 version of the USF Bulls and any coach who is smart will identify the strengths of the individuals and place them in position to be successful. I think we're deeper at all the positions. We should be able to run a lot of guys out there and every one of those guys is expected to create havoc and create disruption. We entered the transfer portal and we're definitely deeper up front.''

Two of the most promising newcomers are defensive tackle Rashad Cheney (Minnesota) and defensive end Jatorian Hansford (Missouri). Cheney a one-time commitment to Alabama will bring some inside beef (he's 6-foot-2 285 pounds) while Hansford (6-4 265) combines power speed and desire on the edge.

""These guys have competed in the Big Ten and the SEC and they bring a lot of experience and maturity'' Shoop said. ""We're very fortunate to have them both. They had a big impact in the offseason and in the weight room. We're looking for big things from them.''

Looking Ahead

The Bulls face their lone Football Championship Subdivision opponent of the season next Saturday Sept. 10 when Howard University visits Raymond James Stadium. Howard which opened with a 23-13 defeat against Alabama State last week in Atlanta travels to Hampton University on Saturday night.

Howard's head coach is Larry Scott  who played on USF's inaugural team and was on the Bulls' offensive line from 1997-99. Scott also served as a USF assistant coach under Jim Leavitt and Skip Holtz through the 2012 season.

Scott's Howard staff includes Lindsey Lamar the Hillsborough High School product who became one of the top players in USF history (2009-12) and was named Big East Conference special teams player of the year in 2010. Former USF assistants Vernon Hargreaves and Troy Douglas are also on Howard's coaching staff.

TAMPA Fla. — After watching new addition Chris Brooks run for 135 yards and a touchdown in BYU’s 50-21 plastering of South Florida on Saturday at Raymond James Stadium Cougars quarterback Jaren Hall said the sky is the limit for the Cal transfer RB in BYU’s offense.

He doesn’t do a bad job operating it himself.

“Jaren played another great game” BYU coach Kalani Sitake said.

Returning to the scene of his first start back in 2019 when the Cougars fell 27-23 to the Bulls and Hall was knocked out of the game in the third quarter with a concussion the fifth-year junior closed the deal this time.

“That was one of my favorite parts of tonight was the young receivers stepping in and making plays on third downs making big plays for us and keeping drives alive. I knew they would do that. I was confident in that and I know they are confident in themselves.” — BYU quarterback Jaren Hall.

“Yeah the initial start I watched that game before this game to see my young self the way I have grown and really just (focused on) allowing the game to come to me and not having to feel it out” Hall said.

There was no feeling of revenge or redemption. That’s not how Hall operates. He stays in the moment then on Saturday in front of 31521 in an NFL stadium that he might be playing in again someday delivered a bunch of them in improving to 9-2 as a starter.

“We were very excited to play very excited to be out here” Hall said. “There was just a lot of talk about all the stuff going against us the weather and all those things. I think it fired us up and got us really going and energized.”

Hall’s stats would have been even better had receiver Keanu Hill hung on to a bomb thrown beautifully by Hall in the second quarter.

As it were he finished 25 of 32 for 261 yards with touchdown passes to Dallin Holker and Hill for a passer rating of 161. He threw one interception and was sacked once losing 1 yard.

“When you make plays you just build off of that. We did a good job of making plays quick we pushed the tempo kept the defense out of the loop” Hall said.

“They were getting flustered. They couldn’t get lined up quick enough so we just kept using that against them just going with our basic stuff that we do in practice and just kinda rolled through it the first half.”

Grover for the Deseret News

With Gunner Romney out and Puka Nacua leaving before halftime with 76 yards and two touchdowns running the ball and one catch for 22 yards Hall found a bunch of other guys ready and willing to fill in.

He completed passes to 12 different players.

“Guys know what they are doing and being ready for their time when it is their time” he said. “We preach that all week in practice understanding that Gunner wouldn’t be available. All fall camp guys were getting reps and so it just speaks to Fesi (Sitake) getting them ready and them taking his coaching and being on the same page together.”

Coach Kalani Sitake said Romney was “close” to being able to play in his mind and might be able to play next week against Baylor. Sitake said Nacua who was on crutches in the second half “could have kept going” if the Cougars needed him.

Which they didn’t — after building a 38-0 lead in the second quarter.

“That was one of my favorite parts of tonight was the young receivers stepping in and making plays on third downs making big plays for us and keeping drives alive” Hall said. “I knew they would do that. I was confident in that and I know they are confident in themselves.”

The 575 total yards Hall and the offense put up are the second-most under Sitake in a season opener. They had 580 at Navy in 2020 when Zach Wilson and company carved up the Navy offense.

Speaking of Brooks he was as good as advertised. The graduate transfer from Cal ran for 135 yards including an up-the-middle burst for 52 yards that left USF defensive backs trailing in his wake.

It was the fifth 100-yard game of Brooks’ career and his second-biggest night as a collegian. He ran for 197 yards against UC Davis one time.

Hall said the Cougars spent the weather delay chilling out and watching other college football games on television.

“We didn’t stress too much. We didn’t press ourselves to stay fired up and ready to go. We understood the situation” he said.

“The medical staff was good about keeping us updated letting us know we had some time. … We kinda stayed tied into the game. We just wanted to make sure we stayed loose and relaxed and then at the 20-minute heads-up we locked right back in did our thing and went out and played.”

At the time this GPU was launched with little fanfare and so we wanted just to take a moment and do a mini-review for the card. This is a mid-range NVIDIA professional GPU that would have been a NVIDIA Quadro in previous generations before that branding was retired. We just wanted to say thank you to PNY for allowing us to borrow this card. NVIDIA makes the GPU itself but some of the photos are tagged PNY since the company is a primary distribution partner for NVIDIA’s professional GPUs. With that let us get to the review.

NVIDIA RTX A4500 20GB GPU Hardware

The GPU itself is a double-width card. It also features an active fan. Some of the other GPUs we have seen such as the NVIDIA A40 do not include a fan and require active chassis cooling. That makes this solution easier to integrate into workstations.

The card itself has 7168 Ampere-generation CUDA cores along with 20GB of ECC GDDR6 memory.

On the edge of the RTX A4500 there is a NVLink connector. NVIDIA also includes connectors for its stereo and NVIDIA Quadro Sync II ports for multi-GPU applications. The stereo and sync ports are typically not found on GeForce GPUs.

On the edge with the NVIDIA logo there is an 8-pin power connector. Some of the higher-end professional GPUs use the data center GPU connector but this still uses the consumer connector making it easily compatible with a range of power supplies.

The back of the card is mostly exposed. This is an area where we wish that NVIDIA made a solid backplate. These are costly enough cards where a backplate to protect the card is a small cost for the protection it provides. It also makes the card look more aesthetically pleasing.

On the I/O side of the card there are four DisplayPort 1.4a ports.

Here is the PCIe Gen4 x16 connector.

If you need a HDMI port there is a DisplayPort to HDMI port connector in the box.

Next let us get to the specs and performance of the card.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9HZUZvcmNlLVJUWC00MC1sYXVuY2gtZGF0ZS1jb3VsZC1iZS1wdXNoZWQtYmFjay1hcy1OdmlkaWEtaXMtcmVwb3J0ZWRseS1wcmVwYXJpbmctdGhlLVJUWC00MDkwLVRpLXdpdGgtYW4tZXhhZ2dlcmF0ZWQtY29vbGVyLWRlc2lnbi42NDQ2OTUuMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GeForce RTX 40 launch date could be pushed back as Nvidia is reportedly preparing the RTX 4090 Ti with an ...,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMirwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9HZUZvcmNlLVJUWC00MC1sYXVuY2gtZGF0ZS1jb3VsZC1iZS1wdXNoZWQtYmFjay1hcy1OdmlkaWEtaXMtcmVwb3J0ZWRseS1wcmVwYXJpbmctdGhlLVJUWC00MDkwLVRpLXdpdGgtYW4tZXhhZ2dlcmF0ZWQtY29vbGVyLWRlc2lnbi42NDQ2OTUuMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000167111111B0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9HZUZvcmNlLVJUWC00MC1sYXVuY2gtZGF0ZS1jb3VsZC1iZS1wdXNoZWQtYmFjay1hcy1OdmlkaWEtaXMtcmVwb3J0ZWRseS1wcmVwYXJpbmctdGhlLVJUWC00MDkwLVRpLXdpdGgtYW4tZXhhZ2dlcmF0ZWQtY29vbGVyLWRlc2lnbi42NDQ2OTUuMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9uZXdzLzk1ODQ5LWF1Z3VzdC1zdGVhbS1zdXJ2ZXktaW50ZWwtdXAtb2N1bHVzLXF1ZXN0LTIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,August Steam survey: Intel up Oculus Quest 2 down RTX 3060 reigns supreme,"What just happened? Valve's Steam survey for August has arrived. There were a few trend reversals last month including AMD losing share to Intel in the CPU space Windows 7 actually gaining users and the Oculus Quest 2's share dropping by almost 10%.

Starting with CPUs August was another period in which Intel scored a rare win over AMD as team blue's processor share among participants rose by 1.65% to 67.91%. AMD had enjoyed many months of chipping away at Intel's lead in this area but Lisa Su's company has experienced both rises and falls since the release of Alder Lake. Don't be surprised to see an uptick in AMD CPU owners following the Ryzen 7000 launch on September 27 though.

Moving onto GPUs it was an excellent month for the RTX 3060. A 0.66% share increase was almost double that of July's top-performer---the laptop version of the same card---pushing the mid-ranger up two places to the sixth spot.

Looking at the top discreet graphics cards it's interesting to see how only the Ampere line made any significant gains in August. Nvidia might not be selling as many cards as it would like despite the company's constant price drops but it seems those who are buying new GPUs are opting for team green's current generation especially the mid-range RTX 3060 3060 Ti and 3050.

At this rate the RTX 3060 could eventually take the number one spot from the GTX 1060 that has topped the table since displacing the GTX 750 Ti in January 2018.

Elsewhere Windows 11 bounced back from its first-ever share decline in July with a 2.66% rise. It means Microsoft's latest version of Windows is now the OS of choice for almost a quarter of the survey's participants. And amazingly Windows 7's share increased very slightly despite its extended support period ending in January 2020---business and education users can still pay for extended security updates.

One final trend reversal in August came from the VR headset section. The Oculus Quest 2 has absolutely dominated this area as its share increased every month. Meta's product passed the 50% milestone in July but August saw an 8% decline. The only headset in the chart to see a significant increase was the Oculus Rift up 0.09%. Is the turbulent economy in which people are making fewer non-essential buys also impacting the VR market or was this a one-off anomaly? We'll know more when the next survey arrives.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRhdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2hvbm9yLW1hZ2ljYm9vay0xNC0yMDIyLTMyMDM1NTQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The HONOR Magicbook 14 2022 ups the graphics ante,"Robert Triggs / Android Authority

TL;DR HONOR has launched several devices at IFA 2022.

The Magicbook 14 2022 brings optional RTX graphics and fast charging.

The company also launched the HONOR 70 in global markets as well as the HONOR Pad.

HONOR has offered its Magicbook line of laptops for a few years now and this hasn’t changed since the company was spun off from parent brand Huawei in 2020. Now the company has used IFA 2022 to introduce several new products including the Magicbook 14 2022.

Honor’s latest notebook brings a 14-inch display with 2160 x 1440 resolution and a 3:2 screen ratio differing from the previous model’s FHD resolution and 16:9 ratio. This panel also gets Gorilla Glass Victus so it should fare well in terms of durability. Otherwise the 1.5kg (3.4 pounds) weight makes it slightly heavier than last year’s model and heavier than the M2 Macbook Air (1.24kg).

In terms of key specs the Magicbook 14 comes with Intel’s 12th generation Core i5 12500H CPU 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. The laptop is also available with either integrated Iris Xe graphics or NVIDIA’s RTX2050 GPU. Don’t expect performance close to other RTX GPUs for laptops but it still delivers much-improved performance on paper over most of NVIDIA’s MX integrated solutions as well as ray-tracing support. In fact you should be able to play some AAA games just fine with this setup while DLSS tech means you can enjoy higher resolutions without a massive hit to performance.

HONOR says you should expect a 75Wh battery capable of delivering a claimed 10.5 hours of work use and 15 hours of 1080p local video playback. Once you’ve exhausted the battery you’ll be glad to know that it supports 135W fast charging via an included USB-C charger. More reading: The best wall chargers worth buying

Expect the laptop to go from zero to full in 80 minutes while a 15-minute charge can deliver a claimed 3.5 hours of work. The zero-to-full figure isn’t exactly groundbreaking when Apple’s latest Macbook Air delivers similar results via 67W charging (showing that wattage isn’t everything) but it’s still pretty brisk nonetheless. The Magicbook charger also works with other HONOR phones and tablets although it’s unclear what kind of speeds you should expect for third-party devices.

The Magicbook 14 2022 also brings the expected HONOR Share functionality for seamless sharing between the laptop and an HONOR phone. Other notable features include multi-screen collaboration tech two USB-C ports (albeit with the charger occupying one port) a full-sized USB port HDMI out 3.5mm port a fingerprint scanner a 720p webcam Bluetooth 5.2 and Wi-Fi 6.

There’s no word on pricing for the Magicbook 14 2022 just yet although its predecessor was available for £799.99 (~$924).

It seems like alongside Ja Morant and his signature Nike model the Nike Ja Jayson Tatum will be receiving his very own Jordan model in the near future being dubbed the Jordan Tatum 1 (name subject to change). Just like the Nike Ja we unfortunately don’t have any looks at the silhouette just yet however we do know that three colorways are set to launch next year. Coming inspired by his son Deuce and some of Tatum’s favorite things we know that there are plans for a “Zoo” St. Louis” and “Pink Lemonade” rendition of the Tatum 1. Being that he was born in St. Louis it only makes sense one of his sneakers would get dressed in Cardinals-inspired colors while the zoo is one of the places he loves to take Deuce. As one of his favorite drinks pink lemonade is making another appearance on one of his sneakers just like the AJ 35 PE that he was spotted in back in 2020.

How To Use The Lunar Cycle To Time Your Cut & Color,"If you’re a lover of astrology you’re probably familiar with the various undulations of the cosmos. I bet you already know you’re supposed to set new intentions during a new moon and you’re meant to release emotional clutter during a full moon. You might have also heard that making permanent decisions during Mercury retrograde is a big no-no. But have you ever thought about the moon’s impact on your overall beauty? Better yet—did you know the moon affects your hair in a major way? Whether you’re dreaming of long luscious locks straight out of a catalogue or you’re contemplating an edgy cut that turns every head feel free to look to the moon for guidance on all your hair-related needs.

So what does the moon have to do with your hair anyway? It’s actually quite simple because the moon has to do with everything about pretty much everything. Being that human beings are made up of roughly 70 percent water the moon has quite an influence on our emotional and physical bodies. Think about it—the moon’s gravity literally pulls the ocean towards it! The human body is mostly water and like the tides we’re being pulled around by the moon’s whims. It even affects our cardiovascular system! In fact according to a 2013 study on the moon’s impact on the human body we often experience a gentle drop in blood pressure during new moons and full moons when compared to other phases of the lunar cycle.

If the moon has an influence on our bodies wouldn’t it make sense that it also impacts our hair (as well as our appearance in general)? If you’re wondering how the moon actually affects your mane and how to harness the moon’s magic to transform your locks keep reading:

How Does The Moon Affect Your Hair?

Click here to read the full article.

The 28-day lunar cycle is all about growth. It begins with the new moon which represents the process of planting the seeds of something new. As the moon waxes that seed begins to grow and sprout leaves and by the time the full moon tales place it finally reaches its peak stage of growth and blossoms. By the time the moon wanes and reaches the new moon phase once again the cycle repeats perpetually bringing us new growth.

Like the lunar cycle each strand of your hair is enduring its own growth process. In fact it goes through three separate phases—anagen catagen and telogen. The first one—anagen—is the growth phase which lasts several years. This is when your hair gets most of its length! By the time it reaches the catagen phase your hair growth slows to a halt and by the time it reaches telogen your hair initiates the process of shedding.

When you consider that the lunar cycle and the process of growing your hair have similar peaks and valleys it only makes sense there would be a correlation between the two. And if you follow the ebb and flow of the lunar cycle you can discover the best possible times of the month to make alterations to your hair!

How The Moon Can Benefit Your Hair

When you understand how your hair looks and feels throughout the lunar cycle you can use that knowledge to harness every last drop of hair magic. During a new moon your locks are often filled with additional moisture which is most likely when your hair is feeling healthiest; like it’s at its prime. After all hair that is moisturized is often softer and more resilient making it more able to withstand the elements. This makes new moons an optimal time for trying out new hairstyles such as coloring adding highlights using a little extra heat or putting in extensions. Your hair can handle it!

On the other hand if you’re in the mood for a drastic haircut a trim or otherwise it’s best advised to do that approximately 14 days into the lunar cycle close to a full moon. Just like full moons are prime time for pruning and harvesting your plants it is also prime time for taming those locks of yours. Full moons are all about releasing cleansing and clearing so if you think about how your hair stores everything using a full moon as a time to release those dead ends makes a whole lot of sense. Just like when you release anything else in life letting go of those split ends will allow your hair to grow healthier and stronger.

In a nutshell you should give yourself a new hairstyle during the new moon and five yourself a good trim during the full moon. Using the moon for not only the ultimate hair care but also the best hair results will be what sets you apart from the average head of hair. You should also avoid cutting during a new moon and stay away from any drastic hair changes on the full moon. If you stick to these simple rules you should notice a difference in as early as a month especially if you’re trying to grow and heal your hair.

When To Schedule Your Next Cut & Color

Beyond the relevance of the lunar cycle you should also pay attention to any astrological aspects the moon may be making. For example if a new moon is joining forces with Venus—planet of luxury and beauty—you might want to try out a style that’s more flirty and designed to lure in a romantic partner. However if a full moon is joining forces with Uranus—planet of individuality—you might opt for a look that’s shorter sharper and edgier. Since the new moon and the full moon are the best times of the lunar cycle to nurture your hair here are some important dates to keep in mind.

New Moons in 2022 – Color Extend and Change

New Moon at 2° Libra – September 25

New Moon Solar Eclipse at 2° Scorpio – October 25

New Moon at 1° Sagittarius – November 23

New Moon at 1° Capricorn – December 23

Full Moons in 2022 – Trim and Cut

Full Moon at 17° Pisces – September 10

Full Moon at 16° Aries – October 9

Full Moon Lunar Eclipse at 16° Taurus – November 8

Full Moon at 16° Gemini – December 7

If a new moon or a full moon takes place in your sun sign moon sign Venus sign or rising sign any changes made to your hair will become that much more meaningful. In fact it could even mark the beginning of a brand new phase of your life! Allow the moon to take over the wheel (or in this case the salon).

>> Brown County man the victim of multiple bee stings awakes from coma

A sentencing hearing had been scheduled Thursday for Joe Eldridge in Greene County Common Pleas Court before Judge Michael Buckwalter.

Wednesday a jury convicted him on one count of domestic violence and two counts of failure to comply with the order or signal of a police officer stemming from two incidents.

On April 30 Eldridge’s girlfriend came to the Fairborn Police Department suffering from two black eyes and facial swelling. She reported to police that Eldridge attacked her several days earlier.

Eldridge also admitted to a separate witness that he assaulted the woman. An arrest warrant was issued for Eldridge based on the initial domestic violence report.

On June 7 Fairborn Police Officer Connor Mulcahy saw Eldridge riding a motorcycle. After confirming his identity and discovering Eldridge’s pending warrant for domestic violence Officer Mulcahy activated his cruiser lights and yelled for Eldridge to stop.

>> No reason to believe shooting was not justified sheriff says

Eldridge fled and reported to others he was fleeing at approximately 101 mph in the area of Kaufman and Powell avenues. Officer Mulcahy determined that further pursuit placed others at risk and ended his attempts to apprehend the man.

Shortly thereafter Eldridge crashed his motorcycle and was thrown into a grassy area. Medics took him for medical treatment. Eldridge reportedly shattered his ankle and stated he may never walk again.

“This successful prosecution was the result of excellent police work” county Prosecutor David Hayes said noting Eldridge has a number of prior violent felony convictions including for domestic violence robbery and aggravated burglary. He has been sentenced to prison on seven prior occasions.

Due to the efforts of police and his prosecutorial staff Hayes said “a dangerous violent felon is off the streets and behind bars.”

Even still the meds' use remained “widespread” in the U.S. this past winter potentially costing the nation tens of millions for treatments that were unlikely to offer much benefit to patients.

Use of Eli Lilly’s bamlanivimab-etesevimab and Regeneron’s casirivimab-imdevimab peaked during the week of Dec. 22 2021 when 91036 total doses were reported according to a new JAMA Network study. While mAb use “gradually declined” after FDA deauthorization and dropped throughout the remainder of the study period—which ran until June 29—Lilly's and Regeneron’s antibody combos continued to be administered after FDA deauthorization on Jan. 24 the study authors note.

Despite the FDA revising Lilly's and Regeneron’s authorizations however hospitals and health systems administered more than 158000 doses of these mAbs in early 2022 the JAMA study contends. Given that Medicare mAb payments range from $450 to $750 per dose spending on these deauthorized treatments likely eclipsed $71 million the study continues.

“Whether deauthorized treatments will be covered by payers and whether the FDA will take regulatory action against entities violating its guidance remains unknown” the study authors continued.

As for why use of Lilly's and Regeneron’s banned antibodies remained so ubiquitous the JAMA study pinned the blame—in part—on conflicting state government guidance and lack of hospital awareness of the deauthorization.

The study authors note that “although the FDA announcements clearly stated that these mAbs were no longer authorized for use” it didn’t fully revoke the meds’ emergency nods “because of the possibility that future COVID-19 variants could retain susceptibility.” This could have in turn led to “misinterpretation” by healthcare professionals.

Overall there was “wide variability in mAb administration by state” the study found. New York and Florida for instance were the biggest users accounting for 20% and 24% of mAb administration for the period respectively. Wisconsin and Arizona were next in line but handed out less that half of New York's total whiles states like Vermont and New Hampshire logged no prescriptions.

Looking at the variability in a different way by assessing use as a percentage of each state's remaining supply 15 states administered up to 10% of their supply while 11 states doled out more than 50% of their leftover antibody stocks.

JAMA ran its study from Oct. 27 2021 to June 29 2022 collecting data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and state hospitals. All U.S. hospitals and health systems must report the number of therapeutic mAb courses administered in the prior week as well as the amount currently on hand the study authors explained.

All is not lost for Lilly on the COVID-19 front meanwhile. Lilly nabbed authorization for its omicron-busting antibody bebtelovimab back in February and it recently laid plans to deploy the drug on the commercial market.

Regeneron for its part recently axed a clutch of trials weighing its antibody combo dubbed REGEN-COV across a range of patients and clinical stages. The company terminated the trials which ranged from early to late stage because of “[e]merging SARS-CoV-2 variants impacting susceptibility to study drug” recent updates on ClinicalTrials.gov state.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNTk4LTAyMi0xOTA5NS030gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elevated serum IgA following vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of high-risk first responders | Scientific Reports,"The study recruited first responders and other personnel from Police Firefighters and Emergency Medicine Service (EMS) agencies. Detail regarding recruitment and study participants have been previously published7. Participants were surveyed at baseline and follow-up regarding prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 periods of quarantine from work symptomatic illness potentially consistent with COVID-19 and confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19.

We categorized individuals based on the serological and clinical evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease as follows: Definite COVID-19 includes participants with a positive COVID-19 RT-PCR or antigen test OR a positive IgG antibody combined with a history of exposure to a person with COVID-19 and a history of symptoms compatible with COVID-19; Probable COVID-19 includes participants with positive IgA or IgG antibody combined with a history of symptoms compatible with COVID-19 OR a history of exposure to a person with COVID-19 AND a history of symptoms compatible with COVID-19; Possible COVID-19 includes participants with a history of exposure to a person with COVID-19 and a history of symptoms compatible with COVID-19 without positive IgG or IgA antibodies; Definite Asymptomatic Infection includes participants with positive IgA or IgG antibody with a history of exposure to a person with COVID-19 with no history of symptoms compatible with COVID-19 OR a positive IgG antibody without history of exposure to a person with COVID-19 and without a history of symptoms compatible with COVID-19; Possible Asymptomatic Infection includes participants with positive IgA antibody alone without history of exposure to a person with COVID-19 and without a history of symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and No Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 Infection or COVID-19 includes participants for whom all antibodies were negative and there was neither a history of exposure to a person with COVID-19 nor a history of symptoms compatible with COVID-19. Participants were categorized based on the last assessment prior to vaccination.

Sera from participants were tested at three timepoints (baseline 2–3 months 6 months) at ICON Laboratories using the Abbott Architect Anti-SARS-CoV2 chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (MIA) for IgG (anti-nucleocapsid protein anti-N) Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA for IgG (anti-S1 domain of spike anti-S) and the Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV2 ELISA for IgA (anti-S1 domain of spike). Results for the anti-N IgG were categorized as either positive or negative based on an signal/cut-off index of greater than or equal to 1.4 for positive results. Associations with anti-S IgG and IgA were evaluated based on an optical-density ratio of greater than or equal to 1.1 corresponding to positive tests based on manufacturer specifications.

Vaccination status was defined as complete if the participant had received a full series at least 14 days prior to the collection. Vaccination was categorized as partial if as of 14 days prior to the collection they had received only 1 of 2 doses. All others categorized as unvaccinated. Individuals who completed a series at least 14 days prior to the 2nd collection were evaluated based on their response at the time of the 2nd collection only.

To assess the impact of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 on vaccine response we compared those categorized as Definite COVID-19 Probable COVID-19 Possible COVID-19 or Definite Asymptomatic Infection to those categorized as No Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 Infection or COVID-19. The percent with positive antibodies by type was summarized by vaccine type vaccine status and the categorized history of infection or disease.

Data management and statistical analyses were performed using SAS® Version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary NC USA). Chi-square testing was used to assay differences in antibody positivity based on exposure and illness categories and prior receipt of vaccine. Medians were calculated and non-Wilcoxon rank sum tests were performed to assess for differences in IgG and IgA ratios based on prior history of COVID-19 and vaccine manufacturer. Data visualization was performed in R with the ggplot2 package.

IRB approval was obtained from the Western IRB protocol # 20201662. Informed consent was obtained from all participants at the time of study recruitment. All study recruitment and laboratory testing were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.",,,,,,,,,

According to a 2022 UN report access to assistive technologies in some low-and middle-income countries is as low as three per cent. Assistive technology is an umbrella term for devices and related services that help users live with greater independence by improving their functioning in daily activities.

Globally the market for assistive technologies for the disabled and elderly is expected to reach US$60.84 billion by 2028 says a recent study. It is expected to rise fastest in the Asia Pacific region because of the large population base and rising awareness about better healthcare.

“The demand for rehabilitation services and assistive technologies is growing for a whole range of reasons” says Wesley Pryor principal advisor at the University of Melbourne’s Nossal Institute for Global Health in Australia. “It includes the changing profile of diseases away from communicable to non-communicable diseases; and due to the diminishing likelihood that as people age their children and grandchildren will be available to take care of them.”

Availability and affordability are major barriers to access. “Governments in developing countries face this dilemma of providing more people with poor quality devices versus few people with high-quality devices” says Abner Manlapaz president of the Life Haven Center for Independent Living and senior associate at the Center for Inclusive Policy in Valenzuela City Philippines.

Getting the right support

Manlapaz says that if a person does not get the right support it becomes a waste of resources. Good quality devices last longer. A cheap wheelchair for example will only last six months to a year whereas a good quality wheelchair can last up to ten years he says.

Imported assistive products are often not suitable for the user. “The Pacific Island countries are often being used as dumping grounds for secondhand or unwanted products by developed countries” says Setareki Macanawai Pacific Disability Forum’s chief executive officer. “Providers need to talk to persons with disabilities and their representative organisations in island countries and factor in user needs affordability and the infrastructure — for example unsealed roads”.

“ In developing countries of the Asia Pacific it is incredibly challenging to ensure assistive technology users have access to both products and the professional services to fit the product. Natasha Layton senior research fellow Monash University

A 2018 report by ATscale the Global Partnership for Assistive Technology showed the unequivocal benefits in health social inclusion and economic returns of investing in assistive technology.

Governments and civil societies in the region are adopting measures such as producing devices locally to expand access to assistive technologies.

“The government [in Lao People’s Democratic Republic] is encouraging devices such as axillary and elbow crutches standing frames and cerebral palsy walkers to be made locally so they are more affordable and sustainable” says Metta Thippawong Cooperative Orthotic Prosthetic Enterprise Programme Manager for Lao. She is herself a wheelchair user owing to lower limbs paralysis from polio.

Nearby Cambodia has three local wheelchair producers making standard wheelchairs and a local orthopaedic component factory started by the International Committee of the Red Cross two decades ago and now run by the Persons with Disabilities Foundation a government institute.

“All the devices are custom made by trained and internationally qualified technicians from the National Institute of Social Affairs’ Department of Prosthetics and Orthotics which is also providing training to students from 26 Asia Pacific and African countries” says Sisary Kheng department director and Cambodia country director of Exceed Worldwide.

“Cambodians now have access to free as well as top of the range titanium prosthesis for which components are sourced from world-class companies. Because of cheaper labour it costs approximately US$250 for a transtibial prosthesis (below the knee artificial limb) or US$350 for a transfemoral prosthesis (an artificial limb that replaces any amputated limb above the knee)” says Kheng.

In Thailand about 2.1 million people (3.17 per cent of the total population) registered with a disability are entitled to 76 assistive technology products listed in the Universal Coverage Scheme for healthcare launched in 2002 says Sawang Srisom a member of the sub-committee of disability affairs at the Senate of Thailand.

Demand for wheelchairs prosthetics

“The items can either be borrowed or bought but most people can keep the items for use as long as they wish” Srisom tells SciDev.Net referring to access to assisted technologies in Thailand. “There is a huge demand for wheelchairs and prosthetics but the supply is not enough so there can be long waiting periods. In some rural and remote areas a person may never get one.”

Growing up with polio in rural north-eastern Thailand Srisom recalls getting a tricycle used by people with disabilities only when he transitioned to secondary school. But at school his classroom was on the second floor so he had to crawl upstairs. It became so difficult and humiliating that he had to quit regular school he says.

Shafiq ur Rehman had a similar experience growing up in Pakistan which motivated him to co-found Milestone (Society for Special Persons) with his other friends with a disability. “In the late 1970s there was no concept of mobility devices in Pakistan. Doctors pushed my family to ‘repair’ my legs paralysed by polio. I was forced to walk with the aid of braces and crutches. It was so painful that I would just crawl.”

Rehman received his first wheelchair at the age of 24 while on a scholarship to Japan for a disability leadership training programme. “The light-weight manual wheelchair was the turning point in my life” he says.

Only five per cent of individuals in need in low-and-middle-income countries have a wheelchair compared to 90 per cent of those in high-income countries according to the ATscale report.

“We began with importing used manual wheelchairs from Japan and customising them to be fit-for-purpose for the local user; and then electric wheelchairs with support from the Japan Council on Independent Living Centers” Rehman tells SciDev.Net. “Currently we are manufacturing 5000 wheelchairs a month that cost US$100. We are also making medical beds walkers and canes. The majority of people working in our manufacturing units are people with a disability.”

The ATscale report highlighted that the supply of the four most needed products — wheelchairs prostheses hearing aids and eyeglasses — is not keeping up with the increasing demand. “Stimulating supply through subsidies by shaping markets and reducing the cost of assistive products to individuals are promising strategies” says Pryor.

“The challenge is to optimise access to products that are already available and eliminating inequities in distribution due to structural geographical and financial barriers and exploitative market practices” Pryor adds.

Attention is now shifting from mobility devices to a whole gamut of technologies that can support people to live independently. But in developing countries many people with a disability do not have access to the internet or a smartphone. This places additional challenges on people with visual and hearing impairment as they have difficulties in using app-based accessibility tools say disability advocates.

Countries in the region are striving to include assistive technology as part of universal healthcare. Says Pryor “In health policy assistive technology falls under the domain of procurement rather than a mainstream agenda item. For many countries there’s often a single procurement approach for medicines and medical products. They’ll audit and tender for a national supply of saline drips for example but rarely for basic assistive products.”

In many countries disability and assistive devices may fall under the remit of different ministries and that may create confusion for the user. Thailand for example has three ministries that provide assistive devices to people with disabilities — Public Health (mobility devices) Digital Economy and Society (tablets and mobile phones) and Education (Braille slates).

Lack of trained workforce

The other major barrier in access to assistive technology is workforce shortages — over 75 per cent of low-income countries have no prosthetic and orthotics training programmes.

“In the Philippines access to the disability benefits programme is very limited because of gaps such as in trained assistive technology workforce. This is being addressed by offering a government-funded free technical skills training programme in colleges” says Manlapaz who has been advocating for disability rights inclusion and access to assistive devices.

“The occupational therapist training for example has been geared towards strengthening correcting and maximising physical functioning as against supporting with assistive products” says Manlapaz who acquired Guillain-Barré Syndrome at the age of 16. He recalls being pushed to use a brace rather than a wheelchair despite severe weakness of the lower extremities which badly impacted his spine and shoulders.

One of the recommendations of the UN Report on Assistive Technology is to enlarge diversify and improve workforce capacity.

“In developing countries of the Asia Pacific it is incredibly challenging to ensure [assistive technology] users have access to both products and the professional services to fit the product. These services ’wrap around’ the product. They include evaluation product trials user training and customisation — essential to ensure the products fit users and their environments” says Natasha Layton occupational therapist policy adviser and senior research fellow at Monash University in Melbourne.

Workforce training for assistive products is fragmented and differs from country to country. “There is rarely an ‘assistive technologist’ as such” says Pryor. “To deliver access across the whole spectrum of functional issues — memory loss vision and hearing impairment to mobility and incontinence it’s not a single workforce or market. And that’s a really complex system challenge which needs a whole mix of interventions.

Countries need to accelerate access to affordable and appropriate assistive technology to meet their 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. There are legally binding instruments like the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and at the regional level the Pacific Framework for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

“There are opportunities now the governments need to walk the talk” Macanawai tells SciDev.Net.

Republic Services which picks up trash east of Ocean View Avenue wants more money than Athens Services Whittier’s other trash hauler that services the western half to run an organics’ recycling program required by the state.

The two companies are supposed to be cleared to raise rates by 4.1% or $25.97 to $27.01 per month. Athens already has agreed but Republic wants an additional $401096 annually.

Or the city could raise rates in Republic’s area 9% or $2.37 a month Public Works Director Kyle Cason said at the Tuesday Aug. 30 City Council meeting.

But City Council members don’t like either option and ordered staffers to resume negotiations with Republic. They’re to come back to council in 90 days to make a report.

“We want parity” Councilman Fernando Dutra said.

“I do not want to look at some of my neighbors and say I’m going to have to raise your rates as compared to the neighbors down the street” Dutra said. “I would have a hard time answering that. My expectation is that all of the city of Whittier is equal.”

Councilwoman Cathy Warner said she didn’t like the idea of using the general fund to make up the difference “when I could use those dollars for one and a half police officers.”

The cost of one officer is $250000 City Manager Brian Saeki said.

Manny Gouveia west area municipal manager for Southern California for Republic said his company’s costs are just higher.

“We don’t have the ability to put additional trucks on the road additional drivers to take the material to the required state-mandated facilities able to accept and process the material” Gouvia said.

Gouvia said his company expects an increase of 192000 pounds of recycled and 1.1 million pounds of organic material annually.

The city’s plan calls for Whittier residents to separate out their food scraps and put them in their green bins together with grass green leafs and branches that already go in those cans.

The new standards are the result of a 2016 law SB 1383 authored by then-Sen. Ricardo Lara D-Los Angeles. It requires the state to reduce disposal of organic waste — food waste green waste paper products — by 75% by 2025.

A city consultant told the council Athens most likely is choosing to absorb those costs with an eye on the longer term.

“Some private companies will sacrifice with hope of getting it back in the longer run” Laith Ezzet senior vice president of HF and H Consultants.

Asked in a Thursday telephone interview about the difference in costs Gary Clifford Athens executive vice president said a private company like his can be more flexible.

“We partner with our cities and we’d rather make a slow nickel than a fast dime” Clifford said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZWluZGlhbmFidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvcmF5cy10cmFzaC1zZXJ2aWNlLWFjcXVpcmVkLWJ5LXdhc3RlLW1hbmFnZW1lbnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ray's Trash Service acquired by Waste Management – Inside INdiana Business,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.insideindianabusiness.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/rays-trash-service-acquired-by-waste-management (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016712935F90>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZWluZGlhbmFidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvcmF5cy10cmFzaC1zZXJ2aWNlLWFjcXVpcmVkLWJ5LXdhc3RlLW1hbmFnZW1lbnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhdGVydG93bm1hbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8wMi9jaGFuZ2VzLWNvbWluZy10by13YXRlcnRvd25zLXRyYXNoLXJlY3ljbGluZy1sYXJnZS1pdGVtLXBpY2t1cHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UPDATED: Changes Coming to Watertown's Trash Recycling & Large Item Pickups,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhdGVydG93bm1hbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8wMi9jaGFuZ2VzLWNvbWluZy10by13YXRlcnRvd25zLXRyYXNoLXJlY3ljbGluZy1sYXJnZS1pdGVtLXBpY2t1cHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016712934A30>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhdGVydG93bm1hbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8wMi9jaGFuZ2VzLWNvbWluZy10by13YXRlcnRvd25zLXRyYXNoLXJlY3ljbGluZy1sYXJnZS1pdGVtLXBpY2t1cHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vc2FsaW5hc3ZhbGxleXRyaWJ1bmUuY29tL3N1bi1zdHJlZXQtdHJhbnNmZXItc3RhdGlvbi1wcmVwYXJlcy10by1jbG9zZS1uZXh0LXdlZWsv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sun Street Transfer Station prepares to close next week,"SALINAS VALLEY — After 17 years in operation the Sun Street Transfer Station in Salinas will officially and permanently close on Sept. 10 announced officials from Salinas Valley Recycles (SVR).

The City of Salinas had requested closure of the Sun Street Transfer Station located at 139 Sun St. in order to fulfill its vision for the Alisal Marketplace redevelopment project.

“SVR has been working with the City for the past 15 years to pursue alternative permanent locations that would satisfy the City’s desire to relocate services away from the central location within city limits while meeting the needs of the community and the increasing mandates from the State for resource recovery and diversion of waste from landfills” according to Salinas Valley Recycles in a news release.

Most recently in August 2021 an agreement was reached between the City of Salinas and SVR that allows its services and operations to continue in a more permanent location that meets the long-term public needs as well as the continuation of mandated waste diversion and recycling programs and supports the City’s “Excellent Infrastructure” goals.

“After 15 years of unrest the saga of the Sun Street Transfer Station in Salinas is settled; the facility will close permanently on Sept. 10 2022” said Sandi Manor on behalf of Salinas Valley Recycles. “Please spread the news to neighbors as this popular facility will be missed by those who relied on its convenient location and low rates for disposal in the Salinas area.”

Manor added “Moving forward the greatest concern for the community is illegal dumping if would-be customers arrive to find the facility is closed; informing the public ahead of the closure could help prevent that.”

Though the Sun Street Transfer Station is closing SVR’s Recycling and Household Hazardous Waste (HHW) Facilities will be relocating to a new location at 1104 Madison Lane in Salinas next to Republic Services’ Madison Lane Transfer Station.

Republic Services — the franchised garbage recycling and organics hauler for the City of Salinas — has been making improvements to the Madison Lane Transfer Station in order to accommodate the anticipated increase in traffic from self-haulers who had previously frequented the Sun Street Transfer Station.

SVR’s Recycling and HHW Facilities will re-open at the new Madison Lane location on Sept. 12 once again offering free recycling and household hazardous waste disposal services to the public. Customers will still be able to recycle their mattresses/box springs appliances cardboard paper metal glass plastics clothing etc. at no charge.

To dispose of garbage yard waste wood waste or construction and demolition materials customers can use the adjacent Madison Lane Transfer Station or SVR’s Johnson Canyon Landfill at 31400 Johnson Canyon Road in Gonzales or Jolon Road Transfer Station at 52654 Jolon Road in King City.

The move to Madison Lane is a full-circle moment for SVR’s HHW Facility which was located at the site prior to the opening of Sun Street Transfer Station in 2005.

Operated by Salinas Valley Solid Waste Authority aka Salinas Valley Recycles Sun Street Transfer Station has been serving self-haulers recyclers and safe disposal of household hazardous waste for residents and businesses in Salinas and surrounding areas for the past 17 years. As locals became familiar with the location off Market Street the facility grew in utility and popularity consistently serving more than 300 customers a day six days a week.

The Authority is a joint powers agency made up of local governments from Monterey County (eastern half of the unincorporated county) and the cities of Gonzales Greenfield King City Salinas and Soledad. For more information visit svswa.org."

MOORESVILLE — West Rowan’s halftime adjustments and inspirational speeches went right out the window when Mooresville sophomore Tiquan Cromartie returned the second-half kickoff for a touchdown.

Cromartie’s 89-yard burst of speed up the middle of the field was the single biggest play on Friday in Mooresville’s 35-14 win over West Rowan at Joe Popp Stadium.

Mooresville coached by former West head man Joe Nixon won the turnover battle won the trench battle thanks mostly to 310-pound defensive tackle Xzavier Booker and won the scoreboard battle.

The Falcons (2-1) dazzling offensively in their first two games were goose-egged in the second half.

West quarterback Lucas Graham threw for huge yards again (301 of them) but the tradeoff was four interceptions by the Blue Devils (2-1).

Mooresville was able to stuff West’s physical running game and then was able to bring a lot of heat on Graham.

West’s power back Landon Jacobs topped 100 yards in West’s victories against Salisbury and Davie to begin the season. He had 18 for 38 on Friday. Eleven of those 18 runs were no-gains or TFLs.

Mooresville’s offense — uptempo and balanced — proved difficult to stop.

QB Jamere Cherry threw for 170 yards on 10 completions and hit a big TD to Terrell Simonton. Jawarn Howell (21 carries 105 yards) and Kyjuan Westmoreland (9 carries 71 yards) formed a productive rushing duo. Westmoreland scored twice while Howell found the end zone once.

Mooresville rolled to a touchdown on its first possession. Howell broke loose on a fourth-and-1 play from the West 18.

In early trouble inside its 10-yard line. West got a couple of breaks — two key receptions on tipped balls. Paxton Greene’s 53-yard deflected catch got the Falcons moving and Adrian Stockton out-jumped defenders for a 26-yard touchdown and a 7-all tie.

Mooresville scored in the first minute of the second quarter.

West came right back with Evan Kennedy turning a pass over the middle into a 64-yard sprint to the end zone. Juan Arteaga’s PAT made it 14-all with 9:54 left in the second quarter but the Falcons wouldn’t score again.

The Cherry-to-Simonton quick strike put Mooresville ahead 21-14.

It got wild in the final minute of the first half. West had a field goal blocked and Mooresville scooped it for a long return.

Lee Vaughters intercepted a pass to stop the Blue Devils. Then Mooresville got a pick to close the half.

West had a meager 9 rushing yards at halftime but was still very much in the game.

Even after that kickoff return to begin the second half put the Falcons down 28-14 they had a fighting chance.

The beginning of the end was a determined West push that moved the ball all the way down to the Mooresville 2. But Mooresville blew up two straight running plays for the stop.

Then the Falcons’ defense had Mooresville contained but an unsportsmanlike flag kept the Blue Devils’ offense on the field.

When Mooresville cashed in on that penalty for a Westmoreland 16-yard TD for a 35-14 lead it was all over.

There was a lot of time left but there no longer was any doubt about the outcome.

Now West has to regroup.

Undefeated North Rowan comes to Mount Ulla on Friday for West’s home opener. West beat North in a thriller in 2021.

A return-to-office showdown is unfolding in Canada and pitting some bosses and workers against each other as the back-to-school season brings with it a renewed push to get employees back into office buildings.

It’s a battle experts say could end a years-long experiment in flexible remote work — or spark a sweeping worker revolt.

“We’re seeing some evidence of a broad pushback” said David Zweig professor of organizational behaviour and human resources management at the University of Toronto.

“Until this pandemic is dead and gone going back to the office is going to be a hard sell.”

It’s not the first time white-collar workers have been recalled to cubicles.

Yet previous return-to-office plans were derailed — repeatedly — by fresh outbreaks and new variants of COVID-19.

This time however some companies appear to be drawing a line in the sand.

Rather than voluntary return-to-office guidelines employers are mandating office attendance through corporate policies.

Some big banks and Bay Street law firms appear to be leading the charge issuing memos mandating a set number of days a week in the office following Labour Day weekend.

Law firm Osler Hoskin & Harcourt LLP said in a statement that on Sept. 6 its offices will move to a hybrid working model where most employees will work three to four days a week in the office subject to operational requirements and local public health guidance.

The head of Royal Bank of Canada recently said organizations need to find the right balance between remote and on-site working.

“It won’t just happen organically” RBC’s president and chief executive Dave McKay said in a LinkedIn post. “We’re asking teams across the bank to start coming together in person more often to work and collaborate.”

For many managers the office is about culture. It’s a place of collaboration face-to-face teamwork and yes even office cooler chit-chat.

“We’re hearing from organizations that the value of creative collision that happens in offices just cannot be recreated virtually” said Tara Van Zuiden Deloitte Canada’s human capital partner and leader of workforce transformation for Western Canada.

“They want the connection and collaboration that happens in person.”

For many workers the preference for working from home is about flexibility and the lack of distractions. They want a better work-life balance and an end to lengthy commutes.

“People want to hold on to the autonomy and flexibility that they’ve gained around their work schedules during the pandemic” said Zweig.

Of course some employees never worked remotely and others are clamouring to get back to the office five days a week. Some companies have already moved to a hybrid model permanently — or quit office leases and told workers to stay home.

In May 2020 Canadian tech giant Shopify Inc. shifted to a fully remote “digital by design” company — saying in a press release its location was not its Ottawa headquarters but “Internet Everywhere.”

The company does most work remotely and “occasionally we gather in person in highly intentional ways to build trust with our teams and connect to our mission. We call these ‘bursts’” spokeswoman Jackie Warren said in an email.

But other companies are rolling out new guidelines for returning to the office this fall a situation that could lead to a standoff between managers and workers some observers say.

“If they’re going to call people on back en masse every day as it was before they’re going to get employee pushback” said Adam Savaglio an employment lawyer and partner with Scarfone Hawkins LLP in Hamilton.

“We could see a mass revolt.”

Many workers have argued that their productivity has remained strong or even improved while working from home. They say their quality of life is better as they spend more time with kids or pets or doing activities that improve their mental and physical wellbeing.

They bristle at the idea of a rigid work day long commutes and expensive downtown coffee and lunches.

“We’re on a bit of a collision course” said Mike Shekhtman a regional director with recruitment agency Robert Half. “Some employers believe the office is the best place to see a high level of productivity. They still believe they have to see and hear their teams in order to feel like they are collaborating and innovating.

“But some workers are really questioning that.”

Companies that issue strict policies around returning to the office this fall could face a wave of workers quitting.

It’s a significant threat in a tight labour market with a rock-bottom jobless rate.

“Some employees will find the more prescriptive return-to-work policies won’t work for them and they will vote with their feet” said Van Zuiden with Deloitte.

Yet it’s not just about retention.

Job hunters are often searching for flexible work arrangements. Positions with strict office attendance rules are becoming harder to fill experts say.

“The biggest challenge for employers will be that if they mandate a hard return to the office employees might feel like they have been treated unfairly and are losing control” Zweig said.

“When that happens people often try to restore a sense of fairness and equity by engaging in less work like ‘quiet quitting’ or worse.”

This more subtle form of dissent has different definitions but at its core it’s about workers setting boundaries and not taking on additional work for which they aren’t paid.

In other words they clock in when expected do their assigned tasks and leave on time.

Meanwhile one of the potential pitfalls of a full return-to-office plan is the upcoming cold and flu season coupled with another potential wave of COVID-19.

“As you call people back you can expect productivity to drop as people become sick in the fall” Savaglio said. “You’re in a confined and limited space conducive to transmitting COVID-19.”

Even if some Canadians are ready to put the pandemic behind them he said there’s a difference between personal life choices and conditions they are subjected to in the workplace.

“In your personal life you can choose what you feel comfortable with you select your risk of harm to some extent” Savaglio said. “When you go to the workplace you submit to your employer’s terms and conditions … if employees aren’t comfortable with the health and safety standards there could be a backlash.”

Why Rings Of Power's Robert Aramayo Calls Elrond The Mutt Of The Legendarium - Exclusive

Elrond is one of the most crucial characters in all of J.R.R. Tolkien's legendarium. The half-Elven fellow is a counselor a warrior a loremaster and the leader of Rivendell. He's one of the most important characters in the entire Second and Third ages of Middle-earth history too. Along with his critical role as a supporting character in ""The Lord of the Rings"" Elrond gets involved in the action on the periphery of ""The Hobbit"" story (via his dealings with the White Council and the Necromancer).

Yet all of those events are arguably little more than a footnote in the character's long and illustrious life on the mortal shores of Middle-earth. Before that he spends time fighting in battles founding Rivendell getting one of the three Elven Rings and eventually settling down and having a gaggle of other half-Elven offspring.

Throughout all of his life though Elrond's half-mortal half-immortal ancestry is one of his defining factors. It connects him to practically everyone and gives him an extremely unique perspective. This isn't just our opinion — it's shared by Robert Aramayo who portrays Elrond in Prime Video's newly released ""Rings of Power"" Middle-earth streaming series. We recently sat down to have a long talk with Armayo about his character and the actor's thoughts on Elrond's ancestry were eye-opening to say the least."

A video - posted by PPV-Tahoe on Instagram - showed an unidentified man and woman stealing a load of designer purses and a basket full of shoes.

In the video alarm bells can be heard going off as a man in a white shirt can be seen languidly browsing through the rack of purses before he casually walks off with what appears to be a few Michael Kors bags.

A woman who is with him can be seen carrying a decorative laundry basket full of shoes out the door of a Peoria Arizona store according to PPV-Tahoe.

Customers did not seem alarmed by the brazen thieves and kept shopping like nothing was happening.

A man was seen stealing designer purses from a Ross store in Peoria Arizona at an unknown time

He was seen walking out with what appeared to be at least one Michael Kors purse

the woman was seen carrying a laundry basket full of shoes as she walked out the store with her head down

They were seen taking off in a white car as no one tried to stop them

Even the manager who appeared to be standing near the rack did not largely engage with the thieves.

One Ross employee ran outside after the pair and appeared to throw a rock at them but that didn't stop them.

It is unclear if the incident was reported to police or how much they stole in merchandise. Employees from both Ross stores in Peoria told DailyMail.com that they were unaware of the incident.

Robberies across the country have risen especially in New York City where a gang of seven thieves was seen calmly leaving a Lululemon store with $30000 worth of items.

Seven thieves believed to be aged from 30 to 50 years old entered the store on 14th Street and 9th Avenue with empty carts and laundry bags while the guard casually glanced over as they grabbed piles of clothing on August 16.

The brazen robbers targeting the posh West Village neighborhood rushed out of the store with their finds - without being apprehended by the security guard.

Store surveillance footage showed the thieves walk in and out of the store around noon - looting thousands of dollars worth of merchandise as the seemingly unbothered guard dressed in a white shirt and black tie stood by.

New York police are searching for a group of thieves who took a shopping spree at NYC Lululemon on August 16. The gang of robbers made of with about $30000 in merchandise as a security guard calmly stood by

Another woman walked out with a bag filled of clothing in a slight more of a hurry than the others. Still the security guard didn't intervene

The first thief left with a cart filled with goods while another struggled to put all the clothing he gathered in a bag right in front of the man - who didn't move an inch.

Another woman ran out of the store with a filled bag. The group fled in an unknown direction.

RCL,Royal Caribbean Group,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJveWFsY2FyaWJiZWFuYmxvZy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8wMi9zcGFjZXhzLXN0YXJsaW5rLWNvdWxkLWJlLWFkZGVkLWZpcnN0LWluZGVwZW5kZW5jZS1vZi10aGUtc2Vhc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SpaceX's Starlink could be added first to Independence of the Seas,"While Royal Caribbean has not confirmed any roll out schedule for its new Starlink internet deal there's at least one ship that appears to be getting it installed already.

Royal Caribbean announced this week a new partnership with SpaceX's Starlink service that will bring high speed internet access to all Royal Caribbean cruise ships.

A Royal Caribbean spokesperson did not provide a timeline other than ""the Starlink technology rollout will start immediately across all Royal Caribbean International ships.""

In the original press release the company planned to get Starlink to ships across all three Royal Caribbean Group brands by the end of the first quarter of 2023.

Independence first?

Cruisers aboard Independence of the Seas have noticed work being done at the aft of the ship that seem to be new antennas.

RoyalCaribbeanBlog reader Paul ""Land Genie"" Crow shared photos from the area near the back of the ship where the new antennas are going.

If true the antennas are located above the Flowrider surf simulator viewing area.

There's no word yet when the new service will be turned on but Mr. Crow reports hearing from crew members that the installers boarded the ship in Nassau earlier in the cruise and have been working ever since.

Celebrity Beyond

If you're cruising with Celebrity then the Celebrity Beyond could be first for them.

The Verge reports Celebrity Beyond would be ready to launch Starlink on September 5th.

Why Starlink on cruise ships matters

If having interenet access on a cruise vacation doesn't get you excited you might be in the minority.

Just like anywhere on land having reliable and fast internet access has become a way of life and not just for those looking to do some work while at sea.

Society has become more reliant than ever on having internet access and on a cruise ship the internet is the way to stay in contact with the outside world.

Whether texting or calling family checking on the latest updates on social media or tracking sports casual internet use is a major need for a lot of travelers.

And then there's the contingent of vacationers who do have a need to keep up with work while on vacation or prefer to work remotely from somewhere else.

Up until now Royal Caribbean's internet service had been hit or miss depending on the ship you sailed on and the region of the world you visited. All but the newest ships had mediocre to poor internet speeds and even the new ship internet access was generally slower than internet access on land.

What can guests expect?

Royal Caribbean did not divulge technical details about the Starlink service onboard such as what kind of speeds guests can expect or how much bandwidth each ship will receive.

They did say passengers should expect to use streaming services and make video calls once deployed.

Another big question is price.

No pricing has been shared for Starlink and it remains unknown what price changes if any will occur as a result of the switch to Starlink.

When Royal Caribbean tested Starlink on Freedom of the Seas earlier this summer they did not alter the prices during the trial period.

Many readers seem to think prices will go up as a result of the upgrade but the company has not commented on pricing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vY3Jldy1jZW50ZXIuY29tL2NlbGVicml0eS1iZXlvbmQtYmUtZmlyc3QtY2VsZWJyaXR5LWNydWlzZXMtc2hpcC1vZmZlci1zdGFybGluay1pbnRlcm5ldNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Celebrity Beyond To Be First Celebrity Cruises Ship To Offer Starlink Internet,"Celebrity Cruises' newest ship Celebrity Beyond is set to become the first vessel in the fleet to offer passengers access to Elon Musk's Starlink Internet at sea. The new technology was introduced as a way to give travelers in remote locations better access to the internet making them ideal for industries such as cruises and air travel. Now three months after the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the use of the technology it will make its way to the open ocean.

A subsidiary of Royal Caribbean Group Celebrity's New After Celebrity Ship may be the first to use it officially but it won't be the last as the technology is expected to be installed across the company's fleet. Here's a look at Royal Caribbean Group's decision to start using Starlink across its fleet plus more information about what Starlink is and what cruise passengers can expect from it.

Starlink on Celebrity - Information for passengers

As those who have been on a cruise will attest internet speeds can be much slower than most passengers at the best of times with speeds rarely in the double digits. This can lead to frustration and stress - two words that should never be associated with cruising. However the days of horrendous delays and slow connections may be over following Royal Caribbean Group's announcement that it will introduce Starlink to its fleet in a press release this week.

Starlink will be installed on all Royal Caribbean International Celebrity Cruises and Silversea cruise ships along with all new ships for each brand according to a press release. By providing Internet access via an array of highly advanced satellites located in low Earth orbit Starlink should be a game changer for cruises allowing guests to perform high-bandwidth tasks such as video streaming and calling the cruise ship as an option – and can do remote work.

Following this announcement the first ship to install Starlink technology will be Celebrity's newest ship Beyond Celebrity. Starlink will be in good time for its five-night voyage to the Western Caribbean this November and a nine-night voyage to Aruba Curaçao and the Cayman Islands in December. The ship can accommodate 3260 passengers and has a variety of Caribbean sailing itineraries from Fort Lauderdale Florida ready to book on its website.

The adoption of the technology at Royal Caribbean Group comes after a successful trial period earlier this year. Starlink was tested on Royal Caribbean's Freedom of the Seas and a press release stated that Royal Caribbean ""received positive feedback from guests and crew."" Following the upcoming installation of Starlink Royal Caribbean expects the technology to be on board all Royal Caribbean International Celebrity Cruises and Silversea cruise ships by the end of the first quarter of 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWhpdmUuY29tL2NydWlzZS1uZXdzLXVwZGF0ZS1zZXB0ZW1iZXItMy0yMDIyLzgwNDU40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cruise News Update: September 3 2022,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWhpdmUuY29tL2NydWlzZS1uZXdzLXVwZGF0ZS1zZXB0ZW1iZXItMy0yMDIyLzgwNDU40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016712B89F90>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWhpdmUuY29tL2NydWlzZS1uZXdzLXVwZGF0ZS1zZXB0ZW1iZXItMy0yMDIyLzgwNDU40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWhpdmUuY29tL3JveWFsLWNhcmliYmVhbnMtYWxsLWFjY2Vzcy10b3VyLXJldHVybnMvODAzNTnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal Caribbean's All Access Tour Returns,"For guests on Royal Caribbean the popular All Access Tour has made a comeback. Several guests have reported in the last week that the tours are available for booking in the cruise planner while others have already been lucky enough to participate in tours onboard.

The behind-the-scenes tour as it is also called gives guests the chance to explore what it takes to run a massive cruise ship with thousands of guests and crew members.

Royal Caribbean’s All Access Tour Is Back

If you’ve ever been on a cruise ship you’ll have wondered how it’s possible to feed this many people onboard and how the crew seems to do it so effortlessly.

And with thousands of pounds of laundry to be done every day and a ship that has to be brought from A to B the logistics are certainly something that is interesting to find out more about.

Luckily for guests onboard the Royal Caribbean cruise ships the All Access Tour has made a comeback. The tour disappeared during the pandemic to keep guests and crew protected under the cruise line’s protocols.

With measures becoming less intrusive onboard and protocols easing Royal Caribbean has decided to bring back the popular tour with guests now being able to make bookings.

During the All Access Tour guests set off behind the scenes in those “Crew-Only” areas. From the main crew corridor known as I-95 guests will be able to take a look at these areas by following their guide including the main dining room galley provisions engine control laundry and the bridge.

Highlights include the Main Dining Room and Main Galley where guests can learn more about how the crew prepares thousands of meals daily with unbelievable precision.

One area that not many people ever get to see is the Provision area where all the necessary food items drinks and everything else are loaded onboard and distributed around the ship.

For those with an engineering background perhaps the most spectacular areas are the Engine Control Room where everything from air conditioning to propulsion is controlled and at the Captain’s discretion the Bridge where guests get to see the officers steering the ship.

The tour can be reserved in the Royal Caribbean cruise planner or while onboard at the shore excursions desk and at guest relations.

With the popularity of the tour booking in advance is recommended. If pre-purchased the cost for the All Access tour onboard Royal Caribbean’s ships is usually cheaper although prices vary per ship.

What About Other Cruise Lines?

With Royal Caribbean bringing back the all-access tours the question arises of what the other cruise lines are doing. Carnival Cruise Line’s ‘Behind the Fun Ultimate Tour’ is not yet available.

Carnival states on the website: “Given our focus on returning to service and executing our health and safety protocols we will not be able to offer this tour until further notice. Our goal is to ensure we can continue to deliver that exceptional value and experience we have always provided.”

As with Royal Caribbean this tour is limited to just a few passengers who sign up early. It takes the select group into crew areas as well as other restricted areas of the ship including the galley theater backstage areas laundry services engine room and the bridge.

When Carnival is bringing back the Behind the Fun tour is therefore uncertain. As for Norwegian Cruise Line and MSC Cruises both cruise lines offer no information if or when the tours are available again.

As cruise lines continue to evolve their health and safety requirements onboard we can be sure that more and more will start offering the behind the scene tours again. And if they do we highly recommend taking the opportunity as it will provide an excellent background on all the fun you’ll have onboard.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc2NhcGUuY29tLmF1L2V4cGVyaWVuY2VzL2NydWlzZXMvZG8taS1oYXZlLXRvLXRpcC1vbi1hLWNydWlzZS1zaGlwLXRpcHBpbmctcnVsZXMtdGhhdC1jb25mdXNlLWF1c3NpZXMvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS9hZTFhYTk0ZTBiMzJiZTZhZWZhMDJlNDk1ZWJlOGY2Y9IBogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc2NhcGUuY29tLmF1L2V4cGVyaWVuY2VzL2NydWlzZXMvZG8taS1oYXZlLXRvLXRpcC1vbi1hLWNydWlzZS1zaGlwLXRpcHBpbmctcnVsZXMtdGhhdC1jb25mdXNlLWF1c3NpZXMvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS9hZTFhYTk0ZTBiMzJiZTZhZWZhMDJlNDk1ZWJlOGY2Yz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aussie cruisers’ confusion over $20 tips,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.escape.com.au/experiences/cruises/do-i-have-to-tip-on-a-cruise-ship-tipping-rules-that-confuse-aussies/news-story/ae1aa94e0b32be6aefa02e495ebe8f6c on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc2NhcGUuY29tLmF1L2V4cGVyaWVuY2VzL2NydWlzZXMvZG8taS1oYXZlLXRvLXRpcC1vbi1hLWNydWlzZS1zaGlwLXRpcHBpbmctcnVsZXMtdGhhdC1jb25mdXNlLWF1c3NpZXMvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS9hZTFhYTk0ZTBiMzJiZTZhZWZhMDJlNDk1ZWJlOGY2Y9IBogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc2NhcGUuY29tLmF1L2V4cGVyaWVuY2VzL2NydWlzZXMvZG8taS1oYXZlLXRvLXRpcC1vbi1hLWNydWlzZS1zaGlwLXRpcHBpbmctcnVsZXMtdGhhdC1jb25mdXNlLWF1c3NpZXMvbmV3cy1zdG9yeS9hZTFhYTk0ZTBiMzJiZTZhZWZhMDJlNDk1ZWJlOGY2Yz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

""What a s--- show of a job you have!"" comedian Josh Ocean Thomas said in response.

Thomas a San Diego native who moved to the Midwest to pursue comedy shared a clip of the exchange during his recent set at The Laugh Factory in Chicago on Instagram earlier this week where it has gone viral.

""You work for the Biden administration? Is your job to wake him up or what’s your job?"" Ocean asked ""Nick"" as the audience erupted into laughter.

BIDEN VOWS TO WITHHOLD WEAPONS FROM ISRAEL IF NETANYAHU GOES FORWARD WITH RAFAH INVASION

Miming a fictional Biden staffer trying to get the president’s attention he exclaimed ""Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! There’s a war! Hey!""

The bit continued with Thomas asking Nick what he really does for Biden. Before he could respond the comic remarked ""What a s--- show of a job you have. I can’t believe you admitted that in front of all these people.""

""You have the freedom to lie. You could have said you were a hooker and I would’ve been prouder of you"" he added.

The alleged Biden staffer started to tell Thomas that he travels to southern states before the comic interrupted with a burst of laughter.

""That’s crazy! You go to the south and try to sell ‘em on Biden? You’re f----- r------! What the f---? What are you talking about?"" he said. ""That’s your f----- job? Is to go ‘Hey listen I know you guys like Trump but Biden. I mean…’""

BIDEN WARNS NETANYAHU AGAINST RAFAH INVASION AS ISRAEL PREPARES FOR ACTION

The clip ended with one last joke as Thomas asked ""Wow. Are you ready to be unemployed? Or what’s your vibe?""

Thomas captioned the video writing ""This was my only option.""

Thomas wasn't the only comic to take aim at Biden this week.

Anti-Trump comedian Michael Rapaport torched the president in a video he shared to X on Thursday in which he officially declared he would not be supporting Biden’s re-election after the world leader told CNN he would not send weapons to Israel if it invades Rafah Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza.

Kennedy Jr.’s running mate complained on Thursday that she was “slandered” and had to “take a walk to shake it off.”

Shanahan who has been bankrolling RFK Jr.’s spoiler-ready campaign for president with the fortune she got in her divorce from Google founder Sergey Brin did not raise any specific objection to the story which she said she didn’t read until nearly a full day after it was published.

But she did go into detail about an almost cinematic encounter she had on her walk when she “pulled into a farmers market to say hello to the farmers.”

“I walked by a young man on the empty side of the parking lot who recognized me and said ‘Nicole Shanahan!’ and said he was a supporter of Bobby and watched my speech” she wrote on X.

“He said he studied the psychology of politics in college. I told him about the article and how I was trying to walk it off. He told me he had watched the ‘Who is Bobby Kennedy’ film which is specifically about how cruel and embarrassingly desperate the left-wing media can be.”

“He’s 23 years old. I looked up at the sky and then said to this young man ‘thank you you are just what I needed in this moment to keep going strong.’ His name is Alex. Thank you Alex.”

The Daily Beast reached out to the Kennedy campaign after her post but did not get an immediate response. The Daily Beast could not reach Alex because no last name was provided but he can contact us at tips@thedailybeast.com at any time.

The story that Shanahan appeared to be referring to detailed her meteoric rise from a turbulent childhood in Oakland California to the wife—and then ex-wife—of one of the richest men in the country as well as the running mate of a conspiracy theory-driven third-party presidential candidate who could hand the election to Donald Trump.

The Beast story the result of more than a dozen interviews and several weeks of work was highlighted by top tech journalist Kara Swisher on Threads on Thursday. In particular Swisher noted that a source who has spent significant time with Shanahan scoffed at Kennedy’s description of her as an artificial intelligence expert with the source saying that she “couldn’t differentiate ‘AI from a tennis ball.’”

Swisher then went on to add “And more: Unsuccessful entrepreneur losing lawyer bloviating nonsense on all manner of things she has no expertise in marriage incompetence and she’s just plainly a candidate for a thirsty wack job because she managed to get a pile of money from a tech billionaire who wanted her to go away.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9kYy1tZC12YS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L2phY2tzb24tcmVlZC1sYXdzdWl0LWlzcmFlbC1wYWxlc3Rpbmlhbi1zZXR0bGVtZW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,D.C.'s largest high school to show alternate Palestinian film after suit,"The D.C.

Finextra spoke to head of open banking and partnerships at TSB Aruna Bhalla about the service and what opportunities it opens up for consumers.

TSB Marketplace hosts 11 fintechs across both retail and business banking with services that range from investing to saving and borrowing. The service supports customers in different attributes of the marketplace focusing initially on saving money then moving on to growing their investments thinking holistically of the customer lifecycle and competency of different partnerships.

“By offering TSB Marketplace we're leveraging on the fact that we can give customers any competence through services they wouldn’t typically expect from their bank” Bhalla states “Customers now want choice they want convenience different offers and services. By being able to offer bespoke pricing we are trying to give customers more while also using our brand our reputation and our credibility to be able to allow customers access to a variety of innovative partnership offerings.”

The service is integrated into the TSB app allowing their 5 million users to access the Marketplace as a standalone product that is segmented into different categories of partnerships. Bhalla explains that the app is “built on the key pillars of grow save invest and protect. It all aligns with our Money Confidence strategy which is around meeting your customer needs and protecting things that matter the most.”

The Marketplace will develop further to offer a personalised experience by in loyalty rewards and cashback to users on products such as phone contracts and insurance policies.

Bhalla details that one of the more popular fintechs on the Marketplace is ApTap which manages bills and savings and cancels subscriptions. Wealthify a platform that manages investments has also gained traffic and significant investments.

“Bearing in mind the cost of living crisis customers are very interested in making the most out of their money obviously driven by external factors happening in the market. From a business perspective we offer the Revenu app for improved financial management for businesses to help them manage invoices and receive faster payments in a variety of digital ways.”

The platform utilises Google Salesforce and e-commerce cloud technologies to power the Marketplace. Bhalla continues that the Salesforce platform allows TSB to leverage the opportunity to conduct tests provide bundles and vary pricing as there is no reliance on in-house technology.

“Open banking is facilitating some of our partnerships so we're now looking at whether we can use open banking to help customers onboard to those third parties in a slicker quicker way.”

Bhalla continues: “We are focusing on protecting the things that matter to our customers the most. We’re looking at pets health licenses - what they need in life at the moment and how we can provide that through the app.”

As banks and fintechs continue to team up Bhalla conveys that working together allows fintechs opportunities to grow learn gain confidence and put their services in front of consumers that are looking for financial guidance.

Bhalla underscores TSB’s dedication to fostering relationships with fintechs and opening up platforms for growth in TSB’s lab program. The program in which ApTap was developed guides startups and builds up their products to eventually partner with the bank.

“We need to look for more non-financial partnerships where we can bring our customers more choice to demonstrate how to become more confident about money because we're giving them a discount to make offerings products and services that will help meet their needs.”

With the funds the company plans to further the develop its platform and expand its debt card service.

Propel offers a free mobile app that helps users manage benefits save money and earn income. It claims its platform is used by more than five million people across 50 states and three territories.

Other features include instant balance checking coupons to make savings access job postings and get instant updates about benefits.

Nyca Partners managing partner Hans Morris told Forbes â€œIf you look at financial services for poor people in many cases they’re a rip off.

â€œPropel shows that it doesn’t have to be like that but you have to be very good at avoiding people who are going to use the card fraudulently at managing all your costs but also at creating very good experiences. And it takes really good software to do that.â€

With the capital injection the company has raised a total of $80m in funding for its Series A.

Last year Nyca Partners led the $200m Series B funding round of Thought Machine a cloud-native core banking solution.

This is a huge amount of storage ideal for archiving games and storing media like music and video and well worth considering especially if your boot SSD is getting full. By comparison the cheapest 8TB SSD is £669 making this more than four times cheaper.

Seagate's IronWolf drives are generally reliable and as well as working fine as internal drives also do well as drives for NAS (network attached storage) servers. Modern PC cases continue to offer a surprising number of 3.5-inch bays so you should be able to find room for this drive and connect up the SATA power/data cables as necessary. One advantage of this over an M.2 SSD is that you can install way more SATA drives; most boards come with at least six SATA ports and some have eight or more.

If you'd prefer an 8TB in a more portable format you could install this into a USB enclosure or pick up a USB-SATA adapter; alternatively you could consider WD's Black D10 Game Drive which offers the same capacity in a form factor better suited to portable use. That costs just £165 thanks to another Amazon discount so it's not a bad alternative if you weren't planning on mounting a drive internally.

I hope you find this deal useful and stay tuned for one more tech deal to close out this week. See you soon!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9uZXdzLzk1ODQ2LW5ldy1vcHRpY2FsLWRpc2MtdGVjaC1jb3VsZC1tYWtlcy01LXRiLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New optical disc tech could make $5 per TB possible,"Serving tech enthusiasts for over 25 years.TechSpot means tech analysis and advice you can trust

Forward-looking: Despite consumer PCs and game consoles transitioning to faster SSDs traditional disk drives (HDDs) continue to offer ever more space for cold storage at lower prices. One company says it can take a significant leap forward for optical disc technology.

Folio Photonics announced a new method for optical disc storage this week that could make hard drives bigger and cheaper than ever. Using new materials and manufacturing techniques the company says it can offer storage at $5 per terabyte and eventually $1 per terabyte. The best hard drives are currently five times more expensive at around $25 per terabyte.

The new optical discs feature dynamic multi-layer write/read capabilities which previously hadn't been cost-effective at the enterprise scale. Folio achieved this through patented polymer extrusion film-based disc construction processes customized optical pickup units an easily scalable polymer co-extrusion process and ""next-generation materials.""

Where archival discs nowadays offer up to three optical layers per side per disc Folio's achieve 16 film layers. The company plans to continue increasing that number.

Folio also claims that its discs are more energy-efficient than traditional HDDs with its implementation hopefully lowering the digital storage industry's carbon footprint. Furthermore the new hard drives are more resistant to electromagnetic pulses.

The company plans to start offering the new hard drives in 2024 with 10-disc units carrying 1TB per disk translating to 10TB HDDs for around $50. Currently that much money might get you a 2TB HDD. Folio hopes to offer bigger drives eventually.

If Folio's technology takes off it could revolutionize the ongoing competition in HDDs over two dozen terabytes. Manufacturers like Western Digital and Seagate are racing to create 30TB drives by the middle of this decade and reach 100TB by 2030. Those companies and Toshiba are pushing the limits of HDD storage and performance with technologies like HAMR microwave assistance and iNAND memory.

Seagate released a 20TB HDD in 2020 and WD unveiled a 26TB drive earlier this year. The recent advances in multi-layer technology could significantly accelerate the storage race.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL3NlYXNvbmljLXNpbHZlcnN0b25lLW5leHQtZ2VuLWF0eC0zLTAtZ2VuLTUtcmVhZHktcHN1LXVudmVpbGVkLXN0YXJ0aW5nLWF0LTIzMC11cy1mb3ItMTAwMHcv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vc2Vhc29uaWMtc2lsdmVyc3RvbmUtbmV4dC1nZW4tYXR4LTMtMC1nZW4tNS1yZWFkeS1wc3UtdW52ZWlsZWQtc3RhcnRpbmctYXQtMjMwLXVzLWZvci0xMDAwdy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Seasonic & Silverstone Next-Gen ATX 3.0 & Gen 5 Ready PSU’s Unveiled Starting at $230 US For 1000W,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL3NlYXNvbmljLXNpbHZlcnN0b25lLW5leHQtZ2VuLWF0eC0zLTAtZ2VuLTUtcmVhZHktcHN1LXVudmVpbGVkLXN0YXJ0aW5nLWF0LTIzMC11cy1mb3ItMTAwMHcv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vc2Vhc29uaWMtc2lsdmVyc3RvbmUtbmV4dC1nZW4tYXR4LTMtMC1nZW4tNS1yZWFkeS1wc3UtdW52ZWlsZWQtc3RhcnRpbmctYXQtMjMwLXVzLWZvci0xMDAwdy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000167120EAA70>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL3NlYXNvbmljLXNpbHZlcnN0b25lLW5leHQtZ2VuLWF0eC0zLTAtZ2VuLTUtcmVhZHktcHN1LXVudmVpbGVkLXN0YXJ0aW5nLWF0LTIzMC11cy1mb3ItMTAwMHcv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vc2Vhc29uaWMtc2lsdmVyc3RvbmUtbmV4dC1nZW4tYXR4LTMtMC1nZW4tNS1yZWFkeS1wc3UtdW52ZWlsZWQtc3RhcnRpbmctYXQtMjMwLXVzLWZvci0xMDAwdy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vc2VjdXJpdHlib3VsZXZhcmQuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvbXVsdGktZmFjdG9yLWF1dGhlbnRpY2F0aW9uLW1mYS1pcy1ub3QtZW5vdWdoL9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vc2VjdXJpdHlib3VsZXZhcmQuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvbXVsdGktZmFjdG9yLWF1dGhlbnRpY2F0aW9uLW1mYS1pcy1ub3QtZW5vdWdoL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Is Not Enough,"By now you’ve surely heard about some of the breaches that have been happening when company A gets illegally accessed via the threat actors hacking into one of company A’s vendors. Microsoft was breached when hackers got into SolarWinds. Twilio was recently breached when hackers were able to hack Okta. Learn more about what exactly happened check out this great article Okta one-time MFA passcodes exposed in Twilio cyberattack. The list of these types of indirect breaches is long and continues to grow. The bad news for vendors like Okta is that it’s happened more than once this year. Can it have been prevented?

Before we look at how Banyan Security can enhance MFA and prevent these types of attacks let’s take a quick look at history. User security started with credentials: a username name and a password. Passwords were never good enough and lots of folks kept them as defaults or on post-it notes on their computers. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and one-time passwords (OTP) came along and tried to correct some of these issues. They’ve done a good job but we know about the limitations. Moreover the identity systems such as Microsoft Active Directory or token-based systems from RSA and the likes of Google Authenticator used to sit behind a firewall and VPN. These systems have evolved into SaaS solutions. Folks are using Microsoft Azure AD Okta OneLogin and Ping which are public-facing SaaS services making it easy for attackers to figure out who is using what. Try going <any company name>.okta.com and you’ll likely find a page for that company. No more secrets hidden behind VPNs.

Identity has become the weakest link and attackers are using new methods to phish for credentials. One example of this is domain squatting. In the latest Twilio attack attackers registered the twilio-sso.com and twilio-okta.com domain names at registrar Porkbun and created phishing sites for them. They then sent messages to users hoping one just one would respond. Unfortunately for Twilio the domains seemed legit enough to their employees and the attack worked.

As incredible as it may seem  the days of using an authentication strategy built on something you have something you know and an inherence factor are likely behind us. MFA phishing attacks are now the norm and standard IAM practices are no longer sufficient to protect access and authorization to mission critical resources. MFA can be better.

How Banyan enhances MFA

Simply stated factoring user and device identity and trust into the equation could have prevented the attacks. Let’s learn how.

Banyan Security’s ZTNA solution integrates with leading MFA vendors. These MFA vendors can be configured to use certificate-based authentication aka cert-auth. These intelligent certificates tie the device to the user. Without them no access will even be considered. Once the user is identified the device identity and posture assessment process is completed to generate a Banyan TrustScore. User identity including MFA or device identity and trust alone are never enough to get access.

To summarize before any access is granted the following must be true:

Banyan must trust the specific MFA vendor

Banyan must deploy the Banyan app to a very specific end user device

Banyan must authenticate the user and ensure that they can enroll their specific end user device

Banyan must generate an intelligent certificate for that specific user and specific device

Banyan must check the identity and authorization level of the user

Banyan must in a timely matter validate a component of the user identity with the MFA vendor

Banyan must check the identity and authorization level of the device

Banyan must check the posture level of the device

Banyan must check the configured risk tolerance of the resource

This is a secure defense-in-depth multi-step process. If any step is skipped no access is granted! Luckily for end users most of this magic happens behind the scenes so ensure your users aren’t jumping through hoops to get secure access.

You may be thinking if the attacker has credentials and has phished MFA they can enroll a new device and gain access. With Banyan’s ZTNA solution new device enrollment can be blocked by rotating invite code or completely disabling the process and leveraging Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) to push out the Banyan app along with the intelligent certificate.

Banyan’s ZTNA granular policies also ensure that applications can only be accessed by devices with a known and specific identity and posture. Unknown and unauthorized devices are banned from attempting enrollment and access.

Banyan’s latest offering further enhances MFA

Banyan’s expansion into Security Service Edge (SSE) comes as customers are looking for innovative solutions to problems such as the domain squatting mentioned above. Banyan introduced DNS Threat Detection which provide acceptable use policy along with malicious domain protection. Moreover Banyan’s DNS Threat Detection blocks newly registered domains which are often set up using shady registrars anonymously and within hours or days of the attack.

LNG Alliance a fully integrated turnkey project developer of LNG terminals already received a permit in December 2020 from the U.S. Department of Energy to export U.S.-produced gas to Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and non-FTA countries for a 7.8 mtpa LNG export facility.

Hart Energy Senior Reporter Pietro Donatello Pitts spoke with LNG Alliance CEO Muthu Chezhian about his company’s plans in Guaymas to import piped gas from the U.S. and the potential timeline for initial LNG shipments to South Asia as soon as January 2026.

LNG Alliance CEO Muthu Chezhian said:

“We already have the U.S. Department of Energy’s permit to export U.S.-produced gas to Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and non-FTA countries for a 7.8 mtpa LNG export facility which we received in December 2020. We also have a cooperation agreement in place with the state government of Sonora which is a key differentiator for our project. In April 2022 we had a launch ceremony at the project site at Guaymas with the participation of the Governor of Sonora a representative from Mexico’s Secretariat of Navy (SEMAR) and the Mayor of Guaymas”.

“This is a cooperation between the state government and Amigo LNG project and the state is providing us the land on a long-term lease. We are also working with the government of Sonora on a concrete way to accelerate and contribute to some of the sustainability and ESG goals of the state. Part of the project margins will go towards the betterment of the communities and cooperatives in Sonora and the State of Sonora is actively supporting the project”.

It’s no secret that northern St. Johns County is experiencing a massive development boom right now.

Over the past decade thousands of single-family and multi-family living units have popped up throughout land that had long sat undeveloped near the county line between southern Duval and northern St. Johns. And with any significant growth in population commercial development soon follows.

Over half a dozen retail center projects have sprung up in the northern St. Johns area. The largest of these projects Durbin Park has been detailed frequently by local publications including our own. We even created a running list of future Durbin Park tenants which became one of our most-viewed articles of all time showing the clear interest in retail growth in the area.

That’s why we’ve decided to make a dedicated list for all of the other less-mentioned developments that are underway in the northern St. Johns area. We’ve listed what we know so far below and we’ll keep updating the list as new tenants and projects are announced.

Be sure to check back frequently for updates. And if you wish to utilize these lists on your own page please be sure to link back to our original list!

TEEN Mom Chelsea Houska got furniture decor and other home items for free while building her South Dakota farmhouse her manager admits.

Chelsea 31 and Cole 33 bought land and built their South Dakota farmhouse as the family moved into the dream home in early 2021.

The U.S. Sun can exclusively reveal that Chelsea and Cole received many free items during the building process including paint furniture decor and more.

The social media deals were mentioned in Chelsea and Cole’s $3million lawsuit.

The couple was sued by consulting company Envy for $3million for allegedly withholding money made from social media promotions.

The information was revealed in Chelsea and Cole's manager William Dzombak’s deposition taken on August 18 2022.

In the court papers obtained by The U.S. Sun William was asked: “So what materials did they receive as part of promotions branding licensing et cetera? Beyond just rugs the actual building materials that they received?”

William responded: “The only thing they would have received is [Sherwin-Williams] paint and railings.”

He added the couple also received paint primer in exchange for “some sort of social media post” according to the manager.

He was then asked: “What was the arrangement between Down Home DeBoers and Montgomery's Interiors?”

William answered: “They probably provided some home furnishings. I'm not sure exactly what.”

William added that the couple also received bedding from company Beddy’s.

In addition to the sheets and comforter William “assumed” during the deposition that the couple also received “payment” for certain posts.

Chelsea and Cole’s Instagram Down Home Deboers promoted various items and companies to their over 700k followers.

The promotion for the railings read: “It’s been long overdue that we chit chatted about our stair railing....we did the Onyx Rod Railing from @viewrail and we could. not. be. happier.

“The install was smooth sailing and I feel like the railing was the final piece that pulled everything together in our main room and up on the catwalk. We wanted something with that modern look and we had seen nothing but great reviews and personal experiences with View Rail and I can say that they were awesome to work with.

“Highly recommend them if you’re in the process of building or if you wanna update your stairs!”

The couple promoted Beddys Wallbrush wallpaper paint and more on their stories which were saved as highlights on Instagram.

DREAM FARMHOME

Chelsea and Cole bought a plot of land in Vermillion South Dakota and began building on it in early 2020.

The couple updated fans on the building and decor process.

The farmhouse has hardwood floors throughout.

The kitchen has white cabinets with a black island for contrast stainless steel appliances and granite countertops.

The living room has a black brick fireplace and ceiling-length windows.

The home has modern farmhouse vibes throughout.

FARMHOUSE FABULOUS

Chelsea and Cole snagged a new HGTV show called Farmhouse Fabulous after building the home.

The series which is set to debut in 2023 will follow the couple as they help families renovate their homes.

Chelsea and Cole have filmed for the series as they shared photos and videos of their renovations with fans.

$3MILLION LAWSUIT

As The U.S. Sun reported Envy claimed in the lawsuit that the company entered into a contract with The William Gerard Group in 2015 to provide consulting services to Chelsea and Cole who entered a contract in 2016 in exchange for a portion of the revenue made from deals.

Envy worked as a “consultant to negotiate appearance endorsement licensing royalty and television agreements and related contracts” from 2015 through 2019.

The court papers claim Chelsea and Cole “failed to pay any of the contractually required fees.”

The former Teen Mom 2 stars were required to pay Envy 35 percent of all fees or royalties for domestic deals and 40 percent for foreign deals.

The court papers claimed Chelsea and Cole “breached their contracts by directing certain Brands to directly pay Houska DeBoer one of the other Shared Clients and/or other persons or entities to avoid paying Envy Licensing Fees.”

The MTV stars also “both failed to perform without any cause or reason many of their responsibilities to the Brands.""

Allegedly failing to meet the contractual obligations caused them to “forfeit certain fees upon which Envy was entitled to receive.”

The court papers continued to claim Chelsea and Cole made “millions of dollars” due to Envy's efforts.

The company sued the defendants for $3million.

HITTING BACK

Chelsea Cole and the other defendants hit back against the lawsuit by filing a counterclaim in May 2020 alleging Envy actually withheld $150000 from them.

Chelsea and Cole denied the allegations and claimed they “do not owe any payments to Envy"" and that the company “wrongfully withheld payments due to Chelsea.”

The reality stars claimed Envy has “actually harmed the professional careers of Defendants Chelsea and Cole by withholding considerable payments from them and acting in an unprofessional manner including but not limited to arguing with and acting disrespectfully toward Chelsea and Cole potential and then-existing licensing contacts and other professional contacts of Chelsea and Cole.”

The Defendants also claimed Envy ""intentionally omitted numerous deals and/or revenues from the Account Statements for the sole purpose of depriving Chelsea Cole and TWGG from receiving funds rightfully due and owing to them.”

Chelsea claimed they owe her $154074.62 from deals with Loving Tan Profile Diff Eyewear and more.

Envy denied the claims against them in their response.

SECRET BUSINESS CLAIMS

The U.S. Sun previously reported Chelsea and Cole were accused of ""hiding"" assets in various businesses.

In a letter to the judge obtained by The U.S. Sun Plaintiff Envy requested to extend the deadline to complete the discovery process which includes documents and financial statements from October 30 2022 through November 30 2022.

Envy claimed Chelsea and Cole “failed to disclose the existence” of their LLCs Dakota Ln Down Home DeBoers DeBoer Holding Company and Aubree Says.

The letter continued to state that William Dzombak Chelsea and Cole's manager was deposed on August 18 2022.

In the deposition they learned that Chelsea and Cole ""failed to produce critical documents related to the concealed entities including a series of licensing agreements and the resulting revenue.”

Envy asserts in its letter that at the deposition the manager testified Dakota Ln LLC was created after Envy threatened litigation.

They state in the letter that the manager believed C&A LLC which was the business Chelsea used during her contract with Envy was “shut down and stripped of all assets"" in his deposition.

The letter continued to claim: “Defendants knowingly failed to fulfill their discovery obligations and actively sought to conceal relevant entities documents and revenue from Plaintiff and ultimately from this Court.

“Defendants have not produced any licensing agreements entered into revenue received by nor correspondence from the Concealed Entities.”

Envy requested to file a new complaint to add the claims against the four secret businesses.

Envy is also asking to be awarded “fees and expenses” of filing the new complaint because of their alleged “malfeasance.”

The Plaintiff is also requesting Chelsea and Cole be “sanctioned” for “willfully intentionally and repeatedly failing to comply with their discovery obligations.”

The letter alleged: “Defendants represented they complied with the order but failed to produce any licensing agreements and related revenue records for Dakota Ln LLC—a failure that Dzombak’s testimony makes clear was knowing and intentional.

“Simply put Defendants possess and are plainly aware of documents they were already ordered to produce. Defendants’ conduct has unnecessarily and vexatiously increased Plaintiff’s fees and expenses throughout this litigation.”

Chelsea and Cole have not yet responded to the letter.

Joe looks at some fun sponsorships,"Joe Blundo

Special to The Columbus Dispatch

The hallowed ground on which the Buckeyes play is now known as “Safelite Field At Ohio Stadium.”

Fans who regard the Horseshoe as the football equivalent of St. Peter’s Basilica are asking where it will all end.

Well I’d say a long way from here.

As long as fans are willing to put up with anything (which ultimately they are) and TV continues to own college football (which assuredly it will) these sponsorship deals won’t stop. It’ll get a lot more intrusive than having a car-window company’s name on the field.

Here are my predictions:

Script Dorito

In exchange for millions of dollars Ohio State allows the marching band to spell out the name of a snack. But the university draws the line at “Cool Ranch Dorito” because it would mean expanding the band by 200 members and stretching the formation beyond the stadium. “We do have our standards” a university spokesman says.

'Charmin Ohio'

In one of its most controversial moves OSU sells the naming rights to ""Carmen Ohio"" the alma mater to a toilet paper company. The lyrics begin as always “Oh come let’s sing Ohio’s praise” but there’s a subtle change later in the song: “Summer’s heat or winter’s cold/You always gotta have a roll.”

Brutus Smuck-eye

J.M. Smucker the giant jelly company with headquarters in Ohio pays millions to meld its name with the Ohio State mascot. The agreement allows Brutus to retain his traditional look but calls for him to travel with a sidekick Toast who leaves a slick of strawberry jam as he cavorts on the field.

H&R Block O

The tax-preparation company antes up big bucks to put its name on the student cheering section which will now hold up cards labeled Form 1040.

Taco Victory Bell

What used to be known as simply the Victory Bell continues to toll after every Buckeye triumph — and also every time Taco Bell wants to alert the city to a two-for-one deal on chalupas.

Scarlet and Greyhound

In exchange for a few million dollars from the bus company the university agrees that every TV mention of the school colors will be accompanied by a honk and hissing airbrakes.

More:Blundo: How will the Jan. 6 insurrection be remembered years from now?

LegO-hio Stadium

Finally the inevitable arrives. After selling naming rights to everything from the yard markers to the urinals OSU auctions off the name of the stadium itself to a Danish toy company.

Fans long since conditioned to such deals are less irked by the name change than by the requirement that the stadium be repainted in tiny blocks of primary colors.

“But it could have been worse” shrugs one. “SpaghettiO-hio Stadium was also in the running. The turf would have been red and dotted with meatballs.”

Summer might be coming to an end but celebs' nude selfies don't seem to be going anywhere. Just one look at Ashley Graham Heidi Klum and Gwyneth Paltrow's feeds show self-love and body confidence are alive and well - and so it should be!

Lisa 59 is the latest to get in on the action sharing an almost nude photo in a gold and beige lingerie set adding the caption ""Nothing but @dilarafindikoglu 🌙🌠✨""

Fans loved the look writing in the comments ""Omg🔥🔥🔥"" and ""Iconic."" Someone else added ""Now you’re just showing off 🤣"" and ""Wow🔥🔥🔥"" while others put ""Thirst trap!"" and ""Iconic Lisa 🙌🏽💕👸🏻""

This isn't the first time Lisa has shared a semi naked snap on her grid. Back in May The Real Housewives star clapped back at a troll by posting a fully as in completely naked picture of herself on Instagram.

The whole thing started when model and writer Paulina Porizkov posted a bikini snap on Instagram and got a pretty lengthy and very agist comment from a follower criticising the 57-year-old for sharing the image.

Rinna rebutted the comment with a nude of her own adding in the caption ""Paulina Porizkov posed in a tiny bikini and they called her old and ugly. I am 1 year older than Paulina. Here's my 'old and ugly' ✨.""

This article explains how to convert your existing Snapchat profile into a public one that everyone can see.

How to Make Your Snapchat Profile Public

When you create an account on Snapchat every piece of content you shoot is only made available to folks on your friends list. In order for the general population to enjoy your content you have to make your Snapchat profile available public. Here's what to do.

To switch to a public profile start by going to your Profile by tapping your Bitmoji on the top left of the screen. Once in your Profile scroll to Spotlight & Snap Map and tap the three dots next to Add to Spotlight. At the bottom of the screen a prompt will show up with two options. Tap Create Public Profile. Confirm your selection in the next screen to make your profile public.



Expert Tip: Note When you decide to create a public Snapchat profile or opt to convert an existing account you run the risk of attracting unwanted attention. As such your name will show up on any Snaps you post to Spotlight or the Snap Map. Your name will also be attached to any Lenses you make. If things get out of hand just edit or delete your Public Profile.

How to Make Your Story Viewable by Everyone

It's just a few taps to make your Snapchat story available to everyone. Here's how it's done.



Tap your Bitmoji located at the top left of your screen to open your Profile. Once there tap the gear in the top right to get to your Account Settings. Once in Settings scroll to Privacy Control and tap View My Story. Choose ""everyone"" to let your Story posts be seen by anyone.

Expert Tip: Note While you're making your Snapchat Story available to all users you can also decide whether you want your profile to be searchable in the app's Quick Add program or if you want to show up in the My Location feature. Both options make it easier for people to find your Snapchat whether you personally know them or not. This will boost your visibility at the expense of your relative privacy using Snapchat.

Shortly after the investigation was published in April last year Afghanistan’s Ministry of Mines and Petroleum released a statement denying it had signed any such deal and calling the investigation’s findings “baseless” and “untrue.”

Now documents published by the very same ministry show the company started collecting chromite while Ghani was in office — and raise fresh questions about the former president’s knowledge of his brother’s involvement in the deal.

OCCRP’s previous reporting showed Ghani’s brother Hashmat held a hidden 20 percent stake in Southern Development a subsidiary of a Virginia-based military contractor that in 2019 won the right to buy chromite from miners across Afghanistan. At the time it was not clear how much the deal was worth or whether the company had actually obtained any minerals.

Documents posted to the Afghan Ministry of Mines and Petroleum’s website show Southern Development received at least 1.1 million kilograms or about 1200 short tons of chromite that had been confiscated from artisanal miners. They also show that it requested approval to obtain up to 200000 tons of chromite which would likely have been worth up to $120 million at the time.

Among the documents are minutes from a briefing for the former president which state that Southern Development was 20 percent owned by unnamed “Afghans.”

Ikram Afzali the executive director of Integrity Watch Afghanistan an anti-corruption organization said the documents raised questions about how much Ghani knew about his brother’s role in the company and when.

“There’s no way he would approve a contract and not know the details of it” he said.

The documents were made public shortly before the Taliban seized Kabul in August last year although it is not clear exactly when they were posted online. Since then Ashraf Ghani has fled to the United Arab Emirates while his brother has pledged allegiance to the new Taliban regime. Southern Development’s website is now offline. According to the Taliban government’s Ministry of Mines Southern Development no longer has any mineral contracts.

The Ministry of Mines and Petroleum has previously denied any wrongdoing in the handling of the contracts.

Hashmat Ghani Ashraf Ghani and Southern Development did not respond to emailed requests for comment. In previous statements to OCCRP Hashmat Ghani denied wrongdoing.

Salvation Through Mining

In the years before the fall of Kabul American and Afghan leaders had been planning to develop Afghanistan’s extensive reserves of gold lithium uranium and other mineral riches thought to be worth at least a trillion dollars.

The theory — originally promoted by a Pentagon task force — was that a more robust mining sector would provide jobs and help to turn the warlords who controlled the mines into business owners. On the ground the sector was chaotic and rife with violations. Former Special Forces Officer Mike Perry who participated in task force missions to Kunar province in Afghanistan’s northeast said that during the time of the U.S. occupation he saw Taliban-run chromite mines where artillery shells were used to blast rock apart.

“If I remember correctly the Taliban brought in labor from Pakistan” Perry told OCCRP. “There was zero benefit to the locals in the district.”

Southern Development was the company that emerged from these plans the local subsidiary of SOS International (SOSi) an American military contractor.

The company had built a mineral crushing plant near Kabul and had its eye on stockpiles of unprocessed chromite gathered by artisanal miners. Chromite a component of stainless steel is relatively easy to extract and therefore popular with independent prospectors.

Because of the mineral’s murky supply chain Southern Development needed government approval to buy the chromite. A PowerPoint presentation prepared for President Ghani by the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum shows the company requested permission to acquire more than 200000 tons of chromite from six provinces potentially worth between $60 million and $120 million.

The 2019 presentation also warned that Southern Development risked bankruptcy unless the government allowed it to obtain the contraband metals because the company’s Kabul factory would become inoperable without a steady flow of raw material.

The presentation did not unequivocally endorse the deal however. One slide warns that allowing Southern Development to buy the metals could constitute “encouragement to continue illegal extraction.”

Afghanistan’s High Economic Council an office personally overseen by the president nevertheless granted the company rights to buy 20000 tons of chromite from artisanal miners according to files posted online.

Before now it was unclear if Southern Development ever actually received any chromite. Reporters could find no public evidence the company paid any royalties to the government which were set at 7.5 percent of the price of the raw material.

Two auditor reports published on the mining ministry website however confirmed that at least 1200 short tons of the mineral was shipped to Southern Development in the first half of 2020. The supplies came from the Maidan Wardak Khost and Paktia provinces — the same regions where the 20000 tons of chromite confiscated by the government was stored.

The reports also included photos of the chromite being unloaded at Southern Development’s facility and bills of lading for the delivery trucks.

Because of volatility in global markets and variance in quality it is hard to give an exact price for the shipments but at standard market rates chromite sand is valued at around $300 to $600 per ton suggesting the deliveries were worth between $360000 and $720000.

It was not clear whether the reports covered all shipments of chromite made to Southern Development.

Throughout Southern Development represented itself as fully U.S.-owned. In an Afghan mining ministry database the company said it was “100 percent” owned by Ralph Baker a retired American general and a SOSi employee.

OCCRP’s previous reporting uncovered that Hashmat Ghani in fact held a secret 20 percent stake through a company based in the United Arab Emirates. Despite his apparently close involvement in the deal former President Ashraf Ghani has denied accusations of insider dealing suggesting that he was unaware of his brother’s role in Southern Development.

But minutes from the High Economic Council meeting where Southern Development’s request for chromite was approved show that the president was briefed that a fifth of the company was held by “Afghans.”

Jessica Tillipman an assistant dean of the Government Procurement Law Program at George Washington University Law School said the discrepancy between the public disclosures and private briefings “appears to … undermine the government’s transparency laws.”

“The question is why?” Tillipman said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlzbGFuZHBhY2tldC5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9jb21tdW5pdHkvYmVhdWZvcnQtbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlMjY1MjQxNTgxLmh0bWzSAVVodHRwczovL2FtcC5pc2xhbmRwYWNrZXQuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvY29tbXVuaXR5L2JlYXVmb3J0LW5ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZTI2NTI0MTU4MS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Flying car company from Japan sets up Beaufort office.

More than 2½ years and one pandemic later the airport is acknowledging that the nation’s largest low-fare carrier is in fact not coming to Huntsville. But the airport and the city’s mayor are not giving up just yet.

That’s not necessarily a window into the future though. But in the snapshot of the present it’s a union that’s not happening. In an interview that published Aug. 28 in The Huntsville Lede new airport CEO Butch Roberts acknowledged as much.

Asked if there was any chance Southwest will offer service in Huntsville Roberts told The Lede “I don’t think so. If Huntsville was years ago what Huntsville is today with the growth we’ve had they might be here. When they went to Birmingham and Nashville and you draw a circle we’re already in their circle. And people are willing to drive.”

There’s a lot to unpack in Roberts’ response.

Roberts who replaced retiring Rick Tucker as airport CEO on July 1 raised the issue of Huntsville’s growth. The city is now the state’s largest and has surged past Birmingham Montgomery and Mobile – which have seen flat if not declining growth over the past decade. Though the Birmingham metro is still far larger than Huntsville’s the Rocket City’s rapid growth has only made it more appealing.

Roberts also acknowledged the fact that Huntsville is wedged between two airports Southwest already serves – 95 miles to the south in Birmingham and 124 miles to the north in Nashville. Roberts also acknowledged that travelers in Huntsville are willing to make those drives up or down I-65 to catch those flights.

And that represents a dilemma for the Huntsville airport. For years the airport has urged local travelers to fly out of their home airport with the incentive of possible lower fares and more connections in the future. The airport frequently used the hashtag #stopthedrive on its social media posts to drive home that point.

However in January 2020 there was a different perspective. The Huntsville airport had just been voted the nation’s best small airport – a celebration event that included a cascade of falling balloons and champagne on ice. Almost immediately the airport rode its new momentum to launch a social media campaign flirting with Southwest. In fact just two days later the airport tweeted from its official account.

“You know what … We’ve decided that from now until Valentine’s Day at least once per day we are going to be showing @SouthwestAir how much we could LUV them.” And among the hashtags included in the tweet: #HSVWantsSouthwest.

Day after day similar social media messages were posted by the airport directed at Southwest. It grew to the point that the airline began responding to people tagging their accounts on social media saying that there were no immediate plans to locate in Huntsville but as for the future who knows?

Six weeks later the coronavirus pandemic shut down the American economy and the airline industry hasn’t been the same since. And the Huntsville airport’s celebration of being the nation’s best came to a sudden stop.

But as the nation begins to emerge from the pandemic there is a chance to look ahead. Huntsville is still growing and with the expected arrival of U.S. Space Command and a rejuvenated space program the city’s national profile is continuing to grow as well.

At the airport while Frontier Airlines has pulled out low-cost carrier Breeze Airways is adding non-stop service to Las Vegas later this month.

“The city of Huntsville continuously works with the Airport Authority to aggressively pursue new carriers for our market” Huntsville Mayor Tommy Battle said in a statement to AL.com on Thursday. “Timing is everything of course and while the time may not have been right 10 years ago for Southwest Airlines it doesn’t mean there won’t be a time in the future. With the growth of Huntsville and North Alabama we’re becoming an increasingly attractive market for regional airlines whether it’s Southwest or another low-cost carrier.”

And while Roberts perhaps stated the obvious in confirming no deal is imminent with Southwest coming to Huntsville he’s far from surrendering.

“Every time we go to meetings we’ll talk to them” Roberts said in the interview with The Lede. “They understand our market.”

And even if it’s not on social media the Huntsville airport keeps tapping Southwest on the shoulder. An example: Roberts said the airport made sure Southwest saw that Huntsville was named the best place to live in America earlier this year by U.S. News & World Report.

“I don’t see Southwest in our near future” Roberts told The Lede. “But they might call next week.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWN1dC5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS9mbGlnaHQtYXR0ZW5kYW50cy1zdW1tZXItbWlzdHJlYXRtZW50LWhhcnJhc3NtZW50Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Summer Has Been Hell for Flight Attendants,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.thecut.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/09/flight-attendants-summer-mistreatment-harrassment.html (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016710748190>, 'Connection to www.thecut.com timed out.

Restaurant employees called police but the they were unable to find her until TSA screeners reported a “female matching that description was observed sleeping near the security checkpoint hindering their operations.” She left the checkpoint before police arrived there too but she was then identified at a baggage carousel.

Officers say she became “belligerent” according to the police report and threated to “spit on all” of the officers.” The 28-year-old woman though says she was just being harassed by police because they’d “never seen anyone as pretty as her” and that they’re “perverts and were trying to rape her” because of how good looking she is.

Ms. Bustami was arrested. She already had an outstanding warrant but bail was set at $1000. Apparently she wasn’t good looking enough to avoid multiple arrests."

A “tip-in” is a basketball term. But what’s a “sip-in”?

The answer from Starbucks workers around the country who seek to unionize themselves and their stores is it’s the latest tactic in their escalating campaign for that goal: Coordinated action coast to coast to support unionizing and demand the firm stop union-busting and start bargaining.

It’s also a variation on the sit-ins civil rights activists used during their pro-integration campaigns 60 or more years ago against segregated restaurants in the South. Remember the sit-in by Black North Carolina A&T students at a Greensboro lunch counter in 1960? Same tactic.

Organizers with Starbucks Workers United (SWU) the grass-roots effort that is mobilizing the workers from coast to coast say the sip-ins aim to draw customer support for their struggle by an unusual tactic: Pay the baristas and servers with big tips when you enter a Starbucks store—but don’t buy any coffee.

The best but not the sole alternative: Grab a cup and draw a glass of water and drink it instead. If you must order coffee identify yourself citing the local union.

“A group of community allies wearing union shirts and buttons” will be “spending as much time as permitted in a Starbucks café–after ordering drinks using union slogans as names and tipping well!” SWU explained in its August 16 newsletter to members.

“The goal is to create a celebratory environment and make connections with workers and customers who could become community allies. Workers feel supported managers feel watched and community allies get to tangibly support the campaign.”

And if you join the tip-ins on Labor Day itself—the campaign is running all weekend—the pro-union workers will ask you to sign their #NoContractNoCoffee pledge “in which allies commit to taking direct action with workers in their fight for a union contract.” Their aim is 30000 names.

The sip-ins aren’t the sole tactic Starbucks baristas and their allies are using to keep the public’s eye on their cause—a cause that resonates with so many other low-paid capitalist-exploited workers including port truckers adjunct professors and fast food workers nationwide.

In Buffalo and Minneapolis workers have had to resort to walkouts after Starbucks bosses continuing their long union-busting campaigns fired lead pro-union organizers. The entire unionized store in Buffalo—whose win touched off the nationwide drive—walked after its bosses fired the campaign chair and lead bargainer.

Starbucks workers will also march on state capitals in deep-red Oklahoma and Texas In These Times reports. Colorado baristas will show solidarity and a sense of labor history too: They will march for themselves and to honor the Mine Workers and their families gunned down at the demand of Rockefeller interests by National Guard troops in the 1914 Ludlow Massacre.

In These Times reported the Starbucks workers are emphasizing intersectionality in their sip-ins not just region to region but issue to issue. In Boston on September 4 for example the sip-ins will coincide with a campaign to preserve abortion rights. In Worcester Mass. they’ll be in conjunction with a Gay Pride celebration.

In the Twin Cities Rebecca Pera reports hundreds of baristas and their supporters took to the streets on August 30 in “The Pumpkin Spice strike” because the firm introduced its annual autumn menu that day. It’s the second forced walkout in Minneapolis in less than a month. The first one lasted two days.

The Minneapolis workers demand management bargain with the union that it reinstate illegally fired organizers and that it provide clear and consistent communication to workers.

Workers at the 47th and Cedar Avenue Starbucks store in Minneapolis won their election to unionize in May. Shortly thereafter union baristas sent requests to bosses to start bargaining meetings to create an initial contract.

Four months later workers are still asking to begin bargaining in good faith despite inconsistent messaging from management and delays from Starbucks to begin the negotiating process.

Some Minneapolis workers suspect Starbucks is intentionally dragging out the initial negotiations as an effort to bust the union and intimidate workers from continuing to organize.

“They are using stalling tactics” explained Emily Mahoney union barista and member of the negotiating team at the Minneapolis store. “Since we requested to begin bargaining in May management has told us that they won’t give us the information we need and there has been a lot of miscommunication from them. It’s as though they are trying to distract us from getting them to sit at the bargaining table.”

Starbucks is also trying other union-busting schemes many of them illegal to stop or discourage organizing. Besides illegally firing at least 80 organizers nationwide it’s closed at least two unionized stores—again illegal retaliation—in Ithaca N.Y. and Kansas City Mo. And it’s even taken a leaf from the union-busting tactics of another notorious boss Amazon’s Jeff Bezos.

The Starbucks Workers United newsletter reports that after the union won 6-1 at an Overland Park Kansas store—defying Starbucks’ illegal and intimidating firing of four organizers–the firm now charges the National Labor Relations Board tilted that election in favor of the workers. SWU calls the firm’s letter to workers about the NLRB’s bias “a PR stunt.”

Amazon leveled that same NLRB bias charge against the independent grass-roots Amazon Labor Union after that union’s decisive election win at a Staten Island N.Y. warehouse earlier this year. Bezos owns a majority share of Amazon.

On September 1 an NLRB hearing officer in Phoenix Ariz. where the Staten Island case was moved to avoid the appearance of prejudice either way ruled for the union and said Amazon proved nothing about the NLRB’s alleged pro-union “interference.”

The Starbucks workers may have influenced one more change in the firm’s corporate suite. CEO Jeff Schultz quit on September 1 with the number of unionized Starbucks stores nearing 250 nationwide. He didn’t say why.

Starbucks Workers United welcomed his successor Laxman Narasimhan hoping he’ll end Schultz’s extreme anti-union tactics and retaliation.

“We are hopeful Mr. (Laxman) Narasimhan will end Starbucks’s scorched earth union-busting campaign and work with all Starbucks partners to make Starbucks a better company and better place to work” said Starbucks Workers United organizing member Michelle Eisen.

“This is the perfect opportunity for Starbucks to end the wrongful terminations store closings and war against workers and instead embrace our union and sign the fair election principles” workers presented to Schultz and local store managers. The managers reject the principles and Schultz routinely ignored the workers’ open letters.

The department of consumer and worker protection called the case on behalf of Austin Locke a Starbucks employee for almost six years the city’s first for violating “just cause” protections under a 2017 law meant to protect fast-food workers.

The action comes as Starbucks appoints a new chief executive and the company along with Amazon and others are being accused of slow-walking negotiations over union contracts in an attempt to dam a wave of unionization efforts across the country.

New York’s fair workweek law prohibits fast-food employers from firing or laying off workers or reducing their hours by more than 15% without just cause or legitimate economic reasons.

According to a petition filed with the city’s office of administrative trials and hearings Starbucks fired Locke on 5 July one month after employees in his store in the Astoria section of the borough of Queens decided to unionize.

The lawsuit seeks Locke’s reinstatement and back pay as well as civil penalties.

A Starbucks spokeswoman said the Seattle-based company does not discuss pending litigation but plans to defend against claims it violated the law.

The petition said Starbucks claimed it fired Locke because he failed to complete a questionnaire required by its Covid-19 protocols and falsely reported that a supervisor made unwanted contact during a dispute by placing his hand on Locke’s chest.

Both incidents took place two days after the unionization vote the petition said.

In a statement provided by the city Locke said: “Starbucks continues to wrongfully fire pro-union workers nationwide in retaliation for union organizing.”

He called on Starbucks to negotiate a contract with Starbucks Workers United which represents employees at more than 200 stores.

Last month Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc agreed to pay $20m to about 13000 workers to settle city claims it violated the fair workweek law.

Chipotle was accused of failing to give workers their schedules two weeks in advance award premium pay for unscheduled shifts and let workers use accrued sick leave.

Industrial production of cement steel petrochemicals and chemicals — in other words the stuff the modern world is made of — accounts for a quarter of all CO2 emissions and demand for raw materials is rising year on year.

Despite the scale of industry’s emissions problem the IPCC says that net zero is “ challenging but possible ” for the sector: “Reducing industry emissions will entail coordinated action throughout value chains … as well as abatement technologies and transformational changes in production processes. Progressing towards net zero GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions from industry will be enabled by the adoption of new production processes using low- and zero-GHG electricity hydrogen fuels and carbon management.”

This is an introduction to two of the abatement technologies in development that will provide industrial manufacturers with an electricity-powered alternative to replace combustion of fossil fuels; a major milestone towards emissions-free materials.

RDH and RDR: Massive temperatures through direct electrification

At Coolbrook we combined technology from space science turbomachinery and chemical engineering to create the Roto Dynamic Heater (RDH) and the Roto Dynamic Reactor (RDR). By running on electricity alone the high-efficiency RDH and RDR can generate the extreme temperatures required for the manufacturing of cement steel petrochemicals and chemicals without the need to burn fossil fuels. Both technologies are being piloted and brought to market in collaboration with ABB.

While the application of these technologies to generate heat is novel its underlying principles are well-established; in the most simplified terms they are gas turbines running in reverse. Instead of using hot gas to rotate blades and generate power electric motors rotate blades to accelerate gas and generate heat for various industrial processes. By accelerating the heated gas to supersonic velocity and then rapidly slowing it down in a diffuser to subsonic velocities Coolbrook’s rotodynamic technology transforms kinetic energy to thermal energy and can generate temperatures of up to 1700 °C and thereby replace coal gas and oil-fired burners that are currently in use.

The RDH technology is the only electric technology capable of providing a high enough temperature level required for cement production which currently accounts for around a third of global industrial CO2 emissions while the RDR technology is best suited for CO2-free steam cracking in petrochemical processes. Combined it is estimated that RDR and RDH can reduce global industrial CO2 emissions by over 2 gigatonnes (Gt) a year and such technologies have the potential to propel these processes towards net zero.

Existing plants can be retrofitted with RDH or RDR without significant structural changes as the commercial units will have a footprint of just a few metres and can be used for a variety of applications allowing for a gradual rather than wholesale switch to electric power. Coolbrook’s RDR and RDH technologies are now being piloted on a large scale and will be ready for commercialisation around 2024.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVtZXBhcmt0b3VyaXN0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy8yMDIyMDkwMi8zMjkzMS9taWxsZW5uaXVtLWZvcmNlLWRlcHRoLXN0b3J5LWNlZGFyLXBvaW50cy1naWdhY29hc3Rlci1pY29uLWFuZC1pdHMtY29hc3RlctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MILLENNIUM FORCE: The In-Depth Story of Cedar Point's Gigacoaster Icon and Its Coaster Wars Victory,"Right at the intersection of art and science resides the roller coaster…

And though we’ve devoted in-depth features to many – from Son of Beast to the Big Bad Wolf; Expedition Everest to Top Thrill Dragster; Space Mountain: De la Terre à la Lune to Volcano: The Blast Coaster – in the opinion of many of the industry’s most devoted fans the ride that most magnificently combines art and science in one is MILLENNIUM FORCE the landmark gigacoaster at Cedar Point.

Image: Cedar Fair

Rising 300 feet over Ohio’s Lake Erie Millennium Force is the crown jewel of the “Roller Coaster Capital of the World”; the end-all-be-all of the ’90s “Coaster Wars”; the “Best Steel Coaster in the World” year after year; and true to its name an industry pivot point perfectly bridging the gap between past present and future. Even having been surpassed in height drop speed and length this landmark ride is a bucket list topper for coaster enthusiasts from around the globe.

Though Cedar Point promised in 2000 that “The Future Is Riding On It” the story of Millennium Force really is the story of the steel roller coaster and its half-century evolution… And that’s where our ride starts…

The Steel Age

Image: Knott's Berry Farm

You have to remember that in the grand scale of humanity’s search for amusement the steel roller coaster is a relatively new invention. By any count the first modern tubular steel-tracked coaster was Disneyland’s Matterhorn Bobsleds – a 1959 addition to the then-four-year-old park. Even still it wasn’t until the mid-’60s that “mine train” coasters began to proliferate across amusement parks; not until 1975 that Knott’s Berry Farm’s Corkscrew (left) turned upside down; not until 1978 that Cedar Point’s Gemini finally offered a drop of over 100 feet proving that this still-new “steel coaster” medium could build taller faster and steeper than anyone had imagined before.

For that reason we can’t lay the foundation for Millennium Force without acknowledging that the rise of the steel coaster began with Arrow Dynamics – a Utah-based ride manufacturer who practically dominated the industry for decades including each of the installations mentioned above from Matterhorn to Gemini.

In fact the story of the first three decades of the steel coaster is basically the story of Arrow: of the “mine trains” that proliferated through a generation of parks in the ’60s; of the Double Loops and Corkscrews that became standard in the ’70s; then of the swinging suspended coasters and daunting “multi-loopers” that became mainstays of midways in the ’80s. Arrow laid the groundwork for countless innovations – and their coasters today remain the foundation of countless amusement parks across the country.

But at the intersection of the steel coaster’s rise and Arrow’s story stands one park one ride and one man who set the stage for Millennium Force. Cue the ’80s synths.

Magnum XL-200

Cedar Point like many classic amusement parks is old. Like seriously old. Tracing its opening to the Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant just five years after the end of the Civil War the 1870 park on Ohio’s Lake Erie began like many amusement parks did: as a lakeside bathing beach that gradually added a bathhouses a dancehall a bandstand and – by 1892 – a roller coaster. (The pre-electric gravity-powered Scenic Railway reached sensational top speeds of 10 miles per hour.) It wasn’t even until 1911 that a causeway was constructed to the island turning the Victorian picnic park from an island to the peninsula we know today.

Speaking of which to visit Cedar Point a hundred years later (left) would be to see a modern park filled with rides of its time – midways littered with log flumes classic wooden coasters historic hotels and more. More to the point though Cedar Point was perhaps a poster child for the story of the roller coaster as told through Arrow’s innovation. The park had its dutiful ’60s mine train (1969’s Cedar Creek Mine Ride) its ’70s looper (1976’s Corkscrew) and an Arrow suspended coaster (1987’s Iron Dragon) all still reigned over by 1978’s Gemini.

But Cedar Point of the ’80s also had a secret ingredient: Dick Kinzel.

Image: Toledo Blade by Amy Voigt

Born in nearby Toledo Kinzel had practically been raised at Cedar Point. According to Tim O’Brien’s biography Dick Kinzel: Roller Coaster King of Cedar Point Kinzel began his employment with the park as a seasonal worker then as a food service supervisor before – in 1975 – “begging” for the job of Director of Operations for the park. Kinzel was there for the groundswell of revenue surrounding the record-breaking opening of Gemini in 1978 so when he returned to Sandusky after a stint leading Valleyfair as the newly-elevated CEO of Cedar Fair in 1986 Kinzel set out to recreate that magic.

Whereas Gemini had cost a staggering $3.7 million Kinzel now turned to the board with an almost-unthinkable request: a $7 million allowance to win back the coaster height record (which would be stolen by Six Flags Great America with 1988’s 170-foot-tall Shockwave).

“I just wanted the highest coaster in the world” Kinzel remembered in a 2017 retrospective with the Sandusky Register with his sights set on reaching 185 feet. But allegedly a board member asked “How much more would it take to get to 200?”

Magnum XL-200 opened May 6 1989 – the world’s tallest fastest and steepest roller coaster… But more importantly to Kinzel’s thinking the first ever to top that once-thinkable 200-foot height barrier; the world’s first “hypercoaster.”

Kinzel called those “last 15 feet” the best investment in Cedar Fair’s history. “People would actually say it was worth the price of admission alone” Kinzel said. “I honestly think it was the best decision the park ever made.” It makes sense. No coaster remains the “tallest” or “fastest” or “steepest” for long but the first? That’s one for the record books.

Even if Magnum is today half the height of Cedar Point’s tallest coaster it’s still a landmark. Its red-orange track blazes alongside the northern edge of Cedar Point’s beach racing perpendicular to the surf in continuous arcing airtime hills and metallic tunnels. Though today its age betrays it (Arrow’s ramp-like hills and trim-braked turnarounds feel significantly different than the precision-calibrated flowing airtime hills of a B&M hypercoaster for example) there’s no question that it remains a bucket list ride for coaster enthusiasts.

Magnum is an icon not only in the park’s history but Arrow’s. After all in retrospect Magnum sort of topped out Arrow’s capabilities. Though the manufacturer had literally created the modern standards of a thrill ride the industry was standing on the precipice of a massive shift that would leave Arrow behind and introduce the designers of the 21st century…

The Coaster Wars

No one could’ve predicted in the late ’80s that everything was about to change. But right about then – just as the concrete footers of Magnum were taking shape along Cedar Point’s beach – the first domino en route to the Coaster Wars had been tapped.

Image: B&M

It started when – in 1988 – two prominent engineers from Giovanola (a Swiss parts supplier who worked with coaster manufacturer Intamin) decided to go it alone opening their very own engineering firm with just four employees on the payroll. Suffice it to say Walter Bolliger and Claude Mabillard weren’t looking for work for long. Right away they were approached by the engineering team at the recently-rebranded Six Flags Great America near Chicago with a proposal to create a next-generation version of the stand-up coaster that the duo had developed for Giovanola.

The result was 1990’s Iron Wolf – like so many B&M coasters not the first of its kind but the most definitive form. After all Iron Wolf (above) debuted what would become B&M signatures like four-abreast trains thick-spined track cylindrical columns that iconic “pre-drop” dip and precisely-engineered layouts packed with complex inversions… a substantial divergence from Arrow’s equivalent mega-loopers of the age and certainly from TOGO stand-up coasters.

Image: B&M

Of course what really put B&M on the map was their return to Great America two years later with a whole new concept coaster: the inverted Batman: The Ride (above). Again though Arrow’s suspended coasters had dangled swinging “buckets” beneath the track B&M’s innovation had allowed for ski-lift style trains where riders – legs dangling! – were rocketed through fluid aerial manuevers and inversions.

Obviously if we jump ahead it’s easy to see B&M’s two debut rides were the start of something substantial. The inverted coaster in particular became the headliner du jour of the ’90s; the must-have thrill ride that would proliferate across coaster parks yielding wave after wave of B&M coaster designs. But especially there at the dawn of the ’90s the first wave of B&Ms standing alongside Arrows must’ve been like color TV supplanting black-and-white; a mind-blowing unimaginable redefinition of what roller coasters could look like feel like and do.

Image: Joel A Rogers CoasterGallery.com (used with permission)

In retrospect it’s almost hard to imagine just how radically the amusement park industry changed between 1989 and 1999 and how quickly B&M overcome Arrow’s multi-decade reign.

Sure Arrow would return to the “hypercoaster” stealing the “world’s tallest” record from its own Magnum XL-200 with 1994’s Desperado which was itself dethroned by another Arrow hypercoaster – Blackpool Pleasure Beach’s Pepsi Max Big One – just a month after. And for a while it might’ve seemed that – just as Arrow mine trains and double loopers had become park standards in the ’60s and ’70s – Arrow hypercoasters would gradually make their way to parks across the world.

But this time was different. The rules had been rewritten as evidenced by B&M’s own take on the 200-foot genre – 1999’s Apollo’s Chariot at Busch Gardens Williamsburg. As they’d done with the stand-up inverted and sitting coaster B&M’s hypercoaster was distinctly of the next century – its precisely-designed effortlessly weightless high-capacity high-reliability and buttery-smooth out-and-back airtime hills with raised open trains and efficient loading… such a vast divergence from Arrow’s pre-computer herky-jerky soldered-on-site installations.

So is it any surprise that for serious thrill parks the ’90s was an era of unthinkable expansion. Corporate owners like Cedar Fair Six Flags and Paramount Parks swept across the nation gobbling up independent parks or small-scale operators like Pac-Man. Frankly their big-budget financial backing and corporate connections were needed to supercharge parks with a tidal wave of thrills powered by headlining record-breakers by B&M.

The Coaster Wars had arrived. Across the industry coaster counts exploded. The arms race accelerated through the decade for better… and for worse.

“For worse” for example the reverberations of this era can still be felt in every copied-and-pasted Vekoma SLC; in every over-expanded Six Flags that can’t seem to get past decades of reliance on low-cost season passes and marketing focused exclusively on thrill-seeking teenagers; in each Cedar Fair park that boasts a dozen coasters but zero dark rides; in the decade of recuperation each park has needed to make up for ten years without any flat rides family attractions or theming; in the parks that didn’t survive the era because they couldn’t muster the finances to compete with corporate-backed chains whose headline-grabbing coasters drew visitors like a fly zapper…

We say all of that to convey to you just how accelerated this era was and how ravenously hungry operators were to turn family parks into flagships; to build taller faster and bigger than the competition by any means necessary with saturated steel columns rising like redwoods among expontentially-expanding park skylines.

And “for the better” this era of breathless expansion intense competition and rising new players in the industry served as a stellar alignment between Cedar Point Dick Kinzel and a rising ride manufacturer willing to do the unthinkable: shatter the 300-foot height record. Read on…",,,,,,,,,

As he looked toward the horizon through the wavy heat lines in his binoculars he noticed two vehicles that seemed out of place. Watching this pair of odd-looking vehicles he sensed something wasn’t right. Without even realizing it weeks of training suddenly kicked in and he was quickly getting his Javelin into operation. In the span of five minutes Baney would destroy three enemy vehicles singlehandedly sparing the brigade support battalion the rear logistical headquarters for the brigade from almost certain destruction. Baney and his unit were part of a larger force tasked with protecting the brigade rear area and for the soldiers in the logistical rear of the brigade they sure were glad he and his fellow soldiers were at the right place at the right time.

To paraphrase journalist Malcolm Muggeridge new things are old things happening to new people. This was the case in the 56th Stryker Brigade Combat Team’s recent rotation at the National Training Center during which the brigade was tasked to organize a tactical combat force in support of the exercise scenario. Responsibility for this mission was assigned to a task force—Task Force Paxton—and its experience during the rotation offers important lessons for the Army as it prepares for the future battlefield.

The tactical combat force concept has fallen out of the Army’s lexicon in recent years but with the flood of lessons learned from Ukraine it is suddenly relevant again. The concept has its roots in AirLand Battle doctrine from the 1980s. In the days of AirLand Battle the tactical combat force (in the 1982 Field Manual 100-5 Operations it was referred to simply as the “combat force”) was designated to defeat a threats categorized as Level III the most potent threat anticipated in rear areas. A Level I threat consists of a small enemy force that can be defeated by typical units operating in the logistical rear of a large unit. A Level II threat generally consists of enemy special operations teams long-range reconnaissance teams and partially attrited combat units. A Level III threat is an enemy force that is beyond the defense capability of the typical units operating in the rear area and any local reserve or response force. During the development of AirLand Battle doctrine writers analyzed the tactics of Warsaw Pact maneuver formations and realized NATO defenses in the rear area lacked the capability to counter a Level III threat. Thus the tactical combat force was born.

As the Army reorients from a focus on counterinsurgency operations to large-scale combat operations the need to address the Level III threat has returned. The war in Ukraine has illuminated the need to address security in the rear area. Commanders must now ensure their rear area combat forces have the capability to rapidly deploy a lethal combat element in a sometimes vast area of operations to defeat a potential armor or mechanized threat that seeks to disrupt their logistical operations. Because of the area that must be covered the tactical combat force needs to be highly mobile and lethal enough to destroy a Level III threat. Having that criteria in mind Task Force Paxton was able to task organize into small mobile teams to rapidly maneuver and counter any Level III threat as it emerged in the brigade’s rear area.

Task Force Paxton at the National Training Center

While not a typical task for a brigade’s National Training Center rotation adding the tactical combat force mission set enabled a training repetition for an additional battalion. Most frequently if a brigade has an undermanned battalion its manpower might be redistributed to round out other battalions and the brigade staff. Assigning OPFOR (opposing force) elements to act as a Level III threat fundamentally changed how the brigade the brigade support battalion and the brigade engineer battalion accounted for security requirements in the rear area. Task Force Paxton deployed to the National Training Center as a battalion (2nd Battalion 112th Infantry Regiment) with reduced manning. The task force deployed without the battalion’s scouts and mortar platoon and fielded a reduced battalion headquarters and headquarters company the forward support company and a rifle company with its headquarters and two platoons. While light in terms of combat power the task force was organized into multiple combat and logistical elements to accomplish its tactical combat force mission. These streamlined formations were capable of covering enemy key avenues of approach as the brigade maneuvered out of the logistical support area through the open desert and ultimately westward toward the urban centers of Razish and Ujen. Like units during most National Training Center rotations Task Force Paxton quickly discovered what did and did not work and constantly refined its task organization in order to defeat the enemy an OPFOR element named “Desert Rat.”

Task Force Paxton emphasized the importance of operating dismounted Javelin teams to counter an armored formation. Because of the relatively small elements command and control from the main command post was focused on tracking the fight and sharing information up to the brigade main command post and laterally to adjacent units. Tactical movement and maneuver was largely left to the Arrow Company commander and his platoon leaders with guidance and direction provided by the battalion commander as needed. This also shaped how the main command post and the combat trains command post which coordinated sustainment operations were established. Because of the highly mobile nature of the tactical combat force and the size of the maneuver elements the battalion staff focused on shortening the normally labor-intensive military decision-making process. Specifically the staff utilized the rapid decision-making and synchronization process which shortens planning because much of the information related to the terrain and enemy is already known and was unlikely to change.

During execution of the tactical combat force mission Task Force Paxton’s scheme of maneuver remained largely unchanged. The initial concept was to fight as small dismounted teams occupying observation posts supported by a Stryker infantry carrier vehicle. Two observation posts would be supported by one Stryker vehicle. The intent was for observation posts to detect and engage the enemy and pull the Stryker vehicle forward out of its hide position and then to send it back to a hide site that mutually supported both observation posts once the threat was eliminated. The Stryker vehicle was utilized in a multitude of ways: as a method to sustain the observation posts a nonstandard casualty evacuation platform a communication relay platform and a mounted weapons platform. Task Force Paxton had one short-range air defense Stinger team that protected the main command post and could be repositioned to one of the observation posts based on the enemy air threat.

During the initial phase of the operation the Level III threat Desert Rat penetrated deep into the brigade’s rear area. Fortunately as described above it was stopped by an intrepid soldier who destroyed two enemy armored vehicles and one enemy tank in less than ten minutes before they could mount an attack on the brigade support battalion. In subsequent phases Desert Rat was able to use terrain to its advantage slip by an observation post and conduct effective strikes against the rear area units. While the initial success could be celebrated these subsequent setbacks afforded Task Force Paxton the opportunity to continue to refine its tactics and mount an effective fight for the remainder of the exercise.

Sustaining multiple observation post locations across the brigade’s large rear area was accomplished using a logistics release point model where the sustainment units would link up with the soldiers manning the observation points at a mutually optimal location and replenish with needed supplies. Task Force Paxton’s main sustainment node the combat trains command post (CTCP) coordinated the resupply conducted at the logistics release points and conducted field maintenance at the CTCP cutting down the distance to be covered if the observation posts to get a vehicle fixed if needed. The Arrow Company supply sergeant was located at the field trains command post and shaped the makeup of logistics packages based on the logistics status of the observation posts. At the observation post locations the supporting Stryker vehicle was sent back to the nearest logistics release point to receive resupply and then ferry supplies to the observation posts. Because the observation posts were dispersed across the tactical combat force battlespace a modified system of tailgate resupply in which items are rapidly moved from one transport vehicle to another at the logistic release point provided the adequate logistical support to sustain the unit. These resupply convoys were often the most likely to inadvertently encounter the Desert Rat element as it executed its logistics package mission. Because of this a Javelin team was sometimes added to the convoy as it resupplied the observation posts.

What We Learned

Five primary lessons emerged from execution of the tactical combat force mission during the rotation at the National Training Center. The first was that adjacent unit coordination between the tactical combat force brigade support battalion brigade engineer battalion and brigade main command post is vital to having a clear friendly common operating picture during operations. Frequent communication proved to be extraordinarily important. At the battalion main command post the staff needed to be friendly unit–focused rather than enemy unit–focused. Map graphics used by the commander and his staff needed to focus more attention on depicting the locations of friendly units than enemy units because of the need to understand what was transiting the rear area. Knowing what was coming and going in and out of the rear area was critical to avoid fratricide and to understand what friendly units could come into contact with the enemy along any route.

Second Task Force Paxton lacked the ability to effectively combine arms as the tactical combat force without indirect fires. Without its mortar platoon and because it has low priority for the brigade’s artillery assets it could not engage the enemy at a distance. Ensuring there were no friendly units operating in the location where the observation posts were about to call in an artillery strike is complex in the rear area due simply to the amount of friendly elements moving within the tactical combat force’s area of operations. Graphics that are universally known to all units fighting on the battlefield as well as fire support coordination measures must be coordinated across the brigade in order to provide the tactical combat force accurate and timely fires when the enemy is located. Again because of the low priority of fires for the tactical combat force and the location of the artillery positions the unit’s own mortar systems are the best indirect fires asset for any tactical combat force commander.

Third the brigade must clearly delineate who is responsible for what in the rear area. In order for the tactical combat force to be successful the brigade must specify responsibility for the various security tasks required in the rear area to avoid duplication of effort and squandering combat power. During the National Training Center rotation it became apparent that assigning the tactical combat force sole responsibility for countering the Level III threat and tasking the brigade engineer battalion with countering the Level I and II threats allows each element to more effectively utilize its combat power. The attached military police units assigned to the brigade engineer battalion are more than capable of defeating the Level I and II threats whereas they would become quickly overwhelmed when attempting to destroy a Level III threat. Conversely if the tactical combat force has to account for all three levels of threat its response to the appearance of armor or mechanized forces in the rear area will not be effective.

Fourth the tactical combat force main command post must be lean agile and rapidly deployable. Use of camouflage netting and vehicle-mounted communication systems in place of tents enabled Task Force Paxton to rapidly shift its main command post as needed. The task force could not rely on computer systems to create digital products and execute briefings due to the time required for setup. Instead a hybrid battle-tracking solution was established combining analog tools—paper maps with plastic overlays—and digital tools like Joint Battle Command–Platform. Operations order briefings were largely done in person over terrain models and over the radio when necessary. Once the battle rhythm was established and setup and tear-down of the main command post was executed a few times Task Force Paxton was able—even with intense weather and over many miles on difficult terrain—to occupy a new main command post location and establish effective communications with its higher headquarters and its own units in about an hour.

Lastly and perhaps most importantly for the National Training Center and other combat training centers incorporating the use of a tactical combat force into scenario design provides a fourth maneuver battalion the opportunity to participate in the world-class training that only these training installations can offer. This is particularly relevant for a National Guard battalion that has reduced manning or is not sourced for a deployment. The tactical combat force mission may appear simplistic but it still exercises a battalion’s systems and processes and requires commanders to maneuver their forces in a deliberately challenging training environment.

As the Army continues to optimize its training at the combat training centers to prepare units for large-scale combat operations more refined tactics associated with fighting as a tactical combat force will emerge. Ultimately the force package a brigade is able to commit as a tactical combat force will shape how it fights. There are many ways to employ a unit in this role and only time will tell how it is incorporated into future operational designs. Army force design updates associated with large-scale combat operations should account for the tactical combat force requirement especially in the penetration divisions because of their extended logistical requirements and the lack of a tactical combat force in the current protection brigade design. Our hope is that the hard lessons learned during Task Force Paxton’s National Training Center rotation will spur conversation and provide future combat training center rotations a good starting point for planning and resourcing their version of the tactical combat force.

Microsoft was breached when hackers got into SolarWinds. Twilio was recently breached when hackers were able to hack Okta. Learn more about what exactly happened check out this great article Okta one-time MFA passcodes exposed in Twilio cyberattack. The list of these types of indirect breaches is long and continues to grow. The bad news for vendors like Okta is that it’s happened more than once this year. Can it have been prevented?

Before we look at how Banyan Security can enhance MFA and prevent these types of attacks let’s take a quick look at history. User security started with credentials: a username name and a password. Passwords were never good enough and lots of folks kept them as defaults or on post-it notes on their computers. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and one-time passwords (OTP) came along and tried to correct some of these issues. They’ve done a good job but we know about the limitations. Moreover the identity systems such as Microsoft Active Directory or token-based systems from RSA and the likes of Google Authenticator used to sit behind a firewall and VPN. These systems have evolved into SaaS solutions. Folks are using Microsoft Azure AD Okta OneLogin and Ping which are public-facing SaaS services making it easy for attackers to figure out who is using what. Try going <any company name>.okta.com and you’ll likely find a page for that company. No more secrets hidden behind VPNs.

Identity has become the weakest link and attackers are using new methods to phish for credentials. One example of this is domain squatting. In the latest Twilio attack attackers registered the twilio-sso.com and twilio-okta.com domain names at registrar Porkbun and created phishing sites for them. They then sent messages to users hoping one just one would respond. Unfortunately for Twilio the domains seemed legit enough to their employees and the attack worked.

As incredible as it may seem  the days of using an authentication strategy built on something you have something you know and an inherence factor are likely behind us. MFA phishing attacks are now the norm and standard IAM practices are no longer sufficient to protect access and authorization to mission critical resources. MFA can be better.

How Banyan enhances MFA

Simply stated factoring user and device identity and trust into the equation could have prevented the attacks. Let’s learn how.

Banyan Security’s ZTNA solution integrates with leading MFA vendors. These MFA vendors can be configured to use certificate-based authentication aka cert-auth. These intelligent certificates tie the device to the user. Without them no access will even be considered. Once the user is identified the device identity and posture assessment process is completed to generate a Banyan TrustScore. User identity including MFA or device identity and trust alone are never enough to get access.

To summarize before any access is granted the following must be true:

Banyan must trust the specific MFA vendor

Banyan must deploy the Banyan app to a very specific end user device

Banyan must authenticate the user and ensure that they can enroll their specific end user device

Banyan must generate an intelligent certificate for that specific user and specific device

Banyan must check the identity and authorization level of the user

Banyan must in a timely matter validate a component of the user identity with the MFA vendor

Banyan must check the identity and authorization level of the device

Banyan must check the posture level of the device

Banyan must check the configured risk tolerance of the resource

This is a secure defense-in-depth multi-step process. If any step is skipped no access is granted! Luckily for end users most of this magic happens behind the scenes so ensure your users aren’t jumping through hoops to get secure access.

You may be thinking if the attacker has credentials and has phished MFA they can enroll a new device and gain access. With Banyan’s ZTNA solution new device enrollment can be blocked by rotating invite code or completely disabling the process and leveraging Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) to push out the Banyan app along with the intelligent certificate.

Banyan’s ZTNA granular policies also ensure that applications can only be accessed by devices with a known and specific identity and posture. Unknown and unauthorized devices are banned from attempting enrollment and access.

Banyan’s latest offering further enhances MFA

Banyan’s expansion into Security Service Edge (SSE) comes as customers are looking for innovative solutions to problems such as the domain squatting mentioned above. Banyan introduced DNS Threat Detection which provide acceptable use policy along with malicious domain protection. Moreover Banyan’s DNS Threat Detection blocks newly registered domains which are often set up using shady registrars anonymously and within hours or days of the attack.

Abstract:

“The design of modern industrial products is further improved through the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation. Realistic simulation is enabled by the closed loop between the hardware under test (HUT) and real-time simulation. Such a system involves a field programmable gate array (FPGA) and digital signal processor (DSP). An HIL model can bypass serious damage to the real object reduce debugging cost and finally reduce the comprehensive effort during the testing. This paper provides a historical overview of HIL simulations through different engineering challenges i.e. within automotive power electronics systems and different industrial drives. Various platforms such as National Instruments dSPACE Typhoon HIL or MATLAB Simulink Real-Time toolboxes and Speedgoat hardware systems offer a powerful tool for efficient and successful investigations in different fields. Therefore HIL simulation practice must begin already during the university’s education process to prepare the students for professional engagements in the industry which was also verified experimentally at the end of the paper.”

T-Mobile's winning bids totaled $304.3 million letting it obtain 7156 licenses out of 7872 that were sold the FCC announced yesterday.

T-Mobile's licenses are spread across 2724 counties (out of 3143 total in the US). The second-highest bidder in dollar terms was PTI Pacifica which spent $17.7 million on nine licenses in five counties. ""With most of the available spectrum in the 2.5 GHz band located in rural areas this auction provides vital spectrum resources to support wireless services in rural communities"" the FCC said.

The auction provided up to three blocks of spectrum totaling 117.5MHz in each county. In terms of the number of licenses won the second-place finisher was the North American Catholic Educational Programming Fund. Its winning bids totaled $7.8 million and cover 107 licenses in 84 counties.

There were 63 winning bidders overall and the auction raised $427.8 million. Small entities and rural service providers were given discounts on the license costs. The 2.5 GHz spectrum was originally set aside for educational institutions but has been repurposed for commercial service.

T-Mobile network already big on 2.5 GHz

Mid-band spectrum such as 2.5 GHz has been good for boosting capacity and speeds over relatively large areas. While low-band spectrum is best at covering long distances and penetrating obstacles there's more spectrum available in the middle and upper bands. At the highest extreme millimeter-wave spectrum provides the fastest speeds but has the smallest coverage areas.

T-Mobile already makes heavy use of 2.5 GHz spectrum in its 5G network. AT&T and Verizon use mid-band spectrum in the 3.7 GHz to 3.98 GHz range which they've deployed more slowly than planned because airlines haven't yet retrofitted or replaced all of the older airplane altimeters that can't filter out transmissions from outside their allotted frequencies.

The new 2.5 GHz licenses are ""flexible‐use geographic overlay licenses"" which means there are restrictions on use to protect carriers already operating in the spectrum. ""With overlay licenses licensees obtain the rights to geographic area licenses 'overlaid' on top of the existing incumbent licenses. As with an ordinary flexible-use license the overlay licensee may operate anywhere within its geographic area subject to protecting the licensed areas of incumbent licensees"" the FCC explains.

But that won't present a problem for T-Mobile. As FierceWireless wrote in March after the FCC set the auction rules the auction is ""for 'white spaces' of the 2.5 GHz band where no one owns the spectrum. T-Mobile is particularly interested in Auction 108 because it already owns or leases much of the 2.5 GHz spectrum across the United States and it wants to fill in the gaps in its coverage.""

T-Mobile to fix “Swiss cheese” network problem

2.5 GHz licenses were first distributed to educational institutions in the 1980s in ""35-mile-radius circles"" that ""left oddly shaped white spaces where no one owns the spectrum"" FierceWireless explained. T-Mobile already had leases with schools around the country to use the licenses.

""T-Mobile is likely to be the major winner as the auction will allow the company to fix the 'Swiss cheese' problem its 2.5 GHz network grid is known to suffer from"" New Street Research policy analyst Blair Levin wrote at the time.

Before the auction AT&T and Verizon requested more information on the lease agreements to help them decide whether to bid. The FCC denied the request saying that ""adoption of proponents' expanded disclosure requirement is beyond the bounds of the existing spectrum leasing rules and the Commission's prior determinations supporting those disclosure requirements.""

AT&T didn't buy any licenses in the auction. Verizon listed under its ""Cellco Partnership"" name in the auction results won 12 licenses in nine counties for $1.5 million.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRyb2lkLWxpZmUuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMDIvdC1tb2JpbGUtbm93LWxldHMteW91LXRlc3QtZHJpdmUtaXRzLW5ldHdvcmstZm9yLTMtbW9udGhzLWRpcmVjdGx5LWZyb20tYXBwL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRyb2lkLWxpZmUuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMDIvdC1tb2JpbGUtbm93LWxldHMteW91LXRlc3QtZHJpdmUtaXRzLW5ldHdvcmstZm9yLTMtbW9udGhzLWRpcmVjdGx5LWZyb20tYXBwL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Test Drive T-Mobile's Network Free for 3 Months,"T-Mobile is building in powerful features to its flagship Android application this week with two of the highlights being a new Network Pass and Easy Switch.

With Network Pass so long as you have a compatible smartphone T-Mobile is letting you test drive its network for three month before you make the switch from your current carrier. This is available to business customers too. Should all go well in your testing and should it make sense financially you can then use the same T-Mobile app to use Easy Switch which can have your account ported over and fired up in just minutes.

As for phone requirements to use Network Pass it’ll need to be an unlocked device that is eSIM compatible. If you have that you can take advantage.

This seems like the perfect thing for people who are always on the fence about their carrier usually because they aren’t exactly sure about coverage area between carriers. With this you can test all of your spots for up to 3 months. T-Mobile seems quite confident in itself these days which is nice.

Give it a go.

Microsoft’s plan to buy Santa Monica based video game giant Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion could have major effects on the gaming industry transforming the Xbox maker into something like a Netflix for video games by giving it control of many more popular titles.

But to get to the next level Microsoft must first survive a barrage of government inquiries from New Zealand to Brazil and from U.S. regulators emboldened by President Joe Biden to strengthen their enforcement of antitrust laws.

In the United Kingdom regulators on Thursday threatened to escalate their investigation unless both companies come up with proposals within five days to ease competition concerns. More than seven months after Microsoft announced the deal only Saudi Arabia has approved it.

“A growing number of countries are subjecting major global transactions to deeper scrutiny” said William Kovacic a former chairman of the five-member U.S. Federal Trade Commission. “Many of the jurisdictions that are exercising that scrutiny are significant economies and can’t be brushed off.”

Microsoft has faced antitrust scrutiny before mostly notably more than two decades ago when a federal judge ordered its breakup following the company’s anticompetitive actions related to its dominant Windows software. That verdict was overturned on appeal although the court imposed other less drastic penalties on the company.

In recent years however Microsoft has largely escaped the more intense regulatory backlash its Big Tech rivals such as Amazon Google and Facebook’s parent company Meta have endured. But the sheer size of the Activision Blizzard merger has drawn global attention.

The all-cash deal is set to be the largest in the history of the tech industry. It would give Microsoft maker of the Xbox console and gaming system control of popular game franchises such as Call of Duty World of Warcraft and Candy Crush. There’s also a growing sense that past review of Big Tech mergers was too lax — such as when Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.

“Collectively that means that the kinds of concessions you’re going to have to make become more difficult” Kovacic said.

The possibility of Microsoft gaining control of Call of Duty has been particularly worrisome to Sony maker of the PlayStation console that competes with Microsoft’s Xbox. In a letter to Brazilian regulators Sony emphasized Call of Duty as an “essential” game — a blockbuster so popular and ingrained that it would be impossible for a competitor to develop a rival product even if they had the budget to do so.

The U.K. watchdog’s preliminary inquiry raised similar worries. It said Microsoft’s control of popular Activision Blizzard games raised concerns that the deal would hurt rivals in multi-game subscription services and the cloud gaming market.

One solution could be a settlement in which Microsoft agrees to ensure that console-making rivals such as Sony or Nintendo won’t be cut off from popular Activision Blizzard games. Microsoft has already publicly signaled its openness to that concept.

Microsoft’s president Brad Smith has said the company committed to Sony to make Activision games like Call of Duty “available on PlayStation beyond the existing agreement and into the future” — although many are skeptical about how long those promises would last if not set into regulatory consent decrees.

On the other hand Microsoft also has a much better reputation in Washington than it did in 2000. It is “seen as more reasonable and sensible” on issues such as data privacy Kovacic said.

Microsoft has also been working to win over skeptics in the U.S. starting with a labor union that’s been trying to organize Activision Blizzard employees. Democratic lawmakers have also expressed concern about allegations of Activision’s toxic workplace culture for women which led to employee walkouts last year as well as discrimination lawsuits brought by California and federal civil rights enforcers.

In March the Communications Workers of America had issued a call seeking tougher oversight of the deal from the U.S. Department of Justice the FTC and state attorneys general. But a June 30 letter from the union to the FTC said it had switched to supporting the deal after Microsoft agreed “to ensure the workers of Activision Blizzard have a clear path to collective bargaining.”

Gaming represents a growing portion of Microsoft’s business despite the company’s efforts to portray itself and Activision Blizzard as “small players in a highly fragmented publishing space” per a document filed with New Zealand’s Commerce Commission.

In 2021 Microsoft spent $7.5 billion to acquire ZeniMax Media the parent company of video game publisher Bethesda Softworks which is behind popular video games The Elder Scrolls Doom and Fallout. Microsoft’s properties also include the hit game Minecraft after it bought Swedish game studio Mojang for $2.5 billion in 2014.

The Redmond Washington tech giant has said the gaming acquisitions will help beef up its Xbox Game Pass game subscription service and its mobile offerings particularly from Activision Blizzard’s King division which makes Candy Crush.

Dutch game developer Rami Ismail said Microsoft’s subscription-based service has thus far been a positive for smaller game studios trying to get their content to users. But he’s unsure about the long-term impact of the merger.

“Xbox Game Pass as a product has been really good in getting interesting creative games funded that might not have the normal market reach to be successful” Ismail said. “On the flip side as power consolidates there is less of an incentive to do anything like that.”

Microsoft rivals are also consolidating. Sony in July closed on a $3.6 billion deal to buy Bungie Inc. maker of the popular game franchise Destiny and the original developer of Xbox-owned Halo. Take-Two Interactive maker of Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption in May completed a $12.7 billion deal to acquire mobile gaming company Zynga maker of FarmVille and Words With Friends.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpYW50ZnJlYWtpbnJvYm90LmNvbS9nYW1lcy9tYWZpYS00LW9uLXRoZS13YXkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Mafia 4 On The Way?,"Haven't we waited long enough?

By Jason Collins |

Following the series of rumors about the game’s production and subsequent delays over the past few months Hangar 13 has finally confirmed that Mafia 4 is under development. In a developer interview for the original game’s 20th anniversary the development studio’s general manager Roman Hladik revealed the information about the upcoming installment in the franchise though it still remains to be seen whether the upcoming release will be titled Mafia 4.

According to IGN both Hladik and the game’s Head of Production and Media Director Tomaš Hrebiček took the time to reflect on the franchise’s fantastic journey over the past two decades before Hladik broke the news about the upcoming Mafia 4. Admittedly Hangar 13’s general manager said that the game is still a few years away and that he can’t share any more details at this point. He also expressed the general excitement behind the studio’s closed curtains regarding the new project and the continuation of one of the gaming world’s most prominent franchises.

While a hypothetical Mafia 4 has been rumored for quite some time now the franchise began with 2002’s Mafia game which was basically an open-world version of The Godfather. The game had an immersive narrative that spanned over three decades covering the 1930s-1960s era. It followed a fictional crime family in a virtual iteration of Chicago and it was received as a more realistic and more serious version of the massively popular Grand Theft Auto games. The PC version of the original game was a blast with scores in the upper-80th percentiles.

Screenshot from Mafia (2002)

Inspired by the success of 2002’s Mafia which by the time the second game was released had sold 2 million copies worldwide Take-Two Interactive released the sequel Mafia II in 2010. Hangar 13 took over the franchise’s development by making the Mafia III game which was released in 2016 to favorable reviews with critics praising the game’s narrative characters and darker themes compared to its predecessors. In 2020 Hangar 13 also produced a remake of the original game and released it as Mafia: Definitive Edition which also made a bang among the audiences.

And as much as we like to see timeless classics such as the original Mafia game getting their remakes and remasters to fit the modern gaming standards we’d also like to see the franchise continued. Hangar 13’s announcement regarding Mafia 4 is a welcomed one but with the details as scarce as they are the fandom is firing up the speculation furnaces and spewing out theories about the upcoming game and its setting.

Considering that the previous narratives were set in past eras between the 1930s and 1970s it’s safe to assume that the upcoming Mafia 4 will follow the same recipes. Still some enthusiasts would also like to see the game set in an ‘80s Scarface settings — which had its own game canceled — while others think that it would distance the narrative from the franchise’s core. Whatever the case may be Hladik clearly stated that we wouldn’t see Mafia 4 for some time so we can only speculate that the game will release in late 2023 or even sometime during 2024.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVyZWFjdG9yLmV1L2EtcGxhZ3VlLXRhbGUtcmVxdWllbS13ZS1nb3QtdG8tcGxheS1hbi1lbnRpcmUtY2hhcHRlci1vZi1hc29ib3Mtc2VxdWVsLWF0LWdhbWVzY29tLTExODczNTMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Plague Tale: Requiem: We got to play an entire chapter of Asobo's sequel at Gamescom,"HQ

There's no denying that this year's Gamescom lacked some serious heavy hitters. With Activision Take-Two Interactive Sony Nintendo and so on all deciding to skip the major convention. But just because these companies weren't in attendance doesn't mean there was a lack of incredibly exciting games that made appearances - with one of those very names being A Plague Tale: Requiem.

HQ

I must confess I wasn't much a huge fan of this series until a few months back when I finally got around to playing A Plague Tale: Innocence which needless to say left me incredibly excited and hopeful for Requiem. That's probably why going into the preview session - where Asobo Studio allowed me to play the entirety of the game's sixth chapter - disappointment wasn't really an option. While I will say this game plays a little differently from the first (mostly for the better might I add) it absolutely didn't let me down. But let me further dive into why.

First of all as you'd expect from a game that is being created for PC and current-gen consoles only and forsaking PS4 and Xbox One unlike its predecessor there are a lot of technological improvements that truly elevate A Plague Tale: Requiem. From larger levels that make life all the more challenging for Amicia and Hugo to navigate as enemies are more challenging to sneak past to better lighting resolution and all the tricks and doodads that make a game look visually striking. The technological improvements are instantly noticeable be it in the facial animations or when wandering through a lush lilac field of lavender it's a significant step-up in quality that is best described in a comparison unique to A Plague Tale - rats.

This is an ad:

Following my play session I caught up with game director Kevin Choteau as part of an interview that is now live on Gamereactor (see it above). It was here that Choteau told me that the better tech at Requiem's core allows the game to render up to 300000 rats at once up from the max of 5000 that still made Innocence's vile rodent hordes seem unspeakably large. Needless to say there will be plenty of rats again. More than you could ever perceive.

But back to the gameplay and how that has changed in this sequel. As we've been told frequently beforehand in trailers and gameplay videos Amicia and Hugo are a bit older in this game. Not much older might I add but just that little bit older that you can see the weight of the decisions the pair have had to make are pressing on them and changing them. Amicia is no longer a passive protector an individual who sneaks and flees to evade danger. No now she carries a crossbow that allows her to take the fight to her enemies. The ammo economy does mean that Amicia won't be able to gun down any foe that steps in her path but she can cut down enemies with greater ease - something we begin to learn is the reason why the sibling duo are in another sticky and awful situation. Amicia also has some fancy new tools at her disposal be it tar that causes flames to enlarge and the crafting system has been streamlined a tad so it's easy to see which weapons Amicia is using and what ammo is currently loaded up.

Hugo also has some new rat-related powers abilities that allow him to control hordes and guide them to attack enemies with direct precision or even get a gauge on where enemies are wandering around (think rat-powered sonar). It all makes for new ways to tackle each level which as I mentioned earlier are larger and will require more patience and planning to get through without being spotted and overwhelmed by the many enemies.

This is an ad:

And generally speaking this was the theme of the gameplay demo. A Plague Tale: Requiem is bigger prettier more detailed and clearly produced to a much higher budget. There's never any doubt of that. This game is set to be one of the top games of the entire year and if the rest of the story holds up to the quality that this singular chapter exudes then it looks like Asobo might just have a Game of the Year contender on its hands.

Then he saw the area code and curiosity got the better of him.

""I was in my office (in Florida) and the phone rang and it was May 5"" said Howard arguably the best defensive end in Kansas State football history. ""It's Kansas. And normally if your name is not in my phone if my phone rings and your name doesn't pop up I'm not answering. This day and age too much spam. Everybody's trying to sell you something.""

But he looked at the area code again.

""So 785 OK. That's Kansas. Might be important"" he remembers thinking to himself. ""I pick it up and it's coach (Bill) Snyder. And for me not hearing his voice from 2000 until now it was exactly the same.

""The exact same reaction. I thought I was in trouble (and) I had to go to his office. I didn't know what I did and I was going through my mind 'What did I do?' And then I remembered I was 45 years old and I was like 'I can chill out.'

Old habits die hard but in fact Snyder was calling to congratulate Howard and welcome him to K-State football's Ring of Honor. Snyder did the same for four other former players whose names were to go on permanent display inside Bill Snyder Family Stadium during Saturday's 6 p.m. season opener against South Dakota.

""He just told me that he's happy to accept me in the Ring of Honor and I was honored and shocked"" said Howard K-State's all-time sacks leader with 29.5 from 1996-99. ""It was maybe noon or 1 o'clock and I just went home.

""I couldn't work anymore. It was great. I was over the moon. I never foresaw it coming so it's a really great honor and hopefully all the other guys see it the same way.""

The other former Snyder players are linebacker Arthur Brown (2011-12) quarterback Collin Klein (2009-12) wide receiver Tyler Lockett (2011-14) and quarterback Ell Roberson (2000-03). They are joined by running back Larry Brown (1967-68) who went on to NFL stardom with Washington.

Howard may have been shocked by the news but few others were. Not only was he a member of one of K-State's all-time great teams in 1998 but followed that up in 1999 with third-team All-America honors from the Associated Press and the defensive most valuable player award in a 24-20 Holiday Bowl victory over Washington.

In addition to the career sacks record he left K-State ranked second in tackles for loss with 54 and forced fumbles with nine. He also had two interceptions.

After K-State Howard was drafted in the second round by the New Orleans Saints and played 10 seasons in the NFL — six in New Orleans and four with the Philadelphia Eagles.

While he had not been back in Manhattan since 2000 Howard still keeps up with the Wildcats. He said he sees a bit of himself in current end Nate Matlack and is equally impressed with Felix Anudike-Uzomah.

Friday's news conference with the inductees took place in the new Shamrock Zone that connects the football stadium and Bramlage Coliseum. All of that and a number of other stadium amenities sprung up since Howard left.

The new indoor football facility is currently under construction on the east side of the stadium while south of the west-side parking lot a volleyball arena and Olympic training center are even further along.

""I haven't been around yet so I have a lot more to see"" said Howard who currently is involved in real estate in his native Florida. ""It's amazing. And to think in some miniscule way I had a little bit to do with it it's great man. I love it.""

He also was looking forward to his first K-State game since the 1999 Holiday Bowl.

""I think it's going to be electric"" Howard said. ""I haven't been in a college atmosphere like this since I left here.

""I think my kids are going to have a good time. My wife and my kids are all post-career this is like the first opportunity they can be enveloped in that world what Dad was doing 22 years ago.""

Calling Ell Roberson and Arthur Brown

Much like Howard Roberson and Arthur Brown were surprised when they got the Ring of Honor news from Snyder.

""I was actually in a meeting at the time and he called me twice"" said Roberson who lives in the Houston area and is a corporate compliance trainer with Targa Resources an oil and gas company. ""It was like 'What does he want what does he want? He never calls me twice.'

""So I pick up the phone kind of in the back and he told me and I hollered with joy. I didn't realize I was still in the meeting. Everybody turned back and looked at me and I was like 'Sorry.'""

Roberson was the Wildcats' quarterback when they stunned No. 1-ranked Oklahoma 35-7 in the 2003 Big 12 championship game which many consider the biggest victory in school history.

Brown one of the all-time great high school players in Wichita transferred to K-State in 2011 after two years at Miami and in 2012 teamed with Klein and Lockett to help the Wildcats win their second Big 12 title. He was not as easy for Snyder to reach.

""Kenny (Lannou executive associate athletics director for communications) reached out to me and he connected me with coach Snyder"" Brown recalled. ""(Snyder) was the one that made it known that I had been inducted to the ring of honor.

""They had been trying to reach me for a while. Once he finally got ahold of me he said 'It's easier to get hold of the president.' He just thanked me for all that I had contributed to the team and my character and likewise I thanked him.""

Sign up for our newsletters to stay up to date on the stories that matter.

A proposal to build a public high school in Chicago’s South Loop neighborhood isn’t a done deal but the land swap that it involves isn’t a new method.

The Chicago Housing Authority board voted last month to submit an application to the federal housing department to lease land at 24th and State Street — part of where the former Harold Ickes Homes existed. In exchange CHA would get two additional parcels of land a few blocks away for the ongoing redeveloped mixed-income Southbridge where the South Loop meets the South Side.

For more than a decade CHA has transferred land on former public housing sites for a CVS pharmacy Mariano’s Target and XS Tennis. Earlier this year CHA approved a measure that starts the process for the Chicago Fire men’s soccer team to build a training facility with a youth component on 25 acres of vacant land at the former ABLA Homes on West Side.

These amenities are on the footprint of new mixed-income housing developments part of the ambitious Plan for Transformation that promised to change the scope of public housing from one of racial and economic segregation. But 23 years later residents who were promised to come back are still waiting for housing to be built at many sites as construction has lagged. Vacant land remains on the State Street corridor in particular. CHA for its part has determined that housing alone won’t create thriving communities especially at locations that weathered decades of disinvestment. Jobs and economic vitality are at stake officials say and the number of promised units isn’t diminished with the land deals.

But residents feel a record of broken promises and want to return to places they once called home.

“I don’t have a problem with them building any entities where you bring in money into the communities. But I do have a problem with them not building the return units of CHA. They continue to sell CHA land but they’re not building the housing” said Etta Davis a tenant leader with the Dearborn Homes.

For example CHA promised 1000 public housing units at the former Ida B. Wells Homes. Through September 2016 there were 277 units that had been developed. In 2022 another 20 are supposed to be built.

“CHA starts everything but they never finish; they are hurting us” said Beverly Feagins a former Ickes resident who now lives in the Dearborn Homes.

Meanwhile CHA CEO Tracey Scott said concentrated poverty and concentrated public housing has not worked.

“And so given that the vision around mixed-income housing mixed-use developments is to create the stronger community that supports residents’ growth supports children and their education and supports their health and wellness” Scott said.

According to public records here are details on some notable CHA land deals:

In 2011 the board approved a land transfer agreement with the Target Corporation near the former William Green Homes at the northwest corner of Division and Larrabee streets. The exchange involved three to five acres of equal land value ( and the land CHA received has remained undeveloped. ) During the term of the proposed hiring agreement Target extended 75 job offers to CHA residents.

In 2014 the board approved a purchase and sales agreement with XS Tennis on vacant Robert Taylor Homes land at 53rd and State Street. XS Tennis offered to pay CHA $2 million and to provide commensurate benefits to CHA residents in the form of scholarships and jobs equivalent to $2.6 million over a 10-year period for a total value of $4.6 million. As of December 2021 20 CHA residents were recruited and hired for construction positions; 355 CHA residents received XS Tennis scholarships; 355 CHA residents received academic tutoring from XS Tennis; CHA residents received 31950 hours of tutoring from XS Tennis; 160 CHA residents attended summer camp and eight jobs were offered to CHA residents.

In 2015 CHA entered into an agreement with Pershing King Drive LLC which helped develop a Mariano’s on the site of the former Ida B. Wells development. As part of the agreement the developer was to set aside 40% of construction contracts to women- and/or minority-owned businesses. Mariano’s hired 97 CHA residents. Mariano’s paid CHA $5.44 million for the land.

In this 2015 file photo Bronzeville residents rallied outside the site where a Mariano’s grocery store would be built at 39th Street and Martin Luther King Drive in Chicago. They were protesting the transfer of public housing land to Mariano’s instead of using it for low-income housing. Al Podgorski / Chicago Sun-Times

All of those land deals preceded Scott. But the Chicago Fire deal will be finalized on her watch. Negotiations are still underway that she said it will provide recreational and job opportunities for CHA families.

“It also provides our children ways that they can grow and [consider] career opportunities. The Fire is committed to also providing directly those career opportunities in terms of internships and jobs both during construction and after construction” Scott said.

As those conditions are negotiated Scott says this is a chance for residents to voice their concerns and shape what front- and back-office jobs can be had with the soccer team.

In 2009 CHA started making small decisions to sell or transfer land to commercial entities and in 2013 CHA continued to dispose of public land. Amy Khare has been documenting. She is research director of the National Initiative on Mixed-Income Communities at Case Western Reserve University and studies land deals in Chicago.

“Some of that land has been used for really interesting and one could argue very positive contributions to the neighborhood — all of which are amenities that leaders within communities of color have long demanded” Khare said.

At the same time she points out thousands of people are waiting for housing.

“So it’s a real dilemma when we see a public agency whose mission is to deliver affordable housing making decisions to again transfer land out of public control and placing it into the private market” Khare said.

Khare said her issue isn’t with what’s being created but how.

Her critique of the Target deal near Cabrini is that the swapped land included parcels spread throughout the Near North Side. “And therefore difficult to build housing on because it was land that couldn’t be for a large multi-unit development but rather smaller parcels where only single-family homes or other types of dwellings could be built. Why would the agency make a decision to move a large parcel out of possession and in an exchange take land that they may or may not be able to build upon?” Khare said.

And even though the proposed CPS neighborhood high school isn’t a done deal residents say they will continue to organize and demand their concerns — particularly their call for the construction of public housing units — be taken seriously.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: People are always trying to find ways to save time whether it's getting their groceries delivered or having a robot vacuum their floors. Well get this. There is a new machine out there from robotics company Clockwork that slashes the time it takes to get your nails done by more than just half. We had to check it out. So let's take a look.

Getting your nails done takes a lot of time. Get this. The average person spends 3120 minutes a year on their nails. But robotics company Clockwork has got a solution for you. They say they will have you out the door in just 10 minutes with their robot manicure machine with a goal to revolutionize the $6 and 1/2 billion nail industry.

Now these robots are in select locations across the country including six Target stores giving customers there the option to sign up for $10 manicures. And it could be a big win for Target too. Focusing on the customer experience is what's going to separate the winners and the losers. It's the future of retail.

GERALD STORCH: The more fun that's added to store environment the better it is. And so I applaud Target for doing it.

SEANA SMITH: And Clockwork co-founder and CEO Renuka Apte says that we are still in the early stages. Requests for this machine are coming from countries all over the world.

RENUKA APTE: Most of the contracts we are signing today are actually for 2023 because we're backed up that much with the demand that we've got. Pushing tens of thousands of partnership requests at this point.

SEANA SMITH: So with all the buzz around these machines we had to check it out for ourselves. We went to the iconic 30 Rockefeller Plaza where real estate giant Tishman Speyer leases a robot as an amenity in the building. We had a little fun with it making those very tough decisions like picking out a color. Let's go with red and play it safe. One hand down one to go. So what's our verdict? Wow. It looks good. I'm not a nail expert but this thing works well.

I mean not a nail expert Rachelle but I was just blown away by the fact it only took 10 minutes. And it looked really really really good.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: They looked really great. When you think of the amount of time you can spend when you go to a nail shop this is fantastic. I love the fact that it's quick. I love to get my nails done. They always stay done. So I would definitely do this. I love it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53b3JsZGNlbWVudC5jb20vdGhlLWFtZXJpY2FzLzAyMDkyMDIyL3RlcnJhLWNvMi10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWFubm91bmNlcy1yZXN1bHRzLW9mLXRoZWlyLXBhcnRpY2lwYXRpb24taW4tdGhlLW1pbm5lc290YS1yb2FkLXJlc2VhcmNoLWZhY2lsaXR5LXByb2plY3Qv0gGkAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvcmxkY2VtZW50LmNvbS90aGUtYW1lcmljYXMvMDIwOTIwMjIvdGVycmEtY28yLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktYW5ub3VuY2VzLXJlc3VsdHMtb2YtdGhlaXItcGFydGljaXBhdGlvbi1pbi10aGUtbWlubmVzb3RhLXJvYWQtcmVzZWFyY2gtZmFjaWxpdHktcHJvamVjdC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Terra CO2 Technology announces results of their participation in the Minnesota Road Research Facility Project,"Terra CO 2 Technology the scalable low carbon alternative for cement production announced today the preliminary results of their OPUS supplementary cementitious material used in the Minnesota Road Research Facility (MnROAD) on Interstate 94. For the project Terra delivered 20 t of their proprietary OPUS SCM (Supplementary Cementitious Material). Terra's materials were used without the need for adaptations or new investments proving OPUS's sustainable approach is ready to be used with the current infrastructure.

Terra's innovative material science technology makes low-carbon concrete possible by creating cementitious materials from a wide variety of abundant local feedstocks and even waste products dramatically reducing cement's GHG emissions. Terra’s proprietary manufactured SCM solution produces 70% lower CO 2 emissions and 90% lower NOx emissions than the Portland cement it replaces.

“There are thousands of miles of road within the public network of the United States alone all of which require cement to create” said Bill Yearsley CEO of Terra CO 2 . “With cement production as one of the largest contributors to carbon emissions globally it’s urgent that we switch to a low carbon alternative and the Minnesota highway is an important catalyst for making the switch.”

“The ongoing test at the MnROAD test facility operated by the Minnesota Department of Transportation and supported by the National Road Research Alliance (NRRA) focuses on materials that will enable sustainable construction. For mixture design the project had a performance target rather than a prescribed concrete mixture allowing the additive suppliers to push the boundaries of cement substitution"" said Larry Sutter from Sutter Engineering LLC who manages the technical aspects of this project which includes testing constructability and performance evaluation of concrete mixtures. ""Terra’s OPUS SCM was utilised at the highest substitution level of all the products tested as an SCM in the project and met the target flexural strength.""

Terra's concrete mixture had the highest substitution of Portland cement at 35%. Documented by both MnDOT and an independent lab concrete made with Terra’s Opus SCM achieved project specification flexural and compressive strength easily about half the usual time making a strong case that higher substitution levels are possible above 35%.

“Braun Intertec Corporation is excited to partner with Terra CO 2 on the MnROAD Research project to help develop concrete with lower CO 2 footprints” said Alfred Gardiner Braun Intertec’s Director of Concrete Consulting. “With the ongoing shortage of fly ash in North America the possibility of manufacturing fly ash from aggregate mining products and waste will help the concrete industry produce sustainable durable concrete which will provide long term infrastructure for our nation. The material performed very well throughout qualification testing and in the construction phase.

Terra CO 2 recently announced a US$46 million Series A bringing the company’s total funding to US$61 million.

A class action lawsuit has been filed against Tesla over unexpected and random braking often called “phantom braking” in its vehicles which is an issue the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is currently investigating.

Plaintiff Jose Alvaraz Toledo the owner of a 2021 Tesla Model 3 filed the suit on Aug. 26 alleging that Tesla is rushing advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) features to market “when the technology is not yet ready and not yet safe.”

Alvaraz Toledo contends that he bought his Tesla because of the OEM’s “marketed dependability and safety” of its vehicles and wasn’t told about a defect with the Autopilot and Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) features.

“Plaintiff Alvarez Toledo has experienced the Sudden Unintended Braking Defect on several occasions since he started driving his Class Vehicle. Specifically Plaintiff Alvarez Toledo has twice been operating his Class Vehicle under intended and foreseeable circumstances using the autopilot system when his vehicle suddenly engaged the brakes and reduced his speed by about half.”

According to the complaint NHTSA “has fielded hundreds of individual complaints in the last three years from drivers of Tesla vehicles” over unexpected slow-downs and stops. Repairer Driven News previously reported that the investigation began after NHTSA received 758 reports of unexpected brake application in certain 2021-2022 Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles.

The suit alleges that Tesla has known about the existence of the braking defect because of pre-production testing consumer complaints warranty data dealership repair orders and NHTSA investigations. Tesla which no longer has a media relations department did not respond to RDN’s questions by the publication deadline.

The lawsuit class includes all individuals or entities in the U.S. that purchased have leased – whether current or past own or owned a Tesla vehicle that has experienced unintended braking. A subclass of Californians is also represented in the suit under the same qualifications as the U.S. class. The vehicles includes are primarily 2021-2022 Model 3s and Model Ys but aren’t necessarily limited to those according to the complaint.

The plaintiff claims Tesla has:

“knowingly falsely concealed suppressed and/or omitted” the defect in information about its vehicles; breached its express warranty; breached its implied warranty of merchantability; breached its implied warranty under the Song-Beverly Act; violated the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act which “provides a cause of action for any consumer who is damaged by the failure of a warrantor to comply with a written or implied warranty;” violated California’s Consumer Legal Remedies Act by stating the vehicles “had characteristics and benefits that they do not have represented that the Class Vehicles were of a particular standard quality or grade when they were of another and advertised the Class Vehicles with the intent not to sell them as advertised;” violated California’s unfair competition law; and has unjustly profited from the sale and lease of its vehicles.



The warranty breaches detailed in the suit are a result of Tesla allegedly refusing to repair or replace its vehicles with the defect “despite the fact that the Class Vehicles are under a comprehensive warranty… Defendant promised to repair or replace defective components arising out of defects in materials and/or workmanship such as the Defect at no cost to owners or lessors of the Class Vehicles.”

“As a direct result of Tesla’s wrongful conduct Plaintiff and the other members of the Class have suffered damages including inter alia: (1) out-of-pocket expenses for repair of the Defect; (2) costs for future repairs or replacements; (3) sale of their vehicles at a loss; (4) diminished value of their vehicles; and/or (5) the price premium attributable to the Autopilot feature.”

Tesla states on its website that “Autopilot enables your car to steer accelerate and brake automatically within its lane. Current Autopilot features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.”

However the suit alleges that the defect “causes the Class Vehicles to detect non-existent obstacles triggering a braking response and causing the Class Vehicles to abruptly decelerate or stop completely despite no need for this action.”

“The Defect presents a safety hazard that distracts the Class members and renders the Class Vehicles unreasonably dangerous to consumers because it severely impacts a driver’s ability to control vehicle speed as expected under normal driving conditions and maintain an appropriate speed based on traffic flow thereby increasing the risk of a rear-end collision.”

It’s also noted in the complaint that Tesla’s owner’s manuals hint at the risk of false activations of AEB but only in small text. “Several factors can affect the performance of Automatic Emergency Braking causing either no braking or inappropriate or untimely braking such as when a vehicle is partially in the path of travel or there is road debris” a Model Y manual states. “It is the driver’s responsibility to drive safely and remain in control of the vehicle at all times. Never depend on Automatic Emergency Braking to avoid or reduce the impact of a collision.”

In May 2021 Tesla chief executive Elon Musk said planned modifications to the automated driving system would address “phantom braking” which some Tesla drivers have long complained about according to Reuters.

In NHTSA’s initial round of data and reports collected through its 2021 Standing General Order (SGO) 273 crashes involved a Tesla out of the 392 Level 2 ADAS-equipped vehicles that were involved in reported crashes.

The complaint states that after the death of a Tesla driver in 2016 which was reportedly the result of neither he nor Autopilot detecting a truck crossing the highway ahead of him the automaker posted on its blog that the “accident” was a “statistical inevitability.”

Tesla stated that at the time of the accident and when it reported the death to NHTSA “That given its nature as a driver assistance system a collision on Autopilot was a statistical inevitability though by this point not one that would alter the conclusion already borne out over millions of miles that the system provided a net safety benefit to society.”

A jury trial is demanded. The suit also seeks an order awarding statutory compensatory treble and punitive damages; injunctive relief enjoining the “illegal acts” and allegations made an order of restitution and all other forms of equitable monetary relief.

Tesla has also been accused of falsely advertising its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) features in California which led to the passage of legislation in the state on Tuesday to “prohibit a manufacturer or dealer from deceptively naming or marketing” ADAS features including collision avoidance systems or partial driving automation feature. If signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom the new law would also require dealers or manufacturers “to provide the buyer or owner with a consumer notice that describes the functions and limitations of those features.”

It can now output up to 50 MW.

Tesla Virtual Power Plant

We have seen Tesla putting a lot of effort into virtual power plants lately.

A virtual power plant (VPP) consists of distributed energy storage systems – like Tesla Powerwalls – used in concert to provide grid services and avoid the use of polluting and expensive peaker power plants.

Last year Tesla launched a VPP pilot program in California where Powerwall owners would join voluntarily without compensation to let the VPP pull power from their battery packs when the grid needed it. It helped Tesla prove the usefulness of such a system.

Following the pilot program Tesla and PG&E (the electric utility covering Northern California) launched the first official virtual power plant through the Tesla app in June.

This new version of the Virtual Power Plant actually compensates Powerwall owners $2 per kWh that they contribute to the grid during emergency load reduction events. Homeowners are expected to get between $10 and $60 per event.

Last month we reported that Tesla’s California VPP expanded to Southern California Edison (SCE) to now cover most of the state. Shortly after the VPP had its first event and it was extremely successful.

Tesla VPP reaches 50 MW

During the last two weeks since the first event Tesla’s virtual power plant in California has grown significantly.

Last Bulb is tracking the growth of the network and noted that it just reached 3500 homes and a capacity of 50 MW:

Between PG&E and SCE it looks like over 400 Powerwalls are being added to the network per week.

The VPP also had its second event this week and it was outputting a record 20 MW on the PG&E network:

Many Tesla Powerwall owners participating in the event are reporting being credited between $30 and $40 for the short event.

The electric utility needed the capacity amid a heat wave and increased demand for electricity and the VPP replaced the use of a peaker plant which is more costly and more polluting.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd4eXouY29tL25ld3MvcmVnaW9uL29ha2xhbmQtY291bnR5L3dlc3QtYmxvb21maWVsZC10b3duc2hpcC1yZXZpZXdzLXByb3Bvc2FsLWZvci10ZXNsYS1nYWxsZXJ50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,West Bloomfield Township reviews proposal for Tesla gallery,"WEST BLOOMFIELD TOWNSHIP Mich. (WXYZ) — Carmaker Tesla is setting its sights on a new gallery in the heart of West Bloomfield. The current property has been vacant for years since bookshop Barnes & Noble closed its doors on Orchard Lake Rd. near 15 Mile Rd.

“I think it would be a good idea. Utilize the space and bring more economy or jobs to the location” says Robert Gardner who visited nearby today.

Curis Enterprises the company working to buy the property has declined comment. However at a recent planning commission public meeting they asked for an exemption to allow vehicle storage behind the old book shop shielded by landscaping decorative fencing & brick pillars.

They also told the township Tesla has an interest in renting the 46000 square-foot space and since they have no official dealers in our state the cars and SUVs kept there would be those sold online.

“It doesn’t bother me what they put there I’d rather see something there than a vacant building.” says neighbor Marci Zeman.

Pastor Danny Faulk has lived in West Bloomfield for 25 years and says he doesn’t see a need to add another shop next to Ferrari in what’s slated to become a downtown center.

“I don’t want it to be like Farmington Hills I would like it more subtle and understand the need for progress” says Faulk.

Curis Enterprises also told the commission Tesla would bring people from all over to the area support local business and eco-friendly electric vehicles. A shop could also provide maintenance without engine smell or noisy work.

“The planning commission when it had its conceptual work session with them was excited about the use of a Tesla facility within the township but the issue is storage of vehicles for when they make delivery several times a year and how it’ll be handled” says Planning Director Amy Neary.

Public hearing would take place before a final decision. So far Tesla hasn’t replied to our request for comment.

“As you know we are dealing with global warming so it would be good to have more Teslas on the road so bring it on” says Gardner.

A next step is another planning commission meeting on September 13th. We’ll be tracking what happens to bring you the latest developments.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdGF0ZXNsYWFwcC5jb20vc29mdHdhcmUtdXBkYXRlcy92ZXJzaW9uLzIwMjIuMjQuOC9yZWxlYXNlLW5vdGVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022.24.8 Official Tesla Release Notes - Software Updates,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.notateslaapp.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /software-updates/version/2022.24.8/release-notes (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001671101DB40>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdGF0ZXNsYWFwcC5jb20vc29mdHdhcmUtdXBkYXRlcy92ZXJzaW9uLzIwMjIuMjQuOC9yZWxlYXNlLW5vdGVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Faster better same cable

The USB Promoter Group which manages the standard hasn’t yet published the technical specification for the standard but it has revealed some interesting details. The group includes Apple Hewlett-Packard Intel Microsoft Renesas Electronics Corporation STMicroelectronics and Texas Instruments.

“Once again following USB tradition this updated USB4 specification doubles data performance to deliver higher levels of functionality to the USB Type-C ecosystem” said Brad Saunders USB Promoter Group Chairman. “Solutions seeing the most benefit from this speed enhancement include higher-performance displays storage and USB-based hubs and docks.”

Here’s some highlights:

USB 4 version 2.0 will use the USB-C connector.

It will support speeds up to 80Gbps.

It will do so using existing40 Gbps USB Type-C passive cables and newly defined 80 Gbps USB Type-C active cables”

What this means is that if you buy a 40Gbps USB 4 cable today you’ll be able to keep using it and it will work twice as fast. This suggests much faster interconnects between devices and accessories and has positive implications for mobile devices on a broader basis.

eWaste savvy backwards compatible too

It also echoes the times we are in as understanding of the role accessories play in eWaste and climate change continues to grow. EU directives around use of a single type of cable are serious as is the challenge those directives try to solve. How many billion old cables does the world need to put in landfill before it recognizes there may be a problem?





The USB 4 version 2.0 specification should also include updates that provide better speeds when you’re using USB 3.2 along with improved support for DisplayPort and PCIe.

Higher speed backward compatibility the ability to gain these enhancements using the same cable and better support for DisplayPort and PCIe should all be reason enough to begin using the new I/O. The only challenge is when it will be made available.

Given developers are only now beginning to kick the new standard around that could be late next year or later on previous form. Though it will be something Apple can begin introducing in its pro Mac range soon after the tech is approved.

While it might seem a bit strange for a camera company to build a projector UST models require precise optics to create a square image while beaming straight up — and that's right up Leica's alley.

The company said it's using its Summicron lens tech with aspherical elements ""manufactured in accordance with Leica standards. It also uses a triple-RGB laser with a 25000 hour service life (built in collaboration with HiSense according to The Verge) and a Texas Instruments DLP chip.

Leica has two versions of the Cine 1 designed for 80-inch and 100-inch screens with the former positioned about six inches from the wall and the latter about 12 inches. Leica recommends setting them at exactly those positions and using the suggested screen sizes as the optics were designed for that. To that end it's also selling 80- and 100-inch ambient light-rejecting (ALR) screens. They output 2100 and 2500 lumens for the 80- and 100-inch models respectively.

On the audio side it offers built-in Dolby Atmos-powered speakers for surround sound. It comes with a TV tuner for for linear TV and HiSense's VIDAA OS as a smart TV platform. You can also install external storage Blu-ray players or consoles via the HDMI and USB inputs.

Other key specs are still missing like color space coverage and HDR support. However they're reportedly priced at $6900 for the 80-inch and $7900 for the 100-inch model so you'd expect all the bells and whistles possible. Currently the most advanced UST projectors out there are Samsung's LSP7T 4K with HDR10+ starting at $3500 the $3000 Formovie Theater with Dolby Vision and HiSense's L9G 3000-lumen Laser TV projectors with Dolby Vision priced at $5000 with a 100-inch ALR screen.

But today the company uncovered its first ultra-short-throw (UST) projector namely the Cine 1. The latter is capable of projecting up to a 100-inch image when placed at six inches far from the wall. However you shouldn’t be surprised knowing that this firm designs UST projectors because such products require precise optics to create a square image. So this is the right niche for Leica.

According to the official introduction the Leica Cine 1 uses in-house developed Summicron lens tech with aspherical elements. Other than that the product comes with a triple-RGB laser with a 25000-hour lifespan. By the way HiSense helped Leica to design this product. Inside it hosts a Texas Instruments DLP chip.

Leica Cine 1 Specs

There are two variants of the Leica Cine 1. One supports up to 80 inches of projection while the higher-end variant supports 100-inch screens. For the former you have to place the projector six inches far from the wall while the latter should be 12 inches far from the projection area. Also these projectors output 2100 and 2500 lumens of brightness respectively.

These are high-end projectors. So it’s logical they will come with good audio performance. for instance the Leica Cine 1 has built-in Dolby Atmos-powered speakers for surround sound. There is also a TV tuner for linear TV and they run HiSense’s VIDAA OS. You can expand the storage or plug Blu-ray players and consoles via the HDMI and USB ports. Lastly it has HDR support.

In terms of availability the projector’s 80-inch variant costs $6900 whereas the 100-inch model comes at $7900. Simply put you have to sell your kidney to buy one of them (haha). As a reference the most advanced UST projectors coming with similar features are the Samsung LSP7T 4K with HDR10+ starting at $3500 the Formovie Theater with Dolby Vision at $3000 and the HiSense L9G 3000-lumen Laser TV with Dolby Vision at $5000. Thus the first attempt of Leica is not much attractive at least in terms of price.

The US Army Operational Test Command (OTC) has announced the completion of XM204 Top Attack Munition testing at Fort Hood Texas.

The operational assessment of the new explosive was carried out by troops from the 59th Combat Engineer Company-Armored (CEC-A) 36th Engineer Brigade reported captain Bradden Van Noy.

According to US Army OTC Operations Research Systems analyst Mitch Hackman the XM204 is a hand-emplaced explosive that launches a top attack submunition into the air.

The submunition tracks and identifies enemy vehicles and then fires a projectile capable of destroying vehicles in the blast area.

As part of the six-day assessment soldiers engaged in various missions both in daytime and nighttime conditions.

To create an operationally realistic enemy they placed over 20 obstacles of various types in position including traditional wire obstacles and mine fields.

The troops then tested the XM204’s capability to destroy an enemy or change their route.

59th CEC-A company commander captain Abraham Orozco said the operational assessment of the XM204 enabled the troops to learn about a new capability.

Orozco said: “The XM204 Operational Assessment provided a great opportunity for the organisation to continue to refine our critical mission essential tasks while enhancing our soldiers’ lethality and providing feedback in support of Army modernisation priorities.”

The test data and feedback by soldiers will allow senior Army leaders to make informed decisions regarding equipment production.

OTC Maneuver Support and Sustainment Test Directorate NCOIC and combat engineer master sergeant Jonathan Stevenson said: “The XM204 provides combat engineers with a semi-flexible smart munition that can be utilised to shape the battlefield and will ultimately enhance the ability of our soldiers to destroy the enemy.”

“We’re confident” Carl Coffman Bell’s vice president for military sales and strategy said in an interview. “We’re not cocky. We’re confident.”

Bell supplies aircraft to U.S. military and private sector customers and has been building new facilities across North Texas including a 140000-square-foot Manufacturing Technology Center in Fort Worth.

The Army is poised to announce in coming months the winner of the long-running assault aircraft competition between Bell which is owned by Textron and a collaboration between Boeing and Connecticut-based helicopter manufacturer Sikorsky which is owned by Lockheed Martin.

The companies also are vying to win a separate assignment to produce the Army’s new attack reconnaissance helicopter. At stake in the high-profile competitions: the billions of dollars and thousands of jobs involved in producing a generation of Army aircraft.

Bell officials said securing either deal would likely result in hundreds of additional jobs in the Fort Worth Amarillo and Arlington areas as well as other parts of the country although they said it would be inappropriate to speculate on specific numbers.

Bell currently employs more than 4500 workers in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.

Latest in manufacturing

Bell has proposed the tilt-rotor V-280 Valor as the Army’s next long-range assault aircraft and the Bell 360 Invictus as the service’s future attack reconnaissance aircraft. If it wins either the company plans to perfect production at its Manufacturing Technology Center.

Glenn Isbell the company’s vice president of rapid prototyping and manufacturing innovation described the center as a “test kitchen” where Bell can craft “recipes” for manufacturing different components of those aircraft and others in the future.

The center is intended to make dramatic advances in cutting-edge manufacturing techniques rather than incremental improvements.

“This particular facility is really a place where we can enable and try to change the way we manufacture our hardest-to-build parts” Isbell said.

The first aircraft would come from the center as the company fine-tunes the process before moving large-scale production to other locations. Bell could build entirely new facilities or expand its existing plants to churn out the large number of aircraft the Army is expected to order.

Coffman said producing the advanced aircraft will require highly skilled employees and the company will look to the area’s technical schools and junior colleges to help provide a pipeline of future workers.

“It’s going to be a manufacturing boost to the Fort Worth area certainly and advanced manufacturing too not just the way we’ve done things traditionally in the past” Coffman said.

Competing designs

Helicopters and their ability to swiftly move personnel and equipment over challenging terrain transformed how the Army fought in the Vietnam War era.

Over the years those helicopters have evolved to increase their airspeed range and capabilities. But now the Army is looking to respond to modern threats with major boosts across all categories.

Bell’s V-280 Valor prototype features a tilt-rotor design that combines the vertical takeoff and hovering ability of a helicopter with the speed and range of an airplane.

“If you want to go far and you want to go fast and you want to be efficient in flight there’s going to be a wing involved” Coffman said.

Bell has plenty of experience when it comes to tilt-rotors. Its pioneering V-22 Osprey was the first production tilt-rotor aircraft.

Company officials say the V-280′s range and speed will allow a group of aircraft to attack in a dispersed formation flying around threats before massing on a target.

On the other side of the competition Sikorsky and Boeing tout the benefits of their Defiant X which they describe as “the fastest most maneuverable and most survivable military helicopter in history.”

Sikorsky also cites its experience supplying the Army with Black Hawks and other helicopters.

Faster and farther

The Army aircraft being developed are key to countering modern threats Maj. Gen. Walter Rugen who oversees the aviation modernization efforts known as Future Vertical Lift said during a recent event at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.

He said the Black Hawk has been “tried and true” but is now 50 years old.

“And what we’re finding is just that analog age will not give us the decisive transformational capabilities we need on the future battlefield” he said.

Rugen said the fighting in Ukraine has validated core principles behind the Army’s modernization efforts including how military aircraft need to be faster in both the physical world and the cyber domain.

Today’s battlefield features more advanced threats especially during higher-altitude daytime flights. That means pilots need to fly faster and lower which requires superior technology.

“There’s plenty of places to hide if you stay low” Rugen said.

He also cited the importance of improving Army aircraft ranges as the United States seeks to bolster its military presence in the Pacific with its vast expanses of open water.

The development of advanced next-generation projects is expected to support the country’s defense industrial base even as older aircraft are phased out.

“We’ve done a great job of incrementally upgrading them but there’s really no more work there because we’ve run out of SWaP — size weight and power” Rugen said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF2aWF0aW9udG9kYXkuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMDIvaWNlbGFuZGFpci1jb25kdWN0cy1maXJzdC1mbGlnaHQtdGVzdC1wYXNzZW5nZXJzLWZ1bGx5LWVsZWN0cmljLXRyYWluaW5nLXBsYW5lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Icelandair Conducts First Flight Test With Passengers in a Fully-Electric Training Plane,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2h1Z2gtZWRnYXItb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzY0MDE2MjTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hugh Edgar Obituary (2022) - Lewiston ME - Funeral Alternatives Group - Lewiston,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/hugh-edgar-obituary?id=36401624 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2h1Z2gtZWRnYXItb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzY0MDE2MjTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

To investigate the role of Yap1 and Taz (Wwtr1) in aging HSPCs we analyzed their expression in LK (Linneg Sca-1neg c-Kitpos) and LSK (Linneg Sca-1pos c-Kitpos) cells from young and old mice (for exemplary flow cytometry profiles see Supplementary Fig. 1). Wwtr1 mRNA as well as the Taz Protein were both strikingly induced in old LSK (oLSK) whereas Yap1 expression remained unchanged (Fig. 1a–c).

To analyze gene expression changes in the LSK compartment in greater detail we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) from long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs: LSK CD34neg CD135neg) short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs: LSK CD34pos CD135neg) and multipotent progenitors (MPPs: LSK CD34pos CD135pos) from young and old mice (Fig. 1d e). As expected the number of immunophenotypic LT-HSCs was strongly increased in old mice (Supplementary Fig. 2a).

ST-HSCs and MPPs showed a weaker age-dependent separation in principal component analyses whereas old LT-HSCs (oLT-HSCs) were more clearly separable from young LT-HSCs (yLT-HSCs) and showed the highest number of differentially expressed genes between old and young (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 2b). Although most Hippo core components showed only weak or no age-dependent changes Wwtr1 was strongly increased specifically in LT-HSCs and old human HSPCs (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 2c). Yap1 on the other hand was barely expressed in LT-HSCs demonstrating that Wwtr1 is the predominant transcriptional Hippo effector in these cells (Supplementary Fig. 2d).

Strikingly Wwtr1 was the most potently induced transcriptional regulator when comparing oLT-HSCs vs. yLT-HSCs (Fig. 1h).

To identify TAZ-dependent target genes in HSPCs we lentivirally overexpressed the constitutively active TAZ S89A point mutant in freshly isolated LSKs and subsequently performed RNA-Seq (Fig. 1i j). A TAZ-induced gene set consisting of 169 genes was then used to probe TAZ activity in HSCs (Fig. 1k and Supplementary Table 1). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) demonstrated that Taz-induced genes were upregulated in oLT-HSCs compared to oST-HSCs and in oLT-HSCs compared to yLT-HSCs (Fig. 1k). These results show that Taz is active in oLT-HSCs and contributes to aging-dependent gene expression changes.

Clca3a1 is induced by Taz and marks oLT-HSCs

To filter for TAZ-induced genes specific of oLT-HSCs we intersected the Taz overexpression RNA-Seq performed in LSKs with the previous RNA-Seq of young and old HSPCs (Fig. 2a). We obtained a relatively concise set of 24 genes that is also strongly induced in independent datasets (Supplementary Fig. 3a) which we refer to as aged LT-HSC-Taz signature (aLT-Taz signature). In the aLT-Taz signature Calcium-activated chloride channel regulator 1 (Clca3a1) coding an accessory protein for calcium-activated chloride channels demonstrated one of the most striking aging-dependent change in LT-HSCs (Fig. 2b). Clca3a1 expression just like the TAZ target gene Amotl2 strictly followed Wwtr1 expression in the different HSPC populations suggesting that CLCA3A1 may be used to trace TAZ activity in vivo (Fig. 2c). Remarkably Wwtr1 Amotl2 and Clca3a1 were all part of an aging HSC (aHSC) signature (Supplementary Table 1) generated by a meta-analysis of sixteen transcriptomic datasets of aged HSCs17 underlining the robustness of our results.

CLCA3A1 was barely detectable by flow cytometry in young LSK populations but specifically induced in old LT-HSCs (Fig. 2d e and Supplementary Fig. 1). CLCA3A1low HSCs purified from old animals were less quiescent than yHSCs. It took them significantly shorter to complete their first cell division in vitro18 (Fig. 2f) a typical phenotype of oHSCs19. CLCA3A1low cells demonstrated a significantly higher Ki67 positivity potentially because they showed a ~3x higher Cdk6 expression and thus were more Cdk6-dependent for cell division (Supplementary Fig. 3b–e).

RNA-Seq analysis of sorted CLCA3A1high and CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs (Fig. 2g) identified a high number of DEGs: 1169 upregulated (FDR < 0.01) and 1489 downregulated (FDR < 0.01) in CLCA3A1high vs CLCA3A1low.

Notably the aLT-Taz signature was significantly upregulated (p = 1.2e−7) in CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs (Fig. 2g) showing that CLCA3A1 is a proxy for TAZ activity.

To analyze the relative contribution of the aging-dependent increase in the frequency of CLCA3A1high cells to the overall transcriptome changes during HSCs aging we compared the CLCA3A1 RNA-Seq with the old vs. young LT-HSCs RNA-Seq (Fig. 2g). Strikingly the vast majority of genes that were upregulated in CLCA3A1high cells were also upregulated in old vs. young LT-HSCs not only in our data but also in an independent RNA-Seq study7 comparing old and young LT-HSCs (Supplementary Fig. 3f). The same was true for the downregulated genes. Thus the up- and downregulated genes in CLCA3A1high cells significantly overlap with the genes up- and downregulated in oLT-HSCs (Fig. 2h). When Clca3a1 is knocked out in yHSCs in vivo20 Clca3a1 seemed to be required to maintain the HSC pool suggesting that this TAZ-induced gene also has a function in young HSCs (Supplementary Fig. 4). However we focus here on the upstream coactivator Taz because it regulates a variety of different genes that can affect the ageing phenotype.

CLCA3A1high/TAZhigh HSCs mark a specific oHSC subpopulation

To investigate the heterogeneity of Taz-dependent transcription programs in HSPCs at the single-cell level independently of any surface marker we analyzed the transcriptome of young LSK (yLSK) and oLSK by Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-Seq)21. We labeled LSKs with antibody-derived tags (ADTs) for the SLAM marker panel CD150 and CD48 as well as CLCA3A1 to validate our findings with an independent set of HSC surface markers. Based on the activity of specific gene sets (Supplementary Table 1) we were able to identify individual cells with different activities for LT-HSCs ST-HSCs and MPPs (Fig. 2i).

Graph-based clustering identified six clusters (clusters 0–5) in the single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) dataset from young and old LSK cells (Fig. 2j). With the help of the SLAM ADTs and gene set activities22 we identified cluster 1 as a cluster enriched for LT-HSC (Fig. 2j–m and Supplementary Fig. 3g h). Since functional studies would be required to demonstrate their functionality as LT-HSCs we refer to this cluster as ‘HSC-like cluster’. It contained cells expressing high Taz on mRNA level (Fig. 2k) high CLCA3A1 on protein level (Fig. 2l) and showing high activity for a CLCA3A1high gene set (Fig. 2m). CLCA3A1high were much more abundant in the aged population (Fig. 2k l) within the HSC-like cluster’. Only very few scattered yLSKs demonstrated high CLCA3A1 protein level or a high Clca3a1 gene set activity (Fig. 2l m and Supplementary Fig. 3i) suggesting that CLCA3A1high cells also exist to a minor extent in young animals. TAZ activity just like CLCA3A1 activity was largely limited to the HSC-like cluster and was strongly induced in old cells within this cluster (Fig. 2n).

The CLCA3A1high gene set activity strongly correlated with the activity of two independent LT-HSC-specific gene sets (Fig. 2o) one based on our own RNA-Seq data and one previously published23.

In summary CLCA3A1high/TAZhigh HSCs represent a specific and highly abundant population within the oHSC compartment. They are characterized by high expression of genes that qualify them as LT-HSCs but are transcriptionally distinct from yHSCs.

Old CLCA3A1low HSCs show features of “young-like” HSCs

To test whether the surface marker CLCA3A1 is sufficient to isolate a pure fraction of oHSCs and “young-like” HSCs from old mice we compared our CLCA3A1high signature with the aHSC signature. Both signatures nearly perfectly correlated at the single-cell level indicating that CLCA3A1 is an excellent marker to isolate oHSCs (Fig. 3a b). Remarkably a substantial number of old cells with low CLCA3A1high gene set activity were present in the HSC-like cluster (Fig. 3c) suggesting that a CLCA3A1low immunophenotype marks individual “young-like” HSCs within the pool of oHSCs.

In accordance with the aged phenotype of CLCA3A1high HSCs CLCA3A1 induction also correlated with a gene expression profile of myeloid-biased LT-HSCs (MyLT-HSCs)24 at the single-cell level (Supplementary Fig. 5a) and in the bulk RNA-Seq dataset (Fig. 3d). Consistently Clca3a1 expression clearly correlated with the expression of CD150 a marker of MyLT-HSC in flow cytometry analyses (Fig. 3e).

Given the fundamental differences between CLCA3A1low and CLCA3A1high HSCs at multiple levels we next tested whether these two cell populations also differ functionally. To this end we analyzed their long-term repopulating capacity and their long-term multilineage reconstitution potential in competitive repopulation assays. Two expected hallmarks of oLT-HSCs in this assay are functional decline in long-term repopulation and myeloid skewing of peripheral blood (PB) cells. We transplanted CD45.2-expressing CLCA3A1high or CLCA3A1ow LT-HSCs together with CD45.1/2 competitor cells into lethally irradiated CD45.1 (Ly5.1) recipient mice. PB chimerism was investigated monthly over a period of 4 months. One month post-transplantation chimerism in the blood of CLCA3A1high recipients was comparable to those who received CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs (Fig. 3f). Over time however recipients of CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs showed a gradual decline of donor contribution to the PB (Fig. 3f g) demonstrating a defect in long-term repopulating activity of the CLCA3A1high population. The frequency of CLCA3A1low-derived leukocytes in contrast remained stable compared to the young and age-matched competitor cells (Fig. 3f). In addition CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs produced significantly more myeloid cells in the PB and fewer B and T cells (Fig. 3g). Four months after transplantation spleen and bone marrow (BM) chimerism appeared strongly decreased in recipients receiving CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs (Supplementary Fig. 5b c). Within the donor-derived compartment Clca3a1high- and CLCA3A1low-derived cells generated a similar frequency of myeloid progenitors but the CLCA3A1low samples showed a higher frequency of common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs)—a typical characteristic of yHSCs3 (Supplementary Fig. 5d). Irrespective of the donor status (CLCA3A1high or CLCA3A1low) CLCA3A1 expression was lost in the BM 4 months after transplantation and the two different cell populations showed similar behavior in secondary transplantations.

Old HSCs induce Taz to keep a minimal regenerative potential

Next we tested whether Taz actively contributes to the functional decline of CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs or whether it gets induced to counteract defects in CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs. Intriguingly Clusterin (gene name Clu) was potently induced in CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Previous studies showed that Clu expression is YAP1-dependent and is induced in stressed cells to trigger a regenerative response25. To test whether TAZ has a similar function in oHSCs we depleted TAZ in CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs using two potent shRNAs (shTAZ#1 and shTAZ#2) shTAZ#2 being more potent than shTAZ#1 and a control shRNA (shRen) targeting Renilla (Fig. 4a). We isolated CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs infected them ex vivo with lentiviral shRNA constructs and transplanted these cells into lethally irradiated recipients. Transplanted CLCA3A1high populations contained ~60–80% infected (GFP-positive) and ~20–40% uninfected (GFP-negative) cells in order to use the GFP-negative fraction as a competitor against the GFP-positive fraction from the same donor and follow the frequency of GFP-positive cells within the CD45.2 donor fraction over time (Supplementary Fig. 6b). In the PB shTAZ-transduced donor cells rapidly lost the GFP signal demonstrating that uninfected cells outcompeted TAZ-depleted cells whereas shRen cells maintained a stable frequency of GFP-positive cells (Fig. 4b).

TAZ-depleted HSCs showed a tendency to produce increased numbers of myeloid cells and decreased numbers of B and T cells (Supplementary Fig. 6c). The effects appeared subtler when compared to those observed for competitive repopulation although both Taz shRNAs showed similar trends. The inferior fitness of shTAZ progeny was also reflected in the BM where TAZ depletion led to a significantly reduced GFPpos fraction in lineage-negative (Linneg) precursor cells (Fig. 4c). The percentage of CD34neg LSK cells in the GFP-positive compartment however remained largely unchanged (Supplementary Fig. 6d) indicating that HSCs were not lost due to Taz depletion. The RNA-Seq analysis of donor-derived LSK CD34neg cells 4 months after transplantation revealed that TAZ-depleted cells were transcriptionally distinct from shRen cells (Fig. 4d e) and that TAZ depletion led to a downregulation of the top 200 genes that were induced in old LT-HSCs (Fig. 4f). These transcriptional profiling analyses in conjunction with our transplantation studies of TAZ-depleted HSCs demonstrate that TAZ sustains a transcriptional program that protects aged HSCs from functional decline.

Clca3a1low HSCs resemble yHSCs at the chromatin level

Given the fundamental changes that occur at the epigenomic level in oHSCs7 we analyzed the chromatin changes in CLCA3A1high and CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs. To this end we profiled the global chromatin accessibility of these cells as well as yHSCs and oHSCs by FAST-ATAC-Seq (Fig. 5a b)26.

We identified 43031 peaks that were shared between all four samples (Fig. 5b). Strikingly CLCA3A1high HSCs and oHSCs demonstrated many additional peaks of these 22023 were shared between these two samples. The functional GO term analysis of those additional peaks demonstrated a clear enrichment for pathways involved in direct or indirect regulation of TAZ e.g. Hippo and Wnt signaling pathways (Fig. 5c)27. Also the Wwtr1 locus itself showed changes in chromatin accessibility specifically in candidate enhancer regions which are hypomethylated in oHSCs7 (Supplementary Fig. 7). Differential peak analysis of CLCA3A1high vs. CLCA3A1low HSCs corroborated the trend toward more peaks in CLCA3A1high HSCs (Fig. 5d–f). Increased accessibility also led to greater expression of the associated genes at the mRNA level (Fig. 5e f) which shows that chromatin changes can impact on gene expression.

To identify changes in TF accessibility indicative of altered TF activity which could explain the functional differences we performed a chromVAR analysis28. In accordance with our transcriptomic profiling of CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs and yLT-HSCs CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs clustered together with yLT-HSCs whereas CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs clustered with oLT-HSCs (Fig. 5g h). Furthermore the accessibility of the TEAD motifs was much higher in CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs than in yLT-HSCs indicating that TEAD/TAZ is more active in these cells (Fig. 5i).

Collectively our data demonstrate that old CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs have lower TEAD/TAZ activity than CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs and resemble yLT-HSCs at the transcriptional chromatin and functional level.

Low PU.1 expression is associated with aging phenotypes

To understand chromatin accessibility changes in aging HSCs at the single-cell level we performed single-cell ATAC-Seq (scATAC-Seq) of young and old LT HSCs and of CLCA3A1high and CLCA3A1low LT HSCs (Fig. 6a d). Analysis of differentially accessible TF motifs showed a striking correlation when comparing changes in old vs. young and CLCA3A1high vs. CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs (Fig. 6g). Here DNA sequences bound by ETS transcription factors (SPI1 and SPIC) were identified as the most differentially accessible sites in both comparisons as well in our bulk ATAC-Seq data (Fig. 6g and Supplementary Fig. 8a b). While the accessibility of Spi1 motifs progressively decreased from young to old and from CLCA3A1low to CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs the accessibility of a Tead motif showed an opposite behavior when we analyzed the behavior of these motifs in pseudotime analyses (Fig. 6h i). oLT-HSCs are thus a heterogeneous pool of cells where opposed activities of PU.1 and TEAD/TAZ define functionally distinct populations which can be separated based on CLCA3A1. Remarkably Spi1 encodes the transcription factor PU.1 a key regulator of HSC function29 suggesting that the activity of this critical regulator is decreased during HSC aging. Consistently Spi1 expression demonstrated a sharp drop specifically in the HSC-like cluster 1 but not the adjacent cluster 0 in our scRNA-Seq data (Fig. 6j). To investigate whether decreased Spi1 expression in CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs also affects PU.1 target gene expression we generated PU.1-dependent gene sets from hematopoietic progenitor cells. For that we depleted PU.1 in the HSC-like cell line BM-HPC#530 using two potent shRNAs and performed RNA-Seq (Fig. 6k l). We identified 667 genes which were downregulated (log2FC < (−1) padj<0.05: shPU1.down) and 899 genes that were upregulated (log2FC > 1 padj < 0.05: shPU1.up) upon PU.1 depletion (Fig. 6l). Consistent with low PU.1 expression in CLCA3A1high HSCs HSC-like cluster 1 contained significantly more cells with high shPU1.up AUC from old vs young a trend which could not be observed in the adjacent cluster 0 (Fig. 6m). Furthermore the shPU1.up gene set was significantly upregulated when comparing CLCA3A1high vs. CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs while the shPU1.down gene set showed opposite regulation (Fig. 6n). We noticed that many genes encoding surface markers commonly used to isolate HSCs (Cd34 Flt3 (CD135) Cd48 Procr (EPCR)) were affected by PU.1 depletion in BM-HPC#5 and were also downregulated in CLCA3A1high vs. CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs (Fig. 6l o). Low Spi1 expression in oHSCs could hence explain the increased frequency of immunophenotypic HSCs commonly observed in aged individuals. We confirmed this by flow cytometry comparing young and old LSK since the frequency of immunophenotypic LT-HSCs in old Clca3a1low LSK resembled that of yLSK cells (Fig. 6p q).

These data demonstrate that HSC aging is associated with a gradual depletion of PU.1 which correlates with specific features of oHSCs at the transcriptional and immunophenotypic level.

Decreased Spi1 expression in yHSC drives features of aging

To test whether decreased PU.1 levels in yHSCs is sufficient to induce an “old-like” HSC phenotype we depleted PU.1 in yHSCs from 14- to 17-week-old by two independent shRNAs. We analyzed the PB and BM only 2 months after transplantation as PU.1-deficient HSCs are lost shortly after transplantation31. PU.1-depleted HSCs rapidly lost their ability to contribute to the production of PB cells but had mostly weaker effects on other parameters in BM and PB (Supplementary Fig. 9a–d). Due to the critical role of PU.1 in progenitors downstream of the HSC compartment we consequently focused on PU.1’s role in HSCs. Therefore we performed scRNA-Seq of the LSK compartment from control- (shRen) and PU.1-depleted (shPU1 #1 and shPU1 #2) HSPCs 2 months after transplantation (Fig. 7a–d Supplementary Fig. 9e). Graph-based clustering revealed seven clusters (Fig. 7a). We used a previously defined stringent HSC vs. MPP1 gene set23 (LT-HSC #2 Fig. 2i) to identify “HSC-like cells” in our scRNA-Seq data. In this way we identified two populations consisting mainly of HSC-like cells (Fig. 7b). One population located in clusters 2 and 5 contained almost exclusively PU.1-depleted HSC-like cells while shRen HSC-like cells were mainly found in cluster 0 (Fig. 7c d). Just as in BM-HPC#5 cells PU.1 depletion in young HSC-like cells resulted in drastic gene expression changes with Cd34 as well as Flt3 being potently downregulated (Fig. 7e). Consistent with the previously described role of PU.1 in maintaining HSC quiescence genes induced after PU.1 depletion in HSC-like cells showed highly significant enrichment for E2F-dependent target genes (Supplementary Fig. 9f g). Noteworthy Taz mRNA was undetectable in the scRNA-Seq dataset suggesting that PU.1 depletion alone does not lead to Taz induction. The shPU1.up gene set showed high activity exclusively in clusters 2 and 5 which contained shPU1 HSC-like cells (Fig. 7f). Strikingly PU.1 depletion alone was sufficient to induce an “aged-like” transcriptome in young HSC-like cells without inducing a myeloid-biased LT-HSC gene expression program (Fig. 7g h) suggesting that decreased PU.1 expression in oHSCs does not contribute to this phenotype or that it takes longer to establish. However the aHSC gene set showed high activity specifically in PU.1-depleted HSC-like cells with low PU.1 activity—equivalent to high sh.PU1.up activity (Fig. 7i).

Given the partially overlapping phenotype that depletion of TAZ and PU.1 had on the regenerative potential of HSCs and their opposite activities in our scATAC analyses we hypothesized that Taz is induced during aging to compensate for the decreased PU.1 expression in oHSCs—possibly because TAZ can act as a coactivator for PU.1. Consistent with this hypothesis PU.1 and TAZ depletion showed a convergent transcriptional response upon depletion (Fig. 7j). Moreover PU.1 and TAZ physically interacted in GST pulldown assays and TAZ was able to act as a potent PU.1 coactivator in transient luciferase reporter assays in a strictly PU.1-dependent manner (Fig. 7k l). Since we were not able to obtain high-quality genomic binding data for PU.1 or TAZ from freshly sorted HSCs we performed Cut&Run for PU.1 in BM-HPC#5 cells to identify genes that are directly regulated by PU.1. The 3163 PU.1 Cut&Run peaks were highly enriched for ETS-motifs and were almost exclusively located in promoter regions (Fig. 7m–p). To identify direct PU.1 target genes that are induced in a TAZ-dependent manner we intersected the PU.1 peaks with the genes that are significantly downregulated in transplanted old CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs (Fig. 4e) upon TAZ depletion (Fig. 7q). We identified here 60 genes that were potently downregulated (with a median log2 fold change of −4.8) upon TAZ depletion (Supplementary Table 1). Here the two gene ontology terms centrosome and microtubule organization which play a critical role in mitosis and symmetric vs. asymmetric cell division were highly enriched in these 60 genes (Fig. 7r). Thus our data show that age-dependent loss of PU.1 activity in HSCs is sufficient to induce aging phenotypes and that Taz can counteract them at least in part by acting as a PU.1 coactivator for specific genes (Fig. 7s t).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNTk4LTAyMi0xOTIyMC020gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Xanthohumol exerts anti-inflammatory effects in an in vitro model of mechanically stimulated cementoblasts | Scientific ...,"Until now multiple effects of XN such as anti-inflammatority2526 antibacteriality27 anti-angiogenity2628 and anti-proliferativity28 have been described. Concerning the periodontal microenvironment anti-inflammatory mechanisms are of highest interest since compression related remodeling processes in this area are associated with a local sterile inflammation29. The effect of XN on bone resorption may also be profitable in other inflammation types in periodontal tissues without compressive stimuli like periodontitis. In this work we investigated the effects of Xanthohumol on immortalized cementoblasts during compressive force application hypothesizing that the anti-inflammatory properties may modulate the inflammatory signaling processes. The drug concentrations corresponded to typical concentrations in standard beer (up to 0.4 µM)30 and XN enriched sorts of beer (8.5 µM)31. In addition these concentrations were in a comparable range with total human XN blood plasma concentrations (free and conjugated) after oral XN administration21. The proportion of conjugated XN relative to free XN in human plasma is close to 100% for conjugated XN21. In many cases conjugated agents in contrast to free ones are not relevant for therapeutic effects. Nevertheless in case of XN biological effects seem to correlate with total (free plus conjugated) XN levels not only with the levels of free XN213233. Furthermore XN has been shown to have a high bioavailability and a low toxicity profile3435. Orally administered Xanthohumol does not affect major organ functions in vivo36.

The in vitro experiments in this study showed dose dependent effects of XN on cytotoxicity and cell viability. Low doses increased cell viability while higher doses provoked cytotoxic effects. Based on this a XN concentration of 0.4 µM has been used for further experiments with compressive stimulation. Higher concentrations were not investigated in further experiments on mRNA and protein level due to high significance and better clinical plausibility of 0.4 µM. The level of exerted force was similar to previous experiments with fibroblasts of the periodontal ligament3738 and cementoblasts3940. In these experiments an initial lag phase of 24 h after force application followed by continuing proliferation has been reported37. We were able to confirm decreased cell proliferation in compressed cementoblasts by cell cytometry. XN had supporting effects on cell proliferation and survival comparable to our findings regarding cell viability.

Comparing compressively stimulated cementoblasts with their control we were able to confirm the results from previous publication indicating that Cox-2 gene expression is upregulated by loading compression41. Our findings regarding compression related Il-6 upregulation correlate with previous publications with periodontal ligament fibroblasts42. IL-6 is an important marker of periodontal remodeling being involved in osteoclast differentiation and activation17. This regulation indicates that cementoblasts are involved in regulatory mechanisms after compressive strain. As hypothesized XN is able to decrease this compression dependent IL-6 upregulation on mRNA and protein level. Regarding anti-angiogenic properties of XN we further investigated the regulation of Vegfa that is upregulated in PDL cells13 and not explored in compressively stimulated cementoblasts yet. We did not observe any relevant regulations neither of compressive force nor of XN on Vegfa mRNA expression. In contrast no effects on other proinflammatory markers´ gene expression such as Il-1a Vegfa Mmp9 and Cox2 were detectable.

Despite the exact intracellular target of XN and its mechanism remains unclear previous studies with various cancer cell lines have demonstrated that XN interacts with the three MAP-Kinase subfamilies: ERK434445 JNK45 and p3846. XN effects on protein kinase B/AKT are known too474849. The well-known relevance of these kinases for cell proliferation cell survival cell stress and inflammatory responses is important for getting a first insight in XN related changes in cementoblasts. Our data provide evidence that XN may influence cell proliferation and cell survival as seen in cell cytometry experiments (Fig. 2) and gene and protein expression of IL-6 (Fig. 3). As we reported before phospho-ERK and phospho-AKT are upregulated by compressive stimulation40 and—corresponding to publications about XN in cancer cell lines—both phosphorylated forms were decreased by XN. Activated ERK is able to translocate into the nucleus and modulates genes for the response to stimulation5051. Taking this together we hypothesize a correlation of ERK activation and IL-6 expression caused by mechanical stimulation in cementoblasts. Regulations of phospho-ERK following mechanical strain are also known in PDLF52. In contrast to that JNK p38 and their phosphorylated forms were not altered neither by mechanical stimulation nor by XN. This suggests first indications that these kinases are not involved in the cellular reaction to compressive stimuli in cementoblasts. Finally we investigated possible effects of XN on RANKL protein expression. RANKL is a key molecule for bone regeneration and remodeling by affecting the differentiation of osteoclasts53. As we showed static compressive stimulation had just a slight effect and XN had no impact on RANKL. This expression nearly independent of mechanical stimulation contrasts with previous studies with human PDLF54 and cementoblasts41 where a clear upregulation was observed.

Special to Utica Observer-Dispatch USA TODAY Network

I like getting letters but very few people seem to write them anymore.

I do get emails however and I like them too because they often make column writing easier.

I’ve received several good ones recently including one from longtime area coach and athletic director Kathy Faber who wrote to tell me about a great rescue performed by Bill Boyle and Ryan Fagan earlier this summer.

Boyle was sitting on his deck at Canadarago Lake drinking his morning coffee and watching an eagle hunting up its breakfast. There was a boat out on the lake trolling with planer boards and the eagle decided that one of the trailing lures might be edible and dropped out of the sky and into the water to get it.

Not a good idea.

The bird became entangled and was in danger of drowning. Boyle enlisted the help of Fagan who netted the bird which then somehow freed itself from the lure and turned out of the net. The eagle was exhausted however and couldn’t get off the water. Fagan netted it again and he and Boyle worked their way against the wind to Deowongo Island where they released it again. The eagle stood in place for a while on the shore then flew-hopped to a bench on the island sat there for about 20 minutes then flew up into a tree and soon was gone.

The rescue wasn’t an easy task since the bird as you might imagine was not in the best of moods. It was great work by Boyle and Fagan.

Fagan thinks the bird was a golden eagle. Tom Salo of the Delaware-Otsego Audubon Society’s Franklin Mountain Hawk Watch has been studying goldens for many years and he is quite sure after looking at photos it was an immature bald eagle. Immatures lack the signature white head and tail and look somewhat like goldens. (Salo wrote an excellent story on golden eagles in the December 2014 New York State Conservationist. You should be able to find it on line.)

By the way you are likely to see bald eagles almost any day near Canadarago and Otsego lakes. I’ve seen them pluck fish out of the water riding thermals standing out in fields and feeding on carrion in the middle of the road. Fagan said they congregate on Canadarago in double-digit numbers at ice-out time in the spring.

Also by the way the Franklin Mountain Hawkwatch – just across the Susquehanna River from Oneonta – officially began last weekend. You can see bald eagles golden eagles and many other raptors up there depending on the season. Broad-winged hawks already have been migrating. Visitors are always welcome and official counters appreciate help spotting birds. Dress warmly in layers. It can be much colder up there than you think it is going to be.

The best times to be at the hawkwatch are when winds are strong from the northwest and especially after a rain and the passing of a cold front. Information including detailed directions is available at https://doas.us/research/franklin-mountain-hawkwatch/.

I received several other emails of note:

For example in regard to a column on garden pests and how to deal with them Sue Fellows suggested an electric fence. She and her husband put up a three-strand solar fence with components from Tractor Supply and a Gallagher charger bought on line. Sue said it was easy to install. She sent photos of the garden which looks great and has not been molested by critters.

Anthony Salerno wrote to share his experience with his very large garden. He has a picket fence that keeps out larger animals and he doesn’t weed and feed his backyard leaving plenty of clover that he says keeps the woodchucks and squirrels fat and happy. He doesn’t plant lettuce kale Brussel sprouts of any type of cabbage because he has found nothing that works at preventing them being ravaged. He moves owl decoys around the garden which seems to keep the crows at bay. Strawberries and blueberries have wire fencing over them to keep the birds and rabbits away and he has so many blackberries that he lets the animals have their fill. He said everything else including herbs usually is undisturbed and left alone.

In response to a column about invasive species Donald Beier wrote to tell me his experience in dealing with Japanese knotweed at a campground he belonged on the West Branch of the Delaware River. Everything was tried and nothing worked until it was decided to tarp the weeds. They were cut down to ground level and then tarps were placed over the roots. It took several years of what he described as diligent consistent effort but the knotweed disappeared and native foliage returned.

Also on knotweed Ross Cohn informed me that it is edible. Well as a veteran forager of dandelions cardoons (burdock) mustard greens leeks black walnuts and the like I should have expected that to be so but really I was stunned by that news. Ross suggested that as terribly invasive as the weed is making it into a feature in the kitchen might be a great way to control its spread.

In a posting from 2016 bonappetit.com reported that some restaurants were serving knotweed. Maybe it was a fad that since has faded but I’m thinking it probably still is a thing in certain big city establishments.

Here is what bonappetit.com had to say:

“Knotweed’s one redeeming quality then is that its hollow green stems segmented like bamboo and freckled with crimson taste a whole lot like rhubarb (though the two bear no relation). They are tart crunchy and juicy; can be eaten raw or cooked; and can lean sweet or savory depending on how they’re prepared. So knotweed is in many ways the perfect thing to forage: It tastes good it’s easy to find and unlike many wild edibles it’s at zero risk of being over-harvested.”

That is for sure.

Special to USA TODAY

A report by Arrivia found that only 42% of people used their awards to lower the cost of a trip.

Customers pay for these ""free"" perks with fees and inflated travel prices.

Travel companies removed many perks during the pandemic or made it more difficult to redeem their miles for ""free"" tickets.

What's the point of participating in a travel loyalty program anymore? Frequent travelers like Joel Smiler can't think of one.

""There is little to no value in status anymore"" said Smiler a retired veterinarian from Lakeville Michigan. ""There are few upgrades no dedicated customer service lines that get you to a representative sooner and no early boarding in some cases.""

He says he's done being loyal and will no longer actively participate in any program.

There have always been travelers like Smiler who don't follow the herds of consumers collecting points and miles. But now there's evidence their ranks are growing. And that has people wondering if loyalty programs have a future after the pandemic.

'There's still pent-up demand':What you should know about fall travel

""Travel loyalty programs are on the decline"" said Humphrey Ho managing director of Hylink Digital USA a digital marketing agency. ""Many programs are experiencing post-pandemic inflation and there's been a decline in users.""

A report by travel technology company Arrivia found that less than half of Americans think points are important to travel and only 42% used their awards to lower the cost of a trip. Even executives agree that their loyalty programs are lacking with nearly one-third admitting that they struggle to demonstrate the value of their rewards.

Most problematic: Younger travelers don't seem to be that loyal. Only 35% of Gen Z travelers participate in a travel loyalty program according to research by Morning Consult. The industry average is 43%. ""Their awareness of loyalty programs is low"" said travel analyst Lindsey Roeschke.

This travel trend is a long time coming. The pandemic made many travelers take a hard look at their loyalties. What they often found were programs that weren't that loyal to them. And although there are notable exceptions it seems we are headed to a reckoning of sorts when it comes to loyalty programs.

Travelers started questioning their loyalties during the pandemic

Travel loyalty programs are at the center of America's travel industry. Millions of people slavishly collect points so they can later reap the rewards of ""free"" travel. They often do so without asking basic questions like Who's paying for this? And who is the real beneficiary?

The economics behind the system are troubling. Customers pay for these ""free"" perks with fees and inflated travel prices. Airlines earn billions of dollars a year from selling miles to credit card companies which pass them along to their customers for ""free."" Airline loyalty programs are routinely valued at more than the airlines themselves. Unsurprisingly the biggest beneficiaries are airlines and hotels and the credit card companies that buy their points.

Are hotel reward programs worth it?:Yes but benefits are small for infrequent customers

But now cracks are starting to form in the wildly profitable loyalty scheme. Early in the pandemic frequent travelers began to ask questions the travel industry didn't want them to ask. Some concluded that loyalty programs just weren't worth it.

Tim Pylant a tech industry manager from Austin Texas is among them.

""It is difficult being tied to a particular airline because of the restricted schedules"" he said. ""And with less business travel and credit cards that let you use your points on any airline you don't have to.""

Pylant had hoped airlines would seize the moment during the pandemic to make themselves more relevant and valuable to their top customers. But instead they fumbled by delaying and canceling flights and too often not even trying to make it up to their customers.

Passengers like Plyant don't even care about the dubious economics of loyalty programs. They just want the travel companies to take care of them as they promised. But they didn't. And that is why some frequent travelers believe loyalty is dead.

How much are your points worth?

Another reason travelers are losing interest in loyalty programs is that they have realized that their points are worth less. Travel companies removed many perks during the pandemic or made it more difficult to redeem their miles for ""free"" tickets. That led to point inflation which means it sometimes takes more points to get the same award ticket or room.

Scott McMurren an Alaska Airlines frequent flier was stunned when he read about his airline giving 90000 miles to each employee.

""I've got a sinking feeling"" says McMurren who publishes TourSaver.com a coupon book for visitors to Alaska. ""It appears the airline is self-fueling inflation for its travelers – including me – who use miles to get tickets. In my mind the airline is simply harvesting the substantial equity it's built up with the program.""

Alaska Airlines said the mileage awards to its employees were a ""one-time"" gift in celebration of the airline's 90th anniversary. A representative said it plans no award pricing changes related to it.

But McMurren's complaint raises a bigger question about the value of these programs. When an airline can do whatever it wants – raise redemption levels change the rules even confiscate all the miles – then what's the true value of the program? How much are your points even worth?

Story continues below.

Some are doubling down on programs

Not everyone is a skeptic. Heather Prestanski who owns an interior design firm that specializes in historic renovation projects said she's all in on her travel loyalty programs.

""I've doubled down on our travel loyalty programs"" she said. ""I've shifted from only using my credit card rewards program to becoming more loyal to specific hotel brands car rental brands and flight carriers to collect more points enjoy faster check-ins and receive a higher level of service while traveling.""

Prestanski said her loyalty has saved her time and money. For example she found a discounted block of rooms in Las Vegas for a recent company meeting thanks to her status. Prestanski even scored ""free"" airline tickets. ""And we extended our stay for a personal vacation"" she added.

Companies are investing in their loyalty programs too. Expedia Brands which currently has 154 million loyalty members reportedly adds several million new members each month. Next year Expedia is rolling out its One Key platform which will allow frequent travelers to redeem their rewards across flights hotels vacation rentals car rentals cruises and activities.

""Loyalty programs aren’t dying"" said Jon Gieselman president of Expedia Brands. ""They just need to get better.""

But even mileage skeptics would point out that loyalty programs are created for frequent business travelers like Prestanski. And for them loyalty programs do have a future – and rightfully so.

Story continues below.

The end is not near until this happens

The rest of us would be forgiven for any acts of disloyalty. After this summer's airline service failures and the substandard service many hotels and car rental companies gave their customers is it even appropriate to show a travel company any kind of loyalty?

So when will the end come for travel loyalty programs? I asked Hal Brierley a loyalty program consultant who helped create American Airlines' AAdvantage program. He said it would take a dramatic shift in consumer behavior – either a bank that offers a rewards-less credit card or a significant number of consumers who say they no longer want points or miles.

""If these programs are at risk the first sign will be a drop in the number of consumers paying significant annual fees to earn their miles and points"" Brierley said.

Sharon Anne Kean head of global expansion at the financial services company Wise said it's an idea they're considering. A card that made all fees transparent showing how much you pay for services like currency conversions and transactions might appeal to some minimalists who want to save money.

""We want to help customers see how they're being ripped off by the banks"" she added. ""That would be cool.""

What about that generation gap? Brierley said he's heard the same argument about the younger generation rejecting loyalty programs for years. But he's not worried.

""As they get older and start traveling"" Brierley added ""the kids will want their points and free tickets. I'm sure of it.""

BANGOR Maine — Another busy holiday weekend begins as people hit the road for what is considered the last weekend of the summer.

According to AAA about 32 percent of Americans will travel this weekend with a third of those travelers flying.

Bangor International Airport leaders say staffing shortages are still making air travel a bit difficult for the airport and travelers.

Leaders also say many of the airlines have adjusted their schedules to better match their staffing models.

Solinftec a global leader in agricultural digitalization has announced that it is expanding its Solix Ag Robotics offerings. In addition to its Solix Scouting robot the company has unveiled its Solix Sprayer robot designed to detect and spray weeds. In partnership with the award-winning manufacturing research and development company McKinney Corporation who will produce and manufacture the Solix spray robot this new cutting-edge technology is slated to become commercially available in 2023 to the entire agricultural market including farmers cooperatives and ag retailers.

“Solinftec’s partnership with McKinney Corporation will positively impact our ability to market and deliver Solix Ag Robotics by consolidating Solix’s scalability and accelerating service to the North American markets” shared Leonardo Carvalho Solinftec’s director of operations. “It also supports Solinftec’s goal of making this technology available globally.”

A leading innovator and pioneer in the AgTech space and champion for sustainable farm practices Solinftec has designed its scouting and sprayer robots to help producers reduce their chemical inputs and deliver a lower carbon footprint and environmental impact.

The new Solix Sprayer robot will provide autonomous and sustainable spot-spray applications on grower’s fields. Similar to the Solix Scouting robot the spray robot is powered by four solar panels that control the drive system and the spray system while providing reports on crop populations weed identification and densities disease identification and thresholds insect identification and thresholds nutrient deficiency identification and densities NDVI among other layers of maps for data analysis and much more useful data to the grower virtually 24/7.

The Solix spray robot will provide weed spot-spray maps with analysis on inputs saved and can services up to 96 acres per day depending on the field shape and terrain.

With a goal to change agriculture in order to transform the world the need and priority to feed the world on a larger scale with a smaller impact has made Solinftec seek out new ways to reimagine agriculture. A Brazil-founded company with its U.S. offices in Indiana Solinftec is revolutionizing how farmers run their business with end-to-end mission critical solutions generating up to 70% efficiency improvements by turning data into action. With more than 15 years of experience developing digital ag solutions throughout various geographies and crops around the world the Solix Ag Robotics connected and integrated with Solinftec’s innovative ALICE AI platform works together to orchestrate machine operations and calculates producers’ ultimate needs and objectives and delivers real-time actionable recommendations and actions in a more eco-friendly way.

“Solinftec focuses on really solving structural problems in agricultural management and offers solutions that truly promote low-impact agriculture and not only measure or certify the footprint but offers a real solution to reduce your impact” shared Carvalho. “Weed detection is a leading issue in fields across the North America and the Solix Sprayer is designed to not only monitor and scan fields like the original scouting version but detect and manage weeds with technology which allows the device to spot-spray into the plant instead of from above eliminating drift and soil compaction caused by larger machines and help lower environmental impact.”

Pilots for the Solix models are currently running in North America in partnership with the ag cooperative GROWMARK Purdue University in the U.S. and Stone Farms and University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon SK Canada.

In Brazil the Solix Scouting robot has been manufactured and produced by cutting-edge electronics manufacturing service company Hi-Mix Eletrônicos and has been commercially available since last April.

“Since the beginning we have identified a strong culture in Solinftec to the agriculture market investing heavily in R&D plus a determination for quality flexibility and agility for the best time to market” shared Daniel Carvalho co-founder Hi-Mix Eletrônicos S/A. “Hi-Mix is proud to work with Solinftec a company always looking for state-of-the-art in its products and solutions.”

Over the past four years Jones has made more than 300% on oil and gas assets he acquired in North Dakota compared to “just” a 58% gain in the value of the Cowboys over that same time.

In 2018 Jones swapped 52.5 net producing oil wells and a series of uncompleted wells he owned in North Dakota’s Bakken region for 88.57 million shares in publicly traded gas producer Comstock Resources worth $620 million. Arguably Comstock overpaid since those wells cost Jones $398 million net of accounting write-downs including depletion and depreciation according to Comstock’s 2019 annual report. Today those shares are worth $1.68 billion—a 328% return on Jones’ original investment.

By comparison in 2018 the Cowboys were worth $4.8 billion increasing “just” 58% in value over the same period to $7.6 billion in this year’s Sportico NFL valuations. Including a follow-on investment of $475 million cash into Comstock in 2019 Jones today has the equivalent of 182.3 million shares of Comstock Resources worth nearly $3.5 billion.

The reason has been an unexpected surge in the price of natural gas. In 2018 when Jones took control of Comstock benchmark natural gas prices were low about $3.25/mmbtu. When Jones doubled down in 2019 prices had fallen even further to less than $3. This year natural gas has traded as high as $9.85 with an average price around $6.59.

“He made one of the biggest out-of-consensus bets. It’s almost like when he bought the Dallas Cowboys” Neal Dingmann an energy stock analyst at Truist Securities said in a phone call. “It looks like an easy bet now but at the time everybody shook their head. I couldn’t find another investor out there that was positive on natural gas.”

There are more parallels with the Cowboys than there may seem at first. In 1989 no one had ever paid more than $100 million for a sports team before Jones a former college football player shocked the industry with his $150 million purchase of the then money-hemorrhaging franchise. Jones followed that by firing legendary coach Tom Landry as his first—very unpopular—act. Since 1989 the Cowboys have risen 5000% in value. When Jones who originally made a fortune in oil and gas before the Cowboys took control of Comstock not only was the natural gas business slumping Comstock itself was saddled with a poor balance sheet and mediocre oil and gas reserves based on a review of the company’s annual reports. The Jones deal more than tripled Comstock’s oil reserves and just as importantly improved its balance sheet and gave the business direction. The Cowboys declined immediate comment when reached Thursday night. Comstock Resources declined comment.

Under Jones’ majority ownership Comstock didn’t stay in North Dakota for long—the company sold off its assets in the state last year to Northern Oil and Gas for $154 million. Jones has refocused the company as a natural gas producer in the Haynesville Basin a massive gas deposit beneath the surface of east Texas and northern Louisiana. Jones didn’t just buy into natural gas at the right time he’s put the company into what many consider the best natural gas geography. The Haynesville region means producers have a short pipeline run to the Gulf Coast where the expected growth in the global liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade to Europe and elsewhere should power Comstock’s business for years to come.

“How much is luck how much is skill no one will ever know. But I don’t want to call it a risky bet—I think he weighed the options and thought he bought it cheap enough” Dingmann said. “Long story short here we are a few years later and it has turned out to be one of the best buys in the oil and gas business in years.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9icmF2ZXMtcm9va2llLXNwZW5jZXItc3RyaWRlci1icmVha3MtbG9uZy1zdGFuZGluZy1mcmFuY2hpc2UtcmVjb3JkLWltcHJlc3NpdmUtc3RhcnTSAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3huZXdzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvYnJhdmVzLXJvb2tpZS1zcGVuY2VyLXN0cmlkZXItYnJlYWtzLWxvbmctc3RhbmRpbmctZnJhbmNoaXNlLXJlY29yZC1pbXByZXNzaXZlLXN0YXJ0LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Braves rookie Spencer Strider breaks long-standing franchise record in impressive start,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.foxnews.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /sports/braves-rookie-spencer-strider-breaks-long-standing-franchise-record-impressive-start (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001671074A260>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9icmF2ZXMtcm9va2llLXNwZW5jZXItc3RyaWRlci1icmVha3MtbG9uZy1zdGFuZGluZy1mcmFuY2hpc2UtcmVjb3JkLWltcHJlc3NpdmUtc3RhcnTSAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3huZXdzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvYnJhdmVzLXJvb2tpZS1zcGVuY2VyLXN0cmlkZXItYnJlYWtzLWxvbmctc3RhbmRpbmctZnJhbmNoaXNlLXJlY29yZC1pbXByZXNzaXZlLXN0YXJ0LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vY2FsbHRvdGhlcGVuLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzAyL2F0bGFudGEtYnJhdmVzLWplc3NlLWNoYXZlei1wb3N0c2Vhc29uLWJyaWFuLXNuaXRrZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Atlanta Braves: ""Great to have"" Jesse Chavez back for postseason",Next.

Along with that the Joey McGuire era is underway as Texas Tech hosted Murray State in the home opener Saturday night at Jones AT&T Stadium.

Thanks to a revamped offense orchestrated by former Frenship standout Zach Kittley the Red Raiders ensured their first-year head coach rang in his tenure with a 63-10 victory.

The start didn’t seem ideal as the offense started from its own 5-yard line after a miscue on a punt return saw Adrian Frye collect the ball near the end zone before maneuvering his way out of danger.

First play in the Red Raiders executed a flea-flicker to get the crowd razzed up and continued that momentum as Tyler Shough completed a 45-yard touchdown pass to Loic Fouonji putting Texas Tech up 7-0 at the 10:34 mark of the first quarter.

The only downside was that Shough left the game at the end of the first quarter.

Late in the first quarter Shough kept the ball for 17 yards on a designed run and was brought down by Jaylon Bolden a 208-pound safety. Shough stayed in through the end of the quarter but put a hand to his left shoulder a few times at the end of plays.

Five plays after he landed hard on his left shoulder the same one in which he suffered a season-ending injury last year. He was replaced by Donovan Smith a former Frenship standout who was named the Offensive MVP of the Liberty Bowl last season.

Smith kept things humming as he orchestrated the offense to 28 points ensuring the Red Raiders finished with scores on all six of their first-half possessions.

Shough returned to the game sporting a sling on his left arm along with shorts a red T-shirt and a cap.

Smith ended the night going 14-for-16 for 221 yards and four touchdowns before Behren Morton was called in to get some reps at the quarterback spot.

The top wideout was Jerand Bradley who made six catches for 108 yards and two touchdowns. Loic Fouonji chipped in 77 yards and two scores on four catches.

Tahj Brooks led the tailbacks with six carries for 50 yards and three touchdowns.

Quick hits

— Texas Tech scored on its first eight possessions before having to punt.

— On the two punts Austin McNamara did a magnificent job by pinning the Racers inside the 20 on both occasions and averaged 38.5 yards per kick.

— With less than 12 minutes to play in the fourth quarter here’s a look at the Texas Tech defensive lineup: DE Isaac Smith DT Blake Burris DT Dooda Banks DE Harvey Dyson. LB Tyrique Matthews LB Dimitri Moore. CB Kobee Minor nickel Tyler Owens FS Joseph Plunk S Jett Whitfield CB Jalon Peoples.

— Behren Morton the third quarterback to see playing time in Saturday’s contest threw his first touchdown pass by finding Mason Tharp for a 21-yard connection down the seam.

Shough hit Loic Fouonji for the first touchdown of the season before letting running back Tahj Brooks do his thing for another 6. But Shough's hot start flamed out before the end of the 1st quarter.

During a quarterback draw Shough pulled away from the pocket and darted toward the Racers' sideline. Instead of sliding to his knees he was brought down hard by Murray State tacklers. While it's unclear if this specific play caused Shough's injury a couple of miffed passes later in the drive lend credence to that theory.

As of the publication of this story the extent of Shough's injury is unknown. It's possible we'll hear more during the post-game press conference.

Donovan Smith took over for Shough in the 2nd quarter. Smith led the Red Raiders through several games in 2021 after Shough missed the final eight games of that season following a broken collar bone. In 2021 Smith secured the Red Raiders' 6th win of the season against Iowa State plus a Liberty Bowl win over Mississippi State. He opened the 2nd quarter against Murray State with a 30-yard touchdown pass to Jerand Bradley. On his second drive of the game Smith led a one-play touchdown drive with a 39-yard touchdown pass to Fouonji his second of the game.

Murrow award among the most prestigious honors in journalism. KQED’s investigation of COVID-19 outbreaks at Foster Farms originally broadcast last fall won best news documentary in the large market radio category. Here's a full list of the 2022 winners.

In 2020 California’s Foster Farms became the site of one of the nation’s deadliest COVID-19 outbreaks at a meat or poultry plant. The California Report’s Central Valley reporter Alex Hall spent a year and a half talking to spouses and family members of workers who spent decades at the company’s chicken-processing plants. She found that hundreds of Foster Farms workers tested positive for the virus in 2020. Sixteen people died and at least 20 others were hospitalized.

Hall’s investigation showed that as plants stayed open to maintain the food supply and workers got sick from COVID-19 or even died Foster Farms didn’t always give a complete picture of the problem to health officials state regulators or their own employees. She introduced listeners to families who lost loved ones who worked at Foster Farms — families who are grieving struggling financially and trying to make sense of what happened.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXdzbGV0dGVycy8yMDIyLTA5LTAyL3N1cHBseS1jaGFpbi1sYXRlc3QtZm9vZC1jcmlzaXMtYXZlcnRlZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Supply Chain Latest: Food Crisis Averted,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.bloomberg.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/newsletters/2022-09-02/supply-chain-latest-food-crisis-averted (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000167127FBF70>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXdzbGV0dGVycy8yMDIyLTA5LTAyL3N1cHBseS1jaGFpbi1sYXRlc3QtZm9vZC1jcmlzaXMtYXZlcnRlZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvYnJpdGlzaC1wb3VuZC1zZWVuLXRyYWRpbmctbmVhci1wYXJpdHktd2l0aC10aGUtZG9sbGFyLWVjb25vbWlzdHMtc2F5LWFzLXNlbGxvZmYtdGFrZXMtd2FsbC1zdHJlZXQtYnktc3VycHJpc2UtMTE2NjIxNDIxMDLSAaABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0d2F0Y2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9icml0aXNoLXBvdW5kLXNlZW4tdHJhZGluZy1uZWFyLXBhcml0eS13aXRoLXRoZS1kb2xsYXItZWNvbm9taXN0cy1zYXktYXMtc2VsbG9mZi10YWtlcy13YWxsLXN0cmVldC1ieS1zdXJwcmlzZS0xMTY2MjE0MjEwMg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,British pound seen trading near parity with the dollar economists say as selloff takes Wall Street by surprise,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/british-pound-seen-trading-near-parity-with-the-dollar-economists-say-as-selloff-takes-wall-street-by-surprise-11662142102 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvYnJpdGlzaC1wb3VuZC1zZWVuLXRyYWRpbmctbmVhci1wYXJpdHktd2l0aC10aGUtZG9sbGFyLWVjb25vbWlzdHMtc2F5LWFzLXNlbGxvZmYtdGFrZXMtd2FsbC1zdHJlZXQtYnktc3VycHJpc2UtMTE2NjIxNDIxMDLSAaABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0d2F0Y2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9icml0aXNoLXBvdW5kLXNlZW4tdHJhZGluZy1uZWFyLXBhcml0eS13aXRoLXRoZS1kb2xsYXItZWNvbm9taXN0cy1zYXktYXMtc2VsbG9mZi10YWtlcy13YWxsLXN0cmVldC1ieS1zdXJwcmlzZS0xMTY2MjE0MjEwMg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Before you sign up for a new credit card it can help to compare a few major issuers and their unique card offerings rewards structures and regular benefits and perks. One major comparison to take a look at is Chase Bank vs. Bank of America mostly because both of these issuers offer popular rewards credit cards that can help you score flexible rewards for each dollar you spend.

Maybe you already have a couple of credit cards in mind or maybe you want to do a basic comparison of all the cash back and travel credit cards each issuer offers. Either way this guide will help you decide between two banking giants — Chase Bank vs. Bank of America — before you sign up for your next credit card.

Bank of America overview

Bank of America has more than 4000 retail financial centers nationwide and roughly 16000 ATMs. Currently this card issuer also boasts 19 different credit cards which include rewards credit cards co-branded airline credit cards secured credit cards student credit cards and more.

Credit card features

If you’re wondering about the features you’ll get with a Bank of America credit card it really depends on the unique card offer you sign up for. Some cards offer cash back or welcome bonuses while others offer lower ongoing interest rates an introductory APR offer or credit-building tools.

However premium credit cards from Bank of America are likely to come with even more perks. For example the Bank of America® Premium Rewards® credit card comes with up to $100 in airline incidental credits annually up to a $100 credit for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck access to the Visa Signature Luxury Hotel Collection trip delay insurance trip cancellation/interruption coverage baggage delay insurance a lost luggage reimbursement an auto rental collision damage waiver and emergency evacuation and transportation coverage. This card also comes with extended warranty coverage purchase protection and return protection.

Approval odds and restrictions

Since Bank of America offers secured credit cards for bad credit this bank is likely a better option than Chase if you need to build credit or repair your credit.

It’s also worth noting that Bank of America lets you check for prequalified credit card offers on the website without a hard inquiry on your credit report. This feature lets you enter basic information to find out which Bank of America cards you might be eligible for. However there’s no guarantee you will ultimately be approved.

When it comes to getting approved for a Bank of America credit card note that restrictions may apply. For example you may face a 24-month rule — which says you cannot be approved if you have had the same card product within the last two years — for specific card offerings. Bank of America also reportedly has a 2/3/4 rule which may limit you to two Bank of America credit cards in a 30-day period three cards in a 12-month period and four cards in a 24-month period.

Mobile banking

If you’re looking for a credit card that lets you track your purchases payments and rewards with your mobile device you should know that Bank of America has an award-winning digital banking platform that is currently accessed by 55 million mobile users. With the Bank of America mobile app you’ll be able to customize your dashboard access your FICO score transfer money pay bills deposit checks and more. You’ll also have the benefit of fingerprint sign-in which can ward off hackers and thieves. Other security features you can access with the app include alerts for suspicious activity and zero fraud liability.

Chase Bank overview

Chase has more than 4700 banking locations nationwide as well as more than 16000 ATMs. It also boasts 36 different credit cards which include rewards credit cards student credit cards co-branded airline and hotel credit cards Disney credit cards Amazon credit cards and business credit cards.

Credit card features

Cash back credit cards from Chase typically include welcome offers extended warranty coverage purchase protection trip cancellation/interruption insurance an auto rental collision damage waiver and travel and emergency assistance services. Other benefits may include cellphone protection or exclusive merchant promotions.

Meanwhile some of the best travel credit cards from Chase come with benefits like 1:1 points transfers to airline and hotel partners no foreign transaction fees trip cancellation/interruption insurance baggage delay insurance or a lost luggage reimbursement an auto rental collision damage waiver a trip delay reimbursement and emergency travel assistance or evacuation coverage. The Chase Sapphire Reserve® a premium travel credit card also comes with airport lounge access an up to $300 annual travel credit and an up to $100 credit for Global Entry TSA Precheck or NEXUS among many other benefits.

Approval odds and restrictions

Chase does not offer any credit cards for consumers with poor credit. In fact all Chase credit cards are geared toward consumers with good to excellent credit.

Chase also limits new credit card welcome bonuses and approvals within specific card families. For example both Chase Sapphire cards — which include the Chase Sapphire Reserve and the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card — have the following wording in their fine print: “This product is available to you if you do not have any Sapphire card and have not received a new cardmember bonus for any Sapphire card in the past 48 months.”

In addition before you apply for a new credit card from Chase you should know about Chase’s 5/24 rule. This rule states that you cannot get approved for a Chase credit card if you have opened five or more cards — from any issuer — within the past 24 months.

Mobile banking

Like Bank of America Chase also offers a very versatile mobile app. The app lets you keep track of your credit card purchases make payments and track your rewards using your mobile device. Chase banking customers can also benefit from perks like mobile check deposit online bill pay and more. The Chase mobile app also supports fingerprint sign-in and facial recognition and you can use the app to lock and unlock your credit card if it has been lost or stolen.

Chase vs. Bank of America: Rewards programs

When comparing Chase vs. Bank of America you’ll also want to learn about each issuer’s rewards program and determine which type of rewards you want to earn.

Bank of America rewards program

Redemption options

Bank of America credit cards come with a number of potential redemption options. For example depending on the card you have you may be able to redeem your rewards for statement credits gift cards deposits to an eligible Bank of America or Merrill account or Bank of America Travel Center purchases.

In some cases such as with the Bank of America® Travel Rewards credit card you can redeem your Bank of America travel rewards points for statement credits to cover a wide range of travel and dining purchases including flights hotel stays campgrounds boat rentals public transit tourist attractions restaurants takeout bars nightclubs and many others.

Additionally note that Bank of America travel cards currently don’t offer the option to transfer points to airline and hotel programs.

Bank of America Preferred Rewards

Although the Bank of America Preferred Rewards program isn’t strictly a credit card rewards program it does help Bank of America customers earn 25 percent to 75 percent more rewards for each dollar they spend on their cards.

To qualify for this program you must have an eligible Bank of America checking account and a three-month combined average daily balance of $20000 or more in qualifying Bank of America or Merrill accounts.

The minimum balance qualifications and rewards bonuses for each program tier are:

Tier Gold Platinum Platinum Honors Minimum balance $20000 $50000 $100000 Rewards bonus 25% 50% 75%

The rewards bonus you’ll receive can make a substantial difference. For example the Bank of America Premium Rewards card normally offers 2X points on travel and dining purchases and 1.5X points on all other purchases. However Platinum Honors members with this card earn 3.5X points on travel and dining purchases and 2.62X points on all other purchases.

Chase Ultimate Rewards program

Redemption options

Many top Chase credit cards earn rewards in the Chase Ultimate Rewards program including their cash back cards and travel cards. In most cases Chase Ultimate Rewards points can be redeemed for cash back direct deposits statement credits gift cards merchandise travel shopping at Amazon or via PayPal Apple products and Chase dining or experiences. If you have a premium travel credit card from Chase such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred or the Chase Sapphire Reserve you can even transfer your points to Chase travel partners at a 1:1 ratio.

Chase travel partners and rewards

Although Bank of America offers some pretty nice incentives to customers who keep at least $20000 in eligible accounts Chase really stands out in terms of its travel rewards program. For example some Chase cards provide more value for your points when you redeem them for travel. Specifically the Chase Sapphire Reserve offers a 50 percent points boost when you redeem your points for travel through Chase Ultimate Rewards and the Chase Sapphire Preferred and Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card offer a 25 percent points boost for travel redemptions through Chase Ultimate Rewards.

Chase also partners with the following hotel and airline programs:

Airline partners

Aer Lingus AerClub

Air Canada Aeroplan

British Airways Executive Club

Emirates Skywards

Air France / KLM Flying Blue

Iberia Plus

JetBlue TrueBlue

Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer

Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards

United MileagePlus

Virgin Atlantic Flying Club

Hotel partners

IHG Rewards Club

Marriott Bonvoy

World of Hyatt

The bottom line

At the end of the day both Chase and Bank of America have some pretty intriguing credit card offers. However Chase really stands out in terms of its travel credit cards and redemption options for rewards while Bank of America is much more attractive if you’re a Bank of America Preferred Rewards customer or if you need to build or rebuild your credit.

If neither issuer seems like a good fit for you there are other top card issuers to consider as well. If you want the best rewards credit card for your needs and goals make sure you also consider options from American Express Capital One Citi Discover and Wells Fargo.

Biden Jr. a candidate for president said the refusal by ride-hailing companies to treat their drivers as employees “deprives these workers of legally mandated benefits and protections.”

Labor activists like Ms. Moore who runs an advocacy group in California called Rideshare Drivers United hoped that Mr. Biden as president would spearhead a flurry of activity aimed at forcing companies in the gig economy like Uber Lyft and DoorDash to classify drivers as employees rather than independent contractors. Such a change would mean paying the drivers a minimum wage giving them benefits and making them eligible to unionize.

Instead a year and a half into Mr. Biden’s presidency little has been done at the federal level to address independent contractors. Enforcement of existing labor laws has not been notably beefed up. And the president’s nominee to lead the Labor Department’s enforcement division was voted down by the Senate including by several Democrats.

ADVERTISEMENT

Uber was born out of the frustration of two US entrepreneurs trying to catch a cab in Paris.

Fast-forward more than a decade later and the ride-hailing giant is making waves once again in the French capital – this time wooing the taxi drivers whose service it once bemoaned.

""We are looking at integrating taxis into the Uber application in Paris” Uber told Euronews Next.

“We are willing to co-construct with the sector a product that meets taxis’ expectations and Parisians’ mobility needs"".

The company is not just doing so in Paris. In recent months Uber has been striking deals with taxi companies around the world to enlist them on its platform as it seeks to widen its pool of drivers and reduce waiting times for users.

Deals are already in place in Germany Austria Spain Greece Italy Turkey and more recently in Brussels.

It’s now taking on Paris which may well be the hardest European city to conquer.

I think Uber did not behave well and a big part of the fleet hasn’t forgotten that. The wound hasn’t healed yet Mouhssine Berrada Paris taxi union leader

“Nobody can forget what happened in 2014-2015 and the monumental blow that UberPop dealt to the French taxi market” Mouhssine Berrada who leads the Paris branch of France’s National Taxi Union told Euronews Next.

UberPop was a service that relied on drivers without commercial licences – essentially anyone with a car looking to earn extra income by picking up passengers through the app – that was attacked from all sides by taxi associations and blocked by several European countries.

In France the service was eventually scrapped in 2015 but the national rules covering the way Uber operates particularly regarding how drivers acquire a professional driver’s licence were eased.

A key grievance taxis have against private hire services is that their drivers do not have to purchase or rent a costly licence to start picking up clients and that this amounts to unfair competition.

Berrada said one more of his colleagues had recently committed suicide over the debt she had racked up to repay her €240000 taxi licence.

“I think Uber did not behave well and a big part of the fleet hasn’t forgotten that” Berrada said. “The wound hasn’t healed yet”.

Uber is well aware of the hard feelings.

A company spokesperson said while these are understandable over 200 taxi drivers have already joined the platform in Paris and globally tens of thousands have.

When we look at the next five years we just don't see a world in which taxis and Uber exist separately Andrew Macdonald Senior Vice President of Mobility Uber

The company is facing a shortage of drivers in a number of cities around the world to absorb a post-pandemic jump in demand for rides – as locals return to a more social life and international tourists make a comeback.

The company argues that adding taxi drivers to its app will create a bigger pool of drivers and reduce waiting times while taxi drivers would have more opportunities to find clients when they aren’t picking up much business at taxi ranks or being hailed from the street.

Uber has even set out a target to get every taxi driver around the world on the platform by 2025.

It’s been scoring big wins. In March Uber announced it would list New York City's iconic yellow cabs. The app has also integrated taxis in Colombia South Korea and Hong Kong.

""When we look at the next five years we just don't see a world in which taxis and Uber exist separately. There's too much to gain for both sides"" Andrew Macdonald Uber's senior vice president of mobility said at the time.

In May when the platform struck a deal with IT Taxi the largest taxi dispatch service in Italy Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi called it “a truly historic deal” adding: “We strongly believe taxis and Uber are better together”.

Uber’s sweeteners

But in France many taxi drivers are suspicious of Uber’s plans – and are not thrilled at the idea of Uber taking a slice of their earnings.

Berrada the taxi union leader said Uber offered taxi drivers “one to two months” free of charge to join its platform before a commission kicks in on the rides booked through the app.

Uber wouldn’t comment on specific sweeteners in its deals and said its financial models vary country by country. In some places it’s a flat fee of around €2.50 that Uber charges the taxi driver for each ride booked through the app.

In others Uber takes a variable commission. In Spain where Uber also recently started listing taxi drivers the platform takes a 12 per cent commission on each ride – which is lower than the 20-25 per cent commission an UberX driver pays.

Treading carefully

The company stresses it never imposes any exclusivity on those looking to join the platform and that drivers remain entirely free to be listed on other ride-hailing or dispatching apps.

It emphasises it offers sick leave and other benefits but also guarantees drivers will always remain independent contractors and enjoy their flexibility.

“What we hear from taxi drivers now working on the Uber platform is it’s beneficial – they access more customers better utilise their time. They still have exclusive access to rank and hail but they have an additional source of revenue” said the company spokesperson.

So far back in France Uber has only approached taxi drivers in the capital.

It’s a key market to court. The 20000 taxis in Paris account for a third of the country’s total fleet.

“If they manage to conquer Paris they’ll have conquered France” Berrada said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NvdXJ0cy8yMDIyLzA5LzAyL3ViZXItZHJpdmVyLXdoby1mbGVkLXRyaWFsLWlzLWNvbnZpY3RlZC1vZi1zZXh1YWwtYXNzYXVsdC1mb3VuZC1hdC1mb3J0LXdvcnRoLXN0b2NreWFyZHMv0gGaAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvY291cnRzLzIwMjIvMDkvMDIvdWJlci1kcml2ZXItd2hvLWZsZWQtdHJpYWwtaXMtY29udmljdGVkLW9mLXNleHVhbC1hc3NhdWx0LWZvdW5kLWF0LWZvcnQtd29ydGgtc3RvY2t5YXJkcy8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fort Worth Uber driver convicted of sexual assault flees midtrial,"An Uber driver who fled during his trial has been found after being convicted of sexually assaulting a woman who used the ride-hailing service in June 2020 the Tarrant County district attorney’s office said.

ORLANDO—Behind the Chair (BTC) a go-to media platform for salon professionals across the world hosted The BTC Show earlier this month in Orlando. The annual hair-centered bash—which was themed “Make Believe” this year—is a place for hairdressers and salon owners alike to “find their people” learn from celebrity stylists in the field and return home inspired.

Programming took place Aug. 13-16 at the Orlando World Center Marriott and included pool parties and educational sessions courtesy of Redeken Ulta Beauty L’Oreal Professional and Moroccan Oil (just to name a few). Also on the schedule? Sunset soirees networking opportunities and activations from dozens of brands—three of which were produced by Los Angeles-based Gladiator Productions.

BizBash caught up with the event production company’s founder and chief creative officer Seth Dolan to gain insight on activating three times at the same event and how to manage the seemingly daunting task as well as manage stress levels and more.

When it came to delegating tasks Dolan said that he “funneled everything for BTC through a core team but assigned producers to each individual project so they got plenty of focus for the client” adding that this strategy also helped Gladiator’s team “manage the various assets.”

The result? “Three uniquely distinct activations” Dolan said.

Keep scrolling for a closer inside look at each one.

As Dolan pointed out activations are all about “focusing on the client story above all.” He and his team did just that when it came to FEKKAI’s booth which boasted testers and a portable sink a plant wall photo op and a “Spin To Win” game where the 3000 eventgoers in attendance could walk away with a full-size product.

Dolan said of the brand’s interesting background: “FEKKAI is the namesake brand of Federic Fekkai the famed hair stylist. He previously sold his brand and then bought it back to make it 100% clean with performance that matches any ‘non-clean’ product.”

The activation played on FEKKAI’s story from the moment guests entered the booth. On the left-hand side a wall read “What’s in the bottle?” and informed attendees about what sets the brand apart. The product stations also boasted facts about FEKKAI’s clean styling products and a photo moment made sure to nod to the motif with neon signage that said “You don’t have to be dirty to be clean.”

Aside from the cheeky quote Dolan noted that the plant wall “was 100% real plants [that were] sustainably sourced” and although “we’ve all seen plant walls 100 times that felt super special.” And after being misted daily on-site throughout the four-day trade show “they were returned to their soil homes in a greenhouse.”

Schwarzkopf Professional

When it came to building out an activation for Schwarzkopf Dolan noted the importance of capturing the brand’s “massive heritage” while also being “always on the pulse.” Photo: Courtesy of Gladiator Productions

“Blonde is so in right now in the professional world and Schwarzkopf was launching new Level 10 toners” Dolan said. (For non-industry members toners dictate how deep or light the blonde coloring is with 10 “creating a nice icy blonde tone in the hair” he explained.) Naturally Gladiator ran with the “icy” concept and produced a booth alongside the venue’s pool complete with an ice bar and “luge in the shape of the product” plus “snow machines and cocktails which made it super fun” Dolan added.

Schwarzkopf even activated during BTC’s pool party and as Dolan pointed out the ice bar was the perfect accompaniment to the 98-degree heat in Orlando that day. On the flip side producing an ice-clad experience in August made for the biggest challenge Gladiator faced throughout BTC according to Dolan who also noted that the payoff was worth it.

Alterna

Alterna’s activation also took place during the pool party and what else do sun-soaked eventgoers need other than something to cool off? Hydration!

“Everything in the experience was to invoke hydration” Dolan explained of the booth which evoked feelings of a cabana and offered product samples. And the design focused specifically on products from the brand’s “Caviar Anti-Aging line that infuses moisture into the hair” with moments that the chief creative officer described as “edutainment.”

Standout elements included “a massive branded water wall and free boxed water that kept everyone hydrated” especially “while drinking cocktails from Schwarzkopf” Dolan said. Photo: Courtesy of Gladiator Productions Photo: Courtesy of Gladiator Productions

So what’s the ultimate key to pulling off three activations at one event? Organization. “We have to keep everything super organized” Dolan said. And to prevent his team from getting overwhelmed “everyone at Gladiator had visibility to what each team was doing at each time [plus] had very clear assignments and division of responsibilities.”

At the end of such an event production extravaganza Dolan noted the importance of “pausing to celebrate each day and saying ‘well done’ and ‘thank you’ to everyone.” Unfortunately “that’s hardly done frequently in our business because it’s so go go go” he added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVyaWNoZXN0LmNvbS9yaWNoLXBvd2VyZnVsL3RoZS1rYXJkYXNoaWFuLWplbm5lci1mYW1pbHktc3Vycm91bmRlZC1ieS10aGUtcGFwYXJhenppLWF0LWt5bGllLWNvc21ldGljcy1sYS1sYXVuY2gtZXZlbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Kardashian-Jenner Family Surrounded By The Paparazzi At Kylie Cosmetics LA Launch Event,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.therichest.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /rich-powerful/the-kardashian-jenner-family-surrounded-by-the-paparazzi-at-kylie-cosmetics-la-launch-event/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016712B8AE00>, 'Connection to www.therichest.com timed out.

A United jet hit another plane when two inexperienced workers were moving the aircraft per The WSJ.

The ramp workers miscalculated the gap between the planes a union leader told The Journal.

Airlines are hiring workers to fill the staff shortage but many lack experience the report said.

The wing of a United Airline plane collided with another one of the company's aircraft after inexperienced ramp workers misjudged the distance between the jets according to a report by The Wall Street Journal.

Michael Klemm head of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAMAW) which represents ramp workers at United told The Journal the incident happened in June at Newark Liberty International Airport.

The ramp workers were operating a tow tug to push back the United plane but one of the winglets — the vertical part at the end of a wing — clipped another jet's horizontal stabilizer on the tail he told the newspaper.

The plane that was struck was parked at a nearby gate Klemm added.

The two ramp workers moving the plane lacked experience in the job he told The Journal. ""They made a mistake but it's not a situation they should have been in alone.""

A spokesperson for United told the publication it had now updated the process of scheduling shifts to ensure that newly hired workers are supported after training and have experienced employees overseeing them. The airline has also given supervisors more details about workers' experience.

United and the IAMAW didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment made outside of US office hours.

It comes at a time when the airline industry is scrambling to recruit more workers to fill the gaps in a depleted workforce after letting many go during pandemic. This has resulted in some hires lacking sufficient experience.

Airline executives and union officials have said new staff members aren't as good as those who left during the pandemic The Journal reported. They said some processes including boarding passengers sorting luggage and customer service have become less straightforward in recent months it added.

Staffing issues hav led to passengers suffering flight cancellations and delays lost luggage being stranded in airports after crews timed out and being booked on different flights home.

Commercial airplanes are still not required to install an added barrier that experts agree will help keep terrorists hijackers and other attackers out of the cockpits.

“The threat and vulnerability remains that we can repeat a September 11th today” Ellen Saracini widow of Capt. Victor Saracini a pilot of doomed United Flight 175 told The Post. He was 51 a father of two girls.

The hijackers sent by Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden brought down four planes on 9/11 two crashing into the World Trade Center one into the Pentagon and one onto a field in Shanksville Pa after brave passengers fought to wrest control before it could reach the White House or US Capitol.

The terrorists did their homework.

8 The secondary barrier looking into the cockpit door space which is installed in many United Airlines planes and the one they used in the study.

“The best time to storm the cockpit would be about 10 to 15 minutes after takeoff when the cockpit doors typically opened for the first time” the 9/11 Commission found.

Other than knives they used to kill 9/11 ringleader Mohamad Atta “did not believe they would need any other weapons. He was confident the cockpit doors would be opened and did not consider breaking them down” the report said.

While cockpit doors are required to stay closed and locked during flight pilots step outside to use the restroom let flight attendants bring in food or switch crews for rest purposes.

After 9/11 Congress mandated airlines to fortify cockpit doors making them virtually impenetrable.

8 Saracini was 51 when he was killed on 9/11. PA Images via Getty Images

But that protection is lost when the doors open. “The flight deck is vulnerable” the Federal Aviation Commission warned in a 2015 advisory.

The solution? Flight attendants are expected to wheel a food or beverage cart in front of the cockpit door and stand by until the door shuts.

“It’s an absurd practice to have flight attendants use their own bodies as the barrier between the cockpit and the cabin” Sara Nelson international president of the Association of Flight Attendants testified to Congress last December.

Since 9/11 the Air Line Pilots Association has called for the mandatory installation of “secondary barriers” — lightweight wire mesh gates several feet outside the cockpit that lock in place before the cockpit door opens and lift after the door shuts.

A video produced by airline employees and shared with Saracini shows the cockpit without a secondary barrier can be stormed in three seconds or less by one or more intruders waiting to pounce — even with a food cart in the way. FAA tests have confirmed the findings.

Two airlines United and Northwest which merged with Delta in 2008 have voluntarily installed lightweight wire barriers costing about $5000 each on “hundreds” of aircraft the pilots union says.

Roughly 5800 jetliners operate in the US.

Meanwhile legislation to mandate secondary barriers fell into a “bureaucratic black hole” the pilots say.

In 2018 – 17 years after 9/11 — Congress finally approved a measure to require secondary barriers but on newly built planes only not existing aircraft.

The FAA was supposed to adopt the limited requirement in 2019 but skipped the deadline. It took the FAA until this past July 27 – another three years – to propose the requirement of secondary barriers on new planes. But after a 60-day public comment period and possibly months more to put out the final rule it will not take effect for two more years – in 2025.

8 “The threats are increasing quicker than we can do the protections” said former FAA agent Brian Sullivan. David McGlynn

Saracini charges the agency has bowed to airline industry pressure.

“The airlines don’t want it and the FAA doesn’t push for it” she said. “They thwart the will of Congress. They don’t care. There’s no regulatory agency that is making the FAA do this.”

The FAA declined to comment but officials said they must follow the “Administrative Procedures Act” which governs how federal agencies develop and issue regulations a slow and tedious process.

8 Mary Schiavo said the holdup to more permanent barriers has to do with money.

Meanwhile thousands of planes currently fly unprotected.

In March 2021 Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick R-Pa and other Congress members sponsored the Saracini Enhanced Aviation Safety Act to require secondary cockpit barriers on all existing passenger aircraft not just new ones. The bill is languishing in committee.

The barriers remain the only 9/11 Commission Report recommendation still not carried out.

An old idea cockpit barriers came up even before 9/11 said Mary Schiavo who was inspector general of the US Transportation Department in the ’90s.

“The issue came up many times but there was always such fierce resistance from the airline industry that proposals really never got anywhere” she said.

The holdup? “Money” she said.

After 9/11 Schiavo and fellow aviation lawyers sued the airlines for negligence — citing the lack of cockpit barriers among other safety failures. The suits reaped more than $500 million in settlements for the families of those killed in the planes.

A 46-page FAA study said the secondary barriers on new planes would cost a one-time $9 million in engineering $35000 per aircraft to install plus training and other minor expenses.

The FAA is finally acting Schiavo believes because it expects another terrorist attack on aircraft in the near future.

8 Saracini left behind his wife and two daughters.

“If they’re putting this forward now I suspect they have enough reason to do so. My guess is they have new intelligence” she said.

“So the threat is real and it’s necessary” she said of the barriers.

Brian Sullivan a former FAA special agent agreed citing possible retaliation for six recent US drone strikes against Al-Shabaab al Qaeda’s branch in East Africa and one in Afghanistan that killed 9/11 mastermind Ayman al-Zawahiri. In other alerts author Salman Rushdie’s stabbing in upstate New York and Iranian plots to assassinate Mike Pompeo and John Bolton.

“The threats are increasing quicker than we can do the protections” said Sullivan who also noted several attempts in the past year to storm cockpits.

Last September it took six or seven crew members to restrain a passenger who went berserk yelling “Allah” on a JetBlue flight from Boston to Puerto Rico when he saw the cockpit door being opened by a pilot. In February an American Airlines flight attendant en route from LA to Washington D.C. bashed an “unruly passenger” on the head with a coffee pot while subduing him with other customers.

Saracini fears more passengers and crew will die and says she won’t stop her safety campaign until every commercial plane has a secondary cockpit barrier.

“I can’t look at another family member in the eye and say ‘Sorry I knew there was a vulnerability and didn’t do anything about it.’”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzZnVuZHMuY29tL3Jlc291cmNlL2ZlZC1hZ2dyZXNzaW9uLWFuZC11cGNvbWluZy1taWR0ZXJtLWVsZWN0aW9ucy1hZGQtdG8tc2VwdGVtYmVyLWppdHRlcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fed Aggression and Upcoming Midterm Elections Add to September Jitters,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.usfunds.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /resource/fed-aggression-and-upcoming-midterm-elections-add-to-september-jitters/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016710FCD420>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzZnVuZHMuY29tL3Jlc291cmNlL2ZlZC1hZ2dyZXNzaW9uLWFuZC11cGNvbWluZy1taWR0ZXJtLWVsZWN0aW9ucy1hZGQtdG8tc2VwdGVtYmVyLWppdHRlcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,

In this urgent panel episode we speak with Zakk Gabriela and Steve three UPS package deliverers and members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters about the serious dangers of working in the heat and the fight they and their union are waging to ensure better protections for workers.

“As blistering heat waves swept across the United States this summer breaking temperature records and placing millions under heat advisories and warnings” Livia Albeck-Ripka writes at The New York Times ​“workers… have continued to deliver America’s packages for a variety of carriers often in trucks that have no cooling mechanisms for drivers. Some UPS workers have shared photographs that show thermometer readings of up to 150 degrees in the backs of their trucks.” A shocking number of package deliverers and letter carriers — to say nothing of farm workers construction workers warehouse workers etc. — have reported heat-related injuries and illnesses and some have even died on the job from heat exposure.

Automated voice: You have one new message.

Speaker: Hello I’m 69 and a human being. I’m male and my name is irrelevant. I am a US citizen. I’ve been around the block so many times that my tires are bald. I only know these independent news sites such as The Real News Network because of Chris Hedges. One day I hope to have the courage he has. He’s my favorite other than my wife. I formidably advocate the Railroaders. It is imperative that you take a stand. The minority cabal of profligates won’t stop until they have it all just like Mary Trump’s description of Donald: too much and never enough. The cabal doesn’t care about you. They don’t care. You must be brave and take a stand. They don’t care about you.

[INTRO MUSIC PLAYS]

Gabriela: Hello I’m Gabriela a UPS Teamster of eight and a half years. I was in package for five years delivering out of small package delivery trucks. And I was a part-timer for three and a half years. Very involved in my union in rank and file action and rank and file education. And yeah thanks for having me.

Zakk: Hi I am Zakk and I am speaking from the hunting grounds the trade exchange point and migration route for the Apache Comanche Kiowa and Osage Nations as well as the traditional home the Caddo Nation and Wichita tribes. Today 39 tribal nations dwell in the state of Oklahoma as the result of settler and colonial policies that were designed to assimilate Native people. And I bring all that up because I want to acknowledge honor and respect the diverse peoples who have formed my understanding of solidarity mutual aid what they look like and how we embody those values in the midst of struggle. So I’ve been at UPS as a Teamster for about five years. I’m a second generation Teamster out of local 886 in Oklahoma City.

Steve: Hey I’m Steve. I’m a local Teamster out of the Mid-Atlantic. I’ve been a Teamster for about just under nine years. First union job. I just got into more union stuff after the last contract that was forced upon UPS and now I’m here.

Maximillian Alvarez: All right well welcome everyone to another episode of Working People a podcast about the lives jobs dreams and struggles of the working class today. Brought to you in partnership with In These Times magazine and The Real News Network produced by Jules Taylor and made possible by the support of listeners like you.

So as y’all heard we’ve got a very special and frankly quite urgent panel today. And I’m really honored to be joined by Steve Gabriela and Zakk three Teamsters who have worked for collectively many years in package delivery for UPS.

And this is an episode that we’ve been wanting to do all summer. And folks have been asking us to record an episode on this because we’ve all been hearing the reports about heat and the unbearable working conditions that folks like Steve Gabriela and Zakk have been going through. Package carriers letter carriers across the board not just at UPS but folks are really really going through it as the climate crisis gets worse as the heat waves get hotter. There was just a new goddamn report saying that the middle corridor most of the middle of the country is going to be experiencing heat of 130 degrees in the next 25 years.

And while that all sounds terrible we have to remember that folks are still working through all of that. As hot as it was this summer not just here in the US but I mean Jesus the entire global map was blistering red and orange for most of the summer in India and Pakistan in parts of Africa and the Caribbean South America it’s getting hot. And a lot of working people through no fault of their own are having to bear the brunt of that. Farm workers are absolutely boiling in the heat. Package deliverers like we said are driving around in these metal hot boxes that reach temperatures of 150 degrees in there and they’re expected to work with no air conditioning.

You guys remember a few episodes ago we spoke to a Dollar store worker in Louisiana Kenya Slaughter who revealed to us that they don’t even control the air conditioning in their own stores. So when they are suffering blistering heat waves and they’re sweating their asses off while trying to work at Dollar General with one or two people the air conditioning for that store is being controlled by corporate headquarters in another state. This is a real systemic problem that working people are dealing with across industries. And the way that we are headed right now with the climate crisis it is only going to get worse.

And so we wanted to convene this panel to talk about what workers are going through what folks out there listening need to understand about the working conditions that folks like Steve Gabriela and Zakk deal with on a day-to-day basis what can be done about it what is being done about it and what we can all do to help to ensure that workers are not subjected to inhumane working conditions that are dangerous and even deadly. People do die from this stuff. We’re not kidding around here. And just to really put a fine point on that I’m going to read a couple of passages from a piece that just came out this week at The New York Times. The New York Times is not always knocking it out of the park to put it nicely. But I mean I thought this –

Zakk: But it is the paper of record.

Maximillian Alvarez: It is the paper of record and I think it is significant that they did cover this. And I’m going to read from a piece that was written by Livia Albeck-Ripka titled ​“UPS drivers say brutal heat is endangering their lives”. Livia writes:

“As blistering heat waves swept across the United States this summer breaking temperature records and placing millions under heat advisories and warnings workers have continued to deliver America’s packages for a variety of carriers often in trucks that have no cooling mechanisms for drivers. Some UPS workers have shared photographs that show thermometer readings of up to 150 degrees in the backs of their trucks.

“Now a string of heat-related illnesses among the drivers has renewed calls to improve their working conditions. ​‘They’re vomiting. Their bodies are shutting down’ said Dave Reeves the president of local 767 a Texas local of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters which represents 350000 UPS workers across the country. He added ​‘It’s awful.’ Government records show that the problem is not isolated. Since 2015 at least 270 UPS and United States postal service drivers have been sickened and in many cases hospitalized from heat exposure. Dozens of workers for other delivery companies including FedEx have also suffered from heat exhaustion according to the records and a handful of drivers have also died in the past few years. According to the Teamsters heat-related injuries illnesses and deaths among drivers are severely under reported.”

So that’s what we’re here to talk about today. And again I could not be more grateful to Steve Gabriela and Zakk for being willing to come on and chat with us. Folks may recognize a familiar voice here because Zakk has actually been on the show before. And he was one of the amazing workers who submitted audio testimony during the first few months of COVID-19 when we did that big two-part six-hour compilation of testimonies from workers talking about what they were going through in that really horrible time when no one knew what was going on everyone was scared. So it’s a gift and I wanted to acknowledge up top that if you go back and listen to that and how scared we all were I think it’s worth stopping and recognizing and being grateful for hearing Zakk’s voice again knowing that life continues. And that I’m really really grateful that we’re all able to be here today to talk about this.

And I also want to make a disclaimer up top that we are all here to discuss this important issue. And I want everyone on this panel to feel comfortable and able to say their piece and not have to worry about anything else. And so I wanted to make it clear up top that everyone here is speaking as an individual worker. They’re speaking about what they have gone through. No one here is speaking as a representative or speaking for a larger membership. I think that what we’re going to talk about here is going to be recognizable to a lot of workers but I don’t want to give the false impression here that anyone here is speaking on behalf of the Teamsters or a specific local. We are speaking as fellow workers dealing with a real huge problem that we all need to acknowledge and address.

So in that vein enough from me enough table setting I wanted to start. Before we really start digging into that question of heat and the brutal working conditions that UPS drivers are enduring especially now in the summer I was wondering if we could go around the table and just familiarize or refamiliarize listeners with you all and get a bit of a snapshot of who you are and the kind of work that you’ve been doing at UPS. So on the normal show we like to really go deep into people’s back stories and how they came to be the people they are how they came to do the work they do. So maybe a condensed version of that just so we get to know the three of y’all a bit more. So can we talk a bit about you and how you got into this work and I guess what that work has entailed in your time at UPS?

Gabriela: My name’s Gabriela I live in the Southwestern part of the United States. And one thing about the Southwest is it’s very very hot. I think Max you touched on so many issues that I want to talk about like climate change the heated trucks how bad it gets in the back that this affects all workers that work outside. A little bit about me up front UPS worker for three and a half years. I spent five years in the summers of package cars delivering in that heat. It’s unbearable. I don’t know if I personally can’t handle it as well as other people can but just last year I was really considering just walking off. I couldn’t handle it anymore. Especially where I’m from it’s so dry and it’s so hot. Three years ago I bought a thermometer and I put it in the back of my truck and it maxes out at 127 degrees.

And the first day I used it it maxed out at 127. It was above 127. I had no idea how hot and I had to get a new one. Anyway but to my husband he’s a mail carrier. So we both work outside in the excruciating heat doing physical jobs.

But a little bit about me. My dad was a Teamster. He wasn’t a long-term Teamster but when I started at UPS he told me stick with it. He said that he wished he had. He actually unfortunately quit in 1997 right at the strike. When he first told me that story I thought oh my God dad did you scab? But no he said the strike happened and I don’t think he really understood what was going on. And he was like I guess I don’t have a job anymore. I was like cool. Yeah that’s the right move. If you’re not going to hang out with the picket line don’t cross it you might as well just get another job I guess.

So I’m technically a second generation Teamster. But anyway I come from a fairly non-union background. My dad’s in trucking and my mom did service work jobs. Both my parents had non-union jobs for the most part. And then when I started working UPS a truly union job and being represented by the Teamsters entirely changed my perspective entirely changed who I am in my core gave me a great sense of purpose in my life that we have the real ability to fight for working class people. And I think that that’s something I could never give up. I also literally could never work a non-union job because every time I have they fired me. So once you become union it’s impossible to go back. You just have too much dignity I think. But yeah no that’s a bit about me.

Zakk: All right this is Zakk. I guess it’s my turn. Before I came to UPS I worked in nonprofits. I worked in the nonprofit sector for about 10 years for Habitat for Humanity most recently in Cleveland county. And we were putting people in homes. Before that I ran the vocations program and education program called Start at the local homeless shelter here in Norman Oklahoma. And I loved that. Before that it was case managing homeless families and people who have to live out in this heat all the time. So that is part of my perspective. I went to UPS because a good union job meant stability and security for my family. I had my dad’s example to look at and how he took care of seven kids. And when I married into three kids and had two kids and adopted two kids and then had seven of my own having a union job made a whole lot of sense.

Although I loved what I was doing in the nonprofit world it turned out that I could make more money by delivering cardboard boxes and that’s what I needed to do. That’s what I needed to do for my family. They needed the insurance that my job provides. And so union work is not easy work it is hard work but working people we know how to work hard. Working class folks they know how to work hard. So when I started at UPS I was a part-timer in the building and loading trucks and I worked seven days a week. I worked five days at UPS Monday through Friday. And on Saturday and Sunday I worked at the inpatient psychiatric hospital in the nursing department and took care of people that way.

And when I had an opportunity to stand up as a steward and to help protect my coworkers at work I jumped on it. I get to listen to that inner voice. I get to follow that calling of protecting people and helping people and lifting people out of really bad circumstances. I get to do that at work every day and that is super super powerful. And you don’t get that in a non-union job. So I’m with Gaby I couldn’t go back.

Also we were applying for government contracts and funding and nonprofit stuff and that pie kept getting smaller and smaller and smaller. I think that when working people come together we can make the pie bigger for everybody. So that’s my perspective. I’ve been doing package delivery for about four years now but I carry all of that stuff with me when I show up to work every day. And so when I look at the transportation sector that I work in and I know that we are the leading source of global warming pollution it makes me wonder what I can do as an employee. It makes me wonder what I can do as a Teamster. It makes me wonder what I can do as a member of a community that doesn’t want my kids to burn up.

I mean it’s fucking hot and delivery trucks and tractor trailers are responsible for half of the nitrogen oxide emissions 60% of all the fine particulate bullshit that’s in the air that is cooking the planet. So I guess I approach work even something that seems as simple as I’m just a delivery boy I approach it through all of those lenses and I’m not the only one. Working people are smart. We have a lot of time to think.

Steve can tell you we drive around for 12 13 hours a day up until our Department of Transportation maximum because that’s where the company has us work a lot of times. We have a lot of time to think about these things and think about what a better world could look like what a better workplace could look like for all of us. And that’s why we’re here that’s why we’re on this podcast. And that’s why we’re talking to you. And so thanks for bringing us here.

Maximillian Alvarez: Hell yeah brother. And well just to say you’re triggering my anxiety now that I work at a nonprofit so thank you for that. Steve how about you man?

Steve: Yeah. So I’m Steve I’ve been package car delivering for about nine years now just under. This is the first union job I ever had. Before this I was in retail management. I was in recruiting and I finally got to join UPS and it was a weird path. I went straight into package car. A lot of people don’t do that. A lot of people go inside the building and I was a lucky member who went straight into delivering in 100 degree heat right away. But my journey is before UPS I didn’t know honestly what union work was. And it sounds weird my father has always been in business always been like CFO CEO stuff treasury everything like that.

And I knew of unions. I’ve heard the word but I never knew the type of work it was. I never knew how much protection you had with the union and how much they could actually be helpful for everyday people like us everyday working people. And like I said I’ve been with UPS nine years wouldn’t change that for the world. I love the people I work with. It’s literally when you get put in situations like we’ve been put in especially over the pandemic and everything you become closer to these people. You want to do better for these people. You want us to have a safe work environment. You want us to be able to come home every day and not worry about things like oh did I drink enough water? Even though I had a gallon of water at work today.

It’s touching on Zakk’s thing. We’re here because we want people to hear our thoughts and see where we’re coming from and that we are regular people but we do a very hard job and the union is here to protect us and we have to get the word out about that.

Maximillian Alvarez: Hell yeah. Well and let’s drill down on that because I think it’s one of those things that people know in the back of their heads but like climate change itself we try to not focus on as much as possible. I don’t know everyone has their different reasons. Maybe we just got too much shit we’re worrying about in our own lives. Maybe we don’t want to recognize our complicity in this and feel guilty about the workers who are delivering our packages while dripping sweat and staggering up to our doors. Capitalism is a brutal system that forces all of us to act out our own inhumanity.

So for whatever reason I think this has been an issue that a lot of us have pushed under the rug. What exactly workers like yourselves go through in brutal summer heat conditions like what we’ve been experiencing this year. And I can say speaking for myself I got my own crash course in that about 10 years ago. All my life in Southern California driving around Orange County driving from Orange County to LA County and back. There are these massive beige buildings festooning the freeways. If you’re driving up the 60 you’re driving up the five you just see these things all over the place. And as a kid I never really knew what was in those buildings. I just knew that they were there. They were part of the background. Then I ended up working at one of those and it was a warehouse and it was hot as shit. It was Southern California. There was no air conditioning in these massive warehouses. They’re made out of metal. So it’s like working in a microwave. You would actually go outside in the blistering heat to cool off.

And guess in that way for a small time I was part of the supply chain that you all are very much a part of and keep running because we would be tagging stacking wrapping and loading pallets onto trucks that would then ship off yada yada yada. Anyway the point being is that it was hot as shit in there. All of us were constantly dripping sweat. I did see people… We didn’t call it that but clearly suffering from heat exhaustion.

And the thing that really upsets me thinking about it now was not just that we were subjected to that as were workers in countless other types of warehouses like that as were the workers like yourselves who are delivering those packages to people in Southern California. But what upsets me is thinking about it it reminds me of when I played football in high school in Southern California. I mean this is not PC but just to give people a sense like the saying was water’s for pussies. And if we were doing two-a-day practices in the brutal summer August heat and you wanted to get a drink of water there was this dumb fucking hyper-masculine bullshit where if you didn’t drink water you were more tough. Guys were throwing up. That’s fucking stupid. Pardon my –

Zakk: It’s so stupid.

Maximillian Alvarez: It’s so stupid.

Zakk: It’s so stupid.

Gabriela: That’s some crazy teenage boy stuff.

Maximillian Alvarez: It is and people died every year. There were kids like myself who would die from heat exhaustion. And I think finally the state collective was like okay this is bad and dumb and unnecessary. But the reason I bring it up is that in the warehouse there was even that sense. A lot of the folks had been in prisons. A lot of the folks were tough dudes and there still was that stigma about speaking up about the horrible conditions we were working in.

Zakk: It seems to be this machismo toxic masculinity bullshit.

Maximillian Alvarez: Yeah.

Zakk: I remember that from two-a-days playing football here in Oklahoma and it was no you just push through it. You just push through it. And as drivers we do that all the time. When you’re out there in that heat you are going nuts from it. Your body temperature’s high you’re not sweating you’re red you’re hot your pulse is just pumping you’re busy you’re confused and you should drink some fucking water.

But the message that you get from either the other kids on your team or management or this internalized BS is push through it and keep going and you’ll be fine. But some people are not fine. And that’s why it’s important to have these conversations like this because some people are not fine. We have underlying health issues. I’ve got an autoimmune disease. There are lots of things that make us people and that make us workers those things do not go away when we enter the company gates. And yeah so pushing through it and not drinking water because it’s not a macho thing to do it’s not a safe thing to do either.

Maximillian Alvarez: Right. And I want to be very clear. The reason that I mentioned that is not to put this on the workers. UPS and the employers are the ones who are subjecting workers to these conditions. I say it because we want to acknowledge what you just said Zakk is that for folks who are maybe listening to this and who think that this is just part of the job it’s not. You don’t have to go through this you shouldn’t have to go through this and it’s okay to speak up and say this sucks. This is dangerous. And we want to make it clear up front that it’s okay to not want to be subjected to this.

And so building on that I was wondering if we can go back around the table and talk about what that work looks like on a day-to-day basis working in the summer as a UPS driver what maybe folks on the customer side see or don’t see that y’all are going through. Could you paint us a picture of what working in that heat whether you’re in the Southwest Mid-Atlantic or Oklahoma what that entails.

Gabriela: Absolutely. Okay people need to understand that UPS especially package delivery is a different job than any job that you’ve probably ever done. I talk to some of my friends and they can stop working and look at their phone for five minutes sometimes 20 minutes. Even one minute at UPS in package delivery you cannot stop for longer. You really can’t stop period. But no worker no delivery driver is ever going to stop for longer than one minute because we have over 200 sensors inside the engine of our truck that tracks us. We’re starting to get cameras inside the cab of our trucks that track us.

Management… Sorry I’m talking too fast because I’m angry. Management is sitting in their air conditioned offices watching every single thing that you do. You’re trained in the 340 methods which is 340 different things to describe your job exactly how you’re supposed to do it. I mean if we were in-person I could show you. We could all show you exactly the methods for how to pick up a box how to walk up to the house how to get in your truck how to pull away from a curb. It’s extreme. It’s a very high stress job. And there are so many rules.

And if you start to care about your safety – And they’ll do liability they’ll act like they care about your safety. They’ll tell you to drink water they’ll tell you all the stuff blah blah blah. But at the end of the day the way that this job functions does not work for human beings. Working in 107 degree heat does not work for human beings. Working in a truck that does not have AC or ventilation in the back where it gets to over 130 degrees doesn’t work for human beings. And not being able to stop I mean I know they will say you can stop if you’re really hot take a break but you know that the next day that they’re going to harass you and ask you why did you stop blah blah? And you say oh I was feeling really hot.

You legally have the right to stop working in unsafe working conditions. So if you need to take a break from the heat then you’re allowed to do that. But then they’re going to try to push you to clock out for your lunch or clock out for your break. So that’s what it’s like working for UPS and it’s insane. I will say that people drink a lot of water in my experience working in the Southwest. People drink a lot of water. They’re pretty good at Gatorade and stuff like that. But then another thing just the stress of the job people don’t want to break off to go to a gas station because they’re afraid of harassment. They’re trying to get off work on time because it’s still really hot at 6:00 PM. So if you can get off work early it’s even better.

And also I want to say we really can’t forget too about our – And I’m glad you brought it up Max – Our inside warehouse employees the part-timers and the combo workers. When I was part-time I saw workers pass out. I saw workers who had to sit down because they were very hot. I saw workers throw up. And actually when I was part-time we started documenting all instances of heat sickness as us part-timers. And then we started to document all instances of heat sickness we started a campaign to get fans in the building we made buttons. We got $10 an hour and we ordered buttons. It was a whole paycheck for me. But we made a petition and we stood in front of the building at UPS and we had everybody sign the petition. We had over 250 signatures and we had a rag-tag group of rank and filers confront the boss and tell our manager and plant engineering and the building manager we said hey we want to have meetings with you as part-timers.

And they were like who does that? They were like I barely even want to meet with the union why would I meet with some part-timers? Like you guys don’t even have a union rep. But we did. We forced them to have meetings with us. And we talked to them about all the people who were sick. We showed them the petition. We would not let up. I think we made stickers ​‚too. We had people wear the buttons. And then won our demands. We won all of our demands and we got fans installed in the building. So that’s the difference that you can have in a union job is that well one you have a legally binding contract that we negotiate every five years. But two you have the legal right to organize on behalf of your coworkers it’s called concerted activity in any job union or not but in a union job you really have it because they can’t actually fire you for it.

In a non-union job they might say you’re fired for wearing the wrong shoes today. But you have worker power in a union job and you can change your contract. So maybe we can get some climate change language in AC ventilation get more fans in the building for part-timers in the warehouse. I don’t see why we can’t have AC in the warehouse. Or two we can do actions outside the building. We can do petitions. We can do everything it takes to make sure that our workers are safe that this is a good job and that our people aren’t dying on the job or they’re not passing out on the job.

Zakk: I want to piggyback on some of that because UPS is the leading company in logistics. It’s a global transportation and logistics company. It sets the pace for all the other companies. And we like that. As Teamsters we love that. We’re working for the number one company in the world that is doing this sort of work. We know that we are a critical component of the companies of our customer supply chains and that gives us a lot of pride in the work that we do. I mean we deliver your vaccines. We deliver people’s medicine and their food. We deliver people’s wine. All of that stuff we deliver pets to the pet stores. I don’t know if people know that. That stuff is in the back of my package car I am taking lizards and stuff to the pet store. I’m taking people’s snakes and their fish and their coral to their house.

So that stuff is back there in 150 degrees too. UPS is number one in this game and they’ve got an opportunity to have an environmentally sustainable and economically viable way to keep their workforce healthy and continuing to bring those big profits in. We want to deliver for our stakeholders for the shareholders. Being in Oklahoma and knowing how important environmental stewardship is… The Dust Bowl happened here. We’ve seen what environmental degradation looks like. That’s my background. That’s my people’s background. And so seeing big organizations or this organization not address these issues head-on is a problem. They’ve got the money to invest in the systems the procedures the equipment the operating processes all of these things to keep us safe to keep us safe while we’re at work and to continue generating all these great shareholder profits.

We make a lot of money for this company. The folks inside who are sweating and working hard they make a lot of money for this company the number one logistics company in the world. And Amazon who is not there but they went to be there they invested years ago a few million dollars to put air conditioning inside all of their hubs. So Amazon has air conditioning in their buildings. I know because I deliver to DOK4 I deliver to one of the Amazon buildings. And when I want to take a break and sort my UPS package car I go inside the Amazon building I open up all the doors I let all the heat escape my car and I go from 130 degrees to 88 degrees in a matter of minutes. That is something powerful. The folks working in –

Gabriela: That’s so fucked up.

Zakk: Isn’t that insane?

Gabriela: Thanks Bezos. [Max laughs][crosstalk] something good.

Zakk: I’m not so sure about sending Jeff Bezos to space but those Bezos bucks put air conditioning in their hubs. And we have folks sitting in our executive suite right now in air conditioning – And they may or may not be listening to this podcast I really hope they are – But I want to make sure that they know that Amazon their competition their competition has air conditioning and we deserve it too. The idea that giving us air conditioning that it’s not going to be efficient because we open the doors and we’re in and out the capital market assumptions here the long-term estimates of financial risk and reward they’ve got to reflect the reality of climate change.

And the notion that investing in our safety as drivers is going to be a net cost to the company’s bottom line to their bottom line. That’s bull hockey man. UPS can avoid climate-related economic deterioration they can improve their risk asset returns with a green transition to sustainable technologies. They can lead the way. They can partner with the Teamsters to provide a healthy and safe workplace resilient supply chain networks that will lower inflation and deliver returns for investors. I mean we’re in a global pandemic there’s economic uncertainty there’s social unrest and this company has an opportunity to come to the table with its workers to come to the table with our union and make it better. And I hope that they do it.

Steve: Yeah. I mean just building off of what these two guys or these two have been saying what people don’t understand is one thing whenever we say hey maybe air conditioning or better ventilation in the cargo would be amazing and what you’ll hear from management would be oh it actually wouldn’t be helpful to you guys. It wouldn’t make that big of a difference. And then what people don’t understand is I personally drive 40 minutes from the hub to my route. And then when I’m done with my route I drive depending on traffic 45 to an hour back to the hub. For them to say hey yeah air conditioning wouldn’t work then. 45 minutes of having air conditioning on me after a day in 110 degree heat index that wouldn’t help? That’s what I just find… It’s just insane. For them to be able to say these words and to know that they’re lying is crazy to me.

Gabriela: My friend works for FedEx drives the exact same model of truck that we do and he has AC in his truck and he says it does make a difference. [Max chuckles]

Steve: Right exactly. And that’s what’s funny is they just say the things because they think we’ll just let it go. We’re done letting these things go. We’re done. I think in my hub we had another driver go to the emergency room last week to be honest. But they won’t they’ll be like oh it was a stomach thing. I’m like or it was heat-related because he couldn’t sweat anymore and all these things but they’re just like no couldn’t be that. And one of the biggest things I try to let people know is yeah when I’m driving with my doors open the wind does feel good. I can deal with some of these things. The problem is when you open the cargo and it’s 115 to 130 degrees in there and they’re like oh there’s this smallest little ventilation thing. You’re like nothing goes in there. Nothing helps get into that thing. It literally does nothing to make anything cooler. It doesn’t do anything to fix the situation that we’re in like I said.

And I wanted to reinforce this whole oh they say you can take a break but they don’t exactly mean that. They mean oh take 10 minutes of your lunch break. Take 10 minutes of your paid union break. But what’s funny is they don’t want you to have extra overtime because we can grieve excessive overtime over three days at UPS. So it’s like Gabriela touched on. It’s like oh you take a break. Why are you going slower today? You’re going to have a meeting in the morning. You had this many stops why did it take you longer?

Oh the fact that it’s 110 degree heat index has nothing to do with how fast I go. I guess I should work the same amount of speed in this rather than that. Yeah. I mean these two have touched on basic points and I just wanted to give my thoughts on that. At the same time I wanted to touch on one real quick thing that Zakk talked about. I was delivering animals. My first week on the job by myself I was delivering crickets to Petco or PetSmart or whatever it was. And another box falls on top of the crickets and I had a 1000 crickets in my truck –

Maximillian Alvarez: Oh shit.

Steve: …The whole day. It was the worst. I just wanted to end on that part.

Zakk: I had the same thing happen with mealworms. A box of mealworms broke open on my shelf – And those shelves are made of metal and it’s 150 degrees you can bake cookies on our shelves. And so these living things are cooking on my shelves and I can smell them in the back of the package car for days. And there’s not enough staff that work in our car wash to get the package car’s really clean and they’re rushed out. Our folks inside the hub they know what it’s like. They don’t want you to have overtime but they let you work three and a half hours a day. And they want you to do X number of package cars a day. And it’s just a lot.

I wanted to jump in here because you talked about opening the bulkhead door and all that heat that comes out hits you in the face. It’s like opening an oven. We won fans in the last contract – What a crazy thing that you have to win a fan to keep you cool. What a crazy thing that you have to win it that you gotta fight for that. But we have to fight for every dime every dollar in our workplaces which is why collective action is so important.

Anyway I’m looking at this boom how to stay safe when extreme heat threatens. This is from FEMA. And one thing that they have on this FEMA shit – Sheet. Shit. [Max laughs] I’m sorry Freudian slip – It says do not use electric fans when the temperature outside is more than 95 degrees. You could increase the risk of heat-related illness. Fans create airflow and a false sense of comfort but do not reduce body temperature. And that’s one thing that I want to mention. The fans they will cool us down and a breeze is super important.

It’s great that I get to drive around with my doors open. That breeze that air flow is super super important. But my day begins when I leave the building at 9:00 AM and some days I am out there 12 13 hours. And the back of that package car builds up very very very quickly to over 100 degrees. So I’m over 95 degrees. I’m in hot temperatures all day. It’s not well you step in and you step out. There is metabolic heat that your body generates from motion just the basic stuff that helps keep you alive. But then the fact that we exert so much physical energy to move all of this stuff all of this medicine all of this food all of this toilet paper all of this stuff that our customers need that metabolic heat combines with environmental heat so temperature sunlight humidity and that stuff equals your core worker temperature.

And when that temperature gets too high it doesn’t matter how much water you drink. That helps but it doesn’t bring down that internal temperature quick enough. And I learned that when my doctor told me that the symptoms I had last week were the symptoms of a heat stroke that when I was cramping and my hands were unable to open when I fell against the wall and I couldn’t figure out how to get up off of it she told me that’s a heat stroke. What you have is your body is breaking down the proteins that you need to stay alive. So that’s what was happening to me. And I didn’t know it until after the fact.

And there are a lot of people inside our building and inside our package cars there are people in your neighborhood in your community right now in package cars out on the street in front of your house and they’re having these problems. So we as Teamsters as workers as people we hope that you guys will say something about it and that we can push this company to do the right thing by the communities that they operate in.

Steve: Yeah I guess going off on Zakk when you think about how long we are outside on a daily basis I clock in at 8:45 every morning and hopefully I’ll be home by 7:45 8:00. That’s just how it is sometimes and some days it’s even longer. And the fact that by the time you get in your car that’s already in a hot building and then you leave the hot building to get in direct sunlight and it starts cooking you is not healthy whatsoever. Nothing about that says safe nothing about that says comfortable nothing about that says anything helpful for us to do our jobs to be the workers that we’re supposed to be. And all we’re asking for is a little relief a little help. And I don’t think that’s too much to ask for.

Gabriela: Well sometimes people go out with about 300 stops. It’s not uncommon to have that high amount of stops. My route would go out with 200 after the pandemic they really slammed my route with even more stops than I could handle. And then that would have the 200 stops that’s not 200 packages total. It’s about 260 packages because some houses have multiple packages. And when you look inside the truck if you ever have the great pleasure to look inside of a UPS truck in the morning it is packed front to back.

Zakk: Don’t do it! Don’t do it!

Gabriela: There’s no way to walk through it. It packed all the way to the ceiling it’s bad.

Zakk: It’s real bad!

The truth is that many do – in fact a 2021 study from the University of Chicago estimates that 53% of people living in homeless shelters and 40% of unsheltered people were employed either full or part-time in the year that people were observed homeless between 2011 – 2018.

Despite how many people experiencing homelessness work a job doesn’t solve everything. Life-sustaining wages are a key determinant of housing security; however most people experiencing homelessness are not earning enough to afford rent.

Low Wages and Underemployment: What the Numbers Show

The National Low Income Housing Coalition’s Out of Reach Report calculates that a household would need to earn an average salary of $46967 or $23 per hour to afford a 2-bedroom apartment at Fair Market Rent. This is much higher than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour – or in cities with a higher minimum wage. Even if people are working full time they would not be able to afford housing earning minimum wage.

Findings from the University of Chicago study highlight this discrepancy: the mean annual earnings for people experiencing sheltered homelessness aged 18 – 64 was $8169 in 2015 (pre-tax income which excludes benefits). Mean earnings for unsheltered people were even lower at $6934 in 2015 and have generally stayed lower than their sheltered counterpart during the ten-year frame of study. Accounting for inflation even the top earners in both groups could not afford a 1 or 2-bedroom apartment in 2022 which are $44200 and $53706 respectively.

Most people in the above study work part-time just shy of the standard 40 hour work week. Opportunities to enter a higher-paying full-time job may help them become more financially stable and independent – but coming from homelessness it isn’t always that easy even with the help of providers.

The Realities of Working While Homeless

A service provider in southern California pointed to several challenges that can prevent people from attaining sufficient employment:

Discrimination: People experiencing homelessness may experience systemic racism as well as discrimination if employers require a permanent address.

Logistics: People experiencing homelessness may need to access public facilities to properly prepare for interviews and their living situation may not be feasible to do so. Access to transportation can also impact when and how they can get to work.

Accommodations: Since the homeless population experiences higher rates of physical and cognitive disabilities many may need work accommodation to perform their jobs successfully.

Hiring Challenges: There may be educational requirements and unspoken social expectations that can impede hiring a person who is currently or has formerly experienced homelessness. People may need support and time to build skills in order to qualify for jobs they are interested in.

There are also less obvious challenges: certain benefits are at risk once someone starts earning a higher income making the transition from homelessness potentially stressful. For example the income limit for social security for a person under retirement age is $19560. This is much lower than the salary required to afford the average cost of a 1-bedroom apartment not accounting for the cost of food or other necessities. Losing these benefits when people are still trying to securely transition into housing only makes the process that much harder.

Finding Employment Doesn’t Equate to Finding Housing

Even if someone experiencing homelessness has a job and is able to afford rent that doesn’t mean they’ll be able to easily find a place to live. Landlord discrimination against past or current homelessness eviction history involvement of criminal justice and income source can all prevent people from achieving housing security. Barriers like these can keep people homeless – even if they’re working and even if there are affordable units available in their area.

Conclusion

While many people experiencing homelessness are employed their income alone often isn’t enough to maintain stable housing. This can result in financial insecurity which is both a main cause and a prolonging factor of homelessness. Every person’s situation is different and demands unique solutions; providing pathways to sustainable employment can be an effective way to help people achieve housing security.

The acquisition of Kelsey-Seybold a physician group based in Houston that includes cancer and women's health centers two ambulatory surgery centers and a sleep center was first announced in April but few details have emerged since the Star Tribune reported.

However Optum based in Eden Prairie Minnesota did provide a statement to MedPage Today about incorporating Kelsey-Seybold's operations and staff into the Optum network.

""Optum is aligned with Kelsey-Seybold's care delivery model that brings coordinated value-based care to patients and employers"" the company said. ""We have a shared vision of supporting high-quality care with better experiences for patients and providers at a lower total cost of care.""

Optum also highlighted its plans to focus on expanding services around the communities that Kelsey-Seybold has been serving.

""We look forward to working together to advance Kelsey-Seybold's compassionate coordinated care model to more patients and communities in the Greater Houston area"" the statement concluded.

As part of this effort Kelsey-Seybold has already begun construction on expanding one of its healthcare campuses which includes an ambulatory surgery center and a cancer center according to a recent press release. The expanded site will reportedly triple the number of possible providers at that location to 82 while also adding ""four operating rooms three endoscopy suites and a procedure room to support interventional pain management and interventional radiology services.""

In addition to that project Kelsey-Seybold has announced several others that will either expand existing healthcare facilities or break ground on new locations the press release noted.

These expansion projects will add to Optum's fast-growing network of physicians around the country.

In March 2021 Bloomberg reported that Optum's network of 53000 physicians made up 5.4% of all U.S. physicians. At that time it was considered to be the largest employer of physicians in the country. Since that report the company has reportedly added 10000 more physicians.

Optum's website states that it currently employs 60000 physicians in more than 2000 locations across the country.

It is not clear whether those numbers reflect the deal with Kelsey-Seybold which claims to have more than 600 healthcare professionals and 30 clinics on its website.

According to the Bloomberg report acquisitions by Optum such as the deal with Kelsey-Seybold are ""a key driver of UnitedHealth's growth"" to expand healthcare services and increase revenue and profits. ""More than any of its peers the company has sought to purchase medical groups and other providers"" the article noted.

UnitedHealth Group also announced that it acquired KS Plan Administrators which is affiliated with Kelsey-Seybold and covers about 41000 Medicare beneficiaries according to Becker's Healthcare.

The healthcare giant reported more than $80 billion in revenue in the second quarter of 2022.

The cost of health insurance plans on and off Connecticut’s Affordable Care Act Exchange will increase next year by as much as 25% according to final numbers released by the state Friday deepening concerns about health care access.

Insurance officials signed off on the rate changes eight weeks after carriers proposed an average increase of 20.4% across individual plans and 14.8% across small group policies. The department approved an average hike of 12.9% on individual plans and 7.9% on small group.

The approved changes range from a decrease of 6% on certain policies to increases of 20% and 25% on others.

While the average rate hike approved by the state is lower than what insurance companies had requested it still represents a significant boost in costs to consumers in the coming year.

“The department’s hard-working actuaries and professional staff were able to reduce the health insurance rate increase requests. But the skyrocketing cost of health care that these premiums cover must be addressed” Connecticut Insurance Commissioner Andrew Mais said in a statement. “The unit cost of hospital inpatient and outpatient care has risen about 9% per year. Prescription drug prices have risen even higher.

“The rates announced today will continue to protect consumers from inflationary pricing and unwarranted profits while ensuring Connecticut residents have access to a stable competitive health insurance market. But we must examine other available avenues to reduce overall costs and keep care and this insurance affordable.”

Residents and health care advocates had urged state insurance officials to reject the substantial rate hikes. On Friday they reiterated their concerns about how the finalized rates would affect health care access and affordability.

“Health care costs and insurance premiums were already unaffordable for many Connecticut families and small businesses” Attorney General William Tong said Friday. “These double-digit rate hikes – among the highest in the country – will only make that worse.”

“I’m glad the insurance department did a thoughtful review and came forth with cuts to the outlandish requested rate increases. But it’s still too high” State Health Care Advocate Ted Doolittle said. “I’m concerned about access [to coverage] with these still-large rate hikes.”

Lynne Ide program lead for communications outreach and engagement at the Universal Health Care Foundation of Connecticut said the General Assembly should pass legislation giving the insurance department “more teeth” in the rate review process including making consumer affordability a priority.

“The end result is that hardworking individuals and small businesses who are trying to provide insurance to their employees are left hanging” she said. “We need more time for these rates to be reviewed. And we need ways for other points of view to be inserted – in a true way – into the process. We need to require that [the insurance department] puts consumer affordability front and center.”

ConnectiCare Benefits Inc. which sells plans on and off the exchange requested an average hike of 24% for individual policies on the exchange. The insurance department signed off on an average increase of 15% with hikes ranging from 10% to 23.6% depending on the plan. The on-exchange plan covers 75003 people.

ConnectiCare Benefits also asked for an average increase of 22.9% on its small group policies offered through the exchange. The department approved 15% with increases ranging from 13.1% to 18.9% depending on the plan. The policies cover 3476 people.

Anthem Health Plans which sells policies to 27698 people through the exchange requested an average increase of 8.6% on its individual plans. The insurance department approved an average of 6.3%. Depending on the policy rate changes range from a decrease of 3.9% to an increase of 13.6%.

Anthem sought a 3.6% average hike on its small group plans. The department approved an average decrease of 1.4%. Changes range from a decrease of 6% to an increase of 20.2% for policies that cover 19271 people.

ConnectiCare Insurance Company which offers plans on and off the exchange requested an average hike of 25.2% for its individual policies on the exchange. The department signed off on a 15% increase. Increases range from 9.1% to 20.3% depending on the plan. There are 8782 people enrolled in the exchange plans.

Off-exchange policies range from a 0% increase (Aetna Life Insurance small group) to an increase of 25.1% (an individual plan through ConnectiCare Benefits).

ConnectiCare has attributed its increases to rising medical and pharmaceutical costs as well as delayed care due to the pandemic.

Karen Moran ConnectiCare’s president said at a public hearing in August that the company sustained over $65 million in losses in the individual market over the last year because rate increases have not kept up with higher utilization of medical services and the cost of prescription drugs among other expenses.

“For an insurance program to be sustainable rates must be adequate to provide for payment of claims and the administrative costs of running the program. For the past year the total insurance premiums we have received are far less than the cost of care we’ve actually funded” she said. “The premiums previously approved by the insurance department were significantly below what was necessary for us to meet the needs of the members. … The single most important driver in our proposed rate increase is to restore rates to an adequate level.”

Cigna which offers small group policies off the exchange had asked for an average hike of 19.6% on its plans. The insurance department signed off on 12%.

Sarah Souza small group actuarial director for Cigna said last month that even with the increases for 2023 plans the company’s premiums would be lower than the market average.

“For silver plans which are the most popular amongst small employers we have the lowest plan in six out of the eight rating areas representing the vast majority of where small employers are located” she said.

Open enrollment for 2023 health policies begins on Nov. 1.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuaWNlZi5vcmcvaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi9kcGctcGF0aGZpbmRpbmctY291bnRyaWVzL2t5cmd5enN0YW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kyrgyzstan: Improving family health through telemedicine,"Needs Assessment and Advocacy

Beginning in November 2019 the first step was to conduct an analysis of the current situation in Kyrgyzstan advocate and build a network of national experts and representatives of developmental partners and donors. In the form of a rapid review an analysis was completed on the current use of telemedicine services in the country.

Additionally a foundational assessment was conducted to see whether a strong foundation exists to implement telemedicine programs nationwide. It found that 99.2% of Kyrgyzstan households had access to mobile phones of which 79.2% had a smartphone; 76% of urban and 65.3% of rural households had access to the internet from any one device from home; and 73.7% of women surveyed had accessed the internet at least once a week in the last three months (MICS 2018). This data provided a basis for the development of telemedicine technologies.

Disability is a strong driver of inequitable realization of rights. 32013 children 1.3% of the child population are registered with a disability (Data from the National Statistic Committee). In Kyrgyzstan - as in many other countries in the region – official data on the number of children with disabilities is that which corresponds to the number of children (with a disability) who receive a state benefit.

The problem of congenital malformations is real for Kyrgyzstan. In 2020 7375 children with congenital malformations (CHD) registered. 751 children were registered with birth defects for the first time in their lives which amounted to 3.0 per 10 thousand children (E-Health Center Ministry of Health 2020). The current surveillance system (routine statistical reporting) collects data on the total number of congenital anomalies of the nervous system (including anencephaly and similar malformations hydrocephalus) heart and vascular system cleft palate and lip Down syndrome and other congenital anomalies.

Several programmes were implemented to prevent folic acid preventable birth defects and other folate deficiency diseases. These include periconceptual and conception folic acid supplementation through antenatal care counselling to maintain the healthy diet flour fortification. However there is no full integration of nutrition services into the health system challenges existing with universal access to iron and folic acid supplements for pregnant women. Moreover the outcomes of the most recent 2021 National Integrated Micronutrient and Anthropometric survey shows that only 2 per cent of flour in households is adequately fortified 22 per cent is inadequately fortified and 76 per cent is not fortified at all. The Birth defects register is vital to monitor the impact of strategies to raise the folic acid status of women periconceptionally in order to prevent Neural Tube Defects (NTDs). Neural Tube Defects (NTD) Register allows to get on-time quality data on congenital malformation analysis of causes and risks factors assessment of efficiency of measures on NTD prevention policy-makers informing and evidence-based policy programming. Under UNICEF support and the partnership with E-Health Center the NTD Register developed and disseminated in health organizations country-wide in 2021.

Telemedicine in Kyrgyzstan's Primary Health Care System was chosen to be deployed.

This open-source solution works in low-cost and low-bandwidth settings and can be customized for use in the field. With its convenient digital assistant Ayu it provides the opportunity to upload national clinical protocols to ensure care provided by the local health worker is in adherence to clinically approved standards. The underlying approach is to create a provider-to-provider connection which allows a family doctor from a remote family center to connect with a qualified health specialist at a secondary or tertiary level outpatient facility. In conjunction with the Ministry of Health (MoH) and National Telemedicine Council a lengthy process of transforming three clinical protocols from paper-based to the telemedicine platform fitting format was concluded.

Main advantages of introducing telemedicine at primary health care level:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS96aW1iYWJ3ZS1oZWFsdGgtc3lzdGVtLWlzLWluLWludGVuc2l2ZS1jYXJlLWhvdy1pdC1nb3QtdGhlcmUtMTg5Njcw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Zimbabwe health system is in intensive care: how it got there,"Health systems are at their core meant to promote restore or maintain health. Their objective is to improve the length and quality of citizens’ life from the cradle to the grave. Health is therefore a fundamental human right.

This was very clear to the different healthcare delivery administrators and practitioners in Zimbabwe for the last 42 years. But something happened along the way and Zimbabwe is now at the bottom of the pile.

During my tenure from 1998 to 2002 as the director of the Institute of Continuing Health Education a postgraduate arm of the medical school at the University Of Zimbabwe I was involved with the health system in Zimbabwe representing the school on a joint health planning committee under the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare. I was also chairman of the national medicines and therapeutics advisory committee which used to take stock of the availability of medicines. I also served as deputy chair of the Medicine Control Authority.

My involvement has continued in the form of teaching students at one of the country’s medical schools.

During the early years 1980 to about 1990 things were moving.

In 1980 after independence the Zimbabwean government set about addressing the inequities of a system imposed during the colonial period. Prior to independence healthcare catered primarily for colonial administrators and expatriates. Africans got separate or second-class provision.

The new government sought to replace this with the concept of equity in health and primary healthcare. The noble idea was to distribute health between individuals and to invest in health wisely and effectively. Zimbabwe also joined the World Health Organisation and followed its recommendations to the letter.

But by the turn of the century it was clear that the government had lost its way when it came to healthcare. And there has been a marked deterioration ever since.

Zimbabwe’s current system fails in three respects which are key to any healthcare system: policy people and funding. The result is it is unable to deliver the most basic care. There’s a lack of medicines and functioning hospital equipment. It is also a system devoid of empathy. Zimbabweans believe that one goes to hospital to die not to have one’s health restored.

The health system in Zimbabwe is to all intents and purposes now in the intensive care unit. The future is bleak unless there are serious long-term reforms to build resilience.

What went wrong

There have been several distinct phases in the development of Zimbabwe’s healthcare system since 1980.

The first phase between 1981 and 1989 was a period of redistribution without growth in productivity. There was an impressive expansion in social services using aid funds. Indeed some health services were free for example maternal and child health. The private sector also contributed to healthcare provision. For example industry paid an HIV/AIDS levy.

The second phase between 1990 and 1997 was a period of economic stagnation. Many people were unemployed and as a result the tax base shrank. Little money was available to the fiscus. The health budget began to be cut affecting the quality of services. Households had to pay for some health services out of their pocket.

The third phase between 1998 and 2008 saw a further contraction of the economy. People began to be laid off in larger numbers. What had already started got worse. Government officials from the very top began to go outside the country for treatment.

The phase of 2009-2013 was a period of stabilisation of the socio-economic situation in the country because a government of national unity was established. During this period funds some of which were allocated to the health system began to flow into the country.

But 2013 to date has been the blame game period. There has been – and continues to be – an exodus of healthcare professionals to greener pastures. The consequence has been poor service at health facilities.

Policy people and funding

Policy: In the 1980s the government sought to put in place a healthcare policy that benefited all Zimbabweans.

For example investment in primary healthcare infrastructure (clinics and health centres) resulted in 85% of the population being within one hour’s travel time to the nearest health facility.

But over time health policy and strategic plans for health became increasingly donor funded. Implementation often reflected the agenda of donors.

Some private sector companies came on board. For example the National Health Trust was set up by Econet the biggest mobile telecommunication company in Zimbabwe. I chaired the trust between 2006 and 2011. The aim of the trust was to augment whatever the government was doing. The aim wasn’t to watch the government fold its arms and let the private sector do everything.

People: A great many doctors nurses and other healthcare professionals have emigrated. In 2006 a report produced by Dr Lovemore Mbengeranwa painted a bleak picture. It found:

there had been an unprecedented staff exodus and that there was low morale among those remaining

ineffectiveness of the referral system

ill-equipped training schools and a shortage of tutors

general shortages and lack of equipment and skilled personnel with poor remuneration

lack of accommodation and other incentives for personnel

inadequate funding for the health sector over the past few years

shortages of essential drugs including antiretrovirals.

The situation has continued on a downward path. Those who stay are incapacitated. When they attempt to focus on providing basic care they appear to have no one to listen to them.

Funding: In the first decades after independence health was put at the forefront of development. This was underscored at the continental level. The Abuja Declaration signed in 2001 saw member states pledge to allocate at least 15% of their national budgets each year to improving their healthcare systems.

Zimbabwe has failed to come close to meeting this target. Health expenditure increased steadily in the first decade after independence to reach 3.1% of GDP and 6.2% of government expenditure – or US$23.60 per capita – in 1990–91. But spending as a percentage of GDP has gone down. And at 2000 per capita health financing stood at US$8.55. At the beginning of 2008 it stood at only US$0.19.

Since the Abuja declaration in 2001 it has improved slightly but is still behind in meeting the 15%. Today in Zimbabwe health insurance covers less than 10% of the population.

Over 39% of all health expenditure is out of pocket leading to financial impoverishment for many people.

Next steps

I believe it’s still possible to provide universal health coverage in Zimbabwe. The country has the basic foundations in place. It has the brain power – locally and in the diaspora. What needs addressing are the socio-economic and political environments to make it conducive for people to return.

Zimbabwe also has the natural resources such as diamonds gold platinum lithium and maybe soon gas and oil. All can be mobilised to provide the required financial resources to strengthen the health system for future generations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vcGFnYW5vZnVuZXJhbGhvbWUuY29tL3RyaWJ1dGUvZGV0YWlscy8xOTU2L0x5bm5lLVJvbWVzYnVyZy9vYml0dWFyeS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary of Lynne K.

Imagine walking into your neighbourhood health centre and knowing that whatever your health-care needs you’re in the right place.

A team of doctors nurses psychologists and allied health professionals are available to ensure that the focus is on your wellness and prevention of disease and illness. You have built relationships with these healthcare providers and you know that they will be there when you need them.

Here in B.C. we’re a long way from this vision. We’re hearing daily stories about emergency room closures staffing shortages and family doctors closing their practices. Premier John Horgan himself stated that health care in B.C. is “crumbling at our feet.”

Physicians have been raising the alarm too saying they’re not paid to do half of their work they can’t afford the high costs of rent and administration and that family practices are being phased out by corporations and governments alike. We cannot expect our health-care professionals to be caring for us when they are not being cared for themselves.

We pride ourselves on our universal health-care system in Canada. But is it working as well as it should be? With a population of 75 million Germany has one of the top ranked healthcare systems in the world while Canada’s public health system serving 38 million people is teetering. Canada and Germany dedicate similar amounts of funding to universal health care. What explains this discrepancy?

Germany has one healthcare administrator for every 15545 citizens. Canada has one health-care administrator for every 1415 citizens. In other words Canada has 10 times as many administrators as Germany for fewer citizens. This means that much of the money we’re spending on health care in Canada isn’t going directly to services.

While some administrators are essential excessive bureaucracy creates inefficiencies within our health-care system. In B.C. the five regional health authorities – an extension of the Ministry of Health – are used to implement and administer health spending while in other jurisdictions funding is sent directly to physician clinics.

Evidence shows that more administration inserted into health-care delivery is not working. Despite this the BC NDP continues to promote government-run Urgent and Primary Care Centres (UPCCs) as a solution to the family doctor crisis. The intention of UPCCs is to provide urgent care to those without a family doctor. In reality UPCCs suffer from bureaucratic overreach chronic staff shortages inexcusable wait times and long-term closures. They are also failing to address the shortage of family doctors: Richmond’s primary care network currently has one of the approved 32 full-time doctors.

As the German example shows us it matters how the money is spent.

Here in B.C. we must rethink our approach to health-care funding. We need to reduce administration and allocate more resources to the doctors nurses and specialists who are invested in providing care to patients. We know that having good access to primary care leads to better health for people and we know that many family doctors want to provide care rooted in relationships with their patients. We need to invest more in services for people not more bureaucracy.

Our vision for health care lies in community health centres. These centres are run by teams of health professionals not by health authorities. Government provides the physical infrastructure – much like schools – and funding for the doctors nurses psychologists and health professionals who deliver health care. These centres focus on delivering care are patient-centred and rooted in community needs. This vision is being realized in community health centres like Shoreline Medical on the Saanich Peninsula and the Whistler 360 Health Collaborative Society.

It’s time the NDP examines its approach to providing care. Instead of doubling down on cumbersome and expensive bureaucracy this government needs to trust the doctors and nurses and work collaboratively with them ensuring the focus is on delivering the highest quality care. The health and well-being of British Columbians should be the essential consideration of government – the NDP must work in good faith with doctors and nurses to build the solutions that work. ■

UU. aumentan un 18 por ciento pese a la escasez de chips | AGENCIA ...,"La foto de archivo muestra el modelo utilitario deportivo (SUV por sus siglas en inglés) Genesis GV80 de Hyundai Motor.

Seúl 2 de septiembre (Yonhap) -- Hyundai Motor Co. y su filial Kia Corp. han dicho este viernes que sus ventas combinadas en Estados Unidos aumentaron un 18 por ciento interanual el mes pasado a pesar de la prolongada escasez mundial de chips.

Las dos empresas surcoreanas vendieron 130.424 vehículos en el mercado automovilístico más importante del mundo en agosto frente a los 110.209 automóviles de un año atrás según los datos de ventas de las compañías.

Las ventas de Hyundai crecieron un 14 por ciento hasta las 64.335 unidades el mes pasado en comparación con las 56.200 de hace un año mientras que las de Kia subieron un 22 por ciento hasta las 66.089 respecto a las 54.009 unidades vendidas durante el mismo período mostraron los datos.

Eric Watson vicepresidente a cargo de las operaciones de ventas de Kia America dijo que a la luz de los continuos desafíos de suministro en toda la industria haber logrado el mejor desempeño de ventas en agosto es un testimonio de la ""solidez"" de la línea de productos de KIA sus distribuidores y sus empleados.

Watson dijo que espera que la producción de vehículos mejore y en consecuencia se impulse la demanda del nuevo vehículo deportivo utilitario (SUV según sus siglas en inglés) Sportage el SUV EV6 totalmente eléctrico y el nuevo y rediseñado SUV Telluride hasta finales de este año.

Según los datos en el período enero-agosto las ventas de los fabricantes de automóviles en EE. UU. cayeron un 10 por ciento a los 930.711 automóviles en comparación con los 1.034.454 vendidos durante el mismo período del año anterior.

Las ventas de Hyundai disminuyeron un 12 por ciento interanual a 468.833 unidades en los primeros ocho meses del año mientras que las ventas de Kia descendieron un 81 por ciento interanual de 502.619 a 461.878 unidades con respecto a las 502.619 durante el mismo período.

Los resultados de ventas de Genesis la marca independiente de Hyundai aún no han sido publicados.

Hasta el momento la serie ha sido recibida con gran entusiasmo por parte de los fans pero al igual que ocurrió en años anteriores con las aventuras de Cersei Jaime o Jon Nieve estos no han podido esperar a que vayan saliendo los capítulos y han acudido en masa a las librerías físicas y online para hacerse con un ejemplar de ‘Fuego y Sangre’ la novela de George R. R. Martin en la que se basa esta nueva entrega del universo de los Siete Reinos.

El libro fue publicado en 2018 y narra la historia de los Targaryen la dinastía que reinó en Poniente trescientos años antes del inicio de ‘Canción de hielo y fuego’ la saga de libros escritos por el mismo autor y que inspiró ‘Juego de tronos’. Hasta el momento solo se ha publicado la primera parte de dos.

La acción transcurre siglos antes de lo que ya habíamos visto (o leído) y recrea la historia de los Targaryen empezando por Aegon I creador del Trono de Hierro al que siguen el resto de las generaciones de Targaryens que lucharon hasta la extenuación por conservar el poder y el trono hasta la llegada de la guerra civil que casi acaba con ellos.

Para los fanáticos de este universo el libro resulta imprescindible ya que amplía este mundo de fantasía que está libremente inspirado en la historia de Inglaterra. Muchos comparan esta novela de Martin con ‘El Silmarilion’ de Tolkien en el que el autor inglés contaba todo lo que había pasado muchos siglos antes de los hechos narrados en ‘El Señor de los Anillos’. El propio Martin ha bromeado muchas veces refiriéndose a este libro como su “GRRMarillion”.

El libro sigue los patrones establecidos por el propio autor en sus libros anteriores con lo que entre sus páginas podemos esperar encontrarnos pasajes muy violentos sorpresas totalmente inesperadas sexo a raudales (casi siempre prohibido sucio e inestuoso) y muertes por doquier. Sin importar si los personajes son claves para la trama o no y de las formas más violentas y sangrientas.

El libro destaca por su número de personajes que en este libro son hasta más numerosos que en las entregas anteriores debido a que la historia cubre muchos más años. Por lo tanto en el caso de que no tengas mucha experiencia en este tipo de literatura ármate de paciencia (y quizá de un lápiz y un papel) para intentar recordar quién es quién dentro de la novela.

Pero si quieres saber cómo acaba (quizá) la nueva serie de HBO Max antes de que llegue realmente a su fin te recomendamos que te hagas lo antes posible con un ejemplar de ‘Fuego y Sangre’ y te sumerjas en sus más de 800 páginas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vZGFlcy5jb20vZW1wcmVzYS9jYW1wZXItbnVldmEtbWV0YS0yMDAtbWlsbG9uZXMtZW4tdmVudGFzLXktMTAtZGUtcmVudGFiaWxpZGFkLWVuLTIwMjPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Camper nueva meta: 200 millones en ventas y 10% de rentabilidad en 2023,"Camper busca nuevas metas. El grupo mallorquín de calzado uno de los mayores de España por cifra de negocio prevé recuperar el año que viene el que había sido su techo histórico de facturación 200 millones de euros con una rentabilidad del 10% según explica la empresa en su informe de sostenibilidad.

“Queremos seguir creciendo de manera rentable y sostenible” subraya la compañía que contempla “espacios de mejora” en las áreas de digital y de comercio electrónico. Además Camper prevé que 50% de sus ingresos procedan de la venta de productos “con un enfoque sostenible” frente al 46% de 2021 y el 39% de 2020.

La compañía rara vez ha comunicado sus resultados anuales y no consolida las cuentas de las diversas sociedades con las que opera. Sus previsiones pasaban por cerrar 2021 con una facturación de 146 millones de euros un 22% más que el año anterior y llegar a 175 millones de euros en 2022 según las últimas estimaciones que la compañía dio en diciembre de 2021 a El País.

Camper prevé alcanzar una rentabilidad del 10% en 2023

Publicidad

Los 200 millones de euros que espera alcanzar en 2023 han sido el techo histórico de Camper. Durante años la empresa mantuvo el objetivo de alcanzar 500 millones de euros de facturación pero el salto al mainstream (más allá del éxito del modelo Pelotas) se le ha resistido.

En esta dirección iban proyectos como el lanzamiento de la cadena de ropa Medwinds y la firma de calzado de piel Cartujano que cerraron en 2018 o la incorporación de Romain Kremer que en 2014 se convirtió en el primer director creativo de la empresa.

La compañía opera con una red de 1.500 puntos de venta y está presente en más de cien países

Desde 2019 el cargo recae en Achilles Ion Gabriel que hasta entonces estaba al frente del departamento creativo del concepto Camper Lab que apuesta por lo comercial sin perder el enfoque vanguardista y con el que Camper ha recuperado su histórico eslogan Walk don’t run.

La empresa también ha apostado por la diversificación con el lanzamiento de una marca de deporte NNormal de la mano del deportista español Kílian Jornet y la entrada en ropa con una pequeña colección de prendas de entre 35 euros y 120 euros.

Camper que sigue en manos de la familia Fluxà opera con una red de 1.500 puntos de venta (incluyendo 300 tiendas monomarca) y está presente en más de cien países. La compañía liderada por Miquel Fluxà emplea a 987 personas y tiene su sede en Inca (Mallorca).

Nuevos objetivos sostenibles

Camper acaba de ser certificada con el sello Bcorp una certificación otorgada por la organización sin ánimo de lucro B Lab que se otorga a compañías con “altos estándares de desempeño rendimiento de cuentas y transparencia” en factores que van desde el ámbito social y ambiental pero también la estructura y las operaciones.

La estrategia de sostenibilidad de Camper se estructura en base a tres pilares producto tiendas y comunicación en base a los cuales el grupo sea marcado una batería de objetivos que incluyen desde el uso de materiales renovables o reciclados (mínimo un 75% en 2025) la reciclabilidad de los productos (el 15% en 2025) o el fin de vida (con la meta de recuperar o reparar el 3% de lo que se vende a cliente final para 2025).

""With more than 80% of countries around the world seeing inflation above 6% socioeconomic risks are reaching critical levels.""

Incorporating data going back to 2017 the latest update to the firm's civil unrest index (CUI) shows that the last quarter of this year ""saw more countries witness an increase in risks from civil unrest than at any time since the index was released"" the analysis states. ""Out of 198 countries 101 saw an increase in risk compared with only 42 where the risk decreased.""

""In December 2020 we warned of a new era of civil unrest projecting that 75 countries would see an increase in civil unrest risk by August 2022. The reality has been far worse with 120 countries witnessing an increase in risk since then"" the firm pointed out.

""With more than 80% of countries around the world seeing inflation above 6% socioeconomic risks are reaching critical levels"" the analysis explains. ""Almost half of all the countries on the CUI are now categorized as high- or extreme-risk and a large number of states are expected to experience a further deterioration over the next six months.""

In a separate index measuring government stability within countries the firm found that 42 nations saw an increased risk of having their governments challenged or toppled compared with 27 countries where it dropped. The analysis says that ""although the negative trend is less marked than for civil unrest rising food and energy prices will make it more difficult for governments to manage popular discontent.""

""Over the coming months"" the firm is now warning ""governments across the world are about to get an answer to a burning question: Will protests sparked by socioeconomic pressure transform into broader and more disruptive anti-government action?""

As Jimena Blanco the company's chief analyst put it: ""We're talking about numerous powder kegs around the world simply waiting for that spark to be ignited. We don't know where that spark will come first.""

However she toldThe Guardian ""the situation is so bad in places like Haiti Myanmar and Sudan that it is hard for them to become much worse. Therefore countries in Europe that have to date enjoyed much more stable environments are likely to see bigger increases in risk.""

The analysis specifically raises alarm about Bosnia and Herzegovina Switzerland Netherlands Germany and Ukraine--which was invaded by Russia in February and continues to endure a war with global repercussions especially in terms of energy.

Echoing Blanco Torbjorn Soltvedt the firm's principal analyst for the Middle East and North Africa toldReuters that ""over the winter it wouldn't come as a surprise if some of the developed nations in Europe start to see more serious forms of civil unrest.""

Describing expected unrest in an interview with Bloomberg Blanco emphasized that ""these are significant events in terms of disrupting everyday life"" and some emerging markets could see ""rioting looting even attempts to overthrow the government.""

According to The Guardian:

Blanco said political events in Latin America ""may feed into drivers of unrest."" Chile is preparing to vote on a new constitution she said and Brazil is heading into a polarized general election. ""In Argentina the government is effectively collapsing amid ongoing unrest"" she added. ""The question is whether the unrest will escalate into something more profound.""

Reiterating previous analysis the firm said Thursday that in terms of government stability ""middle-income countries that were rich enough to offer social protection during the Covid-19 pandemic but are struggling to maintain high levels of social spending during 2022 are likely to face the highest risk.""

""For governments unable to spend their way out of the crisis repression is likely to be the main response to anti-government protests"" the analysis states specifically pointing to Iran. ""But suppression comes with its own risks leaving disgruntled populations with fewer mechanisms for channeling their dissent at a time of growing frustration with the status quo.""

As an example the firm noted the Turkish government's attempt to criminalize independent economic data while adding that ""this is far from an isolated case.""

Verisk Maplecroft's freedom of opinion and expression index shows that over the past two years 66 countries have tightened restrictions. The analysis says that ""Chile and Sri Lanka--both of which have been rocked by large-scale civil unrest this year--account for the biggest increase in risk for this issue.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9nbG9iYWwtZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQvMjAyMi9zZXAvMDIvcmlzaW5nLWNvc3RzLXRocmVhdGVuLWdsb2JhbC11bnJlc3Qtc2F5LXJpc2stYW5hbHlzdHPSAXBodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vZ2xvYmFsLWRldmVsb3BtZW50LzIwMjIvc2VwLzAyL3Jpc2luZy1jb3N0cy10aHJlYXRlbi1nbG9iYWwtdW5yZXN0LXNheS1yaXNrLWFuYWx5c3Rz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Powder kegs waiting for a spark’: rising costs threaten global unrest say risk analysts,"Rising costs of food and energy and the impact of the climate crisis on resources are predicted to increase civil unrest in more than half the world’s countries over the coming months according to new analysis.

This year has already witnessed large-scale protests as inflation levels soar in Argentina Ecuador and Sri Lanka but the worst is yet to come said risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft.

With more than 80% of countries around the world seeing inflation above 6% socioeconomic risks are reaching critical levels it said.

“We’re talking about numerous powder kegs around the world simply waiting for that spark to be ignited. We don’t know where that spark will come first” said Jimena Blanco the company’s chief analyst.

Analysis published by the company on Friday said 101 out of 198 countries including the UK and across Europe now had a heightened risk of conflict and instability.

Only a significant reduction in global food and energy prices can stop the trend of growing civil unrest it said.

“We’ve seen a lot of big protests around the world this year and we’re seeing inflation accelerating” said Torbjorn Soltvedt Verisk’s principal Middle East and north Africa analyst who led the research. “In parallel we’ve seen a trend of a weakening of democratic countries and of free speech. That’s why we expect a lot more civil unrest this year and going into next year.”

Counties across Europe face some of the biggest risks of unrest fuelled by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“The situation is so bad in places like Haiti Myanmar and Sudan that it is hard for them to become much worse. Therefore countries in Europe that have to date enjoyed much more stable environments are likely to see bigger increases in risk” said Blanco.

The risk of civil unrest has increased in Ukraine because it is harder to voice discontent under martial law said Verisk. Since the beginning of the Russian invasion anyone protesting can be arrested. Even after the conflict ends “the challenges to rebuild the economy infrastructure and bring back civil life to prewar standards will provide fertile ground for protests” said Blanco.

Countries such as Egypt the Philippines and Zimbabwe that were able to offer support to people during the Covid-19 pandemic are now struggling to maintain levels of social spending which could cause discontent said Verisk.

Blanco said political events in Latin America “may feed into drivers of unrest”.

Chile is preparing to vote on a new constitution she said and Brazil is heading into a polarised general election. “In Argentina the government is effectively collapsing amid ongoing unrest” she added. “The question is whether the unrest will escalate into something more profound.”

For governments unable to spend their way out of crises repression is likely to be the main response to anti-government protests. People in Iran – alongside other countries in the Middle East – are already subject to violence from security services the research found.

Weather is likely to be a determining factor in whether unrest increases. A cold autumn and winter in Europe could worsen an already serious energy and cost of living crisis. An increase in droughts and water stress globally may worsen already high food prices and spark protests in affected areas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhcHBsZXIuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3Zlcmlzay1tYXBsZWNyb2Z0LWNpdmlsLXVucmVzdC1pbmRleC1zZXB0ZW1iZXItMjAyMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rising energy prices could fuel social unrest across Europe this winter,"This is AI generated summarization which may have errors.

Germany and Norway are some of the developed economies experiencing disruptions to everyday life because of labor actions

LONDON United Kingdom – Europe’s wealthiest nations face rising risks of civil unrest over the winter including street protests and demonstrations due to high energy prices and mounting costs of living according to a risk consultancy firm.

Both Germany and Norway are some of the developed economies experiencing disruptions to everyday life because of labor actions a trend already seen in the United Kingdom Verisk Maplecroft’s principal analyst Torbjorn Soltvedt told Reuters.

Verisk’s latest report on its civil unrest index found more than 50% of the almost 200 countries covered experienced an increase in mass mobilizations risk between the second and the third quarter of 2022 the largest quantity of nations since the firm released the index in 2016.

The list of countries with the biggest projected increase in risk included Bosnia and Herzegovina Switzerland and the Netherlands according to the report released on Friday September 2.

“Over the winter it wouldn’t come as a surprise if some of the developed nations in Europe start to see more serious forms of civil unrest” Soltvedt said.

Russia’s war in Ukraine since February 24 has accelerated a rise in food prices which hit an all-time record in February and again in March. Energy prices also rose sharply with Europe finding itself at the center of the fallout. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine “a special military operation.”

“And we still have some of the fallout from the COVID pandemic playing into this with existing supply chain disruptions” chief analyst Jimena Blanco added.

Devastating droughts and low water levels connected to climate change in many parts of the world have exacerbated high food and energy prices.

From peaceful movements to violent protests the rise in prices of staple foods also explained the increase in social discontent spanning developed and emerging markets alike according to the report.

Mauritius Cyprus and Ukraine have experienced the largest increase in social unrest in the third quarter versus the second quarter with Russia in the seventh place and Norway in the 13th place of the list. – Rappler.com",,,

Apple One will likely be included with Verizon's most expensive ""5G Get More"" unlimited data plan which costs $90 per month for one person. The fully-loaded plan already includes Apple Music the option of Apple Arcade or Google Play Pass Disney+ Hulu ESPN+ 600GB of Verizon Cloud storage and more as free perks. It's unclear if existing subscribers will receive Apple One or if the offer will be for new customers only.

Following in the footsteps of British carrier EE Verizon will likely offer Apple One's individual tier which normally costs $14.95 per month and includes Apple Music Apple Arcade Apple TV+ and iCloud+ with 50GB of storage.

It's unclear exactly when Verizon plans to share this news but the carrier will likely make an announcement at some point in September alongside Apple's introduction of iPhone 14 models. Apple is widely expected to unveil the iPhone 14 Apple Watch Series 8 and more during an event at Steve Jobs Theater on September 7 and the devices should go on sale by September 16 in the U.S. and many other countries.

Verizon offering Apple One with an eligible plan could help to attract customers to the carrier heading into the holiday shopping season. The deal could also further bolster Apple's services business which set a June quarter record with $19.6 billion revenue and was the company's second largest revenue source behind iPhone sales.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vdGVjaC5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vaG93LXRvL2lwaG9uZS0xMi1mb3ItZnJlZS1vZmZlcnMtdGhpcy02OTktaXBob25lLWZvci1ub3RoaW5nLWhlcmUtcy1ob3ctNzE2NjIyMjc2ODEyODEuaHRtbNIBf2h0dHBzOi8vdGVjaC5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vYW1wL2hvdy10by9pcGhvbmUtMTItZm9yLWZyZWUtb2ZmZXJzLXRoaXMtNjk5LWlwaG9uZS1mb3Itbm90aGluZy1oZXJlLXMtaG93LTcxNjYyMjI3NjgxMjgxLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,iPhone 12 for FREE?

S&P Dow Jones Indices made the announcement today after the close of US markets noting the regional casino operator and PVH Corp. (NYSE:PVH) are getting the boot from the world’s most widely followed equity gauge. That pair of stocks will be replaced by CoStar Group (NASDAQ:CSGP) and Invitation Homes (NYSE:INVH).

Those changes and others announced by the index provider will take effect prior to the open of US markets on Monday Sept. 19. Penn Entertainment is the only gaming stock affected by the moves.

With the Bartstool Sportsbook operator leaving the S&P 500 the remaining gaming names in the index in order of weight are VICI Properties (NYSE: VICI) Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS) MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) and Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN).

Penn Looking Like Mid-Cap Stock

Penn’s stay in the S&P 500 was brief as it along with rival Caesars was added to the index in March 2021. The casino operator’s departure from the benchmark makes sense because the S&P 500 is designed to be a large-cap gauge – a status Penn no longer meets.

All companies moving from the S&P 500 to the S&P MidCap 400 are more representative of the mid-cap market space and all companies moving from the S&P MidCap 400 to the S&P SmallCap 600 are more representative of the small-cap market space” according to a statement from S&P Dow Jones Indices.

As of today’s close Penn sports a market capitalization of $5.27 billion which undoubtedly qualifies as mid-cap territory.

While the gaming company has its share of supporters on Wall Street how it arrived at the predicament of S&P 500 removal isn’t a mystery. The stock is down 39.63% year-to-date and 62% over the past year. Over the near-term those percentages could increase as fund managers that benchmark to the S&P 500 are forced to sell shares of Penn.

Trillions of dollars of global assets are allocated to the S&P 500 and related index funds. For example the three largest US-listed exchange traded funds (ETFs) all follow that index and the trio has a combined $918.36 billion in assets under management.

Where Penn Stock Heads to Next

As noted above Penn’s destination is the S&P MidCap 400 Index. While that’s a widely followed benchmark in its own right it pales in comparison to the S&P 500. Additionally mid-cap equities of all stripes are frequently overlooked relative to large- and small-cap fare.

Still hope is not lost for Penn stock. Far from it. Historically mid-caps outperform their larger and smaller counterparts often doing so with less volatility than the latter.

As for prestigious index inclusions it’s possible that with the benefit of major rally into the fourth quarter Penn could be in position for promotion to the Nasdaq-100 Index (NDX) — same goes for Caesars — but that’s likely asking a lot of any gaming equity at this juncture.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Russian media published a video of the younger Medvedev wearing a prominently visible Apple Watch accepting his party card from the hand of party official Andrei Turchak the son of a long-time friend of President Vladimir Putin and a former regional governor who has been accused of ordering the near-fatal beating of journalist Oleg Kashin in 2010.

“I will try to use my abilities in the correct way in spheres that are important for the people and the country” Medvedev said promising to undertake projects in sports education health care and “the digital transformation of government.”

It marked something of a coming out for the young Medvedev who previously had kept a low public profile – an initiation into the ranks of Putin’s ruling apparatus. It also came just a couple weeks after unconfirmed reports that the United States had cancelled Ilya Medvedev’s visa and given him two days to leave the country. Although none of the details of the reports was confirmed Dmitry Medvedev wrote an angry Telegram post on June 4 lambasting the West for imposing sanctions on the family members of Russian officials involved in the Ukraine war.

United Russia members who agreed to be interviewed for a profile of Ilya Medvedev by Current Time and Meduza placed little stock in the reports of a U.S. visa but stressed that Dmitry Medvedev who is now deputy chairman of Putin’s Security Council and one of the most avid outspoken proponents of the war on Ukraine needed to demonstrate that both he and his son are “faithful servants of the Motherland.” The party members spoke on condition of anonymity saying they are not authorized to comment to the media.

'A Model Young Man'

In 2016 a party was held at the Royal Bar in Moscow for recent graduates of the international law department of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO). Music for the event was provided by the band Serebro for a fee of 1.5 million rubles (about $25000). The tab was paid by 21-year-old Ilya Medvedev according to two people who attended the event.

It was a typical gesture for the young Medvedev according to several people who knew him during his time at MGIMO a prestigious institute connected to the Foreign Ministry that has a long tradition of educating Soviet and Russian elites. By all accounts Medvedev was a good student who never skipped class or boasted.

“He was a typical representative of the Moscow intelligentsia -- very well-mannered pleasant tactful” said one woman who studied with Medvedev. “He was a model young man. Your mother would be happy if you brought home such a fiancé. He was always friendly and nice.”

“You could talk to him” said another fellow student. “You could joke around. He didn’t get into politics.”

“He didn’t have that swagger that you find with so many of the kids of high-ranking officials” said yet another. These sources also spoke on condition of anonymity citing possible repercussions for public remarks.

Other acquaintances said Medvedev preferred the company of students who earned their way into MGIMO on their academic merit. He sometimes invited his group to his home “where there was a maid and a home theater.” Several sources remembered such gatherings at a home in the wealthy suburban Moscow area known as Rublyovka where both Dmitry Medvedev and Putin live.

The younger Medvedev’s MGIMO acquaintances also recalled that he was always accompanied by two bodyguards in civilian clothes. This was nothing unusual for some students of the prestigious institute. “There was one girl who had five bodyguards” one interlocutor said.

“One girl who dated Ilya complained that her social media had been hacked apparently in an effort to check her out” one of Medvedev’s classmates recalled.

Another recalled accompanying Medvedev to a popular bar in St. Petersburg one weekend.

“When we arrived the bar was completely empty” he said “and all the security cameras had been covered up. [Ilya] also reserved an entire bathhouse in downtown St. Petersburg for us and paid for everything.”

Friends recall that Medvedev loved playing soccer discussing wine and dreamed of a career in the tech industry. In this regard he seems a carbon copy of his father at that time who visited several Silicon Valley firms during a 2010 trip to the United States.

“He talked a lot about start-ups and innovations” one of Ilya Medvedev’s acquaintances recalled.

“Ilya was an example of a normal guy who understood the social situation” another friend said. “When we had discussions [about politics in class] Ilya’s views -- although they were patriotic -- were pretty close to the [relatively liberal] position of his father before he stepped down.”

Dmitry Medvedev was president from 2008 to 2012 steered into the top office by Putin and served as prime minister from 2012 until a government reshuffle that occurred in January 2020 amid preparations for a constitutional change that allows Putin to seek reelection in 2024 and 2030.

His public rhetoric has changed dramatically since then and particularly since Russia launched the large-scale invasion of Ukraine in February. He has railed against Kyiv and the West in Instagram posts that rival some of the most poisonous pro-war anti-Ukrainian propaganda on state television.

'You Shouldn't Cross The Prime Minister's Son'

Another interlocutor recalled that Ilya Medvedev spoke “rather freely” about political topics did not repeat pro-government rhetoric and did not harbor any negative attitudes toward the West.

“If we had more guys like Ilya -- capable young ambitious --and if we had normal transfers of power things [in Russia] would be better” another friend added.

During his time at MGIMO Medvedev was particularly close friends with two fellow students: Ivan Koptenko the son of Ivan Koptenko a member of Russia’s legislature in the early 1990s who has been described in the media as an “oil speculator” and Ilya Trufanov the son of a mid-level businessman. Trufanov was considered the intellectual of the group -- “the most outstanding the wittiest the most erudite” one former student recalled.

During this period Trufanov was dating a fellow student named Yana Grigoryan. People who knew them at the time described their relationship as “very serious.” Somehow however Grigoryan ended up dating Medvedev and the two are still together several years later according to media reports and people who spoke with Current Time and Meduza.

“I think Trufanov accepted this because he understood you shouldn’t cross the prime minister’s son” one former student who knew them both said.

Rublyovka

In a 2016 interview with the tabloid Moskovsky komsomolets Ilya Medvedev stressed that he wanted to make a career on his own.

“I don’t want to work in a major state corporation” he said. “I’m interested in the things that young people are interested in -- like technology.”

Indeed the new graduate’s first job was with the social media company VK also known as VKontakte. According to a 2016 leaked database Medvedev was paid a little over 100000 rubles ($1500) a month while also studying at MGIMO for his master’s degree. He apparently left VK after about a year and in 2019 he took a job with Mail.ru for 226000 rubles ($3500) a month.

Both companies were part of the VK holding which was partially owned by the holding company of Kremlin-connected tycoon Alisher Usmanov.

“Ilya worked there thanks to his father’s name” a Kremlin-connected source said. “They wouldn’t just hire him on his own.”

Another source connected to Mail.ru said Medvedev “did something connected with the legal department. Two other sources who worked at VK until 2021 told Current Time and Meduza that Medvedev worked at the company but they didn’t know his title.

“They talked about him as long as five years ago but I never once saw him at work” one VK senior manager said.

Seven former and current VK employees confirmed they never saw Medvedev at the company. VK declined requests to comment.

Medvedev’s girlfriend Grigoryan worked for a company called Korklass according to a leaked 2019 tax database. Korklass is part of IKS Kholding an IT company owned by Anton Cherepennikov until recently a business partner of Usmanov’s. Korklass provides programming for “safe smart cities” and a controlling share of it is owned by a subsidiary of the state-owned Rostelekom.

Few observers were surprised that Ilya Medvedev and Grigoryan found work in companies tied to Usmanov. In 2017 the Anti-Corruption Foundation of opposition politician Aleksei Navalny released a report based on since-concealed Moscow property records that asserted Usmanov gifted then-President Medvedev a luxurious Rublyovka home worth some $50 million.

Usmanov denied the allegations and successfully sued Navalny in a Moscow court which ordered the opposition group to remove the video and publish a retraction. The Anti-Corruption Foundation stands by its report and has refused to comply with the court’s orders. The video has been viewed more than 45 million times.

A Love Of Wine

In September 2018 media reported on a gala party in Sochi at which Dmitry Medvedev’s wife Svetlana Medvedeva appeared. Observers noticed Ilya Grigoryan and their college friend Ivan Koptenko at the event as well.

Ilya Medvedev and his friends apparently also share a fondness for fine wines. The three of them and Koptenko’s girlfriend Kristina Khtei are all active users of the Vivino wine-evaluating and purchasing app. Although Medvedev does not use his own name on the app the other three all subscribe to two accounts that very likely are his. One is a private account under the name Il Vino 7 that is registered to an “Anton Belov.” A VK account registered under the name “Ilya Belov” is followed by Grigoryan and several former classmates of Medvedev’s. The account is also a fan of Dmitry Medvedev’s official page.

A second Vivino account under the name of Afanasy Medvedev was publicly available until shortly after Current Time and Meduza published this investigation in Russian. In some of the photographs of the wine bottles one can clearly see the reflection of a dark-haired young man wearing an Apple Watch. Grigoryan reviewed many of the same wines on the same day as “Afanasy” (Afanasy was Ilya Medvedev’s paternal great-grandfather’s name). One bottle that Medvedev particularly enjoyed sells for about 4600 euros a bottle.

Ilya Medvedev shares his interest in wine with his father who according to the Navalny report owned a winery in Italy’s Tuscany region. Both Medvedevs have been tied to the Skalisty Bereg wine-producing business in Russia’s Krasnodar region as well. The newspaper Sobesednik reported in 2017 that Dmitry Medvedev owns the winery through a foundation created by a friend from law school named Ilya Yeliseyev.

According to friends who spoke with Current Time and Meduza Khtei works for Skalisty Bereg and graduated from its sommelier training program. A leaked 2019 tax database identifies the company as her employer.

No Comment

No information has been released about Ilya Medvedev’s work as a United Russia member if any since he joined the ruling party in early June. Sources within the party told Current Time and Meduza that he has not been seen at any United Russia events. United Russia Deputy General Secretary Darya Lantratova said it was “too early” to discuss Medvedev’s party projects adding “Ilya Medvedev is still thinking.”

Ilya Medvedev declined to be interviewed or otherwise comment for this story as did Trufanov Grigoryan and Koptenko. Dmitry Medvedev did not respond to written queries submitted to his assistant Oleg Osipov. His former press secretary Natalya Timakova declined to comment.

After the Russian version of this story was published Usmanov’s press service sent a written statement saying that any assertion that “Usmanov ‘is close to the Medvedev family’ is false.” The press service said it was not “able to confirm or deny” the employment of Ilya Medvedev or his girlfriend in any company of Usmanov’s holding adding that Usmanov had no personal involvement in hiring decisions.

Meduza special correspondent Kristina Safonova and RFE/RL feature writer Robert Coalson contributed to this report.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vb25jdWJhbmV3cy5jb20vZW4vY3ViYS11c2EvcmVhY3RpdmF0ZXMtZmFtaWx5LXJldW5pZmljYXRpb24tcGFyb2xlLXByb2dyYW0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. Embassy in Cuba reactivates Family Reunification Parole Program | OnCubaNews English,"The United States embassy in Cuba announced that it has started processing pending applications for the Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program (CFRP) suspended in 2017.

Its statement says the following:

“USCIS has begun mailing interview notices to CFRP petitioners with beneficiary interview instructions. On August 18 USCIS began conducting interviews at the U.S. Embassy in Havana. USCIS has limited capacity to conduct interviews at this time so beneficiaries should not take any steps to prepare for an interview until their petitioner receives an interview notice.

“In addition USCIS is sending general information about the resumption of the program to petitioners with pending applications for the CFRP program.”

And it clarifies:

“USCIS is not issuing new letters of invitation at this time. We will update our website and make public announcements when the next round of CFRP program invitation notices is issued. A petitioner who previously submitted a CFRP application that is still pending should not submit another application.

“If you are a petitioner with a pending CFRP application please ensure that both USCIS and the Department of State’s National Visa Center have your current mailing address. To update your address with USCIS please use our online change of address tool. Contact the National Visa Center by submitting an online Public Inquiry Form.

“As USCIS resumes CFRP interviews we will not email or call you asking for money or fee payments. Don’t be a victim of an immigration scam. Visit the Avoid Scams page for information and resources.

“The CFRP program was established in 2007 to provide a safe and orderly pathway to the United States for certain Cuban beneficiaries of approved family-based immigration petitions. The program allows certain eligible U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents who receive a letter of invitation to apply for parole for their family members in Cuba. If USCIS approves these family members for parole they can travel to the United States before their immigrant visa priority dates take effect. CFRP processing was suspended due to the significant reduction in USG staff at the U.S. Embassy in Havana for security reasons in 2017 and the closure of the USCIS field office in Havana in 2018.”

Sept. 1 2022

The Minister of Sustainable Development Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management Hon. Orlando Habet said during an interview this week that he has visited the Gales Point community and confirmed that the residents are opposed to Vulcan Material Company’s proposal to establish a mining operation to extract limestone from the Sugar Hills located on the White Ridge Farm near the village. Minister Habet said that those hills serve a number of critical functions and are a landmark that can be seen by those traveling from the direction of Belize City to Gales Point by boat.

He remarked “I know that the people are really strongly against it not only because of the material that could possibly end up in the sea and affect the alkalinity of the ocean change the entire biodiversity of the area. We are also concerned that if those hills are broken down that is the only landmark from Belize City by boat over to Gales Point but also on the other side of biodiversity there are a lot of animal species that will be affected so really the Ministry does not look at it favorably either.”

This is yet another declaration of non-support by a Cabinet member in regard to Vulcan Material Company’s proposal to set up its mining operation in Belize. It must be noted that as previously reported the company’s mining operation in Mexico was shut down by the Mexican government due to severe and irreparable environmental damage caused in the area.

While at this point the government appears to have sided with members of the Gales Point community who are vehemently opposed to the project the multi-billion-dollar US-based company continues its efforts to carry out public information campaigns and meet with government officials. It is also seeking to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment.

“Anybody can apply but whether or not it will be approved is something else. But hopefully the government will have to decide if not now — rather sooner than later — on what kind of development it really wants going forward” Minister Habet said.

Notably Minister of Natural Resources Petroleum and Mining and Deputy Prime Minister Hon. Cordel Hyde has rejected the company’s advances. Additionally the Prime Minister Hon. John Briceño in a recent interview said that he does not think Cabinet will approve the company’s proposal and the Gales Point community’s area representative Minister of Human Development Hon. Dolores Balderamos Garcia has gone on the record to indicate her support of the members of her constituency who are rejecting the company’s proposals.",,,,,,,,,,,,

However an active catastrophe environment could weigh on the upside.



The P&C insurers continue to witness better pricing though the magnitude has slowed down. Global commercial insurance prices for the last reported quarter increased 9% per Marsh Global Insurance Market Index but marked a slowdown in pace for the sixth straight quarter.



Per Willis Towers Watson’s 2022 Insurance Marketplace Realities report rates will continue to rise but by a small margin. Better pricing ensures improved premiums and prudent claims payment. Per Deloitte insights global non-life premiums are estimated to grow 3.7% in 2022.



With Fed raising rates four times already this year and indicating more hikes in the future insurers being the direct beneficiaries of an improving rate environment are poised to benefit.



P&C insurers’ profitability is inversely related to catastrophic events. Colorado State University (CSU) expects an active Atlantic hurricane season this year with 18 named storms. These include eight hurricanes and four major hurricanes. This year’s hurricane season could be about 120% of the average season per CSU.



Nonetheless the insurance industry continues to witness accelerated digitalization and players are investing heavily in technology to improve scale and efficiencies. Per Deloitte Insights the technology budget is projected to increase 13.7% in 2022.



Solid policyholders’ surplus will help the industry absorb losses. Also given the solid capital level insurers are actively pursuing strategic mergers and acquisitions and investing in growth initiatives apart from engaging in share buybacks increasing dividends or paying out special dividends.



The industry has lost 5.2% year to date compared with the Finance sector’s decrease of 14.6% and the Zacks S&P 500 composite’s decline of 17.7%.



Here we focus on two property and casualty insurers namely W.R. Berkley Corporation WRB and Arch Capital Group Ltd. ACGL. W.R. Berkley is one of the nation’s largest commercial lines property casualty insurance providers. Arch Capital Group offers insurance reinsurance and mortgage insurance across the world.

Rehoboth man on top of the arm wrestling world

REHOBOTH – Jerry Cadorette is on top of the arm wrestling world.

In August Cadorette won the title of World Champion arm wrestler at the East vs. West Competition in Turkey.

""I'm pushing I'm pushing I'm pushing and then I get one last surge and as you can see I'm covered in sweat"" Cadorette said while watching video of the winning moment.

Now 49 years old the Rehoboth man has been competing since high school.

""The competition is getting younger and these people are coming in as my kids' ages"" Cadorette said.

So what does it take to be a world champ?

Well in Jerry's case balance. Between workouts and practice he's the General Manager of Camping World in Berkley.

""He's a wonderful boss he runs the company really well here and he's the reason why I stay"" Camping World employee Cynthia Wolent said.

""The problem is my competition their only job is arm wrestling. Mine is I have a family I have a business and I'm super busy"" Cadorette said.

It's a juggling act that's difficult but worth it.

""I'll tell you there's no way to express how awesome it feels to be No. 1 in the planet at anything. But to be No. 1 and approaching my age approaching 50 and to be able to say you're the No. 1 on the planet"" said Cadorette.

Next up Cadorette will defend his title in November.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vb3V0ZG9vcnMvMjAyMi8wOS90b3VybmFtZW50LXdpbm5lci1zaG9ja3MtbGFrZS1lcmllLXdhbGxleWUtYW5nbGVycy1uZS1vaGlvLWZpc2hpbmctcmVwb3J0Lmh0bWzSAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2xldmVsYW5kLmNvbS9vdXRkb29ycy8yMDIyLzA5L3RvdXJuYW1lbnQtd2lubmVyLXNob2Nrcy1sYWtlLWVyaWUtd2FsbGV5ZS1hbmdsZXJzLW5lLW9oaW8tZmlzaGluZy1yZXBvcnQuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tournament winner shocks Lake Erie walleye anglers: NE Ohio fishing report,"CLEVELAND Ohio -- There are a couple of traditional ways to catch Lake Erie walleye in summertime. Anglers cast with forward spinners or small spinner rigs tipped with a nightcrawler or they troll a variety of diving plugs spoons or spinner rigs.

John Hoyer of Orono Minn. however has pioneered the technique of casting plastic swim baits to weed beds for walleye an unusual way to hook trophy walleye without using live bait. His favorite is the Berkley Champion Swimmer a fish-shaped 3.8-inch soft plastic minnow-style lure with a paddle tail.

It worked so well in the National Walleye Trail Championship at Dunkirk N.Y. Aug. 24-26 that Hoyer caught a 15-fish limit weighing 102.33 pounds. His first-place prizes were a Ranger 621 fishing boat worth $129469 and $33474 in cash.

His boat partner on the final day Duane Hjelm of Pierre S.D. finished second with 90.87 pounds winning the Lucas Oil Angler of the Year title. Jason Prtzekurat of Stevens Point Wisc. was third and Sammy Cappelli of Youngstown was 28th with 46.52 pounds.

Most of the 40-angler field trolled the depths of Lake Erie along the New York and Pennsylvania shorelines and found success. Hoyer and Hjelm instead headed north to the Canadian shoreline where near-shore eelgrass beds were abundant.

Using a Berkley PowerBait The Champ Swimmer Hoyer said he would cast into the eelgrass snap the bait as hard as possible to clear the grass and walleye would bite it on the fall. His best colors were HD Bluegill and HD Yellow Perch.

“I was letting the lure free fall as fast as it possibly could and the walleye would absolutely inhale it” Hoyer told the weigh-in crowd. “I would use a 1/2-ounce up to a 1-ounce Fusion 19 swimbait jighead depending on the current. With the heavier jighead the lure falls even faster and they hit it even harder.

“That snapping action is the most fun way to catch a walleye. To see how fast they come and hit it is breathtaking. The only rod I used was a 7-foot medium heavy Fenwick World Class rigged with 10-pound Fireline and a 15-pound Trilene fluorocarbon leader.”

While most of the tournament field was trolling in 70 feet of water Hoyer was casting to the weeds in 6 to 12 feet of water — and winning with a 6.8-pound average for his 15 walleye.

Geneva Open wraps up LEWT: The final Lake Erie Walleye Trail regular season tournament will drop anchor at Geneva State Park Marina with weigh-ins on Saturday starting at 3 p.m. said Tournament Director Jason Fischer. The Geneva GOTL Open has 80 entrants and a team meeting tonight.

The LEWT Championship will be held in Cleveland Sept. 30-Oct. 1 at the Lakefront Reservation/East 72nd StreetFishing Area. Weigh-in spectators welcome.

The value of fishing tournaments: Having competed in a variety of fishing tournaments and attended a wealth of weigh-ins over the years the tournaments have been fodder for a lots of features on new and different ways to catch fish.

Tournament anglers such as Minnesota’s John Hoyer are masters of angling invention and pro fishermen know that cutting-edge fishing tactics can’t be kept secret for very long. Since Hoyer began probing Lake Erie weed beds for walleye a legion of fishermen are going to want to try the technique.

Many years ago most local fishermen cast weight-forward spinners for walleye on a season that ran from June until the winter ice arrived. Minnesota and South Dakota tournament anglers brought trolling tactics to Lake Erie for spring and summer walleye fishing. Spring fishing was considered too difficult because walleye were spawning until western U.S. anglers began casting lead-head jigs and blade baits to to the shallow western Lake Erie reefs to find success.

Lorain walleye catches consistent: The walleye fishing has been good this week in waters shallower than 30 feet and deeper than 50 feet off Lorain. Trolling small crankbaits like Flicker Minnows and small spoons or tandem spinner rigs and nightcrawlers have been the best bet.

Remember that spinner blades are designed not to roll and tangle at various speeds. Colorado blades work best with a slower troll such as under 2 miles per hour. Indiana blades can be trolled at about 2.5 miles per hour while willow blades can be run at up to 3 miles per hour."

The new boosters were authorized by federal health officials earlier this week in hopes of preventing another winter surge in cases while simultaneously reducing the continuing spread of the BA.5 omicron cases.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has counted more than 94.3 million U.S. cases and more than one million deaths. The agency says 34.8% of Americans age 5+ have received the first booster dose.

Previously COVID-19 vaccines have targeted the original coronavirus strain even as wildly different mutants emerged. However the new U.S. boosters are combination or ""bivalent"" shots. They contain half that original vaccine recipe and half protection against the newest omicron versions BA.4 and BA.5 that are considered the most contagious yet.

CDC APPROVES UPDATED COVID-19 VACCINES TARGETING OMICRON VARIANT

People who are at least 18 years old can get the Moderna bivalent COVID-19 booster as long as it's been at least two months after their primary or booster vaccination. People who are at least 12 years old can get the Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent COVID-19 booster as long as it's been at least two months since their primary or booster vaccination.

Additionally patients can get either booster regardless of the primary dose series or booster vaccine they received previously.

Under the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program 21 national pharmacy partners and independent pharmacy networks are working to broaden access to COVID-19 vaccinations according to the CDC. The list includes Albertsons Kroger Publix Super Markets Rite Aid Walgreens and Walmart.

Police report that a 52-year-old man jumped from an 18th floor balcony of 56 Leonard yesterday Friday Sept. 2. EMS responded at 12:25p to investigate a DOA; they pronounced the man deceased. The medical examiner has since ruled the death a suicide.

He was identified by police as Gustavo Arnal and he lived at 56 Leonard and was the CFO of Bed Bath & Beyond moving here from London to join the company in May 2020.

The company acknowledged his death on Sunday issuing a press statement and saying that the entire organization is “profoundly saddened by this shocking loss.”

“I wish to extend our sincerest condolences to Gustavo’s family” said Harriet Edelman independent chair of the company’s board of directors. “Gustavo will be remembered by all he worked with for his leadership talent and stewardship of our Company. I am proud to have been his colleague and he will be truly missed by all of us at Bed Bath & Beyond and everyone who had the pleasure of knowing him. Our focus is on supporting his family and his team and our thoughts are with them during this sad and difficult time. Please join us in respecting the family’s privacy.”

Arnal had a long career in finance that included positions at Avon Walgreens Boots Alliance and Procter & Gamble. At Bed Bath & Beyond the company said that he was “instrumental in guiding the organization throughout the coronavirus pandemic.”

The Times reports that a putative securities class action and shareholder derivative action was filed with the SEC on August 23 against the company Gustavo Arnal  and certain third parties in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The case Si v. Bed Bath & Beyond Corp. asserts “claims of breach of fiduciary duty negligent misrepresentation and violations of the Exchange Act. Arnal had recently sold tens of thousands of shares in the company according to the filings.

WMT,Walmart,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVuYml6LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3dhbG1hcnQtcmVhY2hlcy1oYWxmd2F5LXByb2plY3QtZ2lnYXRvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart reaches halfway to Project Gigaton,"Much has been written about Walmart’s main sustainability program Project Gigaton — the ambition to reduce or avoid 1 billion metric tons (a gigaton) of greenhouse gases from its supply chain by 2030. Now five years in the retail giant is claiming in its recent fiscal year 2022 ESG report to be halfway to its goal having avoided 574 million metric tons by engaging with over 4500 suppliers.

In 2020 and 2021 Walmart avoided or reduced 230 million metric tons and 416 million metric tons of carbon emissions since 2017 before reaching the 574 million cumulative this year. And the 4500 suppliers represent 70 percent of Walmart’s U.S. product sales.

""It's a big number and we know we need to do more"" said Jane Ewing senior vice president of sustainability at Walmart. ""But it gives us confidence that we’re on track to delivering on that commitment.""

A gigaton of greenhouse gases accounts for about 30 percent of Walmart’s Scope 3 footprint in line with the Paris agreement's plans for 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming.

Reaching the halfway point of a 13-year commitment with eight years still to come is quite the achievement. But it does beg the question: Has Walmart grabbed all the low-hanging fruit reduced or avoided the easiest emissions and recruited the most engaged suppliers making the next 50 percent a much harder task?

We want to make sure we democratize access for everybody; we want every supplier to come along the journey.

According to Zach Freeze senior director of sustainable initiatives at Walmart Project Gigaton has already brought most of its largest suppliers on board. The company knows that the next 50 percent of the goal won’t come from signing up thousands of new suppliers.

""We are still incrementally adding suppliers here and there"" he said. ""Likely not going to be as large companies but that still doesn't mean that it’s not worth pursuing. We want to make sure we democratize access for everybody; we want every supplier to come along the journey.

""We do know that there are suppliers that are not engaged. And with our buying partners [we can] have the right conversations with them and encourage them to join.""

But most of the focus for Walmart is on driving initiatives and programs to further reductions inside companies that have already come on board.

Part of that shift according to Ewing is the newly added pillars — nature transportation and people — to Walmart's sustainability and ESG core principles. The company is trying to emphasize new tools to educate suppliers and continue to make progress along the sustainability journey. Freeze believes the most reduction opportunities are in food transportation packaging waste and refrigeration to avoid and reduce that last 426 million tons.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZWR3YXJkc2VnYWwvMjAyMi8wOS8wMy9ob3ctd2FsbWFydC1yZXNwb25kZWQtdG8tcGlsb3RzLXRocmVhdC10by1jcmFzaC1wbGFuZS1pbnRvLXN0b3JlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Walmart Responded To Pilot's Threat To Crash Plane Into Store,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/edwardsegal/2022/09/03/how-walmart-responded-to-pilots-threat-to-crash-plane-into-store/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZWR3YXJkc2VnYWwvMjAyMi8wOS8wMy9ob3ctd2FsbWFydC1yZXNwb25kZWQtdG8tcGlsb3RzLXRocmVhdC10by1jcmFzaC1wbGFuZS1pbnRvLXN0b3JlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVzdGFycHJlc3MuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvY3JpbWUvMjAyMi8wOS8wMi9tdW5jaWUtbWFuLWNoYXJnZWQtaW4td2FsbWFydC1zbGF5aW5nLXRvLXB1cnN1ZS1pbnNhbml0eS1kZWZlbnNlLzY1NDY4NjA5MDA3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Muncie man charged in Walmart slaying to pursue insanity defense,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.thestarpress.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /story/news/crime/2022/09/02/muncie-man-charged-in-walmart-slaying-to-pursue-insanity-defense/65468609007/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000016711ACB700>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVzdGFycHJlc3MuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvY3JpbWUvMjAyMi8wOS8wMi9tdW5jaWUtbWFuLWNoYXJnZWQtaW4td2FsbWFydC1zbGF5aW5nLXRvLXB1cnN1ZS1pbnNhbml0eS1kZWZlbnNlLzY1NDY4NjA5MDA3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rdnVlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvdGV4YXMvd2FsbWFydC13aXRoZHJhd3MtdGV4YXMtbGF3c3VpdC1vdmVyLWxpcXVvci1zdG9yZS1sYXcvMjY5LTg5MzU2MWE3LWVhZGQtNDNiOS04NTZmLTgzNDhlODdlMTA2MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart withdraws Texas lawsuit over liquor store law,"This isn't the first time Walmart has met Texas in court over liquor law.

AUSTIN Texas — According to a report from The Dallas Morning News Walmart is stepping down in its legal fight against a liquor store law in Texas.

Last summer the retailer filed a lawsuit in Austin challenging a portion of the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Code stopping publicly traded retailers from owning liquor stores.

This reportedly marked the second time Walmart has met Texas in court. The company had originally sued in 2015 a battle it initially won three years later. However the ruling was reversed in 2019.

The Dallas Morning News reported that Walmart isn't giving up on its efforts in Texas just yet potentially looking into options to build spaces in its stores with separate entrances for liquor sales.

Currently Walmart is allowed to sell liquor in more than two dozen states.

The site features news and highlights workforce diversity data and inclusive storytelling across the company.

From spotlighting unique personal stories to introducing creative musical explorations of classic Disney songs the Reimagine Tomorrow site invites everyone to see themselves and their perspectives represented in meaningful ways.

To mark the one-year anniversary of the site we’re adding more original content to celebrate the diversity of Disney. Something we’re especially excited about it is the introduction of five musical artists as part of our Recital of Remixes page. This original music series presents up-and-coming independent artists reimagining beloved Disney songs. Fans can look forward to discovering these new artists from various backgrounds and genres as they put their own unique spin on the classic “Go the Distance” from Disney’s “Hercules”(1997) now available to stream on Disney+. The new artists to be announced during D23 Expo will take part in special live performances at this year’s D23 Expo. Stay tuned for their reimagined songs to be released via Walt Disney Records everywhere songs are streamed on September 9.

Nearly 100 years ago Walt Disney set his company on a path that would revolutionize the entertainment industry and the ReimagineTomorrow.Disney.com website is just one of the many ways we are sharing stories that reflect our ever-changing world.

When visiting the Disney Park Guests are drawn to the iconic attractions like Haunted Mansion Pirates of the Caribbean Jungle Cruise Space Mountain Splash Mountain (which is about to be rethemed to Princess and the Frog) Big Thunder Mountain Railroad and many other rides.

The Park has continued to grow and expand over the years with additions like Seven Dwarfs Mine Train and the highly-anticipated TRON Lightcycle/Run which is now testing.

However a major change was just introduced that has many fans split. Yesterday we reported that Disney World had revealed some boozy new concoctions to debut at Magic Kingdom and this has set up a spirited conversation from many who believe adding more alcohol isn’t the way to go versus those who are excited about the new offerings.

Many Disney fans have shared that Walt Disney himself “would not have wanted it this way.”

“No liquor no beer nothing. Because that brings in a rowdy element. That brings people that we don’t want and I feel they don’t need it” Disney said in a famous Saturday Evening Post interview.

“I honestly think that this will be a huge disaster and mistake Disney has dug themselves a deep hole already and I’m sure they don’t want it further” one user wrote. “Apparently they don’t care about how many more problems between guests and workers could arise from this but hey they already dug themselves low might as well just let them go further and just really continues to show me that they are more about the green anymore and don’t care about families don’t care about their workers or what they use to stand for. Way to go guys Walt would be proud of you hope you realize this is sarcasm you really destroyed the industry for me so thank you I deeply appreciate it and don’t expect any support from me for it or if any it is only to go towards franchises in which you think you should profit from which I think should be shut off too.”

Another user pointed out that they felt the behavior in Disney “was already bad enough” without the introduction of more alcohol.

“Are you sure you want to do this? With all the problems with the guests lately why would you want to give them more reasons to act badly? Beer and wine are enough to get them to act crazy but adding liquor just sends them off It all comes down to money right?”

Others have pointed out that Disney has still kept Magic Kingdom relatively dry only allowing alcohol to be bought at table-service restaurants. This is a major discrepancy from EPCOT’s alcohol policy for example.

No matter what side of the fence you fall on all of these new drinks will make their debut on September 13 2022.

The new cocktails can be seen below:

Jungle Bird Cocktail – Gosling Black Rum Campari and cane syrup blended with pineapple and lime juices.

Golden Haze Margarita — Teremana Blanco Tequila Grand Marnier agave syrup lime juice and smoked chili bitters.

Gold Rush – Elijah Craig Bourbon lemon juice and honey garnished with crystallized ginger.

Magical Beacon Cocktail – Created in celebration of the 50th Anniversary is this concoction of Empress 1908 Gin Bols Blue Curacao Minute Maid premium lemonade Orgeat (almond) lemon hibiscus grenadine and a souvenir glow cube.

Each item’s availability may be limited or subject to change. For more information on the cocktails and the location to find them inside the Disney Park please click here.

Imagine it’s 1965. Disneyland is about to celebrate its 10th anniversary. “Mary Poppins” is a global phenomenon. There is talk of a mysterious Disney “Project X” going around. And you are asked to travel the world representing Walt Disney as “Disneyland’s Ambassador to the World.” This was the position Julie Reihm Casaletto found herself in prior to becoming the first Disney Ambassador. Since then Disney Ambassadors have represented our parks and resorts around the world for nearly 60 years of memories and stories. This year at D23 Expo you can hear these stories first-hand at The Walt Disney Archives Stage with Disney Parks Through the Decades: A Disney Ambassador Perspective. From receiving personal advice from Walt Disney to walking construction sites of our biggest parks and projects Disney Ambassadors have had an exclusive front-row seat and inside track to all things Disney.





“D23 Expo is where pixie dust is happening” Julie shared on returning to D23 Expo for the first time since being named a Disney Legend in 2015. While the Disney Ambassador program’s history all started with Julie she originally turned down the role when it was first offered. Born in Galveston Texas and moving to California at a young age Long Beach became her home. After high school Julie went on to study English and Mass Communication at Cal State Long Beach while working weekends as a Disneyland Tour Guide. Those weekend tours led her to her first interaction with Walt Disney. While touring guests along Main Street U.S.A. Walt had tagged along with her tour. As Julie says “one lady was unhappy that a man who had not paid was enjoying the details of the tour.” Walt was not recognized by the guest or anyone else in the party and would continue to follow until rounding the corner in Adventureland when Walt winked to Julie and walked away. “It was my first of many occasions to witness Walt’s impish and boyish delight when observing others being in awe of his ‘baby’ as Walt called Disneyland.”

After two years of leading tours Julie was encouraged to apply for a new role. With Walt’s commitments continuing to increase and the upcoming “Tencennial” celebration of Disneyland a new position was created to serve as a representative for Walt Disney and Disneyland to travel the world speaking for Walt when he could not be there. While the opportunity was once-in-a-lifetime Julie didn’t wish to lose a full semester of straight A’s in her junior year of college. But with a little convincing from Walt Disney himself Julie accepted the job. “Walt was instrumental in convincing me the experience would prove to be educational too. He was right!”

The next year would be unforgettable for Julie from serving as Walt’s co-star for the “Wonderful World of Color” to getting to know Walt’s family and studio executives every day was something new. At the end of the year Julie would go back to school to finish her degree but the Disney Ambassador program was officially established. The success of Julie in the role convinced leadership the program had a valuable part to play. Connie Swanson Lane was selected as the 1966 Disney Ambassador of Disneyland. In 1971 the Disney Ambassador program would expand to Walt Disney World with the selection of Debbie Dane Browne. Since then the Disney Ambassador program has only grown with Disney Ambassadors now all around the world making a Global Disney Ambassador Team. This D23 Expo you can hear from many of these iconic and historical Disney cast members.





“It’s an honor” Connie Lane Swanson shared on taking to the D23 Expo stage. “It is both the guests and cast members that are the heart of Disney magic.”





Debby Dane Browne who started as one of the original 14 hostesses of the Walt Disney World Preview Center shared a similar feeling. “To be a part of D23 Expo and the Disney Ambassador panel is another dream come true and my cheers of joy will be heard from Sleeping Beauty Castle to Cinderella Castle!” This will be Debbie’s first return to Disneyland since her Disney Ambassador training in 1971 after being selected as Walt Disney World’s first Disney Ambassador.

Disney Ambassadors from Hawaii to Paris will take the stage at D23 Expo with the 2022-2023 Global Ambassador Team

Julie Connie Debby and other Disney Ambassador Alumni from Hawaii to Paris look forward to sharing their stories at Disney Parks Through the Decades: A Disney Ambassador Perspective on The Walt Disney Archives Stage at 4 p.m. Sunday only at D23 Expo. We also have an exciting announcement and exclusive giveaway that involves our iconic Disney Parks trees! You will now be able to take the parks home with you like never before and everyone attending will receive a numbered collectible medallion.

According to The Wall Street Journal’s Jessica Toonkel and Sarah Krouse The Walt Disney Company is considering introducing a membership program similar to Amazon Prime.

The program could offer things like guest discounts and perks on Disney+ subscriptions theme park tickets and merchandise with the purchase of a monthly or annual membership fee. Currently there is no timeframe established and it is important to note that according to insider’s claims it is still very early in the discussions.

Disney’s Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Communications offer has confirmed that the company is in fact considering the option. The program has an advocate in Disney CEO Bob Chapek who has worked to get Disney to cross-sell across its various platforms. The idea is to create more value for customers while at the same time Disney would collect more information about customers’ individual preferences.

Presently Disney does offer a membership program in D23 though the new venture would focus more on casual Disney fans.

The Wall Street Journal claims that Disney is also working on a retail component to add to Disney+. Shirts themed accessories and children’s costumes would be available through shopDisney exclusively for subscribers. It is expected this feature will be introduced before the conclusion of 2022.

A membership service like Amazon Prime along with Disney’s diversified portfolio could allow Disney to harness various points of data about customer interest.

A launch date for the membership program has not been announced. Check back for updates.

Yesterday (September 1) Warner Bros Discovery and BT Sport finalized a 50/50 joint venture that combines BT Sport with Eurosport UK. The two brands will initially remain separate but plans are underway to launch a new sports entity. As yet unnamed it will have the rights to the Olympic Games the Premier League Uefa Champions League Premiership Rugby MotoGP UFC Boxing WWE and the tennis Grand Slams.

“It’s important for fans to know they can continue to enjoy BT Sport and Eurosport UK as they do today and we’ll keep them updated on future plans as soon as we can” said Andrew Georgiou board member of the joint venture and president and managing director of Warner Bros Discovery Sports Europe.

The partnership is rival only to Sky in the UK market which also has Premier League and Uefa rights along with Rugby Union English cricket the US Open darts and World Cup fixtures. Saul Walkinshaw the investment performance director at Havas Media Group says it is “debatable” how worried Sky should be about the news. “But looking further down the line it would seem foolhardy not to take it seriously.”

According to Walkinshaw Sky’s biggest threat from the new venture will be more than just sport. “Sky’s premium entertainment films and sports offerings have traditionally been unmatched in the UK until the arrival of Netflix and Amazon Prime – especially from a commercial perspective.”

In 2024 Sky’s content deal with Warner Bros Discovery-owned HBO expires stripping it of premium US imports such as Game of Thrones Succession and Euphoria. Meanwhile the joint venture will be the owner of all that content through Warner Bros Discovery’s newly merged streaming service.

“Adding that content to the sports on BT Eurosport would create a nicely diverse and ’sticky’ package for a discerning consumer who’s looking for broader choice and not just sport or movies” says Walkinshaw.

He calls it a “win” for advertisers: “It’s always positive to have new players in the marketplace and more opportunities for brands to create targeted meaningful media experiences.”

Sports marketing consultant Dan Tunna has previously worked at both Discovery and BT Sport. He says: “Together they have the rights and resources to rival Sky’s position of dominance.” For advertisers looking to capitalize on the combined offering Tunna says the new entity “will provide significance reach across multiple platforms and channels”.

Away from Sky other main commercial sports broadcasters are ITV Dazn and (to a lesser extent) Channel 4. Amazon Prime Video is also starting to make an impact with tennis tournaments and some Champions League matches.

Michael Hannan broadcast director at Total Media explains that “the buying power of the joint venture will present a big challenge” to the other UK sports broadcasters “who could seek to increase their share of the Premier League”.

With the combination of HBO Max and Discovery+’s inventory Hannan expects “more subscribers moving over and creating more opportunities for advertisers across sporting events”.

Gregor Chalmers head of broadcast at the indie media agency The Kite Factory says live sport offers “an increasingly rare opportunity for advertisers to reach a large audience all watching the same content at the same time in a shared moment”.

Chalmers ponders whether the joint venture will establish a new sales house and whether that will lead to increased competition in the broadcaster sales arena. “This would be a bold move but would increase the options on the table for agencies and brands and as the Lionesses showed us this summer there is a healthy appetite to get behind true sporting success stories” he says. “Speak to any TV buyer and they’ll tell you that competition can only be a good thing so we’ll be watching this space carefully.”

“Sports products live and die by the rights” adds TV and online video analyst at Omdia Matthew Evenson. According to Evenson their combined sports rights might “help to reduce churn when popular sports such as Premier League football are in their off-season as subscribers may decide to keep their subscription if they have access to other events”.

Looking at the rest of the market Everson adds that the merger will help the two businesses “stay competitive” as the streamers and tech giants like Amazon and Apple join the live sporting arena.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNici5jb20vd2FybmVyLWJyb3MtZGlzY292ZXJ5LWFkb3B0aW5nLWN3LWJ1c2luZXNzLW1vZGVsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Warner Bros.

The $90 million project was unanimously approved by the Falls planners Aug. 23 but must still go before the Falls Board of Supervisors for final approval.

Attorney Michael Meginniss representing Waste Management said the two 20000 square-foot facilities to be built on the 47-acre parcel on New Ford Mill Road an industrial area will allow Waste Management to prevent or reduce 170000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions from going into the atmosphere annually.

In an email Meginniss said ""We will be requesting a few waivers from the Subdivision Land Development Ordinance in front of the supervisors."" It is scheduled for the Oct. 17 supervisors' meeting said township Manager Matthew Takita.

""I think it's accurate to state this is one of if not the largest investment in the region for this sort of renewable energy"" Meginniss said.

More:Waste Management's plan to expand landfill could be $135M revenue boost for Falls Township

Adam Stough project manager for the Waste Management Renewable Energy division added that the company is investing approximately $800 million in 17 such projects throughout the country over the next four years and the Falls plant would be the largest.

Natural gas produced at the site near Morrisville could be shipped to local WM truck fueling sites including in Bristol and Camden and shipped nationwide through a transcontinental pipe system. He said the project will recover and distribute 3 million MMBtu's a year. Natural gas is measured in metric million British thermal units.

Waste Management can ""pick up garbage at the curb put it in the landfill. Take the landfill gas clean it up inject it in the pipeline and then it's pulled back out at one of our 160 natural gas fueling stations in the country"" Stough said.

The company's Fairless Landfill Complex includes three separate landfills: Fairless GROWS and GROWS North. The company said it has three ultra-low emission (ULE) flares being used as the primary burn for the landfill gas and five enclosed flares are used as backups.

""The Fairless RNG Facility will become the preferred means of managing landfill gas collected from the Fairless complex with any excess gas controlled by one of the three ULE flares with the remaining two flares available as a backup to the RNG plant. The five enclosed flares will be decommissioned and taken out of service at the complex"" WM said in announcing the project.

For these reasons we expect that plastics will continue to play an important role in supply chains globally despite efforts to move away from single-use plastics. But with rising demand comes a significant amount of plastic waste. This creates two related challenges along with opportunities for businesses to help address them:

About the authors Thomas Hundertmark





This article is a collaborative effort by Wenting Gao Gillian Pais  Andrew Ryba and Jeremy Wallach representing views from McKinsey’s Chemicals Practice.

The need to reduce plastic-waste pollution. When plastic waste is not properly managed it can leak into the environment—most notably into the ocean near coastal cities.

The need to increase plastic circularity. Many brand owners have committed to using recycled plastic content in packaging but the supply has been constrained. Unlocking circular plastics will require addressing collection and building out recycling capacity.

Several global public- and private-sector alliances have formed to act on these goals. One such alliance is the United Nations Environment Assembly which resolves to forge an international legally binding agreement to end plastics pollution. In this article we look at what stakeholders could do to best manage the increasing volumes of plastic waste. Our research has found that the answer is twofold: first emerging economies could prioritize investing in modern waste management systems to eliminate waste leakage; and second value chain participants could invest in new business models that span collection sortation and recycling capacity to increase plastic circularity.

The need to reduce plastic waste

In 2018 about 80 million metric tons of plastic waste were not managed to international standards including via open dumping open burning and substandard landfills. Five million to ten million metric tons of waste also ended up in the ocean according to McKinsey research (Exhibit 1) much of which came from Indonesia the Philippines Sri Lanka and Vietnam.

1

Indeed Asian countries including China India Indonesia Thailand and Vietnam account for about 85 percent of mismanaged plastic waste globally. Overall about 15 countries contribute about 80 percent of total global plastic waste which amounts to 270 million metric tons each year.

For these countries the problem goes beyond plastic-waste pollution. The real issue is that they lack complete waste management systems. And building a comprehensive waste management system would require significant government intergovernmental and private-sector funding.

We envision one integrated solution rather than piecemeal approaches that are unlikely to integrate at scale. Ultimately fully functioning waste management systems are part of economic development supporting both improved hygiene and quality of life. We also see an opportunity for emerging economies to leapfrog current approaches by designing waste management systems that can enable more efficient recycling and help emerging economies avoid some of the challenges facing developed economies today.

Building out a fully functional waste management system in emerging economies together with a broad profile of supporting infrastructure could cost $560 billion to $680 billion over ten years. This investment includes roads landfills waste-to-energy facilities trucks trash points and recycling. Changes such as these would strengthen economic development by enabling transportation and commerce and it would also support quality of life by improving health hygiene sanitation and cleanliness. Such a system would aim to manage about 850 million metric tons a year of projected waste including—but not limited to—plastic waste (Exhibit 2). This is a significant investment for budget-constrained emerging economies where governments must balance priorities such as education healthcare energy and public safety.

To accelerate progress governments will need to make waste management a priority—potentially with the aid of external support. Public funding will be required for non-revenue-producing infrastructure such as roads. Private capital might be attracted to infrastructure investments that could be part of an ongoing business including transportation landfills recycling and waste-to-energy plants. Public–private partnerships could also provide a platform for more creative collaboration models as well as additional sources of funding (for example output-focused contracts for municipal solid-waste collection).

Recycling challenges in emerging markets Waste collection and disposal systems in emerging markets are often complex informal and limited in reach. In Kenya for example only 20 percent of waste is formally collected. Thirty-five percent of waste is informally collected by individuals or community-based organizations while 45 percent is not collected at all and is dumped or burned.



The expansion of formal waste collection also faces challenges. For example in most of Africa waste collection is private (that is not run by the government or municipalities) meaning that households must pay for their waste to be collected. In many cases people refuse to pay. Subsequently the waste gets dumped or burned.



These challenges extend to creating circularity for plastics. For example landfill fees are low—$2 per truck in Nairobi compared with $100 or more per truck in developed countries. This discourages formally collected waste from being diverted to recycling given that it is much cheaper to dump than to recycle. Due to low capacity enforcement systems often cannot stop this from happening even where it is illegal.



Moreover the economics in emerging markets are not favorable for materials recovery facilities (MRFs). This is because there is limited to no sorting at the source so MRFs would have to process dirty and contaminated waste. Even then getting the waste diverted to recycling will continue to be difficult in light of low landfill fees unless governments create policies to send recyclable waste through an MRF. According to McKinsey analysis it would take more than ten years for a MRF in Kenya receiving dirty waste to reach cash-flow positivity. However with some minor incentives (such as free land or tax exemptions) or with higher dump site fees a MRF could become profitable.



As a result of these factors the availability of quality sorted plastic in emerging markets is limited with recyclers often having to set up their own collection and sorting systems and pay high prices for waste (versus in many developed countries where the waste producer must pay for the recycling). In fact to cover these costs economically in Kenya we estimate that a rigid polyethylene terephthalate (PET) recycler would require a subsidy of $35 to $45 per metric ton and a recycler of composites would require up to $500 per metric ton.

In addition to the large financial investment required there are many operational challenges—particularly in emerging economies—including ambiguous land-use rights the need for significant coordination with different government layers diversion of funds and challenges to foreign investment. As a result large-scale infrastructure projects and program rollouts are often delayed and require longer execution timelines (see sidebar “Recycling challenges in emerging markets”).

The need to increase plastic circularity

Market signals for recycled plastics and plastic circularity have been accelerating. More than 80 global consumer packaged goods packaging and retail companies have committed to achieving 15 to 50 percent recycled content in their packaging by 2025. Some companies have even made public commitments to premiums that they are willing to pay for recycled content. In the United States alone we expect the amount of recycled plastic waste to double or triple by 2030 to meet the commitments set out by individual brand owners and industry alliances. In addition to customer demand we are seeing growing regulatory action around the world with policies specifically targeting single-use plastics extended producer responsibility (EPR) regulations and recycled-content requirements (see sidebar “The role of extended producer responsibility”).

One of the biggest obstacles to scaling up recycling is access to sorted plastic-waste feedstock. In 2016 only about 16 percent of plastic waste was collected for recycling globally. Increasing that amount would require changes in consumer behavior the building out of infrastructure and investments in recycling capacity.

The role of extended producer responsibility More than 40 countries have created extended producer responsibility (EPR) schemes. Many of these countries are in Europe and Southeast Asia and some African countries are also exploring EPR. EPR transfers the cost of waste collection and recycling to the generators of the waste—typically the brand owner—in the form of a fee per metric ton of plastics (and other packaging or waste products) that they introduce into the market. These fees can vary. For example fees can be higher for harder-to-recycle packaging or lower for materials in high demand for their recycled output.



Typically participation in EPR schemes is mandatory in countries where they exist with private-sector actors participating in producer responsibility organizations (PROs) that collect fees and monitor waste production. In some jurisdictions (for example in the province of Ontario in Canada and in Germany) the private sector pays for a large part of municipality recycling programs through EPR.



In emerging markets PROs can use EPR to transfer fees to informal waste pickers who are then able to scale up and improve the volumes brought to recyclers. Some cities and states in India are pursuing a model that combines EPR with digital payment tools to help informal waste pickers make money and become part of the formal economy.

The economics of recycling vary greatly (Exhibit 3) mostly depending on where the waste is generated (emerging economy or developed economy) the form of plastic waste (rigid packaging flexible packaging or durable plastics) and the recycling pathway (mechanical or advanced recycling). Mechanical recycling and chemical recycling each has a role to play. Mechanical recycling keeps the polymer chain intact and is a more efficient way of enabling circular plastic production but it requires higher-quality well-sorted waste feedstock. Chemical recycling is a superior solution for dirtier streams of hard-to-recycle and commingled plastic waste. It produces virgin-quality high-performance recycled plastics as an output.

Based on existing technologies and assuming there are no business model breakthroughs recycling may be profitable for about 50 percent of plastic-waste volume today and there will be significant value at stake as markets expand. Practical limitations to overcome include collection issues (lack of participation and rural access) processing losses (contamination problems) and resin-type limitations (markets beyond widely used PET PE and PP ). However we see a few tailwinds that could help unlock more addressable volume and improve the business cases for recycling: higher committed volume of recycling offtake and higher price premiums; increasing carbon prices and more recycling mandates by governments; new models for waste collection backed by voluntary EPR schemes from leading brands; technological innovation that reduces costs and facilitates flexibility in feedstock; and large infrastructure investments that could enable and accelerate recycling scale-up.

Recycling may be profitable for about 50 percent of plastic-waste volume today and there will be significant value at stake as markets expand.

What stakeholders can do

Stakeholders across the plastic-waste value chain could consider the following actions to address the waste challenge while scaling up new markets for circular plastics.

Take a local and regional approach

It’s important to recognize that each community has a different starting point. In particular in emerging economies the first priority is to get waste collected ideally in a way that is compatible with recycling.

Given different levels of economic development technology-enabled solutions that are successful in developed economies may not be optimal for emerging economies. Instead more labor-intensive options may offer better near-term bridging opportunities in emerging economies (Exhibit 4). In developed economies plastic-waste pollution is minimal (most plastics are landfilled or incinerated) and these economies have an opportunity to consider how best to divert collected waste to drive more recycling and turn waste into value. In emerging economies costs to recover some streams are likely to be higher because there is no existing system for collection or sortation to build on.

Secure regulatory support

In emerging economies building out a waste management industry would require public-sector funding as well as a supportive regulatory framework to attract private capital to these large-scale infrastructure projects (potentially including the EPR approach mentioned above). Having the right waste management and collection infrastructure in place will not only help reduce waste leakage into the environment but also unlock new recycling opportunities by reducing business case risk and creating easier access to the right kinds of waste feedstock at lower cost.

Having the right waste management and collection infrastructure in place will not only help reduce waste leakage into the environment but also unlock new recycling opportunities.

Collectively define the future paradigm

Reducing plastic-waste pollution and increasing plastic circularity will require collaboration across the value chain. It could mean reimagining parts of the value chain and providing the right collaboration frameworks and incentive mechanisms. Accessing plastic-waste feedstock at scale with consistent quality and in a cost-effective way is a big challenge around the world. Addressing this issue will require an understanding of the needs and constraints of upstream and downstream partners and the identification of creative commercial offtake and partnership models. Some emerging collaboration cases include the following:

Some chemical and waste management companies are working together to secure the right feedstock and produce high-quality recycled plastics. For example LyondellBasell and SUEZ teamed up to create Quality Circular Polymers a polyolefin mechanical recycler.

Others are developing waste feedstock platforms to provide transparency and bridge stakeholders’ specific needs in waste plastics. One such platform is Cyclyx a joint venture between ExxonMobil and Agilyx that helps aggregate supply and demand of plastic-waste materials.

The production and use of plastics around the world will likely increase in the years to come. The value chain and broader society have the dual objectives of eliminating plastic-waste leakage and increasing plastic circularity. These require the deployment and optimization of waste management infrastructure as well as circular systems that can manage and—where possible—recycle the waste. Specific solutions vary by geography and the state of economic dev­el­opment. It is critical to find the right fit-for-purpose solutions that bring together the relevant stakeholders to collectively shape at-scale waste management infrastructure and recycling systems.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5tb25nYWJheS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS93ZWFrLXdhc3RlLW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtbGVhdmVzLWRoYWthLWNvbW11bml0aWVzLWF0LXJpc2stZnJvbS1sYW5kZmlsbC1zaXRlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Weak waste management leaves Dhaka communities at risk from landfill sites,"The four major waste landfills in Dhaka have left a serious environmental impact on the soil and groundwater of surrounding areas through leachate pollution a study shows.

It found levels of toxic metals in the surface and groundwater and in vegetable and rice crops in the vicinity of the landfill sites that were higher than prescribed safe limits.

Experts have called on the authorities to improve waste management including better coordination between municipal and national authorities as well as better-engineered landfill sites that minimize the chances of leaching hazardous waste.

Municipal authorities deny the pollution near the landfills is due to the waste leakage alone and say they plan to expand the city’s largest landfill site both aboveground and underground.

DHAKA — Muzammel Hoque 40 lives in the village of Konda near the largest landfill that services the city of Dhaka some 30 kilometers (19 miles) away.

“The landfill has destroyed the rich wetland biodiversity and cropland on which people’s livelihood depended” he said adding that “many villagers have shifted to other areas since the Dhaka city corporation started dumping waste here.”

For years landfills in Bangladesh such as the Amin Bazar facility near Konda have polluted the environment and posed a health threat to the people. The waste spreads into nearby neighborhoods and farms and toxic substances permeate into the ground with no protective layers or adequate waste disposal facilities in place.

Dhaka is served by four major landfills all of which have left a serious environmental impact on the soil and groundwater of surrounding areas through what’s known as leachate pollution a 2021 study shows.

The study by researchers at Dhaka’s Jahangirnagar University found toxic metals in the surface and groundwater in the vicinity of the landfill sites at concentrations higher than the safe limits determined by the Department of Environment and the World Health Organization (WHO).

This happens through the process of leachate pollution in which toxic liquids and heavy metals leak into the soil from solid waste that’s dumped in non-engineered landfills.

“It is necessary to have several protective layers at the bottom of an engineered and sanitary landfill but we didn’t find it in the ones in Dhaka’s outskirts” said study co-author Shafi Mohammad Tareq a professor at Jahangirnagar University’s Department of Environmental Sciences.

The study also found toxic chemicals in rice crops and various vegetables being grown near the landfills such as lead cadmium nickel and manganese. Consuming this food puts people at high risk of cardiomyogenic cancer the study authors warn.

“The landfills are just dumping grounds. They were not built following a sanitary model. There are no protective layers and synthetic membranes that can guard against the leachate pollution” Tareq said.

The study didn’t find the immediate presence or impact of heavy metals in people living near the sites. However experts say the contamination is a process of slow poisoning with a chronic effect on human health that’s not always immediately apparent.

There’s also growing concern over electronic waste pollution as Bangladesh lacks appropriate legislation and systematic e-waste management strategies. The country produces 3 million metric tons of e-waste annually including from ship-breaking yards according to another recent study.

The leachate from dumped e-waste including from cellphones refrigerators TVs computers and air conditioners also contains toxic heavy metals and chemicals that are detrimental to animals humans and the environment the study says.

“The government should support the e-waste industry as it can help economically as well as environmentally by reducing waste generation” said Dilip Kumar Datta a professor of environmental science at Khulna University who was not involved in either of the new studies.

Non-sanitary landfills

Municipal services in Dhaka are run by two city-owned corporations: Dhaka North City Corporation and Dhaka South City Corporation. Together they collect about 7500 metric tons of waste a day and dump it in the four landfills around Dhaka.

The Amin Bazar landfill next to the Dhaka-Aricha highway began operating in 2007 and has over the years adversely impacted tens of thousands of people living nearby especially in the villages of Konda and Baliarpur.

“It gets worse during the rainy season as rainwater carries the landfill waste into the neighborhoods. We are surrounded by stench and a layer of dark dirty water for days. Skin diseases are common among people living here” Muzammel said.

During the dry season the problems take a different form as the landfill spreads dust in the area leaving people with breathing problems and other respiratory issues added Muzammel who is also the Konda village council secretary.

The soil structure in Dhaka is generally thick and of high quality which works well against leachate pollution. However soil and farmland around the landfills are becoming contaminated because of flawed waste management that they structure of the soil alone can’t prevent Dilip said.

“City corporation authorities are barely aware of the concept of engineered landfill that ensures protection layers” he said.

Both Tareq and Dilip suggested the authorities introduce a central management system to ensure waste sorting during the collection phase; separate collection methods for organic electronic waste and medical waste; and solidification or stabilization for hazardous waste.

Both also said the government should consult waste management experts to address the issue and not continue to take a bureaucratic approach to the problem.

Lack of coordination on waste management

Bangladeshi authorities agree that landfills sites pose a hazard to the surrounding environment and communities but don’t agree on who should be responsible.

The Department of Environment and the Dhaka city corporations appear to have embarked on different projects to improve waste management without adequate coordination.

“We are preparing a solid waste management policy and on the design of a sanitary landfill” said Ziaul Haque a director at the Department of Environment. However he added responsibility for ensuring a sound waste management system falls on the Dhaka city corporations as the “DoE functions as a regulatory body while the city corporation works as an enforcement agency.”

The lack of coordination has had real consequences on waste management in the city. The Department of Environment recently had to suspend a $200 million project financed by the World Bank for proper waste management and source segregation in Dhaka due to the unwillingness of the Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) to join it according to officials.

DNCC chief executive Md. Selim Reza told Mongabay that the city was launching a waste-to-energy project effectively generating electricity from 3000 metric tons of waste daily.

“The city waste management will completely transform as soon as we move from waste to energy” he said.

Reza added waste management has become a major challenge in Dhaka because of the growing population of the city. That’s left the corporation looking to expand the landfills both aboveground and underground.

“DNCC is working to implement an underground waste management system” he said.

The corporation has reportedly acquired more than 20 hectares (50 acres) of land next to the Amin Bazar landfill where waste has pile up so high that it’s already overflowing.

However Reza denied that farms around Amin Bazar had been contaminated by the landfill and instead blamed “growing environmental pollution” all around.

By David Lochead

The RV Ludy Pudluk is back in Nunavut waters for its second year of inshore fishing research.

After spending last year in Sanikiluaq and Kinngait the $2.6-million research vessel has returned to Sanikiluaq to continue investigating what food species are at the bottom of the ocean in that area says Qikiqtaaluk Corporation director of fisheries Jerry Ward.

The Qikiqtaaluk Corporation-owned Ludy Pudluk was built in 2018.

The initial plan was to go to Sanirajak and Igloolik but ice conditions made it difficult to sail that far up initially so the crew returned to Sanikiluaq to build on last year’s work.

The plan is still to go up to Sanirajak and Igloolik later this year when ice conditions improve Ward said.

The research team’s long-term goal is to travel to various Nunavut communities do research and give locals the equipment and training necessary for them to develop their own fisheries for subsistence or commercial use.

One of the researchers on the boat this year is Jesslene Jawanda the project officer at Qikiqtaaluk Corporation’s fisheries division. She said the fish species they are looking for include shellfish scallops sea urchins clams and sea cucumber.

The research is done with help from local communities and their hunters and trappers associations. They provide traditional knowledge of the area while the Ludy Pudluk crew provides scientific equipment and training to use it.

Communities see various types of underwater species such as sea urchins inside the bellies of the walrus and whales they hunt but with the Ludy Pudluk’s help the communities are now getting the equipment needed to catch the bottom dwelling creatures.

That teamwork has been exciting Jawanda said describing how the crew has been able to show underwater footage of nearby ocean to people in communities like Sanikiluaq.

“It’s really amazing to be able to show them what it looks like with our high cameras seeing the joy on their faces” Jawanda said.

“It looks like something from the tropics … But it exists in cold water.”

Inuit trainees are also invited to become members of the crew. While Nunatsiaq News was not able to speak with an Inuit trainee this year last year’s trainee was Ted Irniq. He spoke to Nunatsiaq News last year about the desire for Inuit to become researchers for this type of work.

The Ludy Pudluk will ultimately spend five years helping communities develop their own fisheries. In order for that to happen each community would need to get a licence from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.

To get that licence research on the feasibility for a fishery needs to be done which is what the Qikiqtaaluk Corporation is doing with the Ludy Pudluk.

Getting those fisheries would help create better food security for Nunavut communities but the process to reach that goal will take time Ward said.

“But we feel very comfortable we are headed in the right direction” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlbmVsc29uZGFpbHkuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvc3VwcG9ydC1pbnZhc2l2ZS1tdXNzZWwtZGVmZW5jZS1wcm9ncmFtLWtlZXBzLWJjLXdhdGVycy1oZWFsdGh5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Support for Invasive Mussel Defence Program keeps BC waters healthy,"Support for Invasive Mussel Defence Program keeps BC waters healthy By CBT September 3rd 2022

The best offense is a good defence when it comes to invasive species because once they’re in they can be devastating to the local ecosystem and near impossible to get rid of.

This has been the case for zebra and quagga mussels in eastern Canada and the United States.

Zebra and quagga mussels are native to the black sea region of eastern Europe and western Asia. They came across the sea in the 1980’s on a ship ballast and invaded Canada’s Great Lakes. Since invasive species have no natural predators in a new environment the mussels spread through the Great Lakes currently reaching as far as Manitoba and into the United States.

Sergeant Josh Lockwood of the Conservation Officer Service still remembers the first boat he saw with invasive mussels on it coming into BC in 2015.

“The first boat came out of Cross Lake Texas. We examined the boat with one of the scientists from Victoria who came up and determined that it had mussels on it. They weren’t viable. It’d been out of the water for more than 30 days and they were dried. But at that point we knew we had to do something” Lockwood says.

The Invasive Mussel Defence Program was created at an integral time. Soon Lockwood was seeing more watercraft coming into the province carrying mussels.

The Invasive Mussel Defence Program which includes watercraft inspections lake monitoring and public outreach and education remains extremely effective at preventing the introduction of invasive mussels into BC waterways.

To protect the ecosystem Columbia Basin Trust and Columbia Power Corporation have helped fund the Province’s Invasive Mussel Defence Program since its creation.

During boating season watercraft inspection stations are set up on major highways and border crossings coming into BC. In 2022 there were seven permanent stations and two roving stations which require mandatory stops for inspection of all watercrafts including kayaks paddleboards and any flotation devices.

Failure to stop for inspection can result in a $345 fine under the Wildlife Act.

During an inspection an officer will interview the watercraft hauler examine the watercraft and if necessary conduct a hot water flush in areas of the boat that might contain microscopic larvae or eggs. Officers can quarantine a contaminated boat for 30 days after which any mussels will not be viable.

The program also runs a K9 unit and currently employs two dogs trained to sniff out the invasive critters.

The Invasive Mussel Defence Program has a significant reach and impact. In 2021 out of the 33300 watercraft that were inspected 17 were found to be mussel-fouled. The program prevented these watercrafts from unknowingly introducing the invasive mussels to BC waters.

Furthermore 61600 people participated in public education and outreach in 2021. Officers who conduct these educational courses encourage the public to follow the mantra: Clean Dry Drain when it comes to caring for their watercrafts.

Lockwood has worked with the Invasive Mussel Defence Program from the ground up ever since that first boat became a catalyst for the creation of the program. It’s a job that he feels passionate about.

“We don’t have any zebra or quagga mussels in any British Columbia waters so I think it is a very effective program and an important program for ecology agriculture and tourism” says Lockwood.

“I’ve been in places that have massive zebra and quagga mussel infestations. When you get out of your vehicle it smells like you’re at the ocean and everyone at the beach is wearing shoes because the mussels will literally cut your feet. It can be devastating if it gets a foothold.”

When introduced to a new ecosystem zebra and quagga mussels outcompete native species for their main food source plankton. As the mussels spread they filter more and more plankton out of the water which allows more sunlight to penetrate. This impacts fish and wildlife by increasing toxic algal blooms.

Additionally mussels can clog and damage water infrastructure such as dams community water supplies water treatment facilities fisheries and hydropower operations.

Castlegar resident Ian Kalaski has been boating his whole life. From the fishing community and online publications he’s aware of the potential for spreading invasive mussels and checks his boat regularly.

“I think the checks are important to people that are traveling in and out of province or from the ocean back into fresh water. It’s too much to determine if some people should stop and some shouldn’t so they have to stop everybody. It’s reasonable that way” Kalaski says. “I’m fine with stopping because it’s part of the program.”

“If we can maintain and maybe even increase what we’re doing now I think that we can hold where we’re at and not get mussels into British Columbia” says Lockwood.

This beautiful sight might also harbor an important source of clean energy for the future. The Cyprus-based company Sea Wave Energy Limited (SWEL) has designed a floating generator which moves with the movement of the waves producing power as it undulates. Called the Wave Energy Converter (WEC) or the Waveline Magnet it offers a cheap and environmentally friendly way to produce energy which could be on par with fossil fuels.

SWEL has been developing wave-based generators for 10 years. Earlier this year they released the design of their prototype WEC after much research and design progress. The floating plastic platforms are easy to produce affordable and linked together like a flexible “spine” that bends with the waves. It is cleverly engineered to translate the motion of ocean waves into energy producing as much as 100 MW of power under ideal conditions. This high output paired with its lower cost make it competitive among fossil fuels which dominate the energy markets.

Last year the company tested the device in Larnaca Bay off of Cyprus. More testing and development is needed to commercialize the WEC. However the company designed it to be flexible enough to withstand a variety of open water conditions. It can also be crafted from recycled materials further boosting its eco-friendly image. The WEC will hopefully be deployed in an ocean with an electrical grid connection within five years according to SWEL's timeline as begun in 2019. Perhaps in some number of years wave power will be as common as solar and these floating “spines” will adorn coastlines around the world.

Sea Wave Energy Limited (SWEL) has designed a floating generator which moves with undulating ocean waves called the Wave Energy Converter (WEC) or the Waveline Magnet.

The company estimates one WEC can produce 100 MW of energy providing an affordable and climate-friendly energy alternative to fossil fuels.

According to a Thursday release the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration found that Wells Fargo violated whistleblower protection laws for ""improperly terminating"" an unnamed senior manager.

The Chicago area-based manager who worked in commercial banking at Wells Fargo was fired after voicing repeated concerns about what they believed to be violations of financial law – including allegations of wire fraud price fixing and being instructed to falsify customer information the Labor Department said.

""Even though the manager believed the conduct was illegal based on company-required training they were terminated in 2019"" the Labor Department wrote – adding that Wells Fargo later claimed the executive was fired ""as part of a restructuring process.""

Investigators later found that this termination ""was not consistent"" with that of other managers removed at the time the Labor Department said. Alleging retaliation and violation of whistleblower protections under federal the Sarbanes-Oxley Act the executive then filed a complaint with OSHA.

In a statement sent to USA TODAY on Friday Wells Fargo said the company disagrees with OSHA's findings ""which were not based on an evidentiary hearing.""

""We intend to appeal to an Administrative Law Judge"" the company said in an emailed statement. ""Wells Fargo has zero tolerance for acts of retaliation and employees are encouraged to report concerns which will be promptly and thoroughly investigated.""

Both the former executive and Wells Fargo have 30 days to file objections or request an administrative law judge hearing the Labor Department said.

According to the Labor Department the executive had reported the alleged misconduct to other managers and the company's corporate ethics line – a contact for staff to report possible fraudulent activity violations of Wells Fargo's Code of Ethics and more.

“The evidence demonstrates Wells Fargo took retaliatory action against this senior manager for repeatedly expressing concerns about financial management they believed violated federal laws” OSHA's assistant secretary of labor Doug Parker said in a statement. “The Department of Labor will not tolerate employers who violate the law and illegally terminate workers that exercise their rights under the law.”

The $22 million that the Labor Department is ordering Wells Fargo to pay its former executive includes back wages lost bonuses interest and compensatory damages.

2020:Wells Fargo to pay $3B settlement for violating antifraud rules resolving fake account probes

Thursday's Labor Department order isn't the first time Wells Fargo has been accused of financial misconduct and whistleblower retaliation. In 2020 for example Wells Fargo agreed to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission $3 billion to settle criminal and civil investigations into the company pressuring employees to create millions of fake accounts to meet unrealistic sales goals.

The fake account scandal first came to light in 2016. At the time former Wells Fargo employees told CNN that they were retaliated against after using the corporate ethics line.

The Chattanooga Tennessee-based company said it hired Ben Jaenicke as executive vice president of finance effective this week. Jaenicke is to succeed Farzana Khaleel as executive vice president-chief financial officer on Jan. 1. Khaleel's last day as CFO is set for Dec. 31.

Farzana Khaleel (CBL)

For a publicly traded company such as CBL the CFO plays a critical role and is one of two executives who certify by signature their company's periodic financial reports such as quarterly earnings statements.

Khaleel who's worked for CBL for more than 20 years helped guide the REIT through a rough stretch during the pandemic. She joined CBL in September 2000 as a senior vice president and has served as executive vice president-chief financial officer for a decade.

CBL said Khaleel plans to enter into an agreement to serve as a consultant from January through March with the option to extend the contract for an additional three months to ensure a smooth transition for the CFO position.

""She has played a leading role in helping to navigate the company through a number of challenges including most recently CBL’s reorganization"" CEO Stephen Lebovitz said in a statement. ""Farzana has been unwavering in her efforts to ensure that CBL is best positioned financially.""

CBL emerged from bankruptcy on Nov. 1 about a year after the pandemic's disruption of its retail business forced the REIT to file for protection from its creditors. In December with CBL's reorganization behind it Lebovitz told CoStar News the REIT planned to accelerate its mall redevelopment strategy.

The REIT has been working to strengthen its balance sheet and during its second-quarter conference call to discuss its financial results CBL announced more than $600 million in financing activity on malls and open-air shopping centers tied to various loans on the commercial mortgage-backed securities or CMBS market. CBL refinanced loans on a number of its properties while some loans were modified. Other properties were turned over to lenders.

Jaenicke joins CBL from Wells Fargo Securities and predecessor firm Eastdil Secured which Wells Fargo sold in 2019. He worked at Wells Fargo Securities and Eastdil Secured for more than a decade and before that at PricewaterhouseCoopers where he performed audits and other accounting for public REITs.

Jaenicke served as an adviser to CBL for several years in his roles in investment banking at Wells Fargo and Eastdil Secured.

At CBL he has entered into an employment agreement with an initial term that runs from Sept. 1 through April 1 2024 with automatic renewals for successive one-year terms unless terminated according to a filing made Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Under the agreement Jaenicke is set to earn an initial annual base salary of $350000 that will be prorated for the remainder of this year. His salary would increase to $400000 on Jan. 1 2024.

Jaenicke would be eligible for an annual bonus of $109333 for 2022 and a target annual bonus of $338000 for 2023 according to his employment agreement. In addition he is in line to receive an initial grant of 20000 shares of restricted common stock that would vest in equal installments over four years.

CBL agreed to give Jaenicke who already has relocated from Washington D.C. to Chattanooga for his new job relocation assistance not to exceed $100000 according to his employment agreement.

In 2021 Khaleel earned a salary of $507565 and total compensation of more than $2.5 million as executive vice president-chief financial officer and treasurer according to CBL's 2022 proxy statement.

""The company also anticipates that Ms. Khaleel will continue to serve in her current role if Mr. Jaenicke is unable for any reason to assume the duties of chief financial officer as planned"" CBL said in Thursday's SEC filing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVtYXJrZXRlci5jb20vY29udGVudC9yZXR1cm4tdG8tb2ZmaWNlLXBvbGljaWVzLWJlY29taW5nLWFub3RoZXItd2VhcG9uLXRhbGVudC13YXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Return-to-office policies are becoming another weapon in the talent wars,"The news: Two large US-based banks have announced they’ll drop their vaccine mandates for employees after the US Labor Day holiday according to the New York Post which reported on one bank’s internal memo.

will no longer require employees in the Americas—aside from New York City and Lima—to be vaccinated against Covid-19 before entering the office. Also employees won’t be required to mask up or test for the virus. Last week Morgan Stanley said it would update its Covid-19 testing policies and would no longer notify employees via email of potential exposure or recommend isolation.

Bigger than vaccine policies: The policy changes look like another example of banks’ intentions to revert back to pre-2020 ways of working. Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo told the Post “This is another way of Goldman Sachs saying ‘School’s in session and we want you in person’ after Labor Day.”

Both Goldman CEO David Solomon and Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman have advocated strongly for their firms’ full-time back-to-office plans. But they’re not alone.

As Slayton Search notes  leading firms within the financial services industry—particularly in the wealth management and banking sectors—have been less apt to offer hybrid schedules or the option to work remotely.

By contrast fintechs had been using their more flexible work arrangements to entice talent away from incumbents. Just for one example Revolut said it would allow its employees to work abroad for months at a time (and at the same time redesigned its office workspaces for flexible working)."

The companies -- Leaps & Bounds Private Limited Leaps & Bounds Infra Consultants Private Limited and Leaps & Bounds Management Services LLP -- attracted the attention of the investigating sleuths after the probe agency detected some fictitious transfers of funds.

In the case of Leaps & Bounds Private Limited and Leaps & Bounds Infra Consultants Abhishek Banerjee's parents Amit and Lata Banerjee are the directors. In the case of Leaps & Bounds Management Services LLP which is a partnership firm Amit and Lata Banerjee are the designated partners.

Agency sleuths are currently examining the books of accounts of all these three companies to trace similar fictitious transactions or transfer of funds. In all probability these entities acted as shell companies meant for the diversion of proceeds. Before the 2014 Lok Sabha Sabha polls Abhishek Banerjee himself was one of the directors of Leaps & Bounds Private Limited as per records of the Registrar of Companies (ROC) under the Union Ministry of Corporate Affairs. However before filing his nomination as a Trinamool Congress candidate from THE Diamond Harbour Lok Sabha constituency in 2014 he resigned from the company.

Amit Banerjee joined as a board member of the company on January 2 2014.

“The broadband money is being distributed to providers currently and more money is available” said Sen. Kevin Corbin (R-Franklin).

Several years ago Corbin spearheaded the GREAT (Growing Rural Economies with Access to Technology) grants program with then-House rep and current Republican Labor Commissioner Josh Dobson.

Since then the program has dumped tens of millions of dollars into providing high-speed internet service in WNC for customers who often have no other options.

All told this round of grants totals almost $19 million across Cherokee Graham Haywood Jackson Macon and Swain counties. After the $4.25 million in required matching funds from county governments the total investment in broadband expansion comes to around $23 million.

Those funds will help build out service to nearly 8400 locations at an average cost of $2750 per location.

According to letters issued by the North Carolina Office of Digital Infrastructure’s Division of Broadband and Digital Equity on Aug. 30 each of the six counties will see varying amounts granted to private service providers that were awarded the funds after a competitive bidding process in which the providers who proposed serving the most people for the least amount of money were selected.

In Cherokee County Blue Ridge Mountain EMC of Young Harris Georgia will receive $3.7 million from the state and $1.6 million from the county to establish service at approximately 1778 locations.

Zitel LLC of Moneta Virginia will serve approximately 897 locations upon receipt of $2.7 million from the state and $470000 from Graham County government.

Haywood County will contribute around $150000 on top of a state grant of $870000 which will provide service to approximately 182 locations through Charlotte-based Spectrum Southeast.

Spectrum Southeast will also receive more than $3.8 million in state funding along with a local match of $670000 to enable service at 1196 Jackson County locations.

Norwalk Connecticut-based Frontier Communications was selected as the provider for Macon County and will receive $3.8 million in state funding as well as $670000 from county government to provide service to approximately 2700 locations.

Swain County’s $700000 match of the state’s $3.9 million grant will go to Zito West Holding LLC of Coudersport Pennsylvania to bring broadband to 1619 currently unserved locations.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) defines broadband as having a transmission speed of at least 25 megabits down and 3 megabits up. The FCC says only 59% of North Carolinians subscribe to a service with those speeds.

According to a 2019 report broadband access is anything but universal in the mountains and due to topography many homes and businesses can’t get it even from satellite feeds.

All six counties receiving funding from this round of GREAT grants report more than 20% of residents as having no access to the internet at all. Graham County (36%) and Swain County (34%) top the list of least-connected WNC counties.

Nate Denny deputy secretary of broadband and digital equity in the N.C. Office of Digital Infrastructure said that once the final grant agreements are signed in about a month contractors will have two years to deliver the projects.

“We know that high-speed internet — affordable and reliable high-speed internet — is absolutely central to modern life” Denny said. “It allows people access to education and telemedicine to look for a job and to recruit businesses locally. You have to have that connection. We’re excited because this is just the first of multiple rounds of funding to connect every North Carolinian.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd211YnJvbmNvcy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzkvMi9mb290YmFsbC13bXUtYW5ub3VuY2VzLWNoYW5nZXMtdG8tZ2FtZWRheS1leHBlcmllbmNlLWZvci1zdHVkZW50c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WMU Announces Changes to Gameday Experience for Students,"As Western Michigan Athletics continues to make Bronco Football game days more exciting for fans they are excited to announce two new game day experiences for WMU students a new location for student tailgating and digital ticketing.Over the summer as WMU Athletics sought feedback from student leaders and members of RSO groups on how to make WMU Football game days better for students the common theme throughout those conversations was the location of the student tailgate. WMU students consistently expressed their interest in moving student tailgating closer to a main part campus and in a more centralized location making it easier for all students to access.In partnership with the WMU Department of Public Safety & University Facilities Management this season the student tailgate will move from Lot 105 on East Campus to Lots 16 and 94 the two lots directly behind Read Fieldhouse.""Moving the tailgating lot will make the tailgates more accessible to the entire student body and promote students to go to the games afterward"" President of the Lawson Lunatics Michael Schatzley said. ""The previous location was hard for some students to get to and made attending the game difficult. Hopefully the new location encourages students to join and follow up by attending the game afterward and contributing to the atmosphere at Waldo.""These new student tailgate locations are situated close to the newly announced Buster's Block Party which will be located in Lot 13 across from the Student Rec Center. Buster's Block Party will include live music interactive games and more. To kickoff this new game day experience country music star Chase Bryant will be performing at the first Block Party on Saturday September 17 before the Broncos' home opener against defending ACC champion Pittsburgh.""Going into my senior year at WMU I am so excited to hear about the initiative of moving the tailgate lot"" Panhellenic President Hannah Marcon said.

Forward-looking: Despite consumer PCs and game consoles transitioning to faster SSDs traditional disk drives (HDDs) continue to offer ever more space for cold storage at lower prices. One company says it can take a significant leap forward for optical disc technology.

Folio Photonics announced a new method for optical disc storage this week that could make hard drives bigger and cheaper than ever. Using new materials and manufacturing techniques the company says it can offer storage at $5 per terabyte and eventually $1 per terabyte. The best hard drives are currently five times more expensive at around $25 per terabyte.

The new optical discs feature dynamic multi-layer write/read capabilities which previously hadn't been cost-effective at the enterprise scale. Folio achieved this through patented polymer extrusion film-based disc construction processes customized optical pickup units an easily scalable polymer co-extrusion process and ""next-generation materials.""

Where archival discs nowadays offer up to three optical layers per side per disc Folio's achieve 16 film layers. The company plans to continue increasing that number.

Folio also claims that its discs are more energy-efficient than traditional HDDs with its implementation hopefully lowering the digital storage industry's carbon footprint. Furthermore the new hard drives are more resistant to electromagnetic pulses.

The company plans to start offering the new hard drives in 2024 with 10-disc units carrying 1TB per disk translating to 10TB HDDs for around $50. Currently that much money might get you a 2TB HDD. Folio hopes to offer bigger drives eventually.

If Folio's technology takes off it could revolutionize the ongoing competition in HDDs over two dozen terabytes. Manufacturers like Western Digital and Seagate are racing to create 30TB drives by the middle of this decade and reach 100TB by 2030.

The IAMAW District W24 bargaining team is scheduled to meet with the company today to resume bargaining.

Here is some news coverage from Thursday’s rally:

► From KIRO — Weyerhaeuser employees picket outside company headquarters (video)

► From KOMO — Weyerhaeuser employees on strike rally outside Seattle HQ demand better wages — More than 1100 employees who work for the timber company in Washington and Oregon have been on strike since Sept. 13. Striking Weyerhaeuser employee and IAMAW member Jason Williams said:

“The company has been making record profit. We went through a pandemic. We’ve been there strong with them and working with the company. Coming to this contract here we thought had high hopes that we’d at least get caught up with inflation and their proposal to us doesn’t even come close to it.”

Solidarity rally Thursday to demand Weyerhaeuser agree to a fair contract

SEATTLE — More than 1100 Weyerhaeuser employees represented by IAMAW District W24 have been on strike since Sept. 13. The nation’s largest forest products company which is experiencing record profits has been in no hurry to negotiate a fair contract since then. The company has agreed to meet just twice during that period and has refused to budge from its last contract offer that was overwhelmingly rejected.

Enough is enough. As the IAMAW prepares for its next negotiating session with Weyerhaeuser it’s time for the labor movement to step up and show our solidarity with the strikers.

TAKE A STAND — The Washington State Labor Council AFL-CIO and the Oregon AFL-CIO urge all union members and community supporters to attend a Solidarity Rally with Weyerhaeuser Strikers at 11 a.m. on Thursday Sept. 29 outside the company’s headquarters in Seattle 220 Occidental Ave. South.

The IAMAW is scheduled to meet with company negotiators the following day. Let’s show Weyerhaeuser that Washington’s labor movement has the striking workers’ backs and we demand that they reach a fair contract with the workers who make the company profitable.

BACKGROUND — Company and union negotiators met Thursday Sept. 22 for only the second time since the strike began. The union bargaining team reported that Weyerhaeuser refused to improve upon the offer overwhelmingly voted down by IAMAW members on Sept. 2.

That offer from a company that reported its “2021 financial performance was the strongest on record” was rejected because general wage increases were too low vacation time was cut employees were asked to pay for healthcare premiums for the first time since the 1990s and retirement benefits weren’t improved.

After the Sept. 22 session District W24 President Brandon Bryant reported:

The IAMAW District W24 bargaining team representing over 1100 workers currently on strike met with Weyerhaeuser today to continue bargaining. We are incredibly disappointed that Weyerhaeuser was unwilling to provide a different offer to our members than the one our members have already overwhelmingly rejected. There seems to continue to be delays ineffectiveness and lack of urgency from this multi-billion-dollar company. The company’s next availability is next Friday (Sept. 30) and we hope that Weyerhaeuser will do the right thing. Until then our members will continue to be on strike continue to stand up for themselves continue the fight against corporate greed and continue to not settle for less.

In addition to attending the Rally in Seattle on Sept. 29 here’s how you — and your union — can show solidarity with the IAMAW strikers:

1) Contribute to this GoFundMe fundraiser to support families of striking Weyerhaeuser workers who are experiencing hardship.

2) Please sign this petition to tell Weyerhaeuser: Timber workers and their families deserve living wages good health care and a secure retirement!

3) Join picket lines at Weyerhaeuser facilities and donating food/supplies at the these locations. The union says “community support (on the strike lines) has been amazing” and “each location would appreciate you stopping by; hold a sign talk with us bring a treat or two anything to show your support.”

TIMOTHY A. CLARY / AFP

Until the last second of the last match of her professional career Serena Williams upheld the principle that made her ""The Queen of Queens"" as she was introduced on Monday August 29 in what looks set to be her last US Open. Serena is definitely the one who controls the clock.

The tennis champion with 23 Grand Slam titles announced her impending retirement on August 9 in Vogue and on Instagram. After an extraordinary tennis career lasting over a quarter century she said she wanted to ""focus on being a mom my spiritual goals and finally discovering a different but just as exciting Serena.""

But on Monday night after her first-round win over Montenegro's Danka Kovinic the former world number one was not specific about when and where she would retire. ""I feel like I'm at a stage in my life where I am not necessarily retiring I'm just evolving from tennis. [...] It's time for me you know to evolve to the next thing. I think it's important because there are so many other things that I want to do.""

Ahead of 41st birthday which she will celebrate on September 26 Ms. Williams is about to embark on an intense new chapter in her life to the point of calling herself ""Serena 2.0."" The former tennis circuit boss has been anticipating her transition into the business world for a long time.

A must for sponsors

The best tennis player in history has already managed to build on her unparalleled record of success and popularity in women's sports by signing a dozen partnerships with sponsors of all kinds (including Ford Gucci Gatorade and even AbbVie an American company specializing in pharmaceutical research). She has not hesitated to put herself on stage in commercials like her successful incarnation of Wonder Woman for the DirecTV television platform in which she defeats robots armed with her racket.

Nike her equipment provider since 2003 has just opened an immense high-tech complex of 9 hectares named after the champion on its historic headquarters in Portland (Oregon).

Beyond her advertising contracts Ms. Williams does not intend to sit on a personal fortune estimated by Forbes at 260 million dollars (of which nearly 95 million dollars has come from tennis). The US tennis star has been a formidable businesswoman for nearly a decade through her company Serena Ventures which is involved in various sectors such as consumer services technology and e-commerce.

Founded in 2014 the company has invested in more than 60 projects including 13 ""unicorn"" startups (these are projects with a valuation of at least 1 billion dollars) including Impossible Foods (meat and cheese substitutes from plants) MasterClass (an online conference platform) and Tonal (online sports courses).

""I've always been fascinated with technology and I've always loved the way it really shapes our lives"" Ms. Williams said to The New York Times. In a sign that Serena Ventures is continuing to grow the company announced in March that it had raised 111 million dollars to accomplish its ""mission.""

While not making it an absolute priority the US celebrity makes a point of bringing new profiles into entrepreneurship. According to the Serena Ventures website 53% of the company's portfolio includes companies founded by women and 47% by black people ""because that's who we are"" the soon-to-be retiree said.

In 2009 even before launching her own investment company Ms. Williams and her sister Venus became minority owners of the Miami Dolphins NFL football club in Florida where they grew up.

'The same passion' in business as on the court

But Ms. Williams doesn't just invest and wait she also gets personally involved. She sits on several boards of directors including Poshmark a well-known online platform for selling second-hand clothes and objects. The businesswoman keeps good company. Her partner in Serena Ventures Alison Rapaport Stillman came from the investment giant JPMorgan and she can also exchange business ideas with her husband Alexis Ohanian co-founder of the social network Reddit.

""I feel like I go to sleep getting messages from her and wake up getting messages from her"" Ms. Stillman recently said in an interview with Fortune ""Nothing can replace tennis for her but looking to the future it's exciting to see that she puts the same passion into it as she does on the court.""

Like the basketball star LeBron James Serena Williams also has her eyes set on television. She signed a contract with Amazon Studios in 2021 to produce several documentary series that will air on its Prime Video on-demand service.

She does not intend to let go of the rhinestones and glitter of the fashion world either. She famously walked catwalks and launched her own collection in 2018 after breaking the aesthetic codes of women's tennis by wearing tight and flashy outfits on the courts. As her young compatriot ""Coco"" Gauff predicted ""we're going to keep seeing a lot of Serena.""

And even though fans are sad to see her go many are left wondering who the superstar athlete will pass the baton to.

Following a successful career Serena Williams announced her retirement on the cover of Vogue earlier this week. Her plans to leave after she completes the U.S. Open later this month shocked fans. And according to Williams the decision certainly wasn’t easy for her either.

“There is no happiness in this topic for me.” she says “It’s the hardest thing that I could ever imagine. I hate it. I hate that I have to be at this crossroads. I keep saying to myself I wish it could be easy for me but it’s not. I’m torn: I don’t want it to be over but at the same time I’m ready for what’s next.”

And by “what’s next” Williams means growing her family of three. She talks about how her daughter Olympia prays to be a big sister one day. And since she and her husband are open to adding another branch to their family tree little Olympia may soon get her wish.

Aside from this Williams mentioned that she also wanted to focus on other projects namely Serena Ventures. Even though she says the company is “a small but growing firm of six people” Serena Ventures has already been named one of 16 unicorn companies valued at $1 billion.

Now that Serena Williams is retiring from the tennis world other Black tennis stars have pretty big shoes to fill. Fortunately quite a few contenders are ready to rise to the occasion. Here are the top five Black tennis stars to look out for:"

With the world’s biggest names involved the tournament promises to deliver the same level of entertainment on the pitch but behind the scenes it could prove to be comparatively quiet. The sport’s powerbrokers have spent much of the past 18 months trying to agree upon the future shape of European soccer after the failed launch of the Super League exposed those who are far from satisfied with the existing order.

Those threats are still lingering in the shadows but for now at least Uefa and the European Club Association (ECA) have agreed on a new format from 2024 when the Champions League will expand to 36 teams and do away with the existing six-game group phase. Each team will instead play eight fixtures each before the knockout round meaning the competition will feature a total of 189 matches up from the current 125.

More games of course means more money and another key agreement secured earlier this year saw Uefa appoint Team Marketing and Relevent Sports Group as its agency partners for the next three-year rights cycle. European soccer’s governing body said the deals will ‘guarantee’ increased revenues for participating clubs and ‘bigger solidarity payments’ for those outside Uefa club competitions although it remains to be seen if the changes will narrow or widen the growing divide in the game.

Relevent has already agreed a new Champions League media rights deal in the US where CBS has committed to paying a reported US$1.5 billion to continue showing the tournament for another six years from 2024. Improved deals have also been secured in key markets such as France and the UK where Amazon has entered the fray for the first time.

For now all roads lead to Istanbul’s Atatürk Olympic Stadium which will host the Champions League final for a second time on 10th June. Ahead of kick-off SportsPro presents a commercial rundown of all the teams involved in this season’s competition along with all the key broadcast and sponsorship details.

What’s great about Duran Duran coming to town is you find out how many of your friends once wanted to marry Simon LeBon.

The messages rolled in as I posted during and after Thursday night’s opener at the Encore Theater. “Marrying Simon LeBon was on my bucket list!” and “I was certain I was going to marry Simon LeBon in the ‘80s” and “It was Simon LeBon then John Taylor if Simon didn’t work out.”

Such widespread naivete is the byproduct of early 1980s MTV fame. Duran Duran ruled that network just after its inception. LeBon John Taylor Nick Rhodes and Roger Taylor might all be in their 60s now (well not might — they are) but can still rock to telegenic effect as they showed in their debut at Wynn Las Vegas.

The band returns Saturday and again Oct. 30 and 31 for Halloween-themed shows. The guys are filling the room and fast though LeBon makes it seems as if its not such a challenge. “Compared to the places we normally play” he said at the start of Friday’s show “this seems like a well-appointed bathroom.”

What was reinforced in the Encore lid-lifter was there is so much more to Duran Duran than their days cavorting through “Rio” “Girls on Film” and “Wild Boys.” The band is a powerhouse the riffs are rad and the volume is jacked up. There’s little debate that Duran Duran is worthy of its Rock & Roll Hall of Fame nod. That induction is coming in November.

Thursday night’s highlights were plentiful and sentimental while also contemporary. “Wild Boys” started it a natural singalong. Same with “Union of the Snake” and “Notorious” goaded along by LeBon’s suggestion the crowd go ahead and air out the vocals.

The ballads scored too.”Ordinary World” was a moving dedication to the people of Ukraine. The high-ascending “Save a Prayer” showed LeBon at his finest a song that caused the crowd to sway.

And I have argued this point with James Bond fans for years: My favorite Bond theme is “A View to a Kill” with its wild synthesizer and Taylor’s rumbling low-end bass. They played this during “Live Aid” kids and are playing it again. The crowd roared through the “dance into the fire” refrain as if singing to a new Bond song.

And “Invisible” and “All of You” off the band’s latest release “Future Past” showed Duran Duran is not flagging some 40-plus years after forming.

The band displayed visual splash of course LeBon in silver slacks a bright-green leather jacket and a series of T-shirts (ending with “Union” over a snake so you are reminded of the title of that hit song). John Taylor is still whippet-thin and effectively tattooed. The platinum-maned Rhodes especially has not changed his look over the past 40 years.

As this was a weeknight in VegasVille many locals turned out in the sold-out audience. Seated around the venue were UFC President Dana White SPI Entertainment exec Alex Schechter Vegas bass virtuoso Steve Flora and the ever-rocking Todd Kerns (of Raiding the Rock Vault) who was seated to my right.

Different personality types for sure. But we stood the whole time and we all knew the words.

‘Boom’ time

On Wednesday night CeeLo Green led a conga line through the theater Elvis made famous.

That moment alone might be enough reason to check out “Boombox” the hip-hop traipse through time at Westgate’s International Theater.

As it is CeeLo fulfills his promise to be the host (as always with the most) in this collection of rap hip-hop and R&B artists. Dressed in a bright-white Adidas T-shirt sweatsuit with black-and-white glasses Green belted out a segment of “Crazy” at the top and “Forget You” (with its original profane lyric) at the end. In between he led a rowdy conga line up and down the theater’s aisles.

But that’s too long between numbers and not enough Green in this show. “Boombox” runs through Sunday returning Sept. 28 to Oct. 2.

Kid ‘n Play joined as co-hosts of sorts joking that “Boombox” was sponsored by Icy Hot and Bengay because of the treatment the performers would need after the show. Co-founder Christopher “Play” Martin has just turned 60 and Christopher “Kid” Reid is just two years behind him.

Thea Austin of Snap did perform through an injured Achilles tendon soldering through a long-running take of “Power.” J.J. Fad swept through “Supersonic.” Tone Lōc rang it up with “Funky Cold Medina” and “Wild Thing” drawing an onstage dance party of random groovers.

That moment worked as the crowd flourished alongside Tone Lōc for “Wild Thing.”Less apparent was the reason for the opening-night appearance by Tom Higgenson of Plain White T’s who performed the hit “Hey There Delilah” on acoustic. Imagine CeeLo or Tone Lōc turning up in the middle of a Plain White T’s show and you get the disconnect.

Whatever the surprises the show’s template vibe and even stage set brought to mind “I Love the ‘90s” which ran for about six weeks in late 2019 at the Paris Theater. The giant boombox in the middle of the stage and flanking DJ and drum risers seem to have been pulled from the Paris Theater. Say this for “Boombox” it is truly a sustainable Las Vegas residency.

That show was also co-produced by Seth Yudof who played some lead guitar (in silhouette) for a few moments in another unbilled segment. He and Jimmy Maynes who also partnered in “I Love the 90s” are back with what is essentially a tweaked version of that show.

Aside from Kid ‘n Play the cast has been swapped out from the “I Love the ‘90s” days (no Salt n Pepa En Vogue or Mark McGrath in “Boombox”). But the challenges are about the same now as then. International is a 1600-seat room usually the home of Barry Manilow and a serious ticket-selling lift for this scale of production.

And not to belabor the obvious competition is stiff among Las Vegas resident headliners and all shows generally. But the “Boombox” does own familiarity energy and a friendly ticket price (listed at $29 not including fees). Westgate has hit the mark with R&B acts including Kool & The Gang who light up the International Theater (back Oct. 8 and 9) and “Soul of Motown” which has settled into a successful run at Westgate Cabaret.

We have CeeLo too. He’s an artist we can get behind anytime especially in the conga line.

Penn Entertainment’s (NASDAQ:PENN) lengthy share price decline is leading to the stock’s removal from the S&P 500.

S&P Dow Jones Indices made the announcement today after the close of US markets noting the regional casino operator and PVH Corp. (NYSE:PVH) are getting the boot from the world’s most widely followed equity gauge. That pair of stocks will be replaced by CoStar Group (NASDAQ:CSGP) and Invitation Homes (NYSE:INVH).

Those changes and others announced by the index provider will take effect prior to the open of US markets on Monday Sept. 19. Penn Entertainment is the only gaming stock affected by the moves.

With the Bartstool Sportsbook operator leaving the S&P 500 the remaining gaming names in the index in order of weight are VICI Properties (NYSE: VICI) Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS) MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) and Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN).

Penn Looking Like Mid-Cap Stock

Penn’s stay in the S&P 500 was brief as it along with rival Caesars was added to the index in March 2021. The casino operator’s departure from the benchmark makes sense because the S&P 500 is designed to be a large-cap gauge – a status Penn no longer meets.

All companies moving from the S&P 500 to the S&P MidCap 400 are more representative of the mid-cap market space and all companies moving from the S&P MidCap 400 to the S&P SmallCap 600 are more representative of the small-cap market space” according to a statement from S&P Dow Jones Indices.

As of today’s close Penn sports a market capitalization of $5.27 billion which undoubtedly qualifies as mid-cap territory.

While the gaming company has its share of supporters on Wall Street how it arrived at the predicament of S&P 500 removal isn’t a mystery. The stock is down 39.63% year-to-date and 62% over the past year. Over the near-term those percentages could increase as fund managers that benchmark to the S&P 500 are forced to sell shares of Penn.

Trillions of dollars of global assets are allocated to the S&P 500 and related index funds. For example the three largest US-listed exchange traded funds (ETFs) all follow that index and the trio has a combined $918.36 billion in assets under management.

Where Penn Stock Heads to Next

As noted above Penn’s destination is the S&P MidCap 400 Index. While that’s a widely followed benchmark in its own right it pales in comparison to the S&P 500. Additionally mid-cap equities of all stripes are frequently overlooked relative to large- and small-cap fare.

Still hope is not lost for Penn stock. Far from it. Historically mid-caps outperform their larger and smaller counterparts often doing so with less volatility than the latter.

As for prestigious index inclusions it’s possible that with the benefit of major rally into the fourth quarter Penn could be in position for promotion to the Nasdaq-100 Index (NDX) — same goes for Caesars — but that’s likely asking a lot of any gaming equity at this juncture.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1jb2x1bW5zL2luc2lkZS1nYW1pbmcvbWFzc2FjaHVzZXR0cy1zcG9ydHMtd2FnZXJpbmctZmxhd2VkLWJ5LWxvY2FsLWNvbGxlZ2UtYmV0dGluZy1iYW4tMjYzMzY0NS_SAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmV2aWV3am91cm5hbC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYnVzaW5lc3MtY29sdW1ucy9pbnNpZGUtZ2FtaW5nL21hc3NhY2h1c2V0dHMtc3BvcnRzLXdhZ2VyaW5nLWZsYXdlZC1ieS1sb2NhbC1jb2xsZWdlLWJldHRpbmctYmFuLTI2MzM2NDUvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Massachusetts sports wagering flawed by local college betting ban,"The new Massachusetts sports-betting law prohibits bettors from wagering on sports teams from UMass Boston College Harvard and other universities.

Online poker play may be on the verge of a comeback in Nevada

Say hello to curling the next competitive sport in Las Vegas

When sports wagering goes live in Massachusetts early next year Bay State bettors won’t be able to place wagers on colleges and universities within the state.

No bets on Minuteman football at UMass. Nothing for high-profile Boston College. Forget about getting down on Harvard hoops.

Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker signed sports wagering legislation into law on Aug. 10 but its ban on wagers for in-state schools will likely leave money on the table for the state. It could also push some gamblers to place bets in nearby New Hampshire Connecticut Rhode Island or New York or even illegally.

The state’s lawmakers wrote into the legislation that bettors won’t be able to place those kinds of bets although they allowed wagering on tournament events in which Massachusetts schools play.

This puritanical view of betting was something Nevada got past more than two decades ago.

Nevada changed in ’01

Since the 1950s bettors had been prohibited from betting on in-state teams because it was believed criminal elements could influence the outcome of games through bribes or other coercion of players and coaches.

But the Nevada Gaming Commission lifted a long-standing ban on betting on UNLV and University of Nevada Reno games in January 2001. It was part of a series of sweeping changes involving sports wagering that was debated for four months before adoption.

The commission headed at the time by Brian Sandoval a former governor and current UNRpresident made it clear that Nevada-regulated sports betting could withstand scrutiny no matter what collegiate teams were the subject of a bet including those in the state.

Nevada sportsbooks historically have alerted authorities including administrators of the NCAA when unusual betting patterns suggested someone was trying to fix a game’s outcome. After all sportsbooks do so to protect their own interests as well as the integrity of a sport.

Other lawmakers tripped up

Brendan Bussmann gaming industry analyst with Las Vegas-based B Global indicated the Massachusetts ban could actually hurt the industry.

“The ban on local colleges and universities does nothing to protect any student-athlete that is based in Massachusetts” Bussmann said. “It only enables the offshore books to continue to take these wagers.”

Yet Massachusetts isn’t alone in its approach according to Bussmann.

“Legislators continue to get tripped up over the college wagering issue making it more complex than it needs to be” he said. “States like Massachusetts Nebraska New Jersey and others have put similar limits in place to try to regulate the market. While there is money being left on the table this should be about integrity and the right thing to do is to create a fully regulated market.”

Ultimately two Las Vegas companies are likely to prosper in Massachusetts once sports betting begins next year.

Executives from MGM Springfield owned by MGM Resorts International and Encore Boston Harbor operated by Wynn Resorts Ltd. told Massachusetts regulators last month that they already have space dedicated for sportsbooks. The pair are among the 42 firms expected to compete for up to seven online sports wagering licenses.

Massachusetts assesses a $5 million licensing fee good for five years and a $100000 fee just to apply for a license.

“The Massachusetts Gaming Commission has been preparing for this moment for several years and the Legislature has debated this for several sessions” Bussmann said. “While the bill is far from perfect it does provide strong properties like Encore Boston Harbor and MGM Springfield to bring forward a strong sportsbook for a state that loves sports.”

He added that because Bay Staters are avid sports fans sports wagering will likely be a success.

“The Gaming Commission has laid out a solid plan to implement sports betting over the next several months” he said. “It has the opportunity to beat out jurisdictions to advance this effort and allow wagers in state on the (New England) Patriots (Boston) Celtics and Red Sox among others. This will turn into a strong market in the northeast corridor and recapture some of those dollars that are currently going to other states.”

Higher tax rates

It also helps that Massachusetts has legislated tax rates that are higher than Nevada’s but still lower than some neighboring states that have drawn bettors away.

Massachusetts law calls for a 15 percent tax on the gross gaming revenue of in-person brick-and-mortar sportsbooks and revenue from fantasy sports contests and 20 percent on revenue from mobile wagering.

By comparison Nevada taxes at a rate of 6.75 percent with other fees equaling about 1 percent.

New Hampshire and Rhode Island tax operators 51 percent of their gross revenue.

Xcel’s thermostat lockout involved customers who participate in a voluntary program that offers money in exchange for giving up control of their thermostat to save energy KMGH-TV reported. Xcel gives these customers $100 for signing up to the program and $25 a year thereafter.

This week’s shutdown was the only time in the program’s six-year history that customers couldn’t override their smart thermostats an Xcel vice president told KMGH-TV.

“Let’s remember that this is something that customers choose to be a part of based on the incentives” said Emmett Romine Xcel vice president of customer solutions and innovation. “So it helps everybody for people to participate in these programs. It is a bit uncomfortable for a short period of time but it’s very very helpful.”

The “energy emergency” was based on high temperatures and air conditioner usage that created an outage in Pueblo Colorado Romine said.

Participating customers told KMGH-TV that they didn’t see an emergency reason for the shutdown.

“Even if it’s a once-in-a-blue-moon situation it just doesn’t sit right with us to not be able to control our own thermostat in our house” said Tony Talarcio.

According to Boathouse only 4% of CEO’s view their CMO as the most trusted member of their team. Moreover only 8% view them as the most valuable member of their team with CFOs at 34% and COOs at 35%. Yet in the same breath 47% of CEOs say that the CMO is critical to grow the business.

These embarrassing numbers tell us CMOs need to do more to become trusted and valuable to their CEO as well as to be in consideration to become a CEO. There also needs to be a discussion about what CEOs need to do to get the best out of their CMOs.

Having been both a CMO with responsibility for some of the world’s most iconic and recognized brands including Dove KFC and Taco Bell and the great privilege to be the CEO of Yum Brands I want to share my observations and personal experiences about the causes of this misalignment and provide five points for CMOs looking to demonstrate their ability to reposition to a CEO role.

Rectifying the CEO-CMO relationship

Let’s start with my simple definition of the role of the CMO: ‘SOBO.’ This stands for sales overnight and brand over time. Simply put CMOs will drive sales overnight. Every CEO wants this. They will also build the brand over time. CEOs should hold this as just as important. Unfortunately because the value of the brand doesn’t appear on the balance sheet it is not always equally valued.

Because many people see the CMO as a creative there is an incorrect assumption they cannot also be numerical. One of the greatest compliments I ever received was from David Gibbs who was on the stage with my CFO and is now the CEO of Yum! Brands and called me ‘the human calculator’. When a CFO believes that a person who was a CMO is good at numbers it increases your credibility exponentially. Numerical literacy is a skill that all CMOs should train regardless of whether it comes naturally.

So what credibility does a CMO have to demonstrate to the board to be considered CEO material?

1. Develop cultural insights

The best CMOs understand what is happening in society. Cultural awareness improves relevance. Marketing leaders can develop brand and business strategies that make a brand more relevant. Improved relevance means faster growth.

A great personal example of a brand pivoting to remain culturally relevant was Taco Bell in 2011. The role of food in society shifted around this time from fuel to an experience. This necessitated the change in tagline from “Think Outside the Bun” a comparison to the burger chains as an alternative place to find your fuel.

Taco Bell adopted the tagline to “Live Mas” and moved its messaging to reflect its new role as a lifestyle brand. It remained culturally relevant and has enjoyed a wonderful past decade.

2. Develop employee insights and define customer experience



The customer experience will never exceed employee experience. As such a CMO that is in tune with broader culture should also have a better handle on the companies’ employees/team members as well.

Customer experience is a key component of the brand experience and while the COO will execute customer experience it needs to be defined by the CMO. It’s important that the COO believes that their team can execute the CMO’s customer experience vision.

If employees do not buy into this vision nor will the customer. Being in tune with the team builds greater connections with the customer. This is what brand building is all about.

3. Be a great storyteller



Be the author of the story that explains and makes your brand more distinctive and easy to understand. Tell your story in a genuine and enthusiastic way that is galvanizes the hearts and minds of both the consumer and moreover your fellow employees and C-Suite team.

As marketers we talk so much about speaking to your audience in a way that they understand and that is meaningful for them. Well the same applies to your CEO.

What story do they want to hear? What do they find exciting or compelling?

While some people are naturally born story tellers the good news is that story telling is a skill that can be learned and eventually mastered.

I have two secrets I have relied upon in my career. Firstly “less is more”. Make your stories as short as possible. Secondly never make yourself the hero of the story. Apply these secrets to your external communications but also to your internal team.

4. Be socially relevant (word-of-mouth)



Make your brand the topic of dinner conversation. There is nothing better than the CEO or board members going to outside events and being told by others what an exciting cool or interesting brand has been curated. You make your brand socially relevant by doing things that get talked about in the general population. Taco Bell for example ran an April Fools stunt and took out advertisements announcing they had bought the Liberty Bell. We also once created a Pop-Up hotel in Palm Springs that sold out in under two minutes. Pizza Hut once sent the first Pizza into space. Of course a brand is not solely built on these talking points. But acts like this generate buzz that even your company peers will be privy to.

5. Be Commercial



Know your business and the economics that drive your business as well as anyone in the finance department. This is not about accounting per se but about demonstrating that you know how to make money. They will never give you the key to the CEO office if you cannot demonstrate this capability. Be inquisitive and ask questions if you don’t know. Again this comes down to education. My first step was a 10-day finance workshop at Stanford University that I called “Finance for Marketing Dummies”. It helped my confidence but also gave me credibility with the finance team. Since then I’ve continued to train and educate myself in this area. You cannot succeed in a CEO role without this skillset so start learning as soon as you can.

Blockers to a functioning CMO/CEO relationships

I also want to share a few thoughts about things that get in the way of fruitful CMO/CEO relationships.

The first is the idea that just because you can measure something that does not necessarily make it important. Some of the most important things in life cannot be measured or given a score. In business I would equally argue that the two most important assets that will define any organizations success are their people and brands. Yet because the accountants have not been able to put a “value” on people or brands it is unlikely they will be quantified and appear on the balance sheet. As such many executives particularly CFOs or CEOs who are former CFOs do not consider them as important or critical. I attribute a significant proportion of the lack of trust in CMOs to the absence of clear-cut quantitative data.

58% of CEOs believe that CMOs speak their own language versus the ‘language of business’. This lines up with the fact that so few CEOs come from the CMO track. However we must ask what are CEOs who come from a non-marketing background doing to understand marketing language? Marketers general managers presidents and CEOs must work together to ensure everyone understands the language of marketing. CEOs must feel more confident when they are talking with their own marketers.

Lastly my personal experience is that many CEOs and in fact most of the other C-suite executives think of the CMO as a creative crazy fun less disciplined seat-of-the-pants executive. Whilst they love having them on the team (and who doesn’t love a fun colleague) they get pigeonholed as a player not a leader.

The need for greater CMO representation

Why should more CMOs be CEOs? Why is it important to improve CMO representation? The answer as mentioned is people and brands.

The one person who knows more than anyone else about both is the CMO. Being the brand builder should be their key competency. Moreover CMOs also know both the cultural and social insights that drive both employee and consumer behavior. Perhaps if a few more companies saw their CMO as a true CEO contender – like Yum did for me – they would see their sales increase and their brands expand.

But as a final call-to-action for marketing leaders who find themselves at the helm as a CEO: The job is only half-done. Renew your efforts to learn the language of business and empathize with all members of the C-Suite. Your board brand and balance sheet will thank you!

Coca-Cola Co. McDonald’s Corp. Starbucks Corp. and Yum! Brands Inc. to the growing list of companies suspending some operations in Russia over that country’s invasion of Ukraine.

Ramon Laguarta chief executive officer of PepsiCo Inc. Purchase NY said in an email to employees on March 8 that the company would suspend the sale of beverages like Pepsi Cola 7UP and Mirinda as well as capital investments and all advertising in Russia.

“As a food and beverage company now more than ever we must stay true to the humanitarian aspect of our business” Mr. Laguarta wrote. “That means we have a responsibility to continue to offer our other products in Russia including daily essentials such as milk and other dairy offerings baby formula and baby food. By continuing to operate we will also continue to support the livelihoods of our 20000 Russian associates and the 40000 Russian agricultural workers in our supply chain as they face significant challenges and uncertainty ahead.”

Mr. Laguarta added that PepsiCo has suspended operations in Ukraine and is working to provide aid to Ukrainian refugees in neighboring countries through donations to aid agencies and the ramping up of production at other PepsiCo manufacturing plants in Europe.

The Coca-Cola Co. Atlanta released a brief statement March 8 that it was “suspending its businesses” in Russia but did not provide details.

McDonald’s temporarily will close all its restaurants in Russia and pause all operations in that market according to an email sent March 8 by Chris Kempczinski CEO to employees and franchises.

On the same day Kevin Johnson president and CEO of Starbucks wrote employees saying the company was suspending all business activity in Russia. The company has approximately 130 locations in the country.

“Our licensed partner has agreed to immediately pause store operations and will provide support to the nearly 2000 partners in Russia who depend on Starbucks for their livelihood” he wrote.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine also drew a reaction from Yum! Brands. The owner of the KFC Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands suspended all investment and restaurant development in Russia.

In Russia McDonald’s at the end of 2021 had 847 restaurants with 84% operated by the company. The chain had 108 in Ukraine all operated by the company. The two countries accounted for 2% of McDonald’s systemwide sales in 2021.

“We understand the impact this will have on our Russian colleagues and partners which is why we are prepared to support all three legs of the stool in Ukraine and Russia” Mr. Kempczinski said of restaurants closing in Russia. “This includes salary continuation for all McDonald’s employees in Russia.”

Chicago-based McDonald’s also is paying full salaries to Ukrainian employees has donated $5 million to an employee assistance fund and is supporting relief efforts by the International Red Cross.

“Across the rest of Europe we will stay focused on how McDonald’s can best help those in need both now and in the future” Mr. Kempczinski said. “We have already seen extraordinary leadership by our Ukrainian and Russian teams and I know the rest of the McDonald’s system stands ready to support the large number of refugees who have been displaced by this conflict.

“As we move forward McDonald’s will continue to assess the situation and determine if any additional measures are required. At this juncture it’s impossible to predict when we might be able to reopen our restaurants in Russia. We are experiencing disruptions to our supply chain along with other operational impacts. We will also closely monitor the humanitarian situation.”

Louisville Ky.-based Yum! has about 1000 KFC restaurants and 50 Pizza Hut locations in Russia. Independent operators run nearly all the restaurants under license or franchise agreements. Yum! is donating $1 million to the Red Cross is activating a disaster relief fund to support Ukrainian franchise employees and is matching donations from employees to charities providing relief in Ukraine.

“McDonald’s and other fast-food outlets are under pressure to withdraw from the Russian market” said Ramsey Baghdadi a consumer analyst for GlobalData March 8. “However this is easier said than done for the fast-food industry. Russia represents approximately 0.7% of the global fast-food restaurant’s value in 2020. Such a small proportion of value generation in Russia tells us that fears of losing sales is not the main factor at play here.

“The challenge that foodservice providers have is the very nature of their business model. Fast-food chains such as McDonald’s and KFC often have complicated agreements with their outlets as a large proportion of them are franchises and are not enterprises. So it becomes a much more challenging negotiation to completely stop operations compared to other industries.”

A GlobalData consumer survey released in March showed consumer concern for social causes however.

“As 72% of consumer purchases are driven by a brand’s ethics or support shown toward a social cause it becomes difficult for these companies to balance consumer expectations and their operational needs putting pressure on international fast-food restaurants” Mr. Baghdadi said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNzcndpcmUuY29tL3ByZXNzX3JlbGVhc2VzLzc1MzkzMS11bmxpbWl0ZWQtcG9zc2liaWxpdGllcy1ob3cta2ZjLWNoaW5hLWFuZ2VsLXJlc3RhdXJhbnRzLWVtcGxveWVlcy1hY2hpZXZlZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CSRWire - “Unlimited Possibilities”- How KFC China “Angel Restaurants” Employees Achieved Their Dreams,"Published 09-02-22 Submitted by Yum China

Liu Qingquan with his team at the Angel Restaurant

Yum China’s “Angel Restaurants” continue to provide gainful job opportunities for employees with disabilities and they are receiving greater recognition from the public for it. However it is not just about providing a job but also helping “Angel Employees” to learn and grow. “Angel Restaurants” is a place where employees can better communicate with customers and work towards their full potential in an environment filled with joy and empathy. The initiative is proving to be effective in bridging divides between employees and customers whilst underscoring the benefits of working and realizing one’s potential at “Angel Restaurants” for millions of people with disabilities. In the future Yum China will continue to provide diversified development opportunities for “Angel Employees” to help them achieve their dreams.

Liu Qingquan: Realizing his full potential

Liu Qingquan (Liu) a man with hearing impairment in his thirties still clearly remembers the day when he first entered a KFC“Angel Restaurant” for a job interview in Foshan South China's Guangdong province.

“It wasn’t hot that day but I started to sweat as soon as I walked into the restaurant” Liu said. “I was afraid that I wasn’t qualified enough to work at such a nice place.”

However he soon discovered that this restaurant is special. There are flashing lights installed in order to indicate when the fried chicken is ready which is a great help to those workers with hearing impairments.

In addition to modified equipment customized training and operational processes were provided to Liu to quickly familiarize him with the job. Liu recalls “a management team member was assigned as a mentor to me once I joined the restaurant offering me one-on-one training so that I could learn the necessary skills as well as tools to better help me understand the operational processes. “

Liu also found that employees at “Angel Restaurants” are encouraged to learn and practice sign language sharing that “we have eleven full-time employees in the restaurant including six “Angel Employees” like myself. However everyone can understand how I sign and I often get responses from my colleagues in sign language which is very comforting.”

This March Liu was surprised to find that the “Angel Restaurant” he worked at had been upgraded with brand-new accessibility features such as several greetings in sign language when placing orders online and interactive visualization devices to help consumers communicate with hearing impaired employees such as himself. Furthermore his restaurant and others had been equipped with visual learning materials. Li Liang the first “Angel Employee” to become a restaurant general manager was invited to make a special appearance in a series of sign-language teaching videos.

“The updated devices in the “Angel Restaurant” have greatly helped in bridging what would have been a divide between employees like me and customers. I love seeing their bright happy faces when served a cup of hot coffee” Liu said.

“Working here also gives me opportunities to give back to society. I’ve felt a calling in particular to organize community events” Liu stated before adding “for example I will organize and teach children sign-language classes and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic my team and I sent care to frontline medical workers to express our gratitude for their service.”

With his excellent performance Liu has been promoted to service team leader and he came first in the regional “Championship Challenge.” This has inspired him to work towards even grander dreams.

Liu has enrolled in Yum China’s “Angel College” Program which supports “Angel Employees” in receiving further education and helps to improve their vocational skills through the Open University of China. Liu will start his studies this September.

“With Yum China “Angel Employees” like me can enjoy the same career path as other employees. Now I have the opportunity to finally realize my dream of earning a bachelor’s degree” said Liu.

Liu said that working in the “Angel Restaurant” has helped him to discover his untapped potential pushing him to constantly strive for excellence with his next dream being to become a restaurant general manager.

“As far as I know there is already one “Angel Employee” restaurant general manager in Shenzhen” Liu said going on to say that “I believe this program will help me move one step closer towards my dream of becoming a restaurant general manager myself.”"

In fact when a new national trait is launched often Net Merit (NM$) and TPI are updated simultaneously. And yet they have a different selection goal. It is important to realize that NM$ and TPI are distinctly different indexes by what they aim to achieve and who decides that aim.

TPI is owned and managed by Holstein Association USA just like JPI (Jersey) Production Type Index (PTI) (Ayrshire and Guernsey) and Progressive Performance Ranking (PPR) (Brown Swiss) are owned by their respective breed associations as well. Therefore TPI selects for the best Holstein animal where ""best"" is defined by qualitative analyses that are driven by empirical and subjective factors determined by experts working for or with Holstein Association USA. The traits and weights in TPI are opinion based. They are backed up by science and mathematics but are subjective when it comes to how the association agrees they measure up to the desired Holstein cow of the future.

NM$ is the U.S. national index and was created by the USDA to give U.S. producers a single economic dollar value for lifetime profitability of the U.S. commercial dairy cow. Thereby NM$ includes all developed national traits with economic value to lifetime profitability. While there are discussions in many committees about the traits and weights in NM$ a newly developed trait gets added to NM$ by default if it has economic value and correlation to lifetime profitability. The weights are calculated by genetic parameters and current economic weights.

Lastly there are the proprietary indexes owned by private companies. The Dairy Wellness Profit Index (DWP$) is a good example of a well-known proprietary index owned by Zoetis. Being owned by a business the objective of a proprietary index is always to create additional revenue (through sales of genomic tests or genetics). The selection goals are often fulfilling a gap of a producer need that existing indexes do not cover. This can be a different weighing of traits or the development of novel traits that are presented in an index for simplicity. In Zoetis’s example DWP$ offered a larger emphasis on health and access to proprietary health traits on cows and calves that weren’t present (yet) through the national evaluation.

Advertisement

Some proprietary indexes do not advertise a clear selection goal and simply state the response to selection that can be expected such as better efficiency better health or increased immunity. That is fine if the producer is informed about what the content of the index is. It is important that you make sure that the index covers selection on the whole animal to avoid achieving adverse response to selection in traits that are not considered.

Know what is in the index

The content of the national indexes as well as most of the breed association indexes are publicly available on the websites of the Council of Dairy Cattle Breeding and respective breed associations. The indexes are updated regularly with new economic values and traits. These changes are publicly announced and explained.



Unfortunately it is a lot more difficult to know the contents of the proprietary indexes because that information is often kept confidential. From a business perspective that makes sense. Why make your secret recipe public for the competitor to repeat? But for a producer it’s hard to know if the index fits your breeding goal if you don’t know what the index selects for. Even if you trust the company representative for knowing your needs you still need to consider the traits that are not in the index and avoid double counting the ones that are. Make sure you get to know how the index is constructed before starting selection.

Is the index available on bulls across the board?

The whole point of a selection index is to summarize traits into a single value that can be used for comparison of animals. Breed association indexes are calculated on registered animals that can be compared and national indexes are compared on all animals receiving a U.S. genetic evaluation.

Proprietary indexes are not always calculated for all bulls and cows which is a concern. Especially when proprietary traits are involved companies like to keep predictions of those traits and indexes exclusive to their own animals or to animals that are tested by their products. That makes comparison across the board very difficult if not impossible.

If you do not want to work exclusively with a particular portfolio of bulls it becomes difficult to select for a proprietary index in such a way that you achieve the selection objective that is set out by that index. In essence you are forced to use multiple indexes on a variety of bulls which blurs your breeding goal. So if the proprietary index fits your breeding goal you may have to concede to using just the bulls that have that value. If you do not want to be that restricted it may be best to choose a non-proprietary index. Do not start mixing and matching indexes based on what bulls you like because you will slow down genetic progress by not having a clear direction.

Consider creating your own index

In a perfect world every producer should have his or her own selection index. Many large breeders already do. Selection objectives and indexes should vary as widely as the variety of dairy producers. So creating a herd’s own index is recommended but complicated. There are tools available to create selection indexes but they may offer black boxes that do not explain what is being calculated.

When creating an index it is recommended to consult with a geneticist or adviser who can help to make sure the index is constructed in a way that accounts for accurate genetic and phenotypic relationships between the selection traits. This may sound easy when thinking of the negative relationship between production and daughter pregnancy rate. But considering the genetic correlation of daughter pregnancy rate with productive life – a trait calculated using several indicator traits itself – demonstrates how complicated it can get. Substantial losses can occur when selection is intense and indirect values are ignored.

Conclusion

Genetic improvement is realized when there is continuous long-term selection for a constant breeding goal. Choosing a selection index is therefore a commitment. Changing or mixing selection indexes restricts genetic improvement by change of direction. The defining of a clear breeding goal is key. This should be independent from ranking lists and marketing which can distract. It is then important to find out the objective and content of the index. Ask questions when that information is not publicly available.",,,,,,,,,
