""Downtown and skyways are starting to have a noticeable pulse again"" said Patrick Skinner general manager of Wells Fargo Place the tallest office building in St. Paul's downtown.

The 37-story tower is 90% leased and Skinner now expects building usage to be 60 to 65% of pre-pandemic levels by the summer up from 30 to 35% now.

""Within the last couple of weeks we have learned that all of our tenants save for a couple smaller tenants are planning a return-to work-strategy for the near future"" Skinner said.

Before most office employees started working from home in March 2020 about 1500 workers from Wells Fargo the Internal Revenue Service Merrill Lynch Wealth Management and other tenants were in the building daily.

""We are also seeing very encouraging improvement in activity and sales numbers for our restaurant tenants"" Skinner said.

Downtown Minneapolis and the areas around big corporate campuses such as 3M and Best Buy also will get a boost as more companies set plans for a hybrid schedule for workers.

In downtown St. Paul Wells Fargo workers started coming back last week as did the Travelers Companies' 2100 insurance workers in St. Paul. Securian Financial has set Tuesday for the start of its phased return while Ecolab corporate employees will return April 4.

Already the moves are leading to increasing activity on the streets said Joe Spencer president of St. Paul Downtown Alliance.

""Walking around downtown these days you can feel an anticipation and excitement brewing just under the surface"" Spencer wrote in an e-mail. He also pointed to recently opened bars and restaurants like Momento Lost Fox MetroNome Brewery and Hepcat Coffee.

Sunny skies plus the return-to-work announcements renewed St. Patrick's Day events the Minnesota boys high school hockey tournament — all are ""adding up to a feeling that's been missing for most of the last two years"" Spencer said.

The plummeting COVID-19 infection rates in recent weeks have led many Twin Cities employers to set in motion plans to add office days back into the mix.

Travelers is taking a ""flexible approach to work arrangements"" a spokeswoman said. ""This means that some employees have chosen to or have roles that require them to work from the office full time. While others have fully remote positions and some have chosen a hybrid arrangement.""

That's the approach most companies are taking although the details of hybrid plans differ.

3M reopened its headquarters campus in Maplewood last week and announced its ""Work Your Way"" model that lets most workers choose options.

While most lab and manufacturing employees have to work on-site 3M's U.S. office employees including the nearly 10000 in Minnesota were given a choice to return to the office said 3M spokesman Tim Post during a phone interview.

""Working from a 3M office will be another option for 3M's nonproduction employees as they find a schedule that best works for them"" Post said.

Best Buy's approach for most headquarters employees is more structured — three days in the office two at home or another location of their choice the company said. Some employees will be full time at the Richfield campus and other offices some will be fully remote.

Best Buy's new hybrid structure goes into effect the week of April 18.

Deluxe Corp. employees at the company's new downtown Minneapolis headquarters officially started hybrid work last week joining workers at employers such as the city of Minneapolis the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and Ameriprise Financial.

""We are definitely seeing an increase in workday activity especially in the middle of the week Tuesday through Thursday"" said Steve Cramer chief executive of Minneapolis Downtown Council.

If so you understand how the Minnesota Gophers and their fans feel after Saturday night’s Big Ten playoff championship game.

With a noisy record-breaking audience on hand and a trophy at stake the visiting Michigan Wolverines offered little for the home fans to cheer about. Michigan erased an early Gophers lead and survived a late Gophers rally for a 4-3 win to claim the conference’s post-season title.

Mackie Samoskevich had a goal and an assist for the Wolverines who will be a number one seed in the NCAA tournament when the bracket is announced on Sunday evening. The Gophers got a goal from Jaxon Nelson in the opening minute and two from Matthew Knies on a power play in the final minute but saw their nine-game winning streak snapped.

""It's been a long time since we lost a game"" said Gophers coach Bob Motzko looking ahead to the NCAA tournament. ""It's going to make us better. We needed a game like that to get the cobwebs off after sitting around for a while.""

With the loss Minnesota (24-12-0) will likely fall to a number two seed when the full NCAA field and their first round opponent will be revealed at 5:30 p.m. Sunday on ESPN. The Gophers who won the Big Ten’s regular season title got 27 saves from goalie Justen Close but came up short for the first time since late January.

The notion that we would see a lock-it-down defensive slog typical of many playoff games was spoiled in the opening 77 seconds when each team scored on its first shot to elate then quiet the raucous sellout audience.

It started on the opening shift when the Wolverines left the middle of the ice open allowing Jackson LaCombe to connect with Nelson on a long pass and the latter stuffed a puck past Portillo for a very early lead.

""After we had a rush it just opened up"" LaCombe said. ""I kinda floated one up. Luckily it hit his stick and he went in for the goal.""

Michigan answered at the 1:17 mark and just like that the game was level again.

Michigan took its first lead on a classic “own goal” when Samoskevich fired a puck across the front of the Minnesota goalmouth. Gophers defenseman Mike Koster looking to deflect the puck away from danger instead saw the puck deflect off his stick and into the net. Samoskevich was credited with the goal his 10th of the season.

Michigan got a pair in the second period to open up a commanding lead and played a stifling defensive game in their own end of the rink all night severely limiting the Gophers’ ability to make plays around Wolverines goalie Erik Portillo.

""They're dialed in they're driven. They're champions they really are"" said Wolverines coach Mel Pearson who was soaked in the post-game press conference following the team's celebration. ""Off the ice on the ice I give them so much credit.""

Portillo finished with 25 saves and was named the playoffs most valuable player as Michigan improved to 29-9-1.

""They have great D and they can all skate and move"" Gophers co-captain Sammy Walker said. ""I think we could've done a better job of getting pucks to the goal line and kind of working them down low. But they've got a good team.""

With Close on the bench and Wolverines in the penalty box late Knies finally re-engaged the crowd scoring with just under a minute left and again with 5.8 seconds on the clock but by then it was too late.

It was standing room only in the student section as the Minnesota Gophers got ready to take on Michigan in the Big Ten Men’s Hockey championship game at 3M Arena at Mariucci in Minneapolis on Saturday March 19 2022. John Autey / The Rink Live

Unlike previous years’ Big Ten playoff games which have had sparse audiences this was one of the most sought after Gophers home tickets in the past decade. Five sections of students filled one end of the rink more than 30 minutes before the opening faceoff and a record crowd of 10774 was announced – the largest in 3M Arena at Mariucci history.

""That was the only disappointing thing is that they were ready to go tonight"" Motzko said of the sellout crowd. ""We teased them with the first (goal) and we just never got the second one.""

Despite becoming one of Britain's most sought-after TV stars the comedian has shunned celebrity enclaves and instead chosen to build a six-bedroom property in his home town of Crawley in West Sussex.

The 43-year-old his wife Leesa and their three children recently moved in although workmen are still digging the swimming pool and putting the finishing touches to the red-brick house.

Romesh Ranganathan (pictured) has previously spoken about his impoverished upbringing including the challenges faced by his family when their home was repossessed

It is a far cry from the small house nearby where he grew up with his Sri Lankan parents Shanthi and Ranga and his younger brother Dinesh.

A source told The Mail on Sunday: 'Romesh could have moved somewhere flash but he decided to stay in Crawley where his roots are. It's where his mum and brother are and it's a town he loves.

'He has managed to find a space there to build his dream home though it is rather bigger than his childhood home in one of the poorer areas of Crawley. It's a lovely story of rags to riches which Romesh has worked very hard for.'

The comedian who replaced Anne Robinson as the host of The Weakest Link has previously spoken about his impoverished upbringing including the challenges faced by his family when their home was repossessed after his accountant father was jailed for two years for fraud.

Recalling how the family spent a period in bed-and-breakfast accommodation as they waited for the council to rehouse them he said: 'This all happened very very quickly. It was a struggle.

'My mum found out my dad had been messing around. He fell into financial difficulty so we ended up getting our house taken away.

'We were supposed to go into a council flat but they didn't have enough so we were in a bed-and-breakfast for a year and a half. And my dad was in prison. It was insane.'

The comic whose mother appeared regularly in his BBC travel series Asian Provocateur was previously a maths teacher and head of sixth form at Hazelwick school in Crawley where he had also been a pupil.

It was there he met his wife a fellow teacher. Before moving into their new home the Ranganathans lived in a rather more modest detached property a mile away.

Mr Ranganathan made clear his allegiance to the West Sussex town – whose other notable residents include England manager Gareth Southgate and Crown actress Erin Doherty – by calling his 2018 autobiography Straight Outta Crawley: Memoirs Of A Distinctly Average Human Being.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvZmlybS1ydW4tYnktcGVlcnMtaHVzYmFuZC1mYWNlcy0zbS10YXgtYmlsbC1rN3cwbnFzamTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Firm run by peer's husband faces £3m tax bill,"A firm that promoted tax avoidance schemes and was run by the billionaire husband of Baroness Mone faces a tax bill of up to £3.3 million after a legal verdict that criticised it for being “evasive” in an HMRC investigation.

AML which was based on the Isle of Man was one of the biggest promoters of loan-based tax avoidance schemes which recruited thousands of contractors including doctors social workers nurses and IT workers who later received large bills from HMRC.

A deal for 148 acres milking parlour extensive buildings and two storey house at Breska Clarina was struck in recent weeks. The sale is the talk of the locality with local sources saying the figure achieved is in the region of €2.9m.

The highest bidder in a fiercely contested contest is understood to be a West Limerick-based businessman. He beat off competition from dairy farmers and business interests.

When contacted by the Limerick Leader GVM Group Property Director Tom Crosse refused to comment on the particulars of the sale.

All he would say is: “I can confirm a deal has been done. All parties are very satisfied.”

When the farm was first advertised in January Mr Crosse said at the time that it was the “best dairy farm to come on the market for years in Limerick”.

“This holding is renowned locally as a top class dairy farm. It is an ideal opportunity to acquire a self contained and very sustainable ‘ready to go’ dairy unit situated just 15 minutes drive south of Limerick city in a very affluent locality made up of sizable agricultural holdings and very good quality ‘one off’ housing” said Mr Crosse.

He was guiding around the €2m mark for the Clarina holding. However it achieved close to a million more such was the interest. It works out at around €19500 per acre.

The highly respected current owners are retiring from farming and understood to be moving to Kerry. While there was interest from the Kingdom Breska will remain in Limerick hands.

Due to the price achieved in Clarina and dairy markets “surging” it will be interesting to see if more dairy farmers put their enterprises up for sale in coming months and “get out” while the going is good."

ABT,Abbott,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tLzIyOTgzNDAzL2FiYm90dC1lbGVtZW50YXJ5LXRlYWNoZXJzLXBlcnNvbmFsaXR50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What your favorite Abbott Elementary teacher says about how you were in school,"It is nearly impossible to pick a favorite character from Abbott Elementary’s eclectic and colorful cast. The sitcom takes place in Philadelphia elementary school and follows a colorful group of teachers doing their darn best to help their students succeed amidst low budgets and a school district that could care less. These teachers are uncannily specific and zany — yet they all feel like they could be plucked from our own school day memories.

If you had to pick a favorite though it would probably reflect your favorite teacher in school — and that would say a lot about how you approached your own school days. Behold a very accurate and scientifically-tested personality assessment that will reveal secrets of your past and perhaps hints of your future … based on which Abbott Elementary teacher you like the most.

Janine Teagues

Played by series creator Quinta Brunson Janine is a young go-getter with big hopes and dreams for her journey as a teacher. If Janine is your favorite you were 100% a teacher’s pet. It’s not that you were particularly good at school but you maintained a rapport with your favorite teachers. You were the kid who showed up to class early and remembered things about your teachers’ personal lives. You ate lunch with them and spent recess pestering them. You did all the extra-credit assignments and raised your hand even when you didn’t really know the answer. You strove to get good grades but less because you liked to learn and more because you wanted the positive feedback from the adults in your life. Because of this you also had a hard time relating to your peers and didn’t have a lot of friends. But that’s okay because you got to eat lunch in the teacher’s room! That’s cool right? Please say that’s cool.

Melissa Schemmenti

Melissa played by Lisa Ann Walter is a no-nonsense second grade teacher from South Philly who can get anything she wants by calling someone she knows who owes her a favor.

Your favorite teacher absolutely made fun of you. But you were totally OK with that because you kinda felt it coming. Maybe it was because you were the only one who cared about school or maybe you were particularly earnest and a do-gooder or maybe you had an emo phase and wore bad clip-on hair extensions. The teasing was never mean because you were in on the joke and secretly you also just felt really touched that someone noticed you actually. As someone who spent a lot of school days getting overlooked by your peers you felt special when a teacher noticed you — even when it was in a lightly teasing way. You had a hard time connecting to others but when you did finally find your squad you really shone.

Or if this does not apply to you at all you should see Jacob’s entry instead.

Barbara Howard

Barbara (Sheryl Lee Ralph) is a legend at Abbott Elementary: a respected teacher with years of wisdom under her belt. So if she’s your favorite you maybe sat in front of the class and kept color-coded folders. But your role in a group project was to make sure no one messed up. People who couldn’t follow simple directions annoyed you. You believed that the classroom rules were there for a reason and that the people who didn’t follow them were just plain rude. You got good grades and read all the assigned reading on time. You had great respect for your teachers but at the same time a lot of the other students respected you — when you weren’t telling the teacher that they were sharing homework answers. The thought of using SparkNotes absolutely disgusts you. In contrast to the Janine people out there you did not actually volunteer or raise your hand first; you didn’t have to prove you were the smartest in the room because you knew it.

Ava Coleman

Played by Janelle James the principal of Abbott Elementary would rather focus on her social media accounts than run the school. As such if Ava is your favorite you probably weren’t good at the whole school thing but you really shone when it came to extracurriculars. You weren’t quite a class clown but you did get in trouble a lot for talking and asking questions that weren’t all that related to the material going on. You liked to push the limits of what you could get away with in class. This was either a hit or miss with your teachers — but boy when it was a hit it was a hit and they treated you like the special star that you are. You may’ve been on first-name basis with some teachers while others kept writing you up no matter what you did. Hey taste isn’t for everyone! You dreamed of bigger things than grades and schoolwork. If you found an extracurricular activity you clicked with then you threw yourself into it but if not you bounced around and just had fun meeting new people. You may have been involved in student government and probably ran against someone who took it waaaaayy too seriously but because you were here for a good time you dominated the polls.

Gregory Eddie

Gregory (Tyler James Williams) is the newest teacher at Abbott Elementary called in to be a substitute and he really only is using this job as a launch-point to become a principal one day. You showed up to school because you had to not because you wanted to. That is not to say you did badly in school; you did just fine thank you very much. But you didn’t put any effort into doing anything else at school besides school. Sure you joined the activities you needed in order to make your resume look good for colleges but you didn’t spend an extra moment doing anything you didn’t have to. Yet despite the fact you actively went out of your way to not do anything extra your classmates loved you and your teachers thought you were the bee’s knees. You’re not sure how this happened but you may have been asked to give a speech at graduation or been elected to homecoming court. Everyone liked you and you’re not entirely sure how or why.

Jacob Hill

Sweet sweet Jacob (Chris Perfetti) is another young teacher who was hired with Janine and the butt of many a joke with his very earnest and sometimes (often?) cringe personality.

You absolutely made fun of your favorite teacher. You were cocky and picked one teacher who was an easy target. Early on you decided that in order to show dominance among your classmates you needed to be the loudest and most obnoxious kid in the room — and yes that meant making fun of teachers. But none of this was done out of any malice; nah your favorite teachers riffed you right back and you enjoyed some nice back-and-forth banter. They even wrote your letters of recommendation for you. With little effort you maintained decent grades and skyrocketed to popularity. You weren’t really anyone’s best friend but everyone liked you and knew your name.

Or if this does not apply to you at all you should see Melissa’s entry instead.

Mr. Johnson

The eccentric school custodian (William Stanford Davis) knows his way around an electrical circuit but would rather be fishing with his buddies. As a student you were better with your hands than with your mind and didn’t like it when they stopped having classes where you got to build something. You and tests didn’t jive very well but you were actually very smart and perceptive burdened with the wisdom of life at a young age. You didn’t subscribe to the traditional way of doing things which brushed up against your teachers back in school but nowadays … you are free from conformity and do what you want when you want and how you want. Still you’d rather be fishing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vYWJib3R0LWVsZW1lbnRhcnktbW92aWVzLXR2LXNob3dzLXNlZW4tdGhlLWNhc3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Abbott Elementary: 10 Movies And TV Shows Where You've Seen The Cast,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vYWJib3R0LWVsZW1lbnRhcnktbW92aWVzLXR2LXNob3dzLXNlZW4tdGhlLWNhc3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy53d2xwLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RleGFzLWdvdmVybm9yLWFiYm90dC1zcGVha3MtYXQtZWFzdGxhbmQtZmlyZS1zdGF0aW9uLWFtaWQtZWFzdGxhbmQtY29tcGxleC1maXJlcy1zaWducy1kZWNsYXJhdGlvbi1vZi1kaXNhc3Rlci_SAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3dscC5jb20vbmV3cy90ZXhhcy1nb3Zlcm5vci1hYmJvdHQtc3BlYWtzLWF0LWVhc3RsYW5kLWZpcmUtc3RhdGlvbi1hbWlkLWVhc3RsYW5kLWNvbXBsZXgtZmlyZXMtc2lnbnMtZGVjbGFyYXRpb24tb2YtZGlzYXN0ZXIvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas Governor Abbott speaks at Eastland fire station amid Eastland Complex fires signs declaration of disaster,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wwlp.com/news/texas-governor-abbott-speaks-at-eastland-fire-station-amid-eastland-complex-fires-signs-declaration-of-disaster/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy53d2xwLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RleGFzLWdvdmVybm9yLWFiYm90dC1zcGVha3MtYXQtZWFzdGxhbmQtZmlyZS1zdGF0aW9uLWFtaWQtZWFzdGxhbmQtY29tcGxleC1maXJlcy1zaWducy1kZWNsYXJhdGlvbi1vZi1kaXNhc3Rlci_SAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3dscC5jb20vbmV3cy90ZXhhcy1nb3Zlcm5vci1hYmJvdHQtc3BlYWtzLWF0LWVhc3RsYW5kLWZpcmUtc3RhdGlvbi1hbWlkLWVhc3RsYW5kLWNvbXBsZXgtZmlyZXMtc2lnbnMtZGVjbGFyYXRpb24tb2YtZGlzYXN0ZXIvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3NuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2FydGljbGUvVGV4YXMtR3VhcmQtY29tbWFuZGVyLWdvdC1yYXctZGVhbC1mcm9tLTE3MDEyOTk0LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas Guard commander got 'raw deal' from Abbott other former top guardsmen say,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.expressnews.com/news/local/article/Texas-Guard-commander-got-raw-deal-from-17012994.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3NuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2FydGljbGUvVGV4YXMtR3VhcmQtY29tbWFuZGVyLWdvdC1yYXctZGVhbC1mcm9tLTE3MDEyOTk0LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiuQFodHRwczovL2xhbmNhc3Rlcm9ubGluZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9hdXRob3ItY3VyYXRvci1hcHBvaW50ZWQtbmV3LWV4ZWN1dGl2ZS1kaXJlY3Rvci1hdC13cmlnaHRzLWZlcnJ5LW1hbnNpb24taW4tY29sdW1iaWEvYXJ0aWNsZV8zMWI3MTMyMi1hNmU4LTExZWMtYjg1OC05Mzk3NDY2MmUxNjQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Author curator appointed new executive director at Wright's Ferry Mansion in Columbia,"As it prepares to reopen for the season in May Wright’s Ferry Mansion has appointed a new executive director James Archer Abbott.

Abbott comes to the Columbia historic site from the Lewes Historical Society in Lewes Delaware.

He has been a curator or director at museums in Baltimore; Washington D.C.; and New York’s Hudson Valley according to a news release. Abbott’s other past positions include director and curator of Johns Hopkins University’s Evergreen Museum and Library curator of the Woodrow Wilson House and curator of decorative arts for the Baltimore Museum of Art.

Abbott has written several books including his most recent 2021’s “Designing Camelot: The Kennedy White House Restoration and its Legacy” co-authored with Elaine Rice Bachmann.

In the news release Abbot says the mansion “celebrates 18th-century Colonial design and craftmanship and an exceptional collection of fine and decorative arts. The immediate grounds afford important context to the development of American trade and private enterprise.

“It is rare to have such opportunity to celebrate and engage with history at the level afforded by Wright’s Ferry Mansion” Abbot says adding he hopes to develop a visitors center and learning gallery in a building adjacent to the mansion.

The Colonial mansion was built in 1738 for original owner Susanna Wright a Quaker poet businesswoman and scholar. It’s unique in Pennsylvania for its early 18th-century architecture furnishings and decorative arts.

KEY HIGHLIGHTS The rumours that Putin uses botox treatment started after his visit to Kyiv in October 2011

Eli Lilly and Co Novartis and Abbvie Inc said that they will stop the supply of ""non-essential"" products that include botox

Netizens joked that the stock of botox injections running out would be the ""biggest challenge for Putin""

There have been rumours that Russian President Vladimir Putin uses botox treatment. If the rumours are true Putin might have to stop the botox treatment soon.

The sanctions imposed by the West on Russia due to its war with Ukraine will affect President Vladimir Putin as he might not be able to use Botox anymore according to reports. Putin reportedly might not be able to continue with the treatment due to the announcements made by some pharmaceutical companies in the wake of economic punishment.

According to Reuters Eli Lilly and Co Novartis and Abbvie Inc last week said that they would continue to supply critical medicines for the treatment of cancer and diabetes but will stop the supply of ""non-essential"" products that include botox.

Netizens reacted to the reports that Putin might have to stop botox treatment with memes and jokes.

One user said ""Putin's next target would the botox store."" Another wrote ""So this is how the war in Ukraine ends.""

A third user said ""Botox injections stock has run out.... biggest challenge for Putin."" Someone commented ""I can’t wait for the Botox in Putin’s face to start drooping.""

Yet another added ""Believe it on not  This is what i heard on tv ‘Mr #Putin has been using botox and fillers but with sanctions imposed Mr #Putin’s face will collapse’ #RussiaUkrainWar.

The use of Botox by Putin has been widely reported by several media houses including The Guardian. The rumours reportedly started after Putin's visit to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv in October 2011 as Russia's Prime Minister where he ""sported a massive blue-and-yellow bruise around his eye"".

However Putin's spokesperson denied the rumours saying ""It's probably just how the light fell. The prime minister is tired.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjb29wZWFydGguY29tL3ZsYWRpbWlyLXB1dGluLXRvLXB1dC1hbi1lbmQtdG8taGlzLWJvdG94LXRyZWF0bWVudC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vladimir Putin To Put An End To His Botox Treatment?

For a long time there have been rumours that Russian President Vladimir Putin uses botox. And with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a slew of jokes has sprung up around the rumour. Even if the rumours are genuine Putin may have to put an end to the treatments shortly.

Putin may no longer be allowed to use botox as a result of Western sanctions against Russia according to sources. This is owing to statements made by several pharmaceutical corporations in the aftermath of financial penalties.

Last week Eli Lilly and Co Novartis Abbvie Inc and other pharmaceutical companies announced that they would continue to deliver vital drugs for cancer and diabetes therapy but that non-essential treatments would be discontinued.

Eli Lilly and Co Novartis and Abbvie Inc are among the businesses that according to Reuters indicated last week that they will continue to deliver crucial cancer and diabetes treatments while discontinuing “non-essential” items.

Putin has been taking botox for quite some time according to both The Daily Beast and The Guardian.

In a storey headed “What has happened with Putin’s face?” published ten years ago The Guardian noted that Russia’s liberal New Times magazine has renewed the notion.

It talked with four plastic doctors all of whom said that Russian President Vladimir Putin had had cosmetic surgery. Botox injections in his forehead an eye-lift on his lower lids and a firming filler injection into his cheekbones were all possibilities.

AbbVie a worldwide pharmaceutical firm that makes Botox said on its website that it has temporarily halted operations in Russia for its aesthetics medicines including Botox while the Ukraine situation progresses. According to the corporation it does not have any production units in the area. AbbVie will continue to manufacture and supply life-saving medications to Russian patients.

Drugmakers are having to walk a delicate line between boycotting Russia and continuing to supply ordinary individuals with crucial pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical equipment despite tremendous public pressure on western corporations to stop doing business there. Abbott said this week that it was stopping non-essential activity in Russia including new investments business growth and advertising. Abbott has officially criticised the conflict. However the business stated that it will continue to deliver life-sustaining drugs in Russia for cancer maintenance and organ function.

Other pharmaceutical corporations such as Bayer in Germany Eli Lilly in the United States and Pfizer in the United Kingdom have adopted similar positions. They’re halting non-essential business in Russia while continuing to provide critical medications and gadgets.",,,,,,

Professional services firm Accenture has launched a new metaverse advisory business line which will support clients with everything from strategy through to metaverse world-building.

Backed by its new survey finding that close to half of business leaders across industries believe the metaverse will have a significant impact professional services firm Accenture is gearing up its work dedicated to the unfolding technology.

Dubbed ‘Metaverse Continuum’ the new business group will be jointly led by technology group chief executive Paul Daugherty and Accenture Interactive boss David Droga (the founder of Droga5).

“We are recognised as an early leader in metaverse-related capabilities with 600 patent filings and more than a decade of experience” said Droga who took the helm of Interactive last year. “Our new business group combines these capabilities with the creative strengths of Accenture Interactive with teams of innovators and creators introducing new applications in the decentralised environment of the metaverse.”

The firm envisions a coming decade where business will be completely revolutionised the metaverse transforming how companies interact with customers the products and services they offer and how they’re produced and even how work is performed. It contends that as technologies such as extended reality digital twins and blockchain converge businesses face a future that is far removed from the one they were designed to operate in.

“The next generation of the internet is unfolding and will drive a new wave of digital transformation far greater than what we’ve seen to date transforming the way we all live and work” commented Daugherty. “Our vision of the metaverse as a continuum challenges prevailing narrower views and highlights why organisations must act today or find themselves operating in worlds designed by and for someone else.”

Despite still being early days it seems most businesses tend to agree to some extent with the metaverse’s potential. In a global survey of more than 4600 business leaders across almost two dozen industries seven in ten believed the technology will have a positive impact on their organisation while 42 percent of the executives expect the metaverse will lead to breakthroughs or potentially even reshape entire industries.

With a team of 800 specialists Accenture’s new Metaverse Continuum practice will offer a range of services from strategy consulting including on brand and marketing customer experience and digital identity among other areas through to the design build and operation of clients’ metaverse capabilities for example as to world-building engagement content management marketplace development 3D commerce and trust & safety mechanisms.

The last point the firm believes is a highly important one. “As the line between people’s physical and digital lives further blurs organisations have the opportunity and obligation now to build a responsible metaverse – addressing issues like trust sustainability personal safety privacy responsible access and use diversity and more” Daugherty concluded. ""The actions and choices they make today will set the stage for the future.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmZvYmFlLmNvbS9lbi8yMDIyLzAzLzIwL3Nlcmdpby1rYXVmbWFuLXByZXNpZGVudC1vZi1hY2NlbnR1cmUtd29ycmllcy1hYm91dC10aGUtYmx1ZS1lbXBsb3ltZW50LWNpcmN1aXQtdGhhdC13YXMtZ2VuZXJhdGVkLWluLWFyZ2VudGluYS_SAaoBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5mb2JhZS5jb20vZW4vMjAyMi8wMy8yMC9zZXJnaW8ta2F1Zm1hbi1wcmVzaWRlbnQtb2YtYWNjZW50dXJlLXdvcnJpZXMtYWJvdXQtdGhlLWJsdWUtZW1wbG95bWVudC1jaXJjdWl0LXRoYXQtd2FzLWdlbmVyYXRlZC1pbi1hcmdlbnRpbmEvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1wLXR5cGU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sergio Kaufman president of Accenture: “Worries about the blue employment circuit that was generated in Argentina”,"Accenture is one of the key players in the so-called Knowledge Economy a sector with record employment that nevertheless suffers “the Argentina effect” and not only because of the dollar and local swings. Its local president Sergio Kaufman says that one of the issues that most affects them today is what he defines as “blue employment” young employees who choose to work abroad independently and collect in foreign currency. “This parallel circuit makes the work precarious and makes the Central Bank unable to access dollars it should have” he said in a dialogue with Infobae.

Accenture is a multinational professional services company focused on digital development cloud and security. It has a presence in 120 countries and almost 700000 employees of which 12000 are in the country. Half of the services it generates locally are exported.

In recent months the company showed part of its relentless activity in the country with two purchases: Wolox a rising startup linked to cloud developments and Glamit a fashion-related e-commerce platform. This week it launched its Technology Vision 2022 study where it identifies the metaverse digital twins quantum computing and artificial intelligence as the main trends that will mark businesses in the coming years.

What concerns you most about the local macroeconomic context?

— When we talk about concern we have to go down to social it's not just the economy. Poverty of 50% or more between boys and girls under 15 is a sword of Damocles that hangs all over us. To change that a predictable country is needed; for companies to want to employ generate formal employment invest. The basis is employment but the requirement is macro stability. The agreement with the Monetary Fund which some will like more and others less like does not solve Argentina's problems but it provides a basis for building stability.

— Is Accenture more attentive to the exchange rate salaries or recruitment issues?

— Everything related to the Knowledge Economy remains at record employment levels. There is a huge lack of people to hire and “blue employment” is a big problem today in Argentina.

— What is blue employment?

— People from technology finance services human resources economists who find job offers abroad that are paid in dollars and do not enter through the formal circuit. They are totally precarious jobs but very tempting because of the exchange rate gap we have. Much of the employment that goes through this channel could be formal employment that brings foreign currency into the country. I'm worried about that informal blue employment circuit.

— What impact does it have?

- It weighs and a lot. In the pandemic we added about 2000 jobs but people are also leaving. Out of every 100 people who leave Accenture and I guess it must be something that happens everywhere two-thirds do so with some kind of hard currency offer on a parallel circuit. We no longer compete only with the formal market and the parallel circuit is the one that hinders further growth. This generates precarious people with jobs that do not have social security who do not pay social security...

— With high salaries.

- Yes but without any formal relationship. It has a lot of disadvantages. They are hourly projects without coverage. In the long term it is something that conspires with the ecosystem of the Knowledge Economy.

What do you do to convince people to stay with the company?

— We offer career and future. Last year 25% of the nearly 12000 employees we have were promoted to a higher position. They are people who make careers very fast: many reach managerial levels before the age of 30 and continue to grow from there even with global careers. This level of growth in Argentina is higher than in Europe and the United States. In that regard Argentina has a dynamic and an acceleration that does not exist anywhere else in the world.

— Does the project that a multinational can offer or collect in dollars working abroad weigh more heavily?

— They weigh the dollar the macro and some hint of disappointment with Argentina. Many are still here but dollarized. It's a relatively small portion 15 or 20% of the people but in an over-demanded sector it all adds up. Others decide to leave the country; I don't question them everyone has the right to raise their own lives. I insist: Argentina has a dynamic of professional growth and very good possibilities for promotion. Despite being in a highly challenging context in many respects the Knowledge Economy is a State policy. The general issues of the country such as the exchange rate gap make it difficult for us but the sector is a locomotive and the world continues to provide opportunities as we accelerate education give young people more confidence to stay and the macro stabilizes.

— The sector exports between USD 6 billion and 7 billion in recent years. Why doesn't it finish taking off in terms?

— We grow little because the informal part is not registered. If that represents 20% the account would give about $8.5 billion annually.

What do you think of the agreement with the IMF?

— The important thing about making the agreement is to continue being in the world. We already see in the context of war what happens when you move away from the world: companies leave jobs go away and innovation disappears. I am not an economist but the Fund has made a number of interesting things more flexible. Now we have to do our homework. The problem is not the Fund the problem is the things we have to do as Argentines. It's like when you don't manage well at home and the bank says “I give you a loan but with conditions.” The problem is not the bank the problem is that you have to tidy up your house. Politics entrepreneurship the establishment and the unions have to agree on the things that we need to do in the long term to tidy up the house. It's the best favor we can do to the generations to come. Many of the things that need to be done are not going to be seen tomorrow but it is the exercise that one sees in the countries with the most history: start planting trees in whose shade one will not rest but our grandchildren do. We owe ourselves that exercise.

Part of the opposition and some economic sectors say that again the biggest sacrifice will fall on the private sector. Does it match?

— The private sector is going to be part of the sacrifice but I think there will be a huge sacrifice of those who are in the most vulnerable conditions. The private sector must continue to be given the conditions to generate employment we must not kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. The balance between protecting a part of society giving incentives and making corrections without having an impact on companies that have to generate work — to precisely generate social mobility — is a complex policy exercise that requires agreements. A match alone can't do it.

— Do you think that the current Government will push this path of agreements?

- It depends on both of us. A tango is danced in two. From what I speak informally with both sectors they understand that there are ways of agreement in which certain positive reforms for the country will not be possible.

— He is a regular attendee to meetings with the President and the Minister of Economy. What are these meetings like and how do you see the Government in that vicinity?

— There are many myths about these events. In general they are very transparent events where both the President the Minister and others seek to be close to businessmen and unions in order to join positions. It was also the case with the previous government. They are transparent talks where one poses needs to continue growing. They listen but then obviously they can't do everything. It's easy from the rostrum to say “you have to do this or that” or “you were wrong”. When you are on the court everything is much more dynamic. I don't want to excuse anyone but there are things that seem like mistakes on the outside and when you see it on the other side you understand that there is no other alternative. Or there is the invasion of Russia and the rise in commodity prices.

— Does the stocks have a solution in Argentina?

— Nowadays everyone is talking about structural constraints to growth and one is the hard currency. Argentina needs inputs. We export added value from people but we also need technology sophisticated communication equipment notebooks high-performance servers platelets that allow artificial intelligence. If there are no dollars to import the ability to generate employment is blocked. “Let's live with what is ours” is a fantasy that is impossible at this point in history. Dollars allow us to grow and generate jobs; building trust means more availability of dollars because there are people who are going to bring them to invest and at the same time it makes that gap narrow. That gap is an indicator of confidence I mean that the government does not have dollars to sell them freely because people would overdemand them. Some kind of gap will probably exist in the next few years the issue is to have a decreasing path that involves confidence investment and growing jobs.

Accenture bought Wolox last year

— Is it necessary to carry out a labor reform?

— In our sector we don't have any labor issues it is a regime perfectly compatible with other parts of the world where we operate.

— And at a general level?

— We have to adapt to certain sectors that have been changing over time. A clear example is Vaca Muerta where there were changes because operating an oil well today is not the same as it was 30 years ago. The automotive sector has made changes and workers benefited. It is more sector by sector than a change in labor law.

— They have about 1000 job searches open at the moment. What are they looking for?

— Technology. After the pandemic someone who works in cybersecurity has assured work anywhere in the world. Also artificial intelligence mathematicians physicists who know how to make sophisticated mathematical models. And of course more traditional technology such as programming and design. All bilingual. An important issue for our education system is to start generating a serious strong second language. Insertion into the world involves being able to speak English.

— What career would you recommend to a boy who is finishing high school?

— Adults sometimes don't tell kids the whole truth because in my generation to be politically correct we say “study what you like”. It is a falsehood because many times no matter what is studied it is not worked on. I am an industrial engineer and my work has only a little bit of it the rest are things that I learned studied read. You have to study thinking about what kind of things you are going to like to work on. I studied at Oxford and a demographer always said that a boy born today probably lives about 100 years old with a head that will work for him until he is 90 95 years old. That is he will be able to work from 24 to 94. You're going to do the same 70 years? No. So my recommendation is to do something that reasonably likes but that gives a basis to be able to evolve in the professional career. You don't have to think small you have to think big broad . What's more it's good to be a little generalist in studies because then a lot is built up throughout life. Technology for example changes every six months: if you don't make that permanent construction you will become obsolete early.

— What is the photo of the company today in Argentina?

— In large numbers half of what we do we export and half goes to the local market. The good thing about that dynamic is that we are very resilient towards Argentina. If you suddenly have a crisis and the dollar flies the export share grows a little. The rule is not to go beyond 60/40. There are times when Argentina invests comes strong and then we take advantage of those that were formed in times of the most exports.

— How is this exporting mix made up?

— Technology application building many data services and artificial intelligence. That started two or three years ago and today we already have 200 or 300 people in those areas. Cybersecurity also grew tremendously: Argentina is one of the largest cybersecurity hubs in the world for the company. There are issues of process outsourcing lawyers human resources. The service sector is growing strong.

— He has been in charge of the local subsidiary for more than six years. How does Argentina explain to its bosses?

— The world is so complicated that Argentina is another case within that complexity. Accenture has nearly 700000 employees and relies on local leadership. At most they ask. And from here we say: “It is under control” “This is normal” “We are handling it this way...” and we move on. We bought some companies from Argentina and we will continue to do so. Why? Because of the quality of people we find there is no other secret. These are hard-to-get people in the world.

Supply chains in food construction fashion fast-moving consumer goods electronics automotive professional services and freight account for more than half of all global greenhouse gas emissions.

The importance of supply chains to companies’ sustainability goals is now widely accepted.

A report by Accenture reveals that CEOs agree that technology is enabling new business models and will unlock the future of industry decarbonisation. The ability to track every stage of the product journey from raw materials to the consumers doorstep through to the end-life of the product is now top of mind for businesses. In fact research by EY lists end-to-end visibility as the number one factor in creating a successful supply chain. Furthermore as global supply chains continue to be affected by challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic this is a way to build resilience and future-proof supply chains from disruptions.

To fully leverage the transformational opportunities that technology can unlock organisations need effective data management and item-level visibility across the value chain - but this can’t be accomplished without the right technologies.

Traceability leads to visibility

When we look at the future of sustainability from net-zero goals to circular business models none of it is possible if companies don’t first understand the what when where why and how of their products at each stage of the supply chain.

This is where the benefits of digital identity technologies can have a profound impact. By assigning each product its own ‘digital twin’ companies can unlock sophisticated real-time monitoring of their supply chains. This helps them to make supply chain decisions that can reduce waste increase efficiencies and create circular processes.

A prime example is the use of digital twins in the food sector capable of driving better management of expiry more precise product removal during recalls and improved monitoring of temperatures to avoid spoilage. Based on pilot studies we believe radio frequency identification (RFID) tagging can help grocers reduce food waste by as much as 20%.

Chipotle Mexican Grill recently announced it is testing RFID technology to enhance its traceability and inventory systems across approximately 200 restaurants in the greater Chicago area. A leader in food safety Chipotle is one of the first major restaurant companies to leverage RFID case labels to track ingredients from suppliers to restaurants via serialization. The ambition is to save suppliers time on inventory management and stock rotation mitigate human error and increase expiration date visibility and accountability.

Driving decarbonisation

To meet the urgency of curbing climate change it’s critical that businesses act to eliminate GHG emissions and when we consider that the food supply chain alone represents a quarter of global GHG emissions the possibilities are huge and the supply chain’s role in decarbonisation could be an absolute game-changer.

Avery Dennison is working with a major sports retailer who is piloting our atma.io connected product cloud solution to trace the carbon footprint of its raw materials. By assigning every product a digital identity which is connected to the cloud the sports retailer can determine the carbon cost of each product from manufacturer to store shelf.

The next frontier of supply chain decarbonisation is to ensure companies are measuring and managing their total value chain. Scope 3 emissions account for 65-95% of a company’s emissions but progress on tracking these emissions has been slow. The latest updates to the atma.io connected product cloud have been created to help brands meet net-zero targets and reduce waste across the supply chain. The atma.io Real-time Carbon Impact Analytics tool provides brands with data-driven insights regarding the carbon footprint of their products including Scope 3 emissions and beyond. It captures data from every stage of a product’s journey from raw material to consumer and can help firms as they work to comply with forthcoming EU ‘Digital Product Passport’ regulations.

Supply chains for value-driven customers

Consumer behaviour is changing and given the COVID-19 pandemic transparent and real-time information is becoming critical to ensure health and safety but also to align with consumers’ increasing demands for sustainability.

The information made possible by digital identity technologies goes way beyond a product’s origins to letting people know where their product has been giving them access to behind-the-scenes footage of where products are made to information on how or where to recycle or resell their clothing.

As the global economy is transitioning away from a linear model to a circular one digital identity technologies provide consumers with information through a smartphone scan or tap on how or where to recycle or resell their clothing and by providing resellers with the authenticity of a garment enabling its second life.

For example Levi’s partnered with Hong Kong upcycling brand The R Collective to create a fully traceable denim collection. Each item has an Avery Dennison-enabled digital label with a QR code that informs consumers how to care for their garment and how to recycle at its end of life. French lingerie brand Etam is deploying RFID technology across its entire range of bras and underwear as a means of tracking and tracing product throughout its journey from factory to store shelf. This provides a global vision of its stock wherever the product happens to be allowing the brand to take full advantage of its inventory whether it is being showcased in stores in stockrooms or in warehouses. As part of its commitment to transparency shoppers can scan QR codes on product labels to beam short videos about factories and product insights directly to their smartphones.

Transparent supply chains are fast being seen as ‘business as usual’ not an innovative extra with digital twins being used all the way from item creation to optimising manufacturing operations to end of life. The evidence around the commercial benefits is extensive.

According to an Accenture study across five use cases digital twins can unlock US$1.3tn in economic value and 7.5 Gt CO2 emissions reductions till 2030. We have the societal and the business case for change coupled with the technology required now we just need to see more urgency and action.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmllL2lyaXNoLW5ld3MvaHNlLWhhcy1zcGVudC0xNDBtLW9uLWNvbnN1bHRpbmctZmlybXMtaW4tdGhlLWxhc3QtZm91ci15ZWFycy80MTQ2NzEzNi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HSE has spent €140m on consulting firms in the last four years,"The HSE spent almost €45m last year on professional services provided by major consulting firms and has spent just under €140m with them over the past four years according to figures seen by the Sunday Independent.

EY and PwC were the largest beneficiaries of the spending last year billing the health service for just over €19m and €12.28m respectively.

PwC investigated the cyber attack on the HSE last year publishing its findings last December and a substantial amount of work related to IT has been undertaken by the consulting firms that were hired.

It also carried out a capacity and demand analysis last year to inform initiatives to tackle waiting lists.

EY meanwhile provided a range of services during the pandemic. These included financial analysis work data analytics testing and tracing operations and supporting national integrated operations for the HSE.

The company has also provided services for the HSE in relation to work by Australian software firm Healthcare Logic to implement a so-called “health performance visualisation platform (HPVP)”.

The platform was designed to help hospitals manage and improve their capacity to treat patients while dealing with the ongoing impact of Covid-19. However some voluntary hospitals are declining to use it.

The HSE will tender for phase two of its HPVP project later this year which could be worth up to €10m according to a pre-notification seen by this newspaper.

The next largest fee earner was Accenture which billed the HSE for €4.68m last year.

KPMG earned €3.96m with Grant Thornton the next largest beneficiary of spending on its professional advice and services earning €3.85m.

Gartner and Mazars received €795000 and €195000 respectively.

In total consultancy firms billed the HSE almost €10m more last year than in 2020 when these earned €35.2m.

Their fees in 2018 and 2019 amounted to €31.1m and €28.6m respectively.

The figures on the spending were obtained in a parliamentary question by Social Democrat spokesperson on health Róisín Shortall.

""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.""

Jane Fonda 83 says she is “so happy” about her decision to go gray in a new interview with Ellen Degeneres.

“Enough already with so much time wasted so much money spent so many chemicals—I’m through with that” she said.

The Grace and Frankie star first debuted her silver hair at the 2020 Oscars.

Jane Fonda’s gray hair is here to stay. In a new interview with Ellen Degeneres the Grace and Frankie star opened up about her decision to embrace her natural color at 83—and she’s feeling totally liberated.

“I tell you I’m so happy I let it go gray” Fonda told Degeneres. “Enough already with so much time wasted so much money spent so many chemicals—I’m through with that.”

Although Fonda has rocked all sorts of colors and styles over the years we have to admit that this stunning silver is our favorite. Last year the actress and activist debuted her hair transformation at the 2020 Oscars sending Twitter into a frenzy. She paired the ‘do with a recycled red gown and looked simply fabulous of course.

Fonda’s hairstylist Jack Martin spent 7 hours transforming Fonda’s hair from her iconic blonde to a sophisticated silver. Martin wrote on Instagram that the look was inspired by the regrowth of her salt-and-pepper roots. “The rest was a little tired warm golden blonde” he said. “Her goal color was a silver icy blonde to surprise everyone at the 2020 Oscars.”

But Fonda’s hair isn’t the only major change she’s making when it comes to appearances; she also pledged to never buy a new article of clothing again. As a longtime activist her recent focus has been climate change (and the fashion industry plays a major role in waste and water consumption).

“You see this coat? I needed something red and I went out and found this coat on sale. This is the last article of clothing that I will ever buy” she declared during a November 2019 protest on Capitol Hill.

It seems she’s still holding to her word. When she goes to accept the Cecil B. DeMille Award at the 2021 Golden Globes Fonda told Degeneres that she’ll be rocking a recycled outfit just as she did for the 2020 Oscars.

“I prefer this kind of outfit than getting dressed up” Fonda said of her red jogging suit. “We spend too much money we buy too many things and then we get rid of them. We try to develop our identity by shopping right? We gotta stop that—stop all this consumerism.”

“So I had to go through my closet and find out something that still fit me and I have worn before” she added. “And I found something. I’m all set.”

Meta Platforms (META 3.04%) and Nvidia (NVDA 3.77%) both seemed like unstoppable growth stocks in 2021. After the initial COVID lockdowns a surge in advertising growth drove Meta's stock to an all-time high of $382.18 last September. Nvidia stock peaked around the same time reaching $333.76 in November 2021 as the chipmaker dazzled investors with robust sales of gaming and data center GPUs.

February brought that growth to a grinding halt for both companies badly burning investors who had chased earlier rallies. After mixed fourth-quarter earnings and weak guidance in the year ahead due to its shifting business model Meta stock now sits near $200. Nvidia stock has similarly stumbled dipping to the mid $240s amid concerns about decelerating growth peaking gross margins and the ongoing chip shortage. Nvidia's plan to buy Arm Holdings and become a chip design powerhouse failed disappointing investors.

Should investors take the contrarian view and jump on opportunities to buy either tech stock at a steep discount? Let's take a fresh look at both companies to decide.

What happened to Meta?

Recent years have been good to Meta. While its advertising business struggled at the onset of the pandemic the company bounced back in the second half of the year with revenue rising 22% to $85.97 billion in 2020. That same year Meta expanded operating margins by four percentage points to 38% and increased earnings per share (EPS) by 57% year over year.

Meta had good fortune in 2021 too: revenue increased 37% to $117.93 billion as businesses continued ramping back up ad spending. Following 2020's trend Meta's operating margin expanded to 40% and EPS jumped 36%.

Those past numbers look fantastic but Meta anticipates a slowdown in 2022. The company expects revenue in the first quarter of 2022 to represent 3% to 11% year-over-year growth. Meta primarily blames this halt on Apple's (AAPL -0.91%) iOS privacy update which enables users to opt-out of data-tracking features. The company also anticipates increased competition from short video apps like ByteDance's TikTok.

To keep pace with TikTok Meta plans to prioritize short video content on Facebook and Instagram Reels. That shift though will throttle near-term revenue and earnings growth as videos are difficult to monetize. Meta also plans to pour more cash into its unprofitable Reality Labs division which focuses on virtual reality and the metaverse. This segment may prove promising in the future but it's currently burning money: in 2021 Reality Labs racked up an operating loss of $10.1 billion while generating just $2.27 billion in revenue.

Investors are spooked by this combination of slow growth and high spending. Meta's sliding stock price reflects analyst expectations that company revenue will grow just 12% this year while earnings slide 10%. The future though isn't all bleak: assuming Meta overcomes near-term challenges analysts expect revenue and earnings alike to rise about 17% in 2023.

What happened to Nvidia?

Pandemic trends proved a boon for Nvidia: in fiscal year 2021 (ended January 2021) revenue surged 53% to $16.68 billion. Sales of gaming GPUs jumped as people played more video games while stuck at home. Demand for cloud services increased as people worked from home streamed media and played video games causing data centers to purchase more high-end GPUs to process AI and machine learning tasks.

It's no surprise then that Nvidia's adjusted gross margin expanded from 62.5% to 65.6% over its 2021 fiscal year with its adjusted EPS soaring 73%.

The following year Nvidia's revenue continued to grow hitting $24.91 billion by the end of January. What's more adjusted gross margin rose to 66.8% and adjusted EPS grew by 78%. Again gaming and data center GPUs did most of the heavy lifting. Competitors could barely keep up: according to JPR during the fourth quarter of 2021 Nvidia controlled 81% of the discrete GPU market while its rival AMD (AMD 3.44%) held a 19% share.

Those growth rates are surely solid but analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and earnings to slow this year as the market's appetite for new gaming and data center GPUs wanes. Predictions have the company growing revenue by 29% and earnings by 26%. Looking ahead to fiscal year 2024 analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and earnings to decelerate further growing just 17% and 20% respectively as the upgrade cycle continues to cool.

Other unpredictable headwinds await on the horizon and could impact growth. Intel (INTC 0.63%) is launching new discrete GPUs to compete against Nvidia and AMD which is sure to bite into both companies' market share. The use of Nvidia's gaming GPUs to mine cryptocurrencies could pin the company's growth on the volatile crypto market. The ongoing chip shortage threatens to cap Nvidia's supply of available chips.

The valuations and verdict

Bearing this in mind which bargain stock is the better buy? Examining valuation offers insight into which company currently offers the most bang for your buck. Meta trades at just 16 times forward earnings making it the cheapest FAANG stock by a wide margin. Despite its recent dip Nvidia is still one of the priciest semiconductor stocks trading at 44 times forward earnings.

Both of these companies are solid long-term investments but I believe that Meta's discount valuation and less cyclical business model make it a more compelling investment than Nvidia. Nvidia is still growing at a healthy clip but its high valuation will hamper possible returns.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9naW5uaWZlci1nb29kd2luLWpvc2gtZGFsbGFzLWNoZWVreS0xNTUzMzk1ODMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ginnifer Goodwin & Josh Dallas' Cheeky Text Exchange Shows They're Still on Cloud 9,"Avert your eyes children Snow White and Prince Charming are getting a little saucy. Or rather Ginnifer Goodwin and Josh Dallas are getting saucy. On March 17 Goodwin posted a screenshot onto her Instagram with no caption because this picture truly says a thousand words on its own.

In the screenshot we see Goodwin sent a few photos to Dallas who’s adorably called “Husband” on her phone. The last photo is a cute scrunched-up selfie of her for St. Patrick’s Day to which Dallas responded with three eggplant emojis. Cue the blushing.

Both friends and fans alike quickly commented on the screenshot poking fun at the post or are in a state of shock over it. Actor Justin Long commented saying “Husband is either really turned on or he wants you to pick up 3 eggplants from the store. Either way you’re in for a fun St P Day!” Fans were more so shocked saying “you so cute and he so naughty omg” and “Josh you good?”

Honestly we love that for over a decade together. They still act like teenagers in love — eggplant emojis and all.

Goodwin and Dallas have been together since 2011 after meeting on the set of Once Upon a Time. They married in 2014 and have two sons together named Oliver Finlay 7 and Hugo Wilson 5.

After giving birth to their first son Goodwin took a step back from acting telling E News “It makes me feel like acting is not at all creative but being a parent [is]. Anybody who’s a parent I want to like give an Oscar to.”

According to a Reddit report spotted by Eurogamer  some malicious individuals have found a hack that can send PC players into an endless death loop.

⚠️Elden Ring PSA for PC players⚠️



There's an exploit going around on PC where hackers will corrupt your save file while you're invaded.



First they will crash your game and when you open it back up your character will be constantly falling to their death... pic.twitter.com/8et3bl8T1I — Mordecai (@EldenRingUpdate) March 18 2022

You can see the exploit in action in a video posted by Elden Ring Update on Twitter . A hacker will invade your game and use a specific ability that forces Elden Ring to crash. When you reload your save your character will repeatedly fall to their death. Elden Ring is a big game and some players have reported losing as much as 100 hours of gameplay in this way.

If all of this sounds familiar it’s because FromSoftware was recently forced to disable Dark Souls 3’s multiplayer features after a hacker identified a vulnerability within the game that allowed them to execute code remotely. The studio has been working to address the issue since February .

FromSoftware and Bandai Namco have yet to comment on the exploit. We’ll update this article when they say something on the matter. In the meantime your best bet is to play offline. Failing that you’ll want to regularly backup your save in case someone uses the exploit on one of your characters. In the worst-case scenario it’s possible to salvage a save but the process isn't easy. You need to press Alt F4 before your character dies and then quickly fast travel to a Site of Grace when you reload the game."

Ben Rector may not be a “hype person” — a point he has reiterated in interviews and on social media — but he’s been proud to tout “The Joy of Music” as the album he’s wanted to make for more than a decade.

Though Rector is known to be self-effacing such proclamations would set the bar high for any artist. Fortunately “The Joy of Music” (the Nashville singer-songwriter’s eighth studio album which hit streaming platforms last week) is his most vibrant emotionally robust work yet.

Like 2015’s “Brand New” and 2018’s “Magic” the 13-track set is full of wistful piano-pop melodies that touch on family fame and friendship. This time around the results are more sonically diverse than ever with featured assists from Dave Koz Kenny G and Snoop Dogg. Yes that Snoop Dogg.

Songs like “Steady Love” and “Clichés” reflect the domestic bliss Rector has found with his wife Hillary 4-year-old daughter Jane — who incidentally makes a surprise appearance on the album — and sons Roy and Robert both 1.

The 13 songs on “The Joy of Music” represent a major step up for Rector as a musician. (Photo: Amy Harris/Associated Press)

But time and fatherhood haven’t diminished Rector’s willingness to delve beyond the confines of his previous work. “Supernatural” is a standout track that could very well be the grooviest entry in his catalog juxtaposing Koz’s saxophone solo with a 1980s synth-pop beat. His mischievous wit is here too most notably on the percolating “Sunday” where he swaps verses with Snoop Dogg.

Rector’s desire to get outside his comfort zone extended beyond the recording studio. To accompany “The Joy of Music” he and director Ben Kadie wove six of the new songs into a playful short film that may as well be titled “Rector in Wonderland.” After a fruitless night at the piano Rector is transported into a dream world where he masters some Broadway-style dance moves — in his socks no less — and joins a band of superheroes for an impromptu jam session.

His co-star in the film is a custom-designed red Muppet monster created by Jim Henson’s Creature Shop that audiences can expect to see on his tour which kicks off May 5 in Madison Wisconsin before moving on to Boston New York and other cities.

Watch “Living My Best Life” from “The Joy of Music” short film below.

At 35 Rector may not be a household name or radio fixture. His folk-pop albums and heartfelt relatable lyrics however have endeared him to a massive fan base thus guaranteeing him a spot on streaming playlists and at wedding receptions for years to come.

Hollywood has caught on to Rector’s talents too. Last month the Screen Actors Guild chose “Sailboat” his collaboration with musician Cody Fry as the soundtrack for the “in memoriam” segment of the 2022 SAG Awards. In 2021 he appeared as a mentor on “American Idol” duetting with contestants Wyatt Pike and Graham DeFranco.

In spite of such triumphs Rector acknowledged having moments of self-doubt with regard to his artistry which he hopes to relinquish — or at the very least reassess — with “The Joy of Music” and beyond.

That focus has paid off and there’s no question “The Joy of Music” represents a major step up for Rector as a musician. “It’s the best that it has been in a long time” he croons on “Living My Best Life” the album’s gospel-tinged centerpiece. That sentiment applies to “The Joy of Music” in its entirety too.

Kenosha native Neka Allen lived in Los Angeles when the pandemic hit. It allowed her to work remotely so she could live wherever she wanted. She started looking at real estate back home in Wisconsin.

Allen came across a building at the intersection of East Washington Avenue and Baldwin Street.

The day after she saw that listing she couldn’t get it out of her head.

“I instantly loved it. It looked like it needed some work” she laughed. “I just had a vision for what it could be.”

Her vision included turning the top floor into her home and the bottom floor into an Airbnb for guests.

She texted her dad expecting him to dissuade her from buying it.

“I said ‘Dad talk me out of this third-life-crisis of buying this building’” she said. “He said something along the lines of ‘That’s crazy. But that’s awesome so do it.’”

That building holds decades’ worth of music history although most probably would never know by the outside.

Wisconsin musicians Butch Vig and Steve Marker later members of the band Garbage opened Smart Studios in 1983. It was moved to Allen’s building in 1987.

“This is Studio A down here” Allen said while she walked through a space now set up as a living room. “This room would have been where they set up like the soundboard the mixing boards. Then we have the big glass window so they could communicate with the musicians in that other room.”

Legendary music was recorded in that space. Most notable is likely Nirvana’s “Nevermind.” That was the first draft of sorts for the world’s most famous grunge album. Only one track from the Smart sessions made it onto the final cut “Polly.”

However it was all recorded in Madison first.

Allen paid tribute to the band in the home. The iconic Nirvana yellow smiley face is present throughout with pops of yellow in most rooms.

Luckily it’s her favorite color.

Nirvana wasn’t the only big band to record there. Of course lots of Garbage music found a home at Smart Studios. Other big records recorded there included The Smashing Pumpkins’ “Gish” Fall Out Boy’s “Take This To Your Grave” and Death Cab For Cutie’s “Plans.”

The list goes on to include Everclear Jimmy Eat World Hawthorne Heights and Tegan & Sara.

Walking into former Studio A the acoustics change so drastically it feels like the air has shifted.

“We’re right on East Washington but you can’t hear outside at all” Allen said.

She said she sleeps like a baby in her upstairs bedroom which was Studio B still equipped with soundproofing fabric on the walls.

The great acoustics are helpful upstairs in the old Studio B. That’s now Allen’s bedroom. It’s super quiet in there too.

“I sleep so soundly” she said.

There are remnants of the building’s history everywhere: Old exit signs full-length indoor windows and audio ports built into walls.

Allen has done almost all the work herself. She’s documented it along the way on social media.

Allen said she hopes to have the lower level up and running as an Airbnb this summer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxvY2FsMTAuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyMi8wMy8xOS85MTEtY2FsbHMtZnJvbS13aWx0b24tbWFub3JzLXNwcmluZy1icmVhay1vdmVyZG9zZS13ZS10b29rLXNvbWUtY29rZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,911 calls from Wilton Manors spring break overdose: 'We took some coke . . .',"WILTON MANORS Fla. – “We took some coke and we are not getting some responses right now” says the caller to 911 as he reports overdoses at an Airbnb on March 10 in Wilton Manors.

The spring break nightmare happened at a short-term rental vacation home where Fort Lauderdale fire rescue found six men and a woman suffering from drug overdoses some laying outdoors on the lawn of the home suffering from cardiac arrest according to fire rescue officials.

The frantic caller tells the dispatcher: “People are passing out. Three people are passed out because they drank a lot. Like a lot.”

At one point a person in the background can be heard sobbing.

Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue personnel responded about 5 p.m. on Thursday March 10 in response to the 911 call to a home at 811 NW 29th Ct.

Five people at the house were identified as West Point Academy cadets; four of them were taken to the hospital.

A statement from Wilton Manors police said that “further investigation revealed that 6 males were feeling the effects of a drug overdose. Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue responded to the scene and rendered aid to the male patients. 4 patients were transported to Broward General Medical Center and 2 were transported to Holy Cross Hospital. A seventh female patient was later transported to the hospital after feeling ill.”

Four of the seven hospitalized voluntarily ingested the cocaine; the other three came into contact with it when they performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation according to Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue.

The next day detectives arrested Axel Giovany Casseus 21 of Lauderhill as the person responsible for selling the drugs.

According to the arrest report detectives “were able to ascertain the cellphone number of the alleged dealer who supplied the narcotics to the victims” and Casseus was in possession of the “cellphone used to communicate with the undercover detective and overdose victim.”

The arrest happened after an undercover operation that involved a $1000 deal with Casseus at a hotel parking lot in Fort Lauderdale according to the Broward Sheriff’s Office arrest report.

Local 10 News reached out to Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue for updates on the conditions of those who were hospitalized. We were told that since the families have opted out of providing media updates they were not able to obtain the information.

Just because you’re staying in a giant stone doesn’t mean you have to live like a member of the Stone Age. Not only do you have a kitchen to use but more importantly there is a grill on the private visitor’s patio where you can cook up all the meat you hunt…at the grocery store in Boulder.

Despite appearances to the contrary this isn’t an open-air cave. The openings were walled in with glass all the better to view the Grand Staircase-Escalante Monument. The owner describes the effect as “like sitting in a painting!”…which has the added bonus that there was no need for him to buy any art to decorate the walls. (The cave and its surroundings are the art — duh.)

Have you ever seen a more mouthwatering table full of heirloom tomatoes? In order to enjoy an endless supply of caprese salads (editor’s note: neither heirloom tomatoes nor caprese salads are included with your stay) you will have to embrace the concept of an off-the-grid vacation. While this stay does come with modern electricity and plumbing it does not offer wifi or general cell service (unless you have Verizon and are interested in holing up in the kitchen to scroll away your vacation).

Staying in this home is like traveling all the way back in time to the early 1990’s. You can view that shelf to the left of the TV as your own personal Blockbuster or choose to spend your evening in a jam session in the music room before heading outside with a blanket and a cocktail to do a little stargazing.

“Unique” is the only word that truly describes the Bedrock Homestead Cave but it also is the perfect word for the cave’s backyard. Here you have full access to the gorgeous views and state parks of southern Utah. Or as your vacation home likes to call it of all of their rock relatives.

Care for a dip? After a day spent hiking—which you can do up to the roof of your own house on trails accessible by foot from your front door or through the wilderness only a short drive away you will be ready to take a dip in the natural pool available to all cave guests.

This may look like a gorgeously cultivated homestead but don’t let it’s beauty fool you — you will need 4-wheel drive to access your vacation lodgings. You know that song that goes “over the woods through a river and down a long dirt road”? You may not be visiting grandma but getting here is like a very gentle game of Oregon Trail without all the dysentery and wagons breaking apart in the fast moving waters.

While there is a fireplace in your cave you will not be required to chop your own wood for warmth. The cave home gets all of its power courtesy of the very green hydro electricity which means there is both hot running water and climate control inside. #paradise

We have it on good authority (from more than one first name-only reviewer of course — this is serious journalism we’re doing here!) that you can see the gorgeous sky full of stars from the comfort of your own bedroom. But when the sun is out you can watch someone else’s garden grow and relax in the knowledge that you will be spared from any weeding or hoeing.

This house is consistently called “cool” and “comfortable.” But one other word that’s bandied about is “rugged.” We’re not talking camping in a tent in the middle of the wilderness rugged but here you will be ensconced in the wide open spaces of horses and gardens and nonexistent wifi. Plus one of the most divisive four-legged creatures around: the house cat. Because the kitties are allowed to roam freely inside and out this is not a vacation stay for the afflicted of allergies the watery of eyes or the tender of noses.

Who cares if you have to skip out on a little Instagram scrolling or TikTok’ing when you can wake up and go to sleep each day with this view. Just snap those videos and take those selfies and save them to post later — we would never want to deprive you of basking in the glow of your followers’ envy.

The last two years have been traumatic as a whole but on a day-to-day basis they have also been profoundly boring. Who wants to be stuck inside with just a restricted quarantine pod all the time? Going back to the time of the Flinstones may not seem like the perfect antidote to the Covid-era hangover but we think it just might be so given all the reviews that talk about the opportunities for exploration and adventure here. It’s about time you indulge in another holiday escapade unlike any you’ve been on before.

Now TaylorMade is offering Tour level DNA to Tour Response by integrating the Tour Flight Dimple Pattern seen in TP5/TP5x. With the addition of the new dimple pattern Tour Response retains its soft feel and 100% cast urethane cover. You can think of the Tour Response as a “Lite” version of the TP5 and TP5x a three-layer version of the ball used by Rory McIlroy Dustin Johnson Collin Morikawa and Rickie Fowler. The three-layer Tour Response will have a softer feel than those balls. TaylorMade are that confident in Tour Response they believe that many amateur golfers will not even feel the difference in performance from using TP5 models and that they will decide to save €10 and go with the dozen Tour Response.

The 2022 Tour Response ball features a low 70-compression design with a Hi-Spring core made for pushing the boundaries of ball speed in a soft feeling golf ball. To give it speed TaylorMade designed it with the same HFM casing layer found in TP5 and TP5x. The high-flex material (HFM) encases the core and at impact compresses like a spring before snapping back into shape. This process transfers energy into the shot more efficiently to create more ball speed.

Tour Response also has the same Tour Flight dimple pattern found on the TP5 and TP5x. The dimples are shallower and the walls of the dimples are steeper which according to TaylorMade helps the ball rise off the tee and as the ball starts to come down the steeper sidewalls create more lift.

To measure the effectiveness of a new cover TaylorMade engineers utilised a combination of material property testing robot and player performance testing. That research showed that in addition to increased durability the new cover material is 12% softer and 36% more flexible than the previous material.

TOUR TECHNOLOGY. EASY ALIGNMENT

I n addition to the all-new Tour Response TaylorMade introduces its latest innovation in visual alignment technology with Tour Response Stripe. By drawing inspiration from the PIX design with ClearPath Alignment technology TaylorMade engineers brought 360 alignment to Tour Response making it the easiest golf ball to align that TaylorMade has ever created.

Tour Response Stripe has a 22-millimetre digital band that wraps around the centre of the golf ball to help aim putts better faster and more consistently. Inside the digital band is a thin black line to match with putter sight lines for immediate aid in alignment.

The multi-colour design of Stripe not only creates better alignment but also can’t miss feedback on the quality of the roll of each putt. Proper strikes are easily identifiable as the stripe rolls consistently to the hole while off-centre strikes cause a can’t miss wobble of the digital band.

Tour Response and Tour Response Stripe are both available at retail now with an RRP of €48. Tour Response is available in white and high visibility yellow with an all-new enriched yellow urethane cover to help prevent chipped paint and provide bright visibility.",,,,,,,,,

April Curley who was hired by the technology giant as a University Programs Specialist in its New York office in 2014 said in the complaint that she was fired in 2020 after she “vocally opposed and called for reform of the barriers and double standards Google imposed on Black employees and applicants.” Curley is Black.

Google which has shown slow progress in diversifying its workforce in recent years made a big push to hire more Black employees in 2020 after the police murder of George Floyd sparked worldwide protests in support of racial justice. The company is also facing a suit by another Black employee who accused it in 2017 of hiring minority job seekers with rosy promises and then assigning them jobs with lower pay.

“Google’s centralized leadership which is nearly devoid of Black representation holds biased and stereotypical views about the abilities and potential of Black professionals” Curley said in her complaint filed Friday in federal court in San Jose California.

That’s why “Google hires few Black employees and steers those few Black employees into lower-level roles pays them less and denies them advancement and leadership roles because of their race” she said.

Hiring managers viewed Black candidates as not “Googly” enough and interviewers “hazed” Black candidates and asked them “level-inappropriate questions” to hurt their hiring prospects Curley said.

She is seeking damages for discriminatory employment practices and policies.

Google didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Google’s U.S. workforce is just more than 50% White 42% Asian 6.4% Latinx 4.4% Black and 0.8% Native American — a slight rise in figures reported in 2020 according to an annual diversity report the company released last year.

“Black+” employees with the plus designation reflecting those who identify as multiple races made up 8.8% of Google’s U.S. hires compared with 5.5% the previous year the report said. Attrition was on the rise among racial minority groups with Black women showing the highest jump in the metric according to the report.

The complaint was reported earlier by Reuters.

The show’s spiritual guide Rafiki opened “The Lion King” with her iconic cry at the start of “The Circle of Life” as the landscape of the African savanna mesmerized the audience as elephants giraffes and antelopes filled the theater.

The Broadway tour of Disney’s “The Lion King” takes the stage at the Altria Theater from March 3 to March 20. The Tony Award-winning musical is a theatrical retelling of the 1994 Disney film of the same title.

Children sang along to the theatrics of the film’s most well-known moments as songs and lines they already knew and loved thrilled them. Excited audience members spoke and sang along with the actors.

“The Lion King” mesmerizes and immerses its viewers. The set and lighting design transformed the Altria stage into the African savanna and the performers wear traditional clothing from varying African cultures. The actors gave brilliant performances that allowed audiences to connect with Simba’s story.

The show itself is massive with huge set pieces resembling the story’s setting “Pride Rock” and the elephant graveyard. The musical has a cast of 54 actors. Despite this the musical manages to feel intimate at the Altria Theater without sacrificing any elements of the show. This is also in spite of the fact that the Altria is larger than the show’s home at the Minskoff Theatre on Broadway.

Moments felt just as dramatic and intense from the audience as they do in the movie. Scar’s the show’s antagonist musical number “Be Prepared” and the wildebeest stampede that leads to Mufasa’s death elicited vocal responses from audience members. The show utilizes a combination of silhouetted lighting and a large number of actors to make it seem as if the hyenas and wildebeests overwhelm the stage.

Gerald Ramsey gave a stellar performance as Mufasa. The role is renowned due to James Earl Jones’s vocal performance in the movie. He managed to call upon Jones’s performance as he uses a similar deep vocal tone and line delivery as Jones in the film but he still made the character and Mufasa’s story his own.

Ramsey was born and raised in American Samoa and he said in an interview that he brings his cultural upbringing to Mufasa. He centers singing and dancing as a means of storytelling something he said he learned from his roots as a Pacific Islander.

Mukelisiwe Goba brought both humor and heart to the character of Rafiki and was able to win over the audience despite a majority of her performance being in varying African languages such as Zulu and Xhosa.

Rafiki serves as the spiritual guide in the show as she urges Simba to return to his roots. The change of Rafiki’s character to female in the musical adaptation was an idea of director Julie Taymor’s as she said the show needed more strong female characters according to Taymor in an interview.

Julie Taymor helmed the original Broadway production and she sought to reimagine the film rather than produce a carbon copy according to the director in an interview. Taymor achieved this by emphasizing African culture ingrained in the show as the actors sing in native languages and wear traditional clothing and masks.

Taymor also designed the costumes for the show. She said in an interview she used elements like hand-beaded corsets for the lions inspired by the Maasai tribe of Kenya and Ghanaian kente cloth to compose Zazu’s costume to further highlight the African roots of the story.

The show utilizes African masking and puppetry techniques. The performers playing lions and lionesses wear these masks on their heads rather than over their faces allowing the personality of the actors to shine through according to Taymor in an interview.

Performers using puppets portray the other animals like Zazu Pumbaa and Timon that also keep the actor visible to the audience. Other performers portraying the animals of Pride Rock use tactics such as using stilts to become giraffes and crawling on all fours to portray hyenas.

The music of the show stands out as the heart of “The Lion King.” While the show has the classic songs from the movie it adds songs in Swahili and Zulu taken from South African musician Lebo M’s concept album “Rhythm of the Pridelands.”

The traditional elements of the music are the heartbeat of the show. The percussionists sit playing various instruments like the djembe and the talking drum in booths on either side of the stage and visible to the audience. The music brilliantly incorporates contemporary elements like electric guitar in highly emotional moments like the wildebeest stampede.

The show utilizes its cast off stage as well. In moments of dialogue actors can be heard singing in the background. Actors sing their parts offstage in a booth equipped with microphones a concept known as booth singing.

“The Lion King” dazzled its viewers. The musical cleverly reimagines the movie rather than retelling it adding fresh elements for those who already love the show and breathing new life into Simba’s story.",,,,,,,,,,,,

He was known for unusual experiments in management and business structure and for pursuing long-term passions over short-term profits as described in his 2010 book Delivering Happiness.

A new book Happy at Any Cost: The Revolutionary Vision and Fatal Quest of Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh tells the rest of the story of Hsieh’s life leading up to his tragic death from injuries sustained in a fire in New London Conn. in November 2020. The book also goes behind the scenes of the company’s relationship with Amazon.

Wall Street Journal reporter Kirsten Grind who wrote the book with her colleague Katherine Sayre joins me on the GeekWire Podcast to talk about what they discovered in writing the book and what we can learn from Hsieh’s life.

Kirsten Grind was previously based in the Seattle area as a reporter for the Puget Sound Business Journal. Her reporting on the collapse of Washington Mutual formed the basis for her first book The Lost Bank.

What did you learn about Tony Hsieh in the process of writing this book?

Wall Street Journal reporter Kirsten Grind. (Photo by Nicole Mercado)

Kirsten Grind: His life in his mid 40s looked amazing. And he was very successful. But as we started peeling back these layers we learned that actually despite his focus on happiness he was struggling with all these mental health issues. Social anxiety. He had some facial blindness which can be very challenging especially for a CEO that’s always around people. And he hid all of this. That came out in the form of alcohol abuse over the years and in his last year drug abuse. All of this was really hidden from public view.

In the final year or so of Tony’s life it feels like he was surrounded by people who were not always acting in his best interest. Is that a fair way to put it?

That’s a fair and very nice way to put it. Some of these people were just straight up enabling him. The pandemic was isolating his very good friends from him his true friends. He had a group of hangers-on and friends that weren’t really friends. All of them were clamoring for a piece of Tony and a piece of his business and these high salaries he was offering to pay and consultant fees and money here and there. It was really tragic how this history of him attracting people from all walks of life and giving to them selflessly ended up in this situation at the end.

It’s clear from your reporting in the book that Amazon had no idea what was going on in the final years of Tony Hsieh’s life.

No they didn’t. What was clear though is they were starting to exert way more pressure on Zappos than anyone knew about. (Amazon founder Jeff) Bezos had given them 10 years. So now we’re in 2019 and Tony’s in the middle of all these management experiments. That’s what he’s known for. But Zappos was starting to not meet its profit targets its growth targets.

I think this was a factor in him increasing his drug use during that time because he felt like he needed the next billion-dollar idea. He needed to somehow make the money for Amazon while also coming up with an original way to do that.

They just didn’t quite know how bad it had gotten with Tony until he actually had a breakdown on the phone with (then-Amazon Consumer CEO) Jeff Wilke around the summer of 2020. And then they realized and they put him on a temporary leave.

Are there any lessons to be taken from this arm’s-length approach that many tech companies are taking with their acquisitions?

The thing that I’m really hoping and a point we tried to make in this book is we’ve got to stop putting these people on pedestals. Tony Hsieh was a rock star by the time he died. … He had hundreds of people who would consider themselves to be his close friends. They idolized him so greatly they could not see what was really happening.

What else would you want people to take away from the book?

We need to be talking more about mental health issues. Especially among entrepreneurs and high-performing people it’s just so stigmatized even to be able to step back and say I need a vacation. If this product is delayed then it’s going to be delayed. That’s what we’re really hoping people will take away: Tony’s story isn’t just the heartbreaking story of one man who died. It’s really a warning to everyone. It can’t be just about the startup. And the message that we hope people take away is you need to stop and look at yourself.

The carrier will allow customers to buy beer for $8 and spirits and wine for $9 during flights

The carrier American Airlines announced on Thursday that they will be resuming inflight alcoholic beverages sales starting on April 18 on domestic and short-haul international flights. On the same date the mask mandate for flights is set to expire.

Alcohol has been banned from economy class for almost two years due to passengers’ inappropriate behavior towards crew members and passengers. The decision to bring back beer wine and spirits comes after all other airlines lifted this restriction and travelers requested the service.

The airline confirmed in a statement: “Our customers have expressed that having these options onboard is important to their experience with us.” The prices for inflight alcohol in the main cabin have also been shared and are the same as before the pandemic: $8 for a beer and $9 for spirits—gin rum vodka and whiskey— and wine. Snacks are also coming back and prices range from $4 to $6.

The first alcohol restriction started in March 2020 after that only first-class had access to alcoholic beverages. Starting in April passengers in Main Cabin Extra—a section with extra legroom— will receive free alcohol as they did before the restriction.

Other airlines had also banned alcohol sales during the pandemic but resumed services during the past few months. American Airlines has been the last carrier to return to inflight alcoholic beverages sales.

Why American Airlines Restricted Alcohol Sales

After the pandemic there were many reports of unruly passengers from different airlines across the United States. The Federal Aviation Administration shared a report in June 2021 and informed that since the beginning of the year it had received around 3100 reports of unruly passengers' behavior.

Many of these reports—which include verbal abuse and physical violence— were related to the mask mandate and passengers refusing to wear it. After this the Agency implemented a “zero tolerance” policy and said fines could raise up to $35000.

Last year American Airlines was about to lift the non-alcohol sales mandate implemented in 2020 but decided to postpone this decision. Brady Brynes the carrier’s Vice President of Flight Service said in a memo in May 2021: “Over the past week we've seen some of these stressors create deeply disturbing situations onboard aircraft. Let me be clear: American Airlines will not tolerate assault or mistreatment of our crews.”

Brynes also added that they understand that customers and also crew members are eager to return to “normal” but that they had to be cautious. He also told the staff: “We also recognize that alcohol can contribute to atypical behavior from customers onboard and we owe it to our crew not to potentially exacerbate what can already be a new and stressful situation for our customers.”

Other Airlines Restrictions

Two years ago Southwest Airlines was the first airline to implement the alcohol sales ban due to unruly behavior on March 18. After this mandate American Airlines United Airlines Easyjet Asia’s Virgin Australia KLM and Delta Airlines followed the lead. British Airways also suspended alcohol services but only for short-haul economy.

After prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverages the return of this service in recent months has been offered intermittently. In 2021 Southwest announced that they will resume selling alcohol during flights but after a passenger physically assaulted a flight attendant decided to extend the ban.

A spokesman from Southwest Airlines said: “We realize this decision may be disappointing for some customers but we feel this is the right decision at this time in the interest of the Safety and comfort of all Customers and Crew onboard.”

Delta Air Lines resumed inflight alcohol beverages sales in April 2021—but made them more expensive— and United Airlines in November 2021. Southwest Airlines resumed alcohol sales on its planes in February 2022. American Airlines was the last American carrier to reimplement this service.

American will be the last major U.S. airline to resume its onboard catering sales that were removed for safety reasons linked with the pandemic.

The removal of onboard food and drink services was adopted by most if not at all airlines across the world.

When onboard sales returned temporarily in early 2021 as travel restrictions let up what unfurled was a spate of alcohol-related incidents onboard aircraft resulting in American and Southwest’s decision to remove onboard sales once again.

Here’s what the return of alcohol and snacks means for you as an American Airlines passenger.

Snacks and Alcohol Sales Return for Some

As of April 18 2022 buy-on-board food will be available for passengers on flights that are longer than 1500 miles (or around 3.5 hours long).

Don’t get too excited though: to start with only chips and almonds will be available.

According to American touchless ordering will be brought in later in 2022.

It was only recently that American along with Delta brought back the hot meal service for passengers on domestic flights in business and first class cabins.

American economy flyers on domestic and short-haul international flights only will be glad to know that beer wine and spirits will once again be available for purchase.

However it will still not be possible to buy alcohol on flights of less than 250 miles. This means that economy cabins on short intercity hops such as New York (JFK) to Boston (BOS) and Austin (AUS) to Dallas (DFW) will remain dry for the foreseeable future.

By no means of a coincidence April 18 2022 is also when the U.S. government’s mandate on mask-wearing while flying is set to expire. Having already been delayed more than once there’s a chance it could happen again — a move that could be also mean American Airlines pushes back its chosen date for the resumption of onboard alcohol sales on some flights.

Final Thoughts

Having a strong inflight drink and a snack whether flying for business or pleasure is for many part of the travel experience.

American’s economy class passengers will finally be able to enjoy that experience once again after the carrier took longer than most to resume its onboard catering service.

Let’s hope nothing happens to pushback the planned return date so that economy passengers can toast in the air once again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL2xveWFsdHlsb2JieS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy8yMC9ib296eS1za2llcy1hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1maW5hbGx5LXJlc3VtZXMtYWxjb2hvbC1idXktb24tYm9hcmQtc2VydmljZS1mcm9tLWFwcmlsLTE4LTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boozy Skies: American Airlines Finally Resumes Alcohol Buy-on-Board Service From April 18 2022,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://loyaltylobby.com/2022/03/20/boozy-skies-american-airlines-finally-resumes-alcohol-buy-on-board-service-from-april-18-2022/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL2xveWFsdHlsb2JieS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy8yMC9ib296eS1za2llcy1hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1maW5hbGx5LXJlc3VtZXMtYWxjb2hvbC1idXktb24tYm9hcmQtc2VydmljZS1mcm9tLWFwcmlsLTE4LTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9jYXJpYmJlYW4tYWlybGluZXMtcmVzdW1lcy1mbGlnaHRzLWZvcnQtbGF1ZGVyZGFsZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Caribbean Airlines Resumes Flights To Fort Lauderdale and Curaçao,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9jYXJpYmJlYW4tYWlybGluZXMtcmVzdW1lcy1mbGlnaHRzLWZvcnQtbGF1ZGVyZGFsZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

First they try to get more oil on the market as soon as they can. That almost invariably has meant asking Saudi Arabia which geology has blessed with the world’s most agile oil reserves and which the U.S. has blessed with several billion dollars in weapons to pump and sell more petroleum.

Then they invest in America’s “energy independence” a hazy but ubiquitous slogan meaning that the U.S. should produce as much oil and natural gas as it consumes.

Finally they recognize that the American economy cannot be truly stable so long as it rests on a single flammable commodity. So in the long term they say the U.S. must invest in energy efficiency and fuel conservation and it must fund R&D so that solar wind nuclear and other inexhaustible resources can come to power its economy.

Call it the energy-security two-step. Nearly every recent president has done something like it—even the not-particularly-environmentally-friendly ones. “In the short run the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil” George W. Bush said in 2008. “In the long run the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies.” You can see the same thought appear in Barack Obama’s speeches and in Richard Nixon’s.

Yet since Russia invaded Ukraine every tenet of that approach has been either proved wrong or outright abandoned. After sanctions swept Russian oil off global markets gas prices hit record highs. They were brought down not by any policy but because China imposed new COVID lockdowns. At the same time Congress has failed to invest in any of the clean alternatives that would reduce American oil consumption.

That’s especially stunning because unlike during previous crises renewables and electric vehicles are now mature technologies that could be deployed immediately to cut oil demand. We no longer have to dream: A future where the U.S. economy is far less vulnerable to wild oil price swings—the goal of U.S. energy policy for the past 50 years—is now within reach. But instead of seizing it lawmakers are sitting around. For the first time in many years America has no credible plan for how to maintain its energy security in a geopolitical crisis.

Just how bad is America’s energy-security crisis? Over the course of the 2010s the new technology of hydrofracturing or fracking allowed U.S. companies to drill more and more every year. In 2019 the country actually produced more oil than it consumed for the first time in 62 years. America seemed to have finally achieved its goal of becoming “energy independent.”

Today America is the world’s largest oil and gas producer but instead of winning us energy independence this distinction has made the country dangerously dependent on market whim. No matter how much oil the U.S. drills crude prices are still set on the international market—so when Russia invaded Ukraine oil prices in America soared. This point alone invalidated the central principle of energy independence that suburban F-150 drivers should not have to pay more at the pump because someone else started a war.

Read: America is the world’s largest oil producer. So why is losing Russia’s oil such a big deal?

What about asking Saudi Arabia to drill more? Well the White House actually did ask last summer long before the war began. The Saudis declined. That relationship has frayed partially because of our new status as a major oil producer. The U.S. is no longer just Saudi Arabia’s largest customer; it is also the kingdom’s largest competitor. Today Saudi leaders won’t even take Joe Biden’s calls.

If Saudi Arabia won’t pump more why doesn’t the U.S.? After all doesn’t America have a large fracking industry and a continent’s worth of oil just waiting to be tapped? This assumption too has failed. Unlike the government of nearly every other major oil-producing country including Saudi Arabia and the other OPEC states the U.S. government cannot open and close its own oil taps. It cannot compel oil companies to drill more. So when the war sent oil prices soaring the government was powerless to bring them down.

Yet America’s private companies couldn’t help either. After a series of busts and near-death experiences American fracking firms now manage their cash flow so neurotically that some executives have sworn not to drill more even if oil reaches $150 a barrel an all-time high. In short America is sitting on all the oil it needs right now—and nobody has the power to reach it.

That’s the wreckage of our fossil-fuel policy. Our clean-energy policy is going even worse.

A few months ago the United States seemed to be on the verge of deploying solar and wind farms geothermal plants and even advanced nuclear plants across the country. As part of Biden’s overstuffed Build Back Better package the House had passed ambitious legislation to deploy zero-carbon energy sources at never-before-seen scales and with remarkable efficiency.

Today those climate-policy plans seem to have imploded. Senator Joe Manchin the Democrat from West Virginia who killed the broader Build Back Better package in December has said that he supports many of the clean-energy provisions and could himself revive them. But there is no sign that this is actually happening. In the meantime hundreds of billions of dollars in private investment in clean energy is waiting on the sidelines.

This failure isn’t just bad news for energy prices; it means that America’s broader position in the clean-energy transition has deteriorated since the war in Ukraine ramped up. The United States once flattered itself with the notion that it could compete with China to become a clean-energy-manufacturing powerhouse. This would have always been a hard goal given China’s considerable head start and its massive scale: In 2021 China’s EV sales alone were more than one-fifth of the size of America’s entire car market. But it will be impossible if American companies cannot benefit from the industrial support and consumer-side subsidies meant to help them catch up with global competitors.

American firms may not even be able to get the raw materials that they need to compete anymore. Although pilloried as little more than a “big gas station” Russia is a major supplier of copper platinum and other minerals needed for the energy transition. (One Russian company for instance produced 17 percent of the world’s Class I nickel the type used in EV batteries.) Whatever their merits the West’s sanctions have sent the price of these metals soaring worldwide. Retaliatory sanctions could eventually make it impossible for American and European firms to buy these raw goods.

In the short term that will increase the cost of clean technologies. In the long term the West’s economic blockade may have just enabled Chinese firms to acquire these raw materials from Russia on the cheap further entrenching the lower costs of Chinese-made climate tech and improving their economies of scale. And should the U.S. ever have to sanction China the same way that it has sanctioned Russia it will find itself in the dark severed from the world’s foundry of new energy technology.

In just a few weeks then every tenet of America’s energy policy has deteriorated. But now no policy maker or major interest in Washington seems well positioned to solve this problem. Everyone is stuck: The oil companies can’t get new fossil-fuel supply on the market in less than a year without ceding power to the White House. The White House can’t work with the oil companies without fracturing its climate-concerned coalition—unless it could at the same time get major climate policy passed in Congress to reduce our long-term dependence on oil. But Congress won’t budge. Its failure to pass any comprehensive energy policy is the core of the problem.

There’s only one man in the federal government who could break this impasse: Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Manchin doesn’t just provide the pivotal 50th Democratic vote in the Senate; he owns millions of dollars worth of stock in a fossil-fuel company is the biggest recipient of fossil-fuel donations in Congress and is one of the few Democrats who can claim to understand how the fossil-fuel industry thinks. That could place him in a position to at least restart negotiations. But who knows what he believes anymore? In recent months he has said he wants an energy bill and then declined to restart talks over one. Although he once seemed open to the idea of a clean-energy mandate he yanked that policy from the bill too. (Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer who has too often opted to pressure Manchin publicly rather than treat him as a crucial partner whose support he must secure bears some blame here as well.)

The two men are not alone. Republicans who refuse to support even the mild climate policies favored by European and Canadian conservatives also shoulder the blame for the wreckage of U.S. policy. It was President Donald Trump who scrapped “energy independence” for “energy dominance” framing fossil fuels not as a necessary evil but as a positive good. But Democrats are in the governing majority today and Manchin leads the Senate’s energy committee so it is their job and his at least in theory to govern.

The most likely outcome is that nothing changes. The United States will take its oil and let it fetch the highest price on the world market. The dissipation of America’s natural resources will continue and we’ll muddle through safe in the belief that nothing too bad could really happen. We might be all right for a while until we aren’t.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMTkvY2xpbWF0ZS9lbmVyZ3ktdHJhbnNpdGlvbi1jbGltYXRlLWNoYW5nZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,There's a Messaging Battle Right Now Over America's Energy Future (Published 2022),"Climate scientists oil executives progressives and conservatives all agree on one thing these days: The energy transition is upon us.

It's fairly easy to rack up American Express Membership Rewards points between lucrative welcome bonuses and generous earning rates on many American Express cards. However earning points is one thing — redeeming those points for maximum value (and comfort) is an entirely different story.

Getting the most value out of Amex Membership Rewards points usually involves transferring them to an airline or hotel partner and then redeeming the points or miles through that program. Today we're going to look at some of the best business-class products you can book by leveraging these partners.

Qatar Airways

Qatar Airways' Qsuite is one of the world's best business-class products. The suites are spacious and offer a ton of privacy thanks to sliding doors. Plus if you're flying with a companion and assign yourself to the two center seats positioned closest together you can set up a side-by-side double bed — a rarity in business class.

(Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy)

Qsuites can be found on select Boeing 777-200LRs 777-300ERs Airbus A350-900s and all A350-1000s on flights between Doha Quatar and U.S. cities like New York Seattle Miami Boston Chicago Los Angeles San Francisco and others. However there's no need to fret if you don't land yourself a Qsuite-equipped aircraft since you'll still get to enjoy top-notch amenities on board and restaurant-quality food.

How to book

You can transfer your Membership Rewards points to Cathay Pacific's Asia Miles program and book business-class awards from the East Coast to Doha for 75000 miles one-way. Taxes and fees run around $500 each way. As long as all of your flights are on Qatar Airways you can search and book the award online.

Another option would be to book your award with British Airways Avios — but that would require 105000 miles each way plus taxes and fees.

All Nippon Airways (ANA)

Another top-notch business class product you could book is ANA's ""The Room."" The seats offer excellent privacy thanks to closing doors and are incredibly spacious measuring a whopping 38 inches wide. TPG's Zach Griff went as far as calling it the gold standard for the industry. The only catch is that it's currently only available on select Boeing 777-300ERs flying from Tokyo to cities like New York and Los Angeles.

Business-class seats on ANA's other long-haul aircraft don't have doors but still offer direct aisle access. You'll also still enjoy ANA's impeccable service and amazing cuisine. Besides the usual bedding which typically consists of a pillow and comforter business-class passengers flying ANA can also expect a mattress pad and slippers on all long-haul flights.

How to book

ANA's Mileage Club program is a 1:1 transfer partner of Amex and offers fantastic award availability on many of its U.S. routes. Round-trip business-class awards between the U.S. and Japan range between 75000 and 90000 miles depending on the season plus about $500 in taxes and fees.

If you only need a one-way ticket on ANA you could book with Virgin Atlantic Flying Club from 45000 miles each way. Other transfer partners to consider include Avianca LifeMiles and Air Canada Aeroplan — neither of which impose fuel surcharges.

Delta

The Delta One suite is the only business-class product offered by the big three legacy U.S. carriers to feature sliding doors. Aside from the excellent privacy the seats are very comfortable when in bed mode and the new eco-friendly bedding is great.

You can find these private suites on Delta's Airbus A350s and A330-900neos flying to select Asian and European destinations. Plus you'll occasionally find them on some domestic routes. Although they don't offer doors Delta also offers updated business-class seats on some 767s and A330s.

How to book

Membership Rewards points can be transferred to Delta SkyMiles instantly at a 1:1 ratio. Sounds great right? Unfortunately though booking awards with Delta SkyMiles can be extremely frustrating. Because the airline doesn't publish an award chart award pricing can vary greatly — we've seen Delta One Suite awards to Asia for as low as 80000 miles one-way and as high as 375000 miles one-way.

Your best bet would be to transfer your points at a 1:1 ratio to Virgin Atlantic's Flying Club and book your award through that program. As long as there is saver award availability (typically whenever Delta charges under 100000 miles one-way) you can book Delta One awards to Europe at a flat 50000 miles each way and awards to Asia for 105000 miles and up depending on the distance. Plus you'll pay the same taxes and fees when redeeming Flying Club miles for Delta flights as you would when booking directly through Delta.

Singapore Airlines

Whether or not you're flying on the A380 that features the airline's latest and greatest seats flying business class on Singapore Airlines is always a treat. Singapore Airlines' long-haul aircraft feature stylish business-class cabins in a 1-2-1 configuration with fully lie-flat beds.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

Business-class passengers can take advantage of the famous ""Book the Cook"" service and pre-order scrumptious meals — like the popular Seafood Thermidor — from extensive menus with over 60 dishes.

And if you're lucky enough to be flying on the A380 with the airline's latest business-class product you can enjoy a double bed with your travel companion by selecting two seats in the middle section of the cabin.

How to book

Booking Singapore Airlines business-class award tickets on long-haul routes is challenging since you can only do so through Singapore's KrisFlyer program. Fortunately that's not a problem for Amex Membership Rewards-earning cardholders — or cardholders of any of the three other major transferable points programs (Chase Ultimate Rewards Citi ThankYou Rewards and Capital One) — since you can transfer points to KrisFlyer at a 1:1 ratio.

Singapore Airlines operates several flights between the U.S. and Asia as well as several fifth-freedom routes between the U.S. and Europe. Award pricing varies based on zones and whether you need to add a connection on a Star Alliance partner but here are some of your booking options:

Route Miles required New York – Frankfurt 72000 KrisFlyer miles New York – Singapore 99000 KrisFlyer miles Houston – Manchester England 72000 KrisFlyer miles San Francisco – Hong Kong 89000 KrisFlyer miles Los Angeles – Tokyo 92000 KrisFlyer miles

Air France

If you can't get to Europe with Singapore Airlines or a Delta One suite your next best bet would be with Air France. The French carrier offers updated business class seats aboard its A350s 777-300ERs 787-9s and a few 777-200s. The carrier is also refitting its existing A330s with new seats. Aside from the A330s the new business-class cabins utilize a 1-2-1 configuration and provide each passenger a lie-flat seat direct aisle access and plenty of privacy.

France is known for its fine cuisine and the food on board the country's flag carrier is no exception. The airline has partnered with Michelin-starred chefs like Régis Marcon Michel Roth and Guy Martin to prepare multicourse meals that include an amuse-bouche salad main course cheese course and dessert complete with fine wines and champagnes selected by sommelier Paolo Basso and wine-guide authors Thierry Desseauve and Michel Bettane.

How to book

Air France/KLM's Flying Blue program is a 1:1 transfer partner of Amex. The program doesn't publish award charts but to give you an idea a one-way business-class award ticket between New York and Paris will usually range between 57500 and 75000 miles. However you'll need to fork over a few hundred dollars in taxes and fees.

You may be able to save some miles by booking through Flying Blue's Promo Awards a rotating set of cities with discounted award rates to Europe. For instance we recently saw business class awards to various destinations across Europe for less than 40000 miles each way.

Bottom line

American Express Membership Rewards points offer flexibility and allow you to experience some of the world's best business-class products for very little out of pocket. The ones covered in this post are just some of our favorites but there are plenty more fantastic options that will put your points to good use including on Cathay Pacific and Emirates.

While points transfer at a 1:1 ratio to all of the partners mentioned that is not the case for all Amex's other partners. Additionally it's not uncommon to see transfer bonuses that give you an additional 30% or sometimes more so you may get even greater value from your points.

Last year Apple disseminated an update allowing face mask-wearing iPhone users to employ Face ID to unlock their iPhone but only if they are wearing an unlocked Apple Watch.





The new update is important because not everyone can afford to buy an Apple Watch. With iOS 15.4 installed iPhone users set up Face ID once again with the third facial scan taking longer to complete. To gather enough information from a user's face even with a mask blocking most of it Face ID will now focus on the space around the user's eyes to find unique characteristics that allow Face ID to verify a user's identity.

Whenever an operating system update takes place it could take a few days before the battery returns to normal. Things are taking place in the background and other things are happening that could make it seem as though the battery is draining rapidly. You might be tempted to throw your iPhone into a lake if you are experiencing this battery drain but it could clear up after a few days.

It's no surprise that travel rewards credit cards are a popular discussion here at TPG. By strategically opening and utilizing them you can earn large sign-up bonuses and extra points in a variety of categories of everyday spending which can lead to fantastic redemptions like premium-class flights and luxurious hotel rooms.

However there are a number of misconceptions out there when it comes to credit cards.

Today I'll take a look at what happens when you aren't immediately approved for a new credit card.

Myth: There's nothing you can do if your credit card application isn't immediately approved

Those of you who have been involved in the hobby for a while know there's a certain euphoria that comes with getting approved for a new credit card (or maybe it's just me). When you submit an application those 20-30 seconds of processing can seem like an eternity. But when that immediate approval comes through your mind starts thinking about how you're going to redeem those bonus points or miles.

Unfortunately there are two other pages that can come up after you click the button to submit your application and these can bring the exact opposite reaction.

The first is an immediate denial — which is typically a done deal. If the issuer immediately decides to decline your application there's rarely anything you can do.

However there's another result: the approval pending page.

In general this means you've falling into the limbo known as a ""pending"" decision. When this happens the issuer can't immediately approve you based on the information on your application and the inquiry it ran on your credit report. Instead it needs more time (and sometimes more information) in order to come to a final decision.

In some cases the approval comes without action on your part. In the past I've received an email a few days after getting the ""pending"" notice letting me know that I have been approved. At least one other time the new card simply showed up in my online account (and then arrived in the mail a few days later).

That being said if you want to help ensure that a ""pending"" application turns into an approved application there's an important step you can take: Call the issuer's reconsideration line.

Using the reconsideration line

All banks that issue credit cards have automatic systems for processing online credit card applications and these systems have a variety of factors that they consider. A large chunk of this is your credit score which includes details like your payment history and credit utilization rate. But banks will also look at the income you reported on your application and the relationship you have with them. If your details fall below the preset thresholds you won't be automatically approved (and may even get denied).

This is where reconsideration comes in as it allows you to speak to an actual person who may be able to override those systems.

If you're immediately declined for a credit card I'd generally wait until you receive the formal rejection letter in the mail before calling. This will outline the reason(s) your application was denied and give you a chance to plan your talking points before calling — though convincing a customer service agent to overturn an immediate denial is a relatively hard task.

On the other hand if your card goes into ""pending"" status there are two schools of thought about calling the reconsideration line:

Some feel like you should let the process unfold and then call if your application is eventually denied. They believe that calling preempts the regular review process and could actually hurt your chances. Others believe that you should call a few days after applying — or even right away before an issuer has a chance to turn a pending application into a denied one.

Personally I belong to the latter camp. I would rather get ahead of the issuer's process — and I've had plenty of success doing so. It's often as simple as verifying the information you submitted or shifting credit lines from an older card to the new card.

Now keep in mind that there are cases where there's little chance of a successful reconsideration call. The most prominent example is Chase's 5/24 rule. If you've opened five or more new card accounts in the last 24 months you will almost certainly be declined when you apply for many Chase cards.

However other reasons you're likely to be denied include:

Insufficient income.

High debt-to-income ratio.

Applying for a credit card outside your credit score range.

In these instances calling reconsideration generally will get you nowhere. Nevertheless in most other situations it can't hurt to try.

Related: Your guide to calling a credit card reconsideration line

Bottom line

When you apply for a new card there are generally three results: approval denial or ""pending"" status. While one of those is (obviously) preferred all hope is not lost if you get either of the other two notices. Calling a reconsideration line and speaking to a customer service agent can go a long way toward turning a non-approval to an approval.

Be sure to keep this in mind the next time you aren't immediately approved for a new credit card.

The former US Open champion averaged over 323 yards off the tee on the PGA Tour last season but he hasn't played on tour since January and there is a growing concern as to whether he will play at The Masters.

We have seen some huge drives on the PGA Tour this season. DeChambeau's longest hit is 403 yards which he recorded at the Sentry Tournament of Champions.

However this drive puts the eight-time PGA Tour winner in seventh place in terms of the longest drives of the season an incredible 57 yards short of the biggest strike.

This PGA Tour pro has hit longest drive of 2022 - but it's not Bryson…

Scott Stallings hit an absolutely monstrous drive of 460 yards during the WM Phoenix Open at TPC Scottsdale. No player has hit one further than this in 2022 and we have a feeling this record could last a lot longer.

In fact this hit from Stallings is 47 yards ahead of the second-longest drive of the season so far. Cameron Young striped one drive 413 yards at The American Express.

The Sentry Tournament of Champions won by Cameron Smith at Kapalua was the scene of some huge drives and it is the event where Jon Rahm and Tony Finau also recorded their longest drives so far this term.

Rahm the current World No.1 hit one tee shot 401 yards in Hawaii while Tony Finau has edged him out on 402 yards.

DeChambeau missed out on defending his title at the Arnold Palmer Invitational this month but we can hope to see him back soon and hitting bombs like he always does.

Specifically intelligence and counterterrorism officials say that despite Taliban promises to sever ties with al-Qaida and oppose terror groups such as the Islamic State's Afghan affiliate as codified in the 2020 Doha agreement with the United States there has been scant evidence of progress.

""The Taliban is attempting to maintain pressure on ISIS [Islamic State group]"" the top general at U.S. Central Command told lawmakers in Washington on March 15. ""They're finding it difficult to do.""



""They're much less firm on the al-Qaida issue in terms of opposing them and trying to limit them"" CENTCOM's General Kenneth ""Frank"" McKenzie added.

A recent United Nations report based on member state intelligence echoed those fears.

""There are no recent signs that the Taliban has taken steps to limit the activities of foreign terrorist fighters in the country"" the report said. ""On the contrary terrorist groups enjoy greater freedom there than at any time in recent history.""

Despite such concerns some diplomats such as the U.S. special representative for Afghanistan have expressed hope the Taliban will crack down.

Thomas West told the U.S. Institute of Peace on Feb. 15 that he believed the Taliban were ""very sincere in their intent to contain"" Islamic State terrorists.

Here is a look at the Taliban and the major terrorist organizations now operating in Afghanistan and how they have fared in the six months since U.S. and coalition forces left the country.

Taliban

Since its emergence in 1994 the Taliban movement which calls itself the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has been led by an emir a central figure ostensibly appointed for life by a religious council of Taliban leaders.

Like his two predecessors the current emir Hibatullah Akhundzada has made no public speeches and leads a reclusive life in southern Afghanistan's Kandahar province. He has left the management of day-to-day government affairs to his appointed caretaker Cabinet in the Afghan capital Kabul.

Various estimates by U.S. intelligence agencies and United Nations member states put the number of Taliban fighters between 58000 and 100000 with numbers fluctuating according to the time of year and battlefield conditions.

A U.N. report issued in June 2021 prior to the U.S. withdrawal noted the Taliban force size was ""robust in spite of significant attrition rates"" over the past few years.

The Taliban have also benefited from the presence of some 8000 to 10000 foreign fighters in Afghanistan most of whom are aligned with the Taliban. The Taliban's defense minister recently said in an interview that the group is trying to build a 110000-strong army.

Intelligence shared publicly by the United States and United Nations member states further accuses the Taliban of continuing to work closely with al-Qaida and maintaining ties with other terrorist groups pushing some to become part of a new Taliban-run Afghan military force.

And even if the Taliban are planning to crack down on cells of IS-Khorasan Islamic State's affiliate in Afghanistan they may not have the right capabilities.

""I don't think what we'll see from the Taliban will be traditional [counterterrorism] as we think of it"" Colin Clarke director of research at the global intelligence firm The Soufan Group told VOA last year.

""It's much easier to play a spoiler role than to perform effectively in the role of counterinsurgent"" he said. ""I think the Taliban could be effective in clearing an area but it will struggle more with holding it.""

For their part Taliban officials have publicly denied that terrorism is an issue for Afghans under their leadership.

""We do not see anyone in Afghanistan who has anything to do with al-Qaida"" Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid told a news conference in Kabul last September.

""The ISIS that exists in Iraq and Syria does not exist here"" he added. ""We are committed to the fact that from Afghanistan there will not be any danger to any country.""

Islamic State Khorasan Province

The Islamic State terror group's Afghan affiliate is a sworn enemy of both the Taliban and al-Qaida which has deep and long-standing ties to Taliban leadership. But IS-Khorasan is also one of the groups that has benefited the most from the Taliban takeover.

As Taliban forces asserted control over Afghanistan they emptied out many of the country's prisons including the Parwan prison at Bagram Airfield which had held hundreds of IS-Khorasan fighters.

Taliban commanders quickly executed former IS-Khorasan leader Abu Omar Khorasani but many other IS followers were allowed to escape.

At the time U.S. military officials said the prison releases helped swell IS-Khorasan's ranks from several hundred to at least 2000 ""hardcore"" fighters. IS-Khorasan was also blamed for the August 26 bombing at Kabul airport that killed 13 Americans and more than 170 Afghans.

Intelligence shared by U.N. member states suggests that since then IS-Khorasan has nearly doubled in size to about 4000 fighters half of which may be from outside Afghanistan.

The same intelligence estimates say that the group which lost all the territory under its control in early 2020 now ""controls limited territory in eastern Afghanistan"" and that it is ""capable of conducting high-profile and complex attacks.""

IS-Khorasan also appears to be benefitting from financial support from its core in Syria and Iraq receiving more than $500000 over the past six months according to some intelligence estimates.

U.S. defense officials have further voiced concern about IS-Khorasan regenerating the capability to launch attacks against the U.S. and other foreign targets initially warning that the group could launch global operations starting in April 2022.

More recent assessments by U.S. military intelligence officials indicate that the group is more focused at the moment on cementing its support within Afghanistan itself and that IS-Khorasan may not be ready to carry out external operations for another 12-18 months.

Al-Qaida core

Since its initial statement at the end of August congratulating the Taliban on its victory al-Qaida leadership has been mostly silent on the situation in Afghanistan though al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri referenced ""the defeat of the Americans"" in a video released this month.

Zawahiri himself is believed to be hiding in Afghanistan and intelligence agencies from a number of countries assess he is in ill health.

Intelligence shared with the U.N. for a recent report however indicates al-Qaida is benefitting from ""a significant boost"" due to the U.S. withdrawal and Taliban takeover of Afghanistan.

""Some of its [al-Qaida's] closest sympathizers within the Taliban now occupy senior positions in the new de facto Afghan administration"" according to the U.N. report which also says chances are now good that Zawahiri's likely successor Saif al-Adel will seek to leave Iran and establish himself in Afghanistan.

Western counterterrorism estimates from before the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan suggested the al-Qaida core perhaps commanded several hundred fighters across at least 15 Afghan provinces. And in September a top U.S. intelligence official said that there were ""indications of some potential movement of al-Qaida [officials and followers] to Afghanistan"" though he cautioned ""It's still early days.""

While U.S. officials remain concerned that al-Qaida will focus again on conducting foreign attacks a recent report based on U.S. military intelligence assessments indicates that the group has been keeping a low profile at the Taliban's request and that the Taliban who are seeking to gain international recognition for their new government are likely to dissuade al-Qaida leaders from launching attacks.

Al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent

One of al-Qaida's key offshoots al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent has as much of a presence in Afghanistan as the group's core.

Intelligence estimates from U.N. member states say AQIS has up to 400 fighters in Afghanistan spread across Ghazni Helmand Kandahar Nimruz Paktika and Zabul provinces.

AQIS fighters including native Afghans and fighters from Bangladesh Pakistan India and Myanmar (Burma) are said to have fought alongside Taliban against the U.S.-backed government prior to its collapse. Earlier U.S. intelligence assessments said it appeared that AQIS fighters were actively integrated into Taliban units.

AQIS leader Osama Mehmood and AQIS deputy Atif Yahya Ghouri are both thought to reside in Afghanistan.

Haqqani network

The Haqqani network is widely considered to be the most influential and strategically successful extremist group in the region. While nominally loyal to the Taliban the network as described by the U.N. is ""semi-autonomous"" maintaining ties with both al-Qaida and IS-Khorasan.

The group boasts a ""highly skilled core of members who specialize in complex attacks and provide technical skills such as improvised explosive device and rocket construction"" according to the U.N.

It also oversees a force of between 3000 and 10000 traditional armed fighters in Khost Paktika and Paktiya provinces.

The network is run by Sirajuddin Haqqani a son of the late mujahedeen commander and network founder Jalaluddin Haqqani. For much of its existence the group has been based in Pakistan's tribal areas as it operated across the border in Afghanistan. The more than 40-year-old Haqqani has a $10 million bounty on his head from the U.S. government and works as a deputy emir of the Taliban as well as the interior minister of Afghanistan.

The Haqqanis have been accused of perpetuating some of the deadliest and most sophisticated attacks against U.S. Indian and former Afghan government targets in Afghanistan since 2001.

The network is believed to have strong ties to Pakistani intelligence and al-Qaida. The U.S. designated it a foreign terrorist organization in 2012.

Intelligence gathered over the past year from some U.N. member states said that at times the Haqqanis have acted as a go-between for the Taliban and IS-Khorasan and that with the tacit approval of the Taliban they directed the Islamic State affiliate to attack the now defunct U.S.-backed Afghan government.

Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan

Most active on the 2640-kilometer-long border between Afghanistan and Pakistan the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTP is an insurgent group involved in terrorist attacks in both countries.

The latest U.N. intelligence estimates put the number of TTP fighters at between 3000 and 5500.

The group's stated objectives are to end the Pakistani government's control over the Pashtun territories of Pakistan and to form a strict government based on Islamic Shariah law.

U.S. forces in Afghanistan and the Pakistani military have killed or captured several TTP leaders over the past two decades.

The group's current leader Noor Wali Mehsud has publicly declared allegiance to the Afghan Taliban leader.

The Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan has reportedly reenergized the TTP and Pakistani officials have sought the Afghan Taliban's assistance in dealing with the group.

The U.N. says those efforts have made some progress.

""Mediation from the Taliban has led to a reduction in TTP attacks against Pakistan"" a recent U.N. report found adding that one country's intelligence agency said the Taliban have been involved in talks aimed at allowing TTP family members to peacefully resettle in Pakistan.

The Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan

The Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan or IMU was founded in the late 1990s with help and financial support from al-Qaida founder Osama bin Laden and several IMU leaders have served as part of the al-Qaida hierarchy. The group has sought to replace the Uzbek government with a strictly Islamic regime.

IMU launched its first attack in February 1999 by simultaneously detonating five car bombs in Tashkent the Uzbek capital. The group is also believed to have carried out attacks in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

In 2015 then-IMU leader Usman Ghazi and other senior members of the group shifted allegiance from al-Qaida to the rival Islamic State. But the move did not sit well with Taliban leaders who launched a major military campaign against Ghazi killing him and nearly wiping out the group.

IMU's force size was estimated at several hundred in 2018 but the group was reportedly battered by a large-scale Taliban onslaught in Afghanistan's Faryab province that same year.

As of mid-2021 intelligence suggested IMU had broken into Uzbek and Tajik factions with the Uzbek faction possibly entertaining the idea of joining IS.

Recent intelligence suggests the remnants of IMU were fighting alongside the Taliban as they took over Afghanistan which has earned the terror group more freedom of movement.

Khatiba Imam al-Bukhari

Khatiba Imam al-Bukhari (KIB) was founded in 2011 by fighters who left the IMU and fought alongside the Taliban against the U.S.-backed Afghan government.

The group is led by Dilshod Dekhanov a Tajik national.

KIB's forces are in Afghanistan's Badghis province though the group is also thought to have about 100 or so fighters in Syria possibly in Latakia or Idlib governorates.

According to the U.N. KIB's numbers in Afghanistan have been growing due to the successful recruitment of locals. KIB not only has received money from the Taliban but also raises funds through its leadership in Syria.

Intelligence shared with the U.N. indicates Dekhanov visited Kabul in September asking the Taliban to unify KIB and IMU under his leadership.

Dekhanov's request was denied reports say with Taliban officials pushing to make the KIB part of a new Taliban army.

Islamic Jihad Group

According to intelligence assessments shared with the U.N. the Islamic Jihad Group is considered ""the most combat-ready Central Asian group in Afghanistan"" and known for expertise in ""military tactics and the manufacture of improvised explosive devices.""

The group is led by a Kyrgyz national named Ilimbek Mamatov. The group's second-in-command Amsattor Atabaev hails from Tajikistan.

IJG's fighters operate across Badakhshan Baghlan and Kunduz provinces fought alongside Taliban forces against the previous government and even got some financial support from the Taliban over the past year.

Like KIB's leader Mamatov is reported to have asked Taliban leaders to unite key Central Asian groups under his leadership. But reports say his request was rejected.

Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement/Turkistan Islamic Party

The Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM) also known as the Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP) was first established in the Xinjiang region of China with its first reported attack in 1998.

After 2001 it began getting help from both al-Qaida and the Taliban and it has been consistently active in Afghanistan since 2007.

According to intelligence estimates provided by U.N. member states ETIM has between 200 and 700 fighters in Afghanistan training and plotting for attacks on Chinese targets.

Most of the ETIM fighters had been in Badakhshan province which borders China. But according to a recent U.N. report the Taliban recently relocated many of the fighters ""to both protect and restrain the group.""

Recent intelligence suggests that ETIM fighters have embraced the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan and that members have been encouraged to forge deeper ties with Afghanistan.

""They also anticipate that the Taliban de facto administration will provide them with refugee status and passports enabling them to travel internationally"" the U.N. said in a recent report.

In addition to the group's close ties with the Taliban and al-Qaida it has been reported to collaborate with other groups in Afghanistan including TTP and Jamaat Ansarullah an ethnically Tajik faction of the IMU.

Intelligence also suggests that IS-Khorasan has increased its recruiting of ETIM members.

Lashkar-e-Islam

Lashkar-e-Islam was founded in the Khyber district of Pakistan in 2004 but relocated to Afghanistan's Nangarhar province in 2014 following clashes with the Pakistani military.

Since coming to Afghanistan Lashkar-e-Islam has clashed with IS-Khorasan with major skirmishes taking places in 2018 as the two groups fought for control of territory and resources.

Hezb-e-Islami

Hezb-e-Islami or ""Party of Islam"" was founded in 1976 by former Afghan Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.

The group shares much of the same ideology as the Taliban and its fighter have assisted in Taliban in the past.

In 2015 Hekmatyar ordered his followers to help IS fighters in Afghanistan but never pledged allegiance to IS.

Hezb-e-Islami was known to target U.S. forces in Afghanistan carrying out a series of attacks on U.S. and coalition forces in from 2013-15.

Lashkar-e-Taiba

Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) or ""Army of the Pure"" was founded in Pakistan in the 1990s and is sometimes known as Jamaat-ud-Dawa.

Led by Hafiz Muhammad Saeed and aligned with al-Qaida the group is perhaps best known for carrying out the November 2008 attacks in Mumbai India which killed more than 160 people.

LeT established an office in Quetta Pakistan in 2006 to assist the Taliban in Afghanistan and the group has also reportedly sent fighters to Afghanistan to assist the Taliban in their efforts.

In June 2021 a blast outside Saeed's home killed three people. The U.S. is offering a $10 million reward for information leading to Saeed's conviction in the Mumbai terror attacks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDIyL21hci8yMC9pdHMtZWl0aGVyLWtpbGwtb3ItYmUta2lsbGVkLXRoZS1zb3V0aC1hbWVyaWNhbnMtZ29pbmctdG8tZmlnaHQtaW4tdWtyYWluZdIBeGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDIyL21hci8yMC9pdHMtZWl0aGVyLWtpbGwtb3ItYmUta2lsbGVkLXRoZS1zb3V0aC1hbWVyaWNhbnMtZ29pbmctdG8tZmlnaHQtaW4tdWtyYWluZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘It’s either kill or be killed’: the South Americans going to fight in Ukraine,"Emílio Teixeira Alarcón thinks he knows exactly how he will feel after slaying his first Russian soldier.

“Mission accomplished” shrugged the Brazilian army reservist. “In war it’s either kill or be killed.”

“If I get someone in my crosshairs and don’t shoot he might shoot me. It’s just like a game of paintball” he added as the mid-morning sun bathed his home in north Rio.

Paintball is the closest Alarcón 43 has ever come to active combat. He served in his city’s 21st Field Artillery Regiment in the late 1990s before throwing himself into political activism and the battle against what he calls “the scourge of communism”. He has never left Brazil.

But with the outbreak of hostilities in Ukraine Alarcón said he saw an unmissable chance to wage real-life war on the ideology he believes Vladimir Putin represents. “What’s happening is surreal … It’s put the whole world in danger” said the Rio-born nationalist who runs an anti-communist group called ‘O Pesadelo de Qualquer Político’ (‘Any Politician’s Nightmare’). “That’s why the whole world’s mobilising to go there – Brazilians included.”

Alarcón who has been fundraising for his mission since day one of the war is not the only Latin American making plans to travel thousands of miles east to Ukraine’s frontline.

From Brazil and Argentina to Mexico and Colombia volunteer fighters have voiced interest in joining – or already joined – Ukraine’s international legion for what they describe as a mix of ideological humanitarian and financial reasons.

The volunteers range from battle-hardened veterans of Colombia’s US-backed “war on drugs” to Argentinian students who have never picked up a gun and Brazilian Instagram influencers who have been criticised for putting lives at risk by using the conflict as clickbait.

Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced the legion’s creation three days after Russia’s 24 February invasion telling would-be fighters: “Please come over we will give you weapons.”

Uriel Saavedra a former member of the Colombian police unit that protects government officials and VIPs said he hoped to reach the battlefield within a fortnight after signing up to fight through a Colombia-based security firm.

“If someone wants me to go to war in Ukraine well obviously they’re going to have to pay – because the risk of coming back dead is so high” said Saavedra 40 who expects to receive $10000-a-month from the company which recruited him and about 30 other veterans.

Saavedra who saw the job advertised on a WhatsApp group for military and police veterans recognised it was dangerous. “But we’re prepared. We can use any weapon they give us” said the soldier of fortune who sees the war as a way of supplementing his $1000-a-month state pension.

Brazilian reservist Isaías Diogo da Boa Morte said he was driven by anger at Putin’s ruthless assault on civilians. “It’s just so cowardly” declared the 43-year-old who served with Alarcón and is part of his collective.

Boa Morte said his son was horrified. “Damn it Dad are you nuts?” he had asked. But the reservist was determined to travel despite concerns about sub-zero temperatures. “We’ll be so full of adrenaline when we arrive we won’t notice the cold” Boa Morte said as he sat beside a swimming pool in a Rio sports club wearing flip-flops and shorts.

Some Latin American legionnaires have already reached Ukraine among them Tiago Rossi a shooting instructor from south Brazil who claimed he had set off for his first war in early March one day after turning 28.

Rossi who said he was accompanied by two other Brazilians – a former infantryman and a former paratrooper – recalled meeting combatants from South American countries including Argentina Chile and Colombia whose mercenaries are coveted by contractors because of their experience fighting leftist rebels paramilitaries and drug traffickers.

Rossi insisted he did not fear dying on a battleground more than 7000 miles from his home in the city of Maringá: “I came here to fulfil my mission – if I die it’s because that’s how God willed it.”

But how such bravado will hold up in the face of the horrific realities of Ukraine’s conflict is unclear. Rossi said he had retreated into Poland after Russia bombed the Yavoriv military base where he was staying. He said he had no plans to return and would instead seek to help South Americans in Polish refugee centres. “I think I’ll be more useful here than over there [in Ukraine].”

Alarcón who said he had more than 20000 hours of shooting range experience is still fundraising but hopes to set off soon. “My speciality’s using cannons and machine guns to shoot down planes – so I think we’d help make a difference” said the army reserve artillery corporal wondering whether the Guardian might ask wealthy readers to buy his group body armour and plane tickets.

On receiving a negative response Alarcón said: “England has every interest in seeing Brazilians going there to help out. It’s much closer to Ukraine and Russia than Brazil … What happens if this nut job launches an atomic bomb?”

Many of the Brazilian volunteers appear to be disciples of Brazil’s far-right president Jair Bolsonaro a former paratrooper who is popular in the military rank and file. But Bolsonaro who visited Moscow on the eve of Russia’s invasions and has seemed to take Putin’s side has outraged some followers with his stance.

Alarcón vowed to never again vote Bolsonaro. “I wanted to shoot the television” his father Emílio Galdeano 68 said of the moment he saw Bolsonaro voice “solidarity” with Russia nine days before war.

Emílio Galdeano a retired shooting range owner said he was too old for combat but supported his son despite fearing for his safety. “If he was a kid I’d tie him to the foot of the bed and give him a bit of a hiding with my belt. But he’s too old for that” he sighed.

This week Alarcón believed he had taken a major step towards the theatre of war after a Kyiv entrepreneur launched a campaign to fly up to 50 Brazilians to Poland. “I’ve got goosebumps” Alarcón celebrated after receiving the news. “I think help’s on its way for us.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDMvMjAvY2hpbmEtaXNsYW5kcy1taWxpdGFyaXplZC1taXNzaWxlcy0wMDAxODczN9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. admiral says China has fully militarized islands,"There were no immediate comments from Chinese officials. Beijing maintains its military profile is purely defensive arranged to protect what it says are its sovereign rights. But after years of increased military spending China now boasts the world’s second largest defense budget after the U.S. and is rapidly modernizing its force with weapons systems including the J-20 stealth fighter hypersonic missiles and two aircraft carriers with a third under construction.

Aquilino spoke with the AP onboard a U.S. Navy reconnaissance aircraft that flew near Chinese-held outposts in the South China Sea’s Spratly archipelago one of the most hotly contested regions in the world. During the patrol the P-8A Poseidon plane was repeatedly warned by Chinese callers that it illegally entered what they said was China’s territory and ordered the plane to move away.

“China has sovereignty over the Spratly islands as well as surrounding maritime areas. Stay away immediately to avoid misjudgment” one of the stern radio messages said in a veiled threat.

But the U.S. Navy plane dismissed the multiple warnings and pressed on defiantly with its reconnaissance in brief but tense moments witnessed by two AP journalists invited onboard. “I am a sovereign immune United States naval aircraft conducting lawful military activities beyond the national airspace of any coastal state” a U.S. pilot radioed back to the Chinese.

“Exercising these rights is guaranteed by international law and I am operating with due regard to the rights and duties of all states” he said.

Navy commanding officer Joel Martinez who led the P-8A Poseidon’s crew said there has been an incident when a Chinese jet flew close to a U.S. aircraft in a dangerous maneuver in the disputed region. The U.S. flight crew calmly reminded the Chinese to comply with aviation safety regulations he said.

As the P-8A Poseidon flew as low as 15000 feet near the Chinese-occupied reefs some appeared to be like small cities on screen monitors with multi-story buildings warehouses hangars seaports runways and white round structures Aquilino said were radars. Near Fiery Cross more than 40 unspecified vessels could be seen apparently anchored.

Aquilino said the construction of missile arsenals aircraft hangars radar systems and other military facilities on Mischief Reef Subi Reef and Fiery Cross appeared to have been completed but it remains to be seen if China will pursue the construction of military infrastructure in other areas.

“The function of those islands is to expand the offensive capability of the PRC beyond their continental shores” he said. “They can fly fighters bombers plus all those offensive capabilities of missile systems.”

He said any military and civilian plane flying over the disputed waterway could easily get within range of the Chinese islands’ missile system.

“So that’s the threat that exists that’s why it’s so concerning for the militarization of these islands” he said. “They threaten all nations who operate in the vicinity and all the international sea and airspace.”

China sought to shore up its vast territorial claims over virtually the entire South China Sea by building island bases on coral atolls nearly a decade ago. The U.S. responded by sending its warships through the region in what it calls freedom of operation missions. The United States has no claims itself but has deployed Navy ships and aircraft for decades to patrol and promote free navigation in international waterway and airspace.

China routinely objects to any action by the U.S. military in the region. The other parties — the Philippines Vietnam Malaysia Taiwan and Brunei — claim all or part of the sea through which approximately $5 trillion in goods are shipped every year.

Despite China’s aggression the long-simmering territorial conflicts should only be resolved peacefully Aquilino said and cited the Philippine government’s successful move to bring its disputes with China to international arbitration in 2013 as a good template.

A U.N.-backed arbitration tribunal that handled the case invalidated China’s sweeping historical claims in the South China Sea under the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea. Beijing dismissed the ruling as sham and continues to defy it.

Washington’s main objective in the disputed region is “to prevent war” through deterrence and promote peace and stability including by engaging American allies and partners in projects with that objective Aquilino said.

“Should deterrence fail my second mission is to be prepared to fight and win” said Aquilino who leads the largest U.S. combatant command with 380000 military and civilian personnel covering 36 nations and territories.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMTkvY2xpbWF0ZS9lbmVyZ3ktdHJhbnNpdGlvbi1jbGltYXRlLWNoYW5nZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,There's a Messaging Battle Right Now Over America's Energy Future (Published 2022),"Climate scientists oil executives progressives and conservatives all agree on one thing these days: The energy transition is upon us.

AMT,American Tower,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXpvZXJlcG9ydC5jb20vYmVhdXR5L2ZlbWFsZS1iZWF1dHktZm91bmRlcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Three Female Beauty Founders Open Up About Their Journeys To Success,"When you think about the last year in beauty what comes to mind? Maybe it’s EDM-soundtracked hair tutorials on TikTok rave reviews of new skin care products on Instagram Reels or your best friend sending the group chat photos of their new makeup/skin care hybrid find. 2021 was full of notable beauty moments and trends three of the biggest ones coming directly from female beauty founders. There were a few overarching themes that ran deeper or hit harder than the rest namely like the “skin care-ification” of hair a return to natural “no makeup makeup” and complexion-specific skin care. Hair care brand Ceremonia skin care brand Topicals and makeup brand Tower 28 were among the names that led the charge in these industry-shifting trends. And the founders behind these brands are as much a force to be reckoned with as the brands themselves.

Women make up the vast majority of purchasing power in America and that number only goes up when talking beauty specifically — 97% of American women report buying multiple hair products per year for example. Despite that statistic only a sliver of beauty brands are actually led by women. A WWD deep-dive illustrates that among the top 20 beauty manufacturers just three are led by women. For women of color who make up an even larger share of that beauty industry buying power the number is zero. But with every seemingly-insurmountable situation comes those visionary disruptors ready to do just that — change the very face of the $511 billion beauty industry themselves.

To celebrate the female minds who along with their best-selling brands lead the year in hair makeup and skin care TZR spoke to three of the biggest boldest names in beauty right now for a reflection on their journey to success the year past and what’s to come in the industry.

Babba C. Rivera Founder of Ceremonia

A star-studded professional résumé filled with companies including Uber and Away is impressive but possibly even more impressive is Rivera’s ability to embody the proverbial high-fashion It-girl the creative/analytical entrepreneur and the doting mother. Rivera who’s always made advocating for fellow Latinas a top priority identified a glaring gap in the beauty marketplace. “For the longest time this category has been dominated by celebrities fronting big-box beauty and red carpet hairstylists creating their own brands” Rivera explains to TZR. “But what’s interesting is that the industry has been heavily focused on styling versus care...Ceremonia was born out of the desire to bring back the care aspect to hair while celebrating the richness of the Latinx culture.” For Rivera that representation and celebration was and is so crucial to the brand’s ethos — she considers a one-year anniversary campaign celebrating the diversity of the Latinx community one of her proudest moments.

There’s been a lot of buzz surrounding the “skin care-ification” of hair but it’s not just marketing jargon cajoling people into buying hair serums. As Rivera rightly points out there’s been a significant ingredient-focused pivot among beauty consumers. This can probably be traced back to increased accessibility to information about formulas and materials as well as social media at large. But knowing what goes into your beauty products has become a significant factor for buyers in every beauty industry category — and that’s where Ceremonia’s thoughtful health-first formulations and transparent ingredients lists shines.

Couple the rise of the conscious consumer with a pandemic-forced pivot toward embracing natural hair color textures and types and it’s no wonder Ceremonia’s popularity soared. “At Ceremonia these are two core pillars of what we do” Rivera says. “We practice hair wellness with all of our formulas and have a strong emphasis on products that not only make your hair nice for the day but that also have nutrients to help improve your overall hair quality over time. This strategy plays into our larger mission of empowering consumers to re-fall in love with their natural hair and embrace what they have instead of trying to change who they are.”

Rivera is all too familiar with the unique challenges that come with womanhood but she’s flipping it on its head. “There’s no getting away from this identity” she says point-blank ticking off comparatively paltry fundraising numbers and unconscious biases as just some of many hurdles female founders need to clear just to compete. “I find an enormous sense of purpose in questioning the status quo and redefining what it means to be a woman today” Rivera says. “Fundraising for my own business while highly pregnant launching Ceremonia while having my baby at the NICU and now growing my company with a toddler and a second one on the way has given me a lot of encouragement to showcase not only for myself [but for] my team and the rest of the world that women shouldn't need to choose between family or career.”

Olamide Olowe Founder of Topicals

Olamide Olowe might be barely old enough to rent a car but she managed to blow the doors off the notoriously exclusive skin care industry with a keen eye for business and a deep-seated sense of purpose. Like so many Black women Olowe often found herself not only unrepresented within the beauty-sphere but unconsidered too. “I grew up with skin conditions and never saw people of color be centered in the research and branding of ointment brands” Olowe tells TZR explaining how she got the idea to start Topicals. Her brand is an instantly recognizable one — you’ve almost certainly seen the cheerily colorful aluminum tubes of Faded a signature product scattered across the artfully messy bathroom counters of Instagram’s coolest content creators. But while cool seems inextricable from Olowe’s DNA her goal for Topicals reaches far beyond aesthetics.

“Topicals mission is to transform the way people feel about skin through effective science-backed products and mental health advocacy” she says. “Our mission continues to evolve to meet the needs of our community.” It’s a mission that’s clearly resonated with the Topicals audience resulting in the brand completely selling out at Sephora within its first 48 hours of arrival — that was when “I had my first realization that we made it.” So promising is that ethos that in 2020 Olowe became the youngest Black woman to raise $2 million in funding an investment her backers must be still thrilled with considering the brand’s importance to Gen Z and Millennials. Much of the brand’s success can be attributed to Olowe’s insistence on only formulating products with the most well-researched science-backed ingredients possible but a relatively new philosophy that doesn’t make some unattainable idea of “perfect skin” — or glass skin or glazed donut skin or poreless skin — the goal.

Olowe and the Topicals team know that so-called perfect skin doesn’t exist. “The journey to healthy skin is more important than the destination of clear skin” she says. “Everyone is always looking for that one product that will solve all of their problems when in reality our genetic composition is so different that not everything will work for everyone.” A far cry from the “miracle cure” marketing approach to skin care it’s no wonder why young people in particular flock to Topicals.

Because she hasn’t always felt represented in the beauty community Olowe’s committed to putting that inclusivity and celebration of identity at the forefront of her business. “I try to take an intersectional approach to create our products campaigns and company culture” she explains and it’s clear from even a cursory scroll through Topicals’ social media that Olowe thoroughly succeeds. As for the year ahead things are looking bright. “We’re looking forward to transforming the way people feel about their skin and ultimately themselves through storytelling and fun” she promises. Millions of beauty fans can’t wait.

Amy Liu Founder of Tower 28

Amy Liu has been entrenched in the industry for nearly two decades now and has seen plenty of makeup trends and brands come and go. “But as someone with a history of eczema-prone skin” she tells TZR “I couldn’t even enjoy the best part of working in beauty: trying out all the latest products! Even the clean alternatives were either triggering for my sensitive skin totally unaffordable or too clinical and lacked any fun.” Her own journey for the perfect products gave her an idea — why not just make her own? Upon Tower 28’s 2019 launch the brand became the first and only makeup line to completely and entirely follow the National Eczema Association guidelines making them officially free of all potentially irritating ingredients. But it’s more than just clean safe gentle products that make up the Tower 28 ethos. “Growing up Asian-American in L.A. I didn’t see myself reflected in pop culture nevertheless beach culture” Liu explains. “I’ve lived on the westside of L.A. my entire adult life and I love that the beach is a place where everyone gets to enjoy a healthy lifestyle. “My mission in launching Tower 28 was to create an approachable beauty company inclusive of all skin tones skin types budgets and beauty philosophies and inspired by the diverse and healthy L.A. lifestyle I love.”

Based on the runaway success of the brand it seems like Liu’s inclusive approach resounds with entire generations. Tower 28’s enjoyed plenty of word-of-mouth virality especially on peer-to-peer platforms like TikTok thanks to the sustainable packing irritation-free formulations and the lush colorful products themselves. Just as skin and hair care have seen a return to more natural-focused ideals so has makeup — scroll back through any beauty influencer’s grid to see the evolution in almost-real time. Even the most elaborate makeup trends of the day — like the Euphoria look that’s so enraptured Gen Z in particular — intentionally don’t try to cover up every dot blemish or scar. That physical vulnerability seems to be a reflection of the emotional vulnerability encouraged in part by legitimately conscious brands like Tower 28. “Internally we talk a lot about our tagline #ItsOkayToBeSensitive and it’s a throughline for both product development and 2021 in general” Liu explains. “Whether it’s our team or customers people in general are going through a lot whether that manifests itself in your skin or mental health. At Tower 28 we try to be mindful of both and try to be a little corner of the beauty industry (and social media) that people can count on as their safe space.”

As a mother to three children Liu says she likes to take that maternal lens and turn it towards her brand — she even jokes that Tower 28 is her fourth baby and it’s an apt comparison. “I am trying to raise all my babies with strong values and a commitment to community” Liu explains and those values come through in everything she says about the brand from its day-to-day work models to the flexibility she grants her employees — as a beauty industry vet she knows too well how all-consuming the work can be. While 2021 was a massive year for the brand it wasn’t without its challenges. “We’ve also dealt with Asian hate and global supply chain issues” she shares along with lingering effects of the pandemic. “Ultimately it’s made our company and supportive community stronger and tested our ability to be agile as a brand” she says. “We were overwhelmed by the amount of support we have received from customers creators industry leaders and brands who believe in us and share our same values. We are so glad to see people vote with their wallets and realize their power to make change as consumers.”",,,,,,,,,,,,
AWK,American Water Works,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZmVybi5vcmcvYWdfaW5zaWRlci9yZXBvcnQtYWdyaWN1bHR1cmUtcnVub2ZmLWlzLWxlYWRpbmctY2F1c2Utb2Ytd2F0ZXItcG9sbHV0aW9uLWluLXRoZS11LXMv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVmZXJuLm9yZy9hZ19pbnNpZGVyL3JlcG9ydC1hZ3JpY3VsdHVyZS1ydW5vZmYtaXMtbGVhZGluZy1jYXVzZS1vZi13YXRlci1wb2xsdXRpb24taW4tdGhlLXUtcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Report: agriculture runoff is leading cause of water pollution in the U.S.,"Last week water experts marked the 50th anniversary of the Clean Water Act with a dire warning: After evaluating over 700000 miles of rivers and streams across the country they concluded that half of those waters are too polluted to fish or swim in—and agriculture is often to blame.

“This is difficult politically but we have to confront the fact that agricultural runoff is really the leading cause of water pollution in the U.S. today” said Eric Schaeffer executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project (EPI) an environmental watchdog founded by former EPA enforcement attorneys at an online press conference Thursday. He added that the failure to confront agriculture “is probably the biggest program failure in the Clean Water Act.”

The EPI report portrays an agricultural industry that has polluted water and evaded accountability for the better part of half a century. Pollution sources include fertilizer runoff from cropland and manure runoff from factory farms fouling waterways with pesticides phosphorus nitrogen and fecal bacteria. In Indiana e.Coli bacteria was found in 73 percent of assessed waterways and harmful algal blooms are on the rise. In Delaware meat plant wastewater is awash with fecal bacteria. That water is then sprayed onto cornfields as fertilizer and from there it seeps into the water table contaminating some homeowners’ drinking water.

Schaeffer stressed that U.S. water quality has actually dramatically improved under the Clean Water Act. “You have to be as old as I am to understand how bad it was before” he said. The problem he says is that the agricultural industry is largely exempt from it and that loophole needs to be closed.

“Farms raise animals under contract to a handful of very large corporations [and] we need to make those corporations responsible for the problem” he said. “We still have a ways to go.”

Agribusiness’ pollution problem can be traced back to the Clean Water Act itself. Passed in 1972 in the aftermath of the Cuyahoga River fire and other industrial disasters the legislation is focused on pollution from factories and sewage plants. It includes enforceable regulations for specific identifiable sources of pollution like discharge pipes that dump sewage into waterways. But agricultural runoff often can’t be traced to a single pipe or source and these non-specific sources of pollution—the EPA calls them “nonpoint” sources—are thinly regulated by the Clean Water Act.

EPI describes the regulations for farm runoff as “weak to nonexistent.” And factory farming—and its pollutants—has only become more prevalent in the decades since the law was passed.

The Clean Water Act requires the EPA to periodically review and update certain industry-specific water pollution standards but EPI’s report found that two thirds of the agency’s industry-specific water pollution standards haven’t been updated in over 30 years. The agency also struggles to enforce some of the regulations that do involve agricultural operations including Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs)—detailed cleanup plans that state branches of the EPA are required to develop to address polluted waterways. Because “nonpoint” sources of pollution are so thinly regulated TMDLs rely on voluntary efforts which means many of the plans are effectively toothless.

The law promised that all waters would be “fishable and swimmable” by 1983. But EPI found that half of the river and stream miles 55 percent of the lake acres and 25 percent of the bays and estuaries they evaluated were “impaired”—which means they cannot be safely used for swimming fishing drinking water or other public uses. The report notes that its analysis relied on EPA reports which means its dataset is incomplete: the EPA hasn’t assessed many waterways in years.

At the press conference EPI personnel were frank about how challenging it is to effectively regulate the agricultural industry. “I have to say the Farm Bureau makes the coal lobby and the oil lobby look like the Little Sisters of Mercy” said Schaeffer. “The politics are very tough. They are quick to deploy pastoral images of the family farmer even though we’re talking really about a very industrialized system.”

Schaeffer and other water experts also touched on Sackett vs. EPA a pending Supreme Court case that could further limit the Clean Water Act by narrowing the kinds of waterways it applies to. At issue is the controversial Waters of the United States rule issued by the EPA in 2015 during the Obama administration which defined the upstream reach of federal clean-water laws. The American Farm Bureau Federation was in the forefront of challenging WOTUS as the rule was known as a power grab.

Nonetheless EPI has sent several letters to the EPA urging it to make “across the board changes” including updating its industry-specific water pollution standards. The organization is also pushing for Congress to close the loophole for “nonpoint” source pollution and Schaeffer expects the EPA to issue a memo related to nutrient pollution “some time very soon.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vcnRoY2Fyb2xpbmFoZWFsdGhuZXdzLm9yZy8yMDIyLzAzLzE5L3BmYXMtZm91bmQtaW4tY3VtYmVybGFuZC1jb3VudHktd2VsbHMtMjUtbWlsZXMtZnJvbS1jaGVtb3Vycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PFAS chemicals found in wells 25 miles from Chemours - NC Health News,"By Greg Barnes

CityView Today

John Sweitzer lives in a comfortable home surrounded by towering pines and more than two acres of privacy in northeastern Cumberland County a world away – he thought – from the contamination caused by the Chemours Fayetteville Works plant.

But in early January a brother-in-law who lives next door decided to have his well tested. The results came back positive for a potentially carcinogenic per-and polyfluoroalkyl substance known in the chemical world as PMPA.

State environmental regulators believe there is only one place the so-called forever chemical could have come from – Chemours – which is about 25 miles from Sweitzer’s home between the towns of Wade and Falcon.

That’s a whopping seven miles farther from the chemical plant than the previously known border of the contamination which had been off Baywood Road between Vander and Eastover.

Since mid-February more than 6200 private wells in Cumberland Robeson and Sampson counties have been found to contain GenX PMPA and other forever chemicals collectively known as PFAS.

How the contamination got here

After his brother-in-law received his test results Sweitzer decided to have his own well tested. He called a number that connected him with a third-party testing outfit contracted by Chemours.

Sweitzer said his test results came back last week showing his well contained PMPA at 300 parts per trillion – five times higher than what was found in his brother-in-law’s well. Several of Sweitzer’s neighbors have had their wells tested and “a few” have come back positive said Lisa Randall a Chemours spokeswoman.

The Environmental Working Group a national nonprofit organization based in Washington says “PMPA and other perfluorinated chemicals can cause serious health effects including cancer endocrine disruption accelerated puberty liver and immune system damage and thyroid changes.”

But Jamie DeWitt a toxicologist at East Carolina University and a national leader in PFAS research said it’s too early to say what effects PMPA has on humans. Research is continuing she said.

Detlef Knappe a researcher at N.C. State University whose team found GenX in the Cape Fear River in 2016 called PMPA a “byproduct that forms from air emissions associated with Chemours’ vinyl ether process.” That process is used to make the building blocks for fluoropolymers Knappe said.

Fluoropolymers are a family of plastic resins. Their many uses include wire coatings because of their unmatched ability to resist temperatures. DuPont had been using its vinyl ether process at the Fayetteville Works plant since at least the early 1980s. Chemours spun off from DuPont in 2015.

Until recently DuPont and later Chemours were releasing GenX PMPA and many other PFAS through their vent stacks. The chemicals drifted with the wind and fell with the rain eventually soaking into the soil and the groundwater miles from the plant.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency does not regulate PFAS though it is expected this spring to make a health advisory level for GenX one of the more prevalent compounds in the Cape River River basin. The EPA’s advisory is expected to be set vastly lower than the 140 parts per trillion used in North Carolina. That could trigger Chemours to have to provide replacement water or filtration systems to scores of additional private well owners in the basin.

Sweitzer warns his neighbors

Because of Sweitzer and his brother-in-law it is now known that the PFAS from Chemours drifted at least 25 miles from the plant. The air emissions have all but stopped now after Chemours spent $100 million on a thermal oxidizer that began operating in early 2020. The company says the new equipment destroys 99.9 percent of the plant’s PFAS air emissions.

But that provides little comfort to Sweitzer and the thousands of others whose wells have been contaminated. Sweitzer is determined to get people to have their wells tested.

While learning that his well tested positive Sweitzer said a Chemours representative delivered bottled water to his home. Sweitzer said the representative also gave him printed information that he took to his neighbors.

“I got some of those door hangers from that cat today and took them straight across from me across the field” Sweitzer said. “There’s three houses back there and I went to talk to them. They had no idea.”

Those are just three of the hundreds of homes on well water in that seven-mile gap between Sweitzer’s home and the previously known border of the contamination.

A “good neighbor” would warn residents

Under a 2019 consent order filed against Chemours by the Department of Environmental Quality and Cape Fear River Watch Chemours has to test out another quarter of a mile every time a well is found to be contaminated. Among many other requirements the consent order also makes Chemours provide bottled water or filtration systems to homes with contaminated wells or to be hooked up to public water.

But the consent order doesn’t specify what obligation Chemours is under to timely notify people living in the seven-mile gap that their wells could be contaminated. Spokeswomen for the DEQ and Chemours cited only the requirements specified in the consent order that requires the company to test out a quarter of a mile whenever a contaminated well is found.

Randall the Chemours’ spokeswoman said the company follows procedures specified in a drinking water plan to notify residents and provide them information on how to get their wells tested.

Geoff Gisler a lawyer for the Southern Environmental Law Center and Dana Sargent head of Cape Fear River Watch said Chemours should notify residents in the entire contamination zone.

“Any good neighbor would of course let their neighbors know if it was possible their drinking water was toxic” Sargent said. “They should be informing everyone in the entire basin regardless of what is required under the consent order and actively reaching out to sample all public and private wells and providing clean drinking water while the samples are being analyzed; that’s the least any good neighbor would do.”

The order requires Chemours to provide replacement drinking water to people with affected wells within six months from the time the company becomes aware that a well has been contaminated. The company typically has provided free bottled water to people shortly after their test results come back positive.

Sweitzer said Chemours responded promptly when the PMPA was found in his well. He said the company quickly provided him with bottled water and a credit card with a $225 limit.

Sweitzer said he was also offered the opportunity to hook into a public water line that runs along his street. He said he will have to pay a $2400 tap fee and pay to extend part of the line to his home because it sits well away from the public water main. He said he may have to replace his water heater because contamination could have gotten trapped inside of it. He will also have to pay a monthly water bill.

Sweitzer has lived in his home for 20 years. He said he and his wife have no known health effects from the water which they did not use for drinking but an outside dog died mysteriously.

“Luckily I’m not destitute” Sweitzer said adding that he wonders what poor people with the same problems are left to do.

Many of the people in Sweitzer’s predicament have joined class-action lawsuits against Chemours.

Another recently discovered contamination area

Previous to the discovery of contamination in Sweitzer’s well the farthest known well contamination was believed to be in an area off Pleasant View Road between Rock Hill Road and Baywood Road and in the Bayfield subdivision off Baywood Road. The areas are basically side by side between Eastover and Vander.

Tal Baggett head of the Eastover Sanitary District said 338 homes in those areas could benefit from public water lines. The problem he said is money. He estimated that it would cost $3 million to run the district’s water lines to the areas.

Baggett said he has talked to members of the county’s Board of Commissioners and was told that the county did not have enough American Rescue Plan money to help offset the costs. The county has designated $10 million in ARP money – and $10 million of its own – to fund a bulk water system for the Gray’s Creek area.

Cumberland County tried to get Chemours to pay at least some of the bulk water system’s costs. When those efforts failed the county retained an out-of-state law firm that specializes in contamination issues to fight Chemours. The water system is expected to cost at least $64 million.

The Eastover Sanitary District serves an area bordered by Murphy Dunn and Maxwell roads. Baggett estimates that hundreds of homes in that area don’t have public water either by choice or because of distance to main water lines. The district buys its water from Dunn in Harnett County.

The towns of Wade Godwin and Falcon have their own water systems Baggett said. Everyone else in the area gets water from the Eastover Sanitary District or has a private well.

“It’s just very expensive to get water lines in sparsely populated areas” Baggett said. “You’ve got to run a mile of line just to pick up a few houses. Nobody can do that and make any money doing it of course even to pay back a loan. You’ve got to have some help.”

But other than what is specified in the court order help from Chemours has not been forthcoming.

“Chemours certainly has to step up to the plate and be responsible” Baggett said.

Instead many residents in rural areas of the county continue to be saddled with contaminated well water including some who buy new houses not knowing that the problem even exists.

The Gray’s Creek area where the heaviest well contamination lies is exploding with new home construction.

Bulk water for Gray’s Creek

Last week the Gray’s Creek Committee of the Board of Commissioners received an update on a proposed bulk water agreement with the Fayetteville Public Works Commission. The news was not good. An engineering firm said it would require 3 million gallons of water a day for the system. The PWC has said it would cap out at 1.2 million gallons a day. Negotiations are continuing.

Meanwhile the state’s environmental regulators continue to lock horns with Chemours. On March 2 the DEQ directed Chemours to expand the scope and detail of its proposed interim sampling and drinking water plan for New Hanover Brunswick Columbus and Pender counties.

“The interim plan is insufficient and does not include the necessary steps to adequately determine the extent of Chemours’ contamination in the downstream communities” DEQ Secretary Elizabeth S. Biser said in a statement. “Chemours must contact residents directly sample more wells and proceed more quickly to address contaminated drinking water.”

Although much remains unknown about the health effects of PFAS the compounds are ubiquitous in everyday life. Multiple household products contain PFAS including microwave popcorn bags and other food packaging stain- and rain-resistant clothing cosmetics and dental floss. Some U.S. companies have begun to ban PFAS from products.

Studies have found a link between some types of PFAS and kidney prostate and testicular cancers low-birth weight and high cholesterol. PFAS are called forever chemicals because most of the more than 5000 compounds in the family of chemicals don’t break down easily.

People can call 910-678-1101 to ask that their wells be tested.

Tesla designs develops manufactures sells and leases electric vehicles (EVs). The company is also in energy generation storage systems and offers services related to its sustainable energy products. Some of its automotive products include four-door sedans – Model 3 and Model S – as well as sport utility vehicles (SUVs) Model Y and Model X.1

In its 2021 full year (FY21) financial results Tesla reported an 87% increase in deliveries of EVs which it believes speaks to the viability and profitability of these products. The company achieved the highest quarterly operating margin among all volume of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) which it said demonstrated that EVs can be more profitable than combustion engine vehicles.2

In the same financial year the group generated $5.5 billion in net income and $5 billion of free cash flow. This was after spending $6.5 billion to build out new factories and other capital projects. It’s ramped up production by increasing manufacturing capacity at its new factories in Austin in the US and Berlin in Germany. This is while also maximizing output of existing factories in Fremont in the US and Shanghai in China.2",,,,,,

Downtown Minneapolis and the areas around big corporate campuses such as 3M and Best Buy also will get a boost as more companies set plans for a hybrid schedule for workers.

In downtown St. Paul Wells Fargo workers started coming back last week as did the Travelers Companies' 2100 insurance workers in St. Paul. Securian Financial has set Tuesday for the start of its phased return while Ecolab corporate employees will return April 4.

Already the moves are leading to increasing activity on the streets said Joe Spencer president of St. Paul Downtown Alliance.

""Walking around downtown these days you can feel an anticipation and excitement brewing just under the surface"" Spencer wrote in an e-mail. He also pointed to recently opened bars and restaurants like Momento Lost Fox MetroNome Brewery and Hepcat Coffee.

Sunny skies plus the return-to-work announcements renewed St. Patrick's Day events the Minnesota boys high school hockey tournament — all are ""adding up to a feeling that's been missing for most of the last two years"" Spencer said.

The plummeting COVID-19 infection rates in recent weeks have led many Twin Cities employers to set in motion plans to add office days back into the mix.

Travelers is taking a ""flexible approach to work arrangements"" a spokeswoman said. ""This means that some employees have chosen to or have roles that require them to work from the office full time. While others have fully remote positions and some have chosen a hybrid arrangement.""

That's the approach most companies are taking although the details of hybrid plans differ.

3M reopened its headquarters campus in Maplewood last week and announced its ""Work Your Way"" model that lets most workers choose options.

While most lab and manufacturing employees have to work on-site 3M's U.S. office employees including the nearly 10000 in Minnesota were given a choice to return to the office said 3M spokesman Tim Post during a phone interview.

""Working from a 3M office will be another option for 3M's nonproduction employees as they find a schedule that best works for them"" Post said.

Best Buy's approach for most headquarters employees is more structured — three days in the office two at home or another location of their choice the company said. Some employees will be full time at the Richfield campus and other offices some will be fully remote.

Best Buy's new hybrid structure goes into effect the week of April 18.

Deluxe Corp. employees at the company's new downtown Minneapolis headquarters officially started hybrid work last week joining workers at employers such as the city of Minneapolis the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and Ameriprise Financial.

""We are definitely seeing an increase in workday activity especially in the middle of the week Tuesday through Thursday"" said Steve Cramer chief executive of Minneapolis Downtown Council.

CHICAGO (WLS) -- Sunday marks the beginning of spring and at Chicago's Navy Pier Saturday a major celebration marked that occasion -- the Hindu festival of Holi.

The festive event is part of the attraction's Global Connections series presented by ComEd.

Holi is joyful powder throwing in the colors of spring. A celebration of renewal growth and health.

The powder throwing was strictly an outside affair but under the dome of the Aon Ballroom the mayor diplomats and Chicagoans new and old reveled in the rituals of this centuries-old festival.

""It's a spring day. The city is reopening"" Mayor Lori Lightfoot said at the event.

""I am from Brazil so it is very important to see other cultures. It is happening all over the world and I think Chicago does a great job of bringing everybody"" said Alice Abreu a Colombia College student.

Dance is in Holi's DNA as little symbolizes better the triumph of good over evil led here by Bollywood Groove.

""I don't know how to describe it it's just something you have to get up and dance and feel it"" said fellow Colombia College student Ann Fernandez.

And everything is better with food.

""We are really starting to see people come indulge and be safe about it and that is the most exciting thing. I am excited to see us go back to being normal"" said Ali Dewjee with Bombay Eats.

Global Connections at Navy Pier has celebrated Chinese New Year and Carnivale as the pandemic has ebbed.

""We also want to make sure that all of the communities that make up this beautiful diverse group of our city are acknowledged get recognition through those international partnerships"" said Smita Shah chair of the New Delhi Committee and Chicago Sister Cities International board member with Navy Pier.

Chinedu Eze writes that these forces may keep domestic flights out of the airspace unless urgent action is taken to address the situation

The major challenge Nigeria is having now is how to tame the soaring prices of petroleum products especially the ones that are deregulated which include diesel and aviation fuel known as Jet A-1. To keep the price of petrol at the official rate of N165 per litre the federal government has to heavily subsidise it a decision that has burrowed holes in the finances of the government.

For aviation fuel and diesel their rising costs have given rise to panic because of their impact on the economy. What will happen if airlines stop operating as the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) has threatened to do? What if fuel trucks and articulated vehicles stopped moving essential goods and services from one part of the country to another? What if manufacturing companies and other businesses shut down their operation due to the high price of diesel which they use to power their generators?

There are key factors responsible for the high cost of aviation fuel. The major challenge is that aviation fuel along with other petroleum products are imported. So they yield to the undulating international market forces and pricing. The naira has significantly depreciated. Most importers are buying dollars at N600/$1 at the parallel market and that is outrageous. Now the price of crude oil has gone up in the international market the cost of the refined product has also risen so with such an increase and also the increase in the cost of ancillary services it is expected that the cost of the product would be high.

Middlemen

There are suggestions that a lot of profiteering is taking place in the import and distribution of aviation fuel hence the high cost of the product which is already deregulated. People import and sell at their prices. THISDAY investigation also revealed since the rapid increase in the cost of aviation fuel known oil marketers that sell the product to airlines like Sahara Energy Oando Conoil MRS and others have stopped stocking the product because they cannot buy but new companies have sprung up to sell the product.

This was confirmed by AON during the meeting the body held with National Assembly last week.

“Yesterday I travelled to Maiduguri I bought aviation fuel at N675 per litre. It was sold by another company; I didn’t even know their name. The major ones that we know and I have an account with them are Sahara Energy MRS Oando and Conoil. Those I have an account with. They said they don’t have fuel and then we see new companies coming in. For the last 10 years or so we have been paying for aviation fuel N180 N170 N140 per litre. But today we are paying N680 per litre” one of the operators stated at the meeting.

Difficulty in Product Sourcing

Also the Managing Director of Clean Serve Energy Limited Chris Ndulue explained the challenge the aviation fuel marketers are facing.

“There are three basic things: the cost of crude oil in the international market and the price of the dollar. We have failed to refine fuel locally so we have to import. The price of crude oil has been rising and the price of the dollar has been rising. Supply of the product has been facing disruptions because there is war in Europe. There is scarcity because people have not been producing so the price is rising. We need to start producing refined product here” he said.

On the issue of middlemen he said that there were suppliers who were not selling directly to the airlines. They sell to the marketers who in turn sell to the airlines.

“But recently the Nigerian National Petroleum Cooperation (NNPC) intervened. They should start selling to marketers who directly sell to the airlines. In doing so the profit made by the middlemen will be abrogated so airlines can buy the product at a cheaper rate. But the major problem is that Nigeria is not refining the product. We have the raw material which is crude oil. If it becomes a locally manufactured product the price will go down. There is no justification for the shutting down of the refineries for 20 years” he said.

THISDAY findings show that airlines spend huge operating funds for the purchase of aviation fuel to operate two major aircraft types in use by Nigerian airlines which include Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 among others. While Boeing 737 consumes about 2 300 2 500 and 3409.57 litres of aviation fuel for one hour flight depending on the configuration Airbus A320-200 consumes about 3 125 litres of aviation fuel or 2500kg per hour.

AON said globally while fuel is about 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the cost of operation it is about 70 per cent in Nigeria.

Profiteering

Industry sources alleged the prevalence of fraudulent activities in the importation and distribution of petroleum products especially on the part of some highly placed public officers who use proxies to make fraudulent gains from the crisis.

In the interview he granted to national television last Sunday the former Senate President Dr Bukola Saraki expressed strong doubt that Nigeria is consuming up to 70 million litres of fuel daily as stated by NNPC and insisted that it won’t be more than 30 million litres daily. He strengthened his argument by observing that during the lockdown government officials said Nigeria was consuming about 50 million litres of fuel when most people were at home and the government allowed only essential movement.

In his verified Twitter handle the former governor of Kwara state further said “I want to address the cost of diesel and jet fuel at the moment. We have seen prices of diesel and prices of airfare go up as well. This has impacted the cost of food and transportation. I want to ask a question. Why has the cost of diesel and fuel gone up from N300 to almost N900 and the cost of jet fuel also has doubled when those products must have clearly been ordered paid for and shipped before this Ukraine war started?”

During a meeting between members of the House of Representatives officials of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and AON last Monday the Deputy Speaker Hon. Ahmed Idris Wase wanted to know the cost of the imported aviation fuel per litre but he did not get any response from the NNPC officials.

Speaking on behalf of AON the Chairman and CEO of Air Peace who is also the Vice President of AON said “I have the mandate of every airline in this country to announce that if they (NNPC) cannot come down from their rooftops we have only three more days to be able to fly. We are not threatening this country because we have been subsiding on what we are doing. The rate as of today (Monday 14 2022) is between N630 and N640.

“We have an aircraft going to Kano and that one has about 7000 litres of fuel on it. If you multiply it by N630 the unit cost per seat already is about N70 000 per seat. We have not talked about very static insurance. All the insurance companies in Nigeria put together cannot even insure one aircraft so you have to go abroad to insure and they slam us with heavy premiums. What Nigerian airlines use in insuring one plane is what the legacy airlines use in insuring three planes so domestic airlines are dead on arrival.

“Yet the fuel cost which was supposed to be about 30 to 40 per cent of operating costs in every clime in the world is about 70 per cent in Nigeria even before now. So you can now see the mortality rate of airlines in this country. They have refused to answer the question. Whether you got money from CBN or from the black market how much is the unit cost of your acquisition (fuel import) so that we would know if the airlines are cheating you or you are cheating the airlines or if you formed a cartel to increase your prices overnight.

“From what is happening if we continue this way the least ticket anyone would expect from airlines would be N120 000 for the economy and we don’t want to do that because it would not help the ordinary man. I have the mandate of the AON to demand that we should be given a license to import fuel. If we can buy jets that cost millions of dollars we can also afford to import fuel. NNPC should give us the right to import fuel and we won’t complain” Onyema said.

Expectations

Managing Director of Flights and Logistics Solutions Limited Amos Akpan said that to ensure uninterrupted supply and good pricing of aviation fuel the Nigerian government refine its product improve its forex earning capacity reduce the channels of distribution by piping into dumps and use rail for long-distance deliveries into depots.

“Government and its agencies should supply fuel to airlines take voucher of fuel supplied to the banks then banks should pay the supplier to stop cash payment.

“AON should keep the pressure on the government and maintain the current status of bringing information to the public daily on the issue. This helps their image. Those that are following cannot accuse them of taking advantage of the situation to profiteer” Akpan said.",,,,,,,,,

By Jonathan Stempel

(Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors have charged a former Apple Inc employee with defrauding the iPhone maker out of more than $10 million in a series of schemes.

Dhirendra Prasad faces five criminal counts after exploiting his ""position of trust"" as a buyer in Apple's global service supply chain to defraud the company according to filings on Friday with the federal court in San Jose California.

Prosecutors said that as an Apple buyer Prasad negotiated with vendors and placed orders with Apple making payments based on invoice amounts he entered into its purchasing system.

Prasad allegedly defrauded Apple by taking kickbacks stealing parts using false repair orders and causing Apple to pay for items and services it never received

Prosecutors said Prasad also evaded taxes on and laundered proceeds from his schemes. Apple fired him in December 2018 after a decade of employment court papers show.

It is unclear whether Prasad has a lawyer. Prasad could not immediately be reached on Sunday for comment. A phone number listed for him has been disconnected.

Two owners of vendors that did business with Apple and who allegedly conspired with Prasad on similar fraud schemes pleaded guilty to related charges in December court records show.

Prasad faces charges including conspiring to commit wire and mail fraud commit money laundering and defraud the United States as well as tax evasion.

His arraignment is scheduled for March 24. Prosecutors also want Prasad to forfeit millions of dollars of real property and other assets.

So in 1985 Jobs used his ambition – and $12 million of his own money – to launch NeXT a company Jobs started in order to build computers for colleges and researchers. And this week a piece of history from that period in the tech icon's career hit the auction block.

In 1989 one year after NeXT released its first computer Jobs extended what he deemed to be an ""insanely great"" job offer to David Nagy who was working as a product manager at Apple at the time. Jobs offered Nagy a salary of $80000 per year paid monthly in advance to join him at NeXT. According to the offer letter obtained by RR Auction the role – which didn't have an actual title – also came with a $5000 signing bonus options to purchase 5000 share of NeXT common stock and coverage under the company's employee healthcare plan.

Jobs' letter ends with a bit of cheeky confidence in the form of an enthusiastic sentence – ""I accept this insanely great offer!!!"" – above a blank space where Nagy was meant to sign his name. However Jobs was not actually able to poach Nagy who ended up staying at Apple until 1993.

RR Auction's website currently lists the letter's lot as ""closed"" but the auction house has not yet announced if the letter sold. The letter's estimated value is over $30000 according to RR Auction.

Prior to extending an offer to Nagy NeXT was trying to pivot. Their original $10000 computer wasn't marketable to its intended audience of educators and scientists. Jobs wanted to bring on Nagy to ""develop product strategies and plans third party partnerships and marketing programs"" just as he was doing at Apple according to a provenance letter Nagy wrote and submitted to RR Auction.

Nagy added that while he knew NeXT was struggling to get off the ground he still regrets turning down the job.

""The offer was very unusual in that there was no job title department or specific areas of responsibility"" Nagy wrote in the letter. ""I loved my job at Apple and didn't think NeXT would be successful but in retrospect obviously should have taken the opportunity.""

In 1997 Apple bought NeXT – which ultimately became known for its computer software – for $429 million and rehired Jobs.

For what it's worth the $80000 salary Jobs was offering would be worth nearly $180000 today according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But given the lack of a job title and Jobs' abrasive leadership style it's also possible that the offer wasn't quite as fantastic as advertised.

Guy Kawasaki who worked for Apple throughout the 1980s and 90s said working for Jobs ""was sometimes unpleasant and always scary.""

""In the Macintosh Division you had to prove yourself every day or jobs got rid of you"" Kawasaki wrote in a contributing article for CNBC Make It. ""He demanded excellence and kept you at the top of your game… but it drove many of us to do the finest work of our careers.""

The brand promise can cultivate trust between a business and its customers as it guides customer interactions. Stakeholders can also use the brand promise to manage their expectations of the business

A brand promise is not a public statement. Companies use tag lines or slogans to frame a brand’s offerings or inject something exciting and noteworthy. A tag line is by definition a public statement that appears to the customer as many times as possible. Because the brand promise is not a public statement it should not be communicated to the customer or the external public. Let us be clear here it is not some deep dark secret. It would be fine if it got out into the public consciousness. It is not designed for public consumption. It is only to align people’s efforts within the organisation. In short it is like an internal compass that guides the activities of the people within the organization. Simply put it influences what comes from inside to the outside. That way members of the organisation will act and engage in specific ways and manners known and understood by insiders but received by outsiders and taken as the style or philosophy of the organisation.

Let us consider the promises of some brands and see if these are reflected in their services and engagements.

Virgin Atlantic: To be genuine fun contemporary and different in everything we do at a reasonable price

Virgin’s promise goes a lot farther than seating passengers in airplanes

Coca Cola: To refresh the world in mind body and spirit and inspire moments of optimism; to create value and make a difference

Coca-Cola’s brand promise takes a bit of a different route. It does not mention the product or service but instead aims to convey a mindset held by all of those that are a part of the company. With a brand promise like this Coca-Cola positions itself as a lifestyle brand that is about much more than just manufacturing popular drinks.

Apple: Think Different

Apple’s brand promise is arguably the most famous slogan of all time and the key to Apple’s wild success in the computer industry. Apple’s brand promise is two-sided–their guarantee to create products based on seeing the world a little differently and their promise to inspire their customers to do the same.

BMW: The Ultimate Driving Machine

This bold statement is the driving force behind BMW’s brand. They aim to produce only the most efficient and elegant vehicles and their brand promise states this with confidence.

It is important to state clearly that a brand promise is different from a brand’s tag-line. While a brand promise is for internal use a tag-line is for the external public especially customers. It accompanies all brand publicity and promotions particularly commercials.

Developing a tag- line for a brand is not an easy task. The process might take copywriters and brand managers months and over a thousand iterations to be tight enough to speak to consumers in only a few words. You do not need to go to all that effort with a brand promise. A brand promise is talking to employees investors and partners. These people have already bought into the brand; they need to know what to do to further it. Any material designed for these people is going to be worded entirely differently than a tag-line.

A brand promise and a value proposition are similar. Both are one or a few lines on why a consumer would choose the brand over its competition. But a value proposition focuses on product features where a brand promise speaks to the long-term meaning of a brand. Features may change but the promise endures. A value proposition is on a shorter time horizon than a brand promise.

Read also: Connecting vision mission strategy brand and culture

A value proposition is a useful exercise to go through. Look at your brand’s offerings versus other brands consumers might choose. What are the product features that make your brand the clear choice? Does the market value these features? Are these features strategically defensible? In other words what is stopping the competition from adopting these features if the product is successful?

The value proposition should be a stepping stone on the road to the brand promise. If Swedish car maker Volvo’s brand promise is to provide a safe car suitable to protect the driver’s loved ones then the safety features of its vehicles cannot be compromised and are necessary to establish the brand promise credibly. The value proposition that established Volvo’s reputation of safety was the three-point seatbelt. The seatbelt that is now standard in every car was first offered in the Volvo PV 544 in 1959. Nowadays Volvo needs to be first to provide new features to protect its legacy of safety.

Last line

A brand promise is that unique promise of value you make to your target market that your brand will fulfill. It is the essence of what you have to offer and guides you in how your brand will engage. It clarifies and communicates what makes your brand special–what makes you different from other brands. Crafting this promise requires understanding your values interests strengths and personal qualities and using them to distinguish your brand",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYXBwbGUtZm9ybWVyLWVtcGxveWVlLWZyYXVkLW1vbmV5LWxhdW5kZXJpbmctdGF4LWV2YXNpb24tMTAtbWlsbGlvbi0yMDIyLTPSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2FwcGxlLWZvcm1lci1lbXBsb3llZS1mcmF1ZC1tb25leS1sYXVuZGVyaW5nLXRheC1ldmFzaW9uLTEwLW1pbGxpb24tMjAyMi0zP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Apple employee charged with defrauding company out of $10M,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='businessinsider.mx', port=443): Read timed out.

Roula Khalaf Editor of the FT selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

Martin Murray wanted to disrupt the global beverage industry with Waterdrop the company he established in 2015.

“The way [the industry] is structured is incredibly unsustainable” says the former Boston Consulting Group employee. “Putting sugar water into plastic bottles and shipping them around the planet — it’s not only a lot of plastic bottles but a lot of carbon dioxide emissions for transport. In an ideal world you don’t have to bottle anything any more.”

Waterdrop has yet to displace Coca-Cola or PepsiCo. But Murray’s creation — effervescent cubes with fruit and plant extracts that buyers drop into water — captured something of the zeitgeist.

By 2020 its revenues had reached €41mn while its compound annual growth rate from 2017 to 2020 was almost 300 per cent making Waterdrop the most rapidly expanding food and beverage group in the Financial Times’ latest ranking of Europe’s fastest-growing companies.

In January this year it raised €60mn of series B funding led by Singaporean fund Temasek.

With its so-called microdrinks the Vienna-based company has tapped into “the focus of an ageing population on healthier lifestyles combined with a focus on natural ingredients” says Mark Lynch founding partner at Oghma Partners a corporate finance boutique specialising in the consumer sector.

Similar forces have boosted London-based protein bar group Misfits Health and Italian organic foods exporter Blife which also feature on the ranking placed 99th and 516th respectively.

Some 20 food and drinks groups made the list several of them going the route of direct-to-consumer sales — a common mechanism for consumer start-ups to bypass retailers and expand through an efficient digital marketing operation.

German spices group AnkerKraut has combined retail sales with direct sales online. “The company has grown rapidly over the Covid period helped by a renewed focus on home cooking” says Lynch.

Gousto the UK-based meal kits business has taken a similar approach selling digital subscriptions to its boxes of ingredients and achieving the highest 2020 revenue — some €211mn — of all the food and beverage companies on the list.

Like Waterdrop Gousto sells itself on sustainability boasting that just 0.4 per cent of its food goes to waste against a rate of between 20 and 25 per cent for UK food sales as a whole most of which is accounted for by households but also by canteens restaurants and retailers.

“In the global food space the big big drivers have been convenience health and sustainability” says founder Timo Boldt.

Gousto became profitable in 2019 then underwent a quick-fire expansion in 2020 as the pandemic boosted sales.

“With Covid restrictions easing and consumers facing a cost of living squeeze we would expect growth rates to slow [at Gousto]” says Oghma’s Lynch.

“However the relative value convenience and provision of food inspiration will probably see the model continue to thrive.” One of Gousto’s selling points has been its comparatively low prices with its boxes starting at about £3 a serving.

Like Boldt Michal Borecki founder of Warsaw-based Wild Grass saw an opportunity to pitch a hitherto luxury product at the mass market. His company’s Chai Kola canned drinks are made with natural ingredients such as tea extracts.

“We were able to fill the gap in the market between those very popular corporate beverages like Coke and Pepsi and drinks that are quite alternative and very expensive that are available mainly in glass bottles and cost three times as much” he says.

The company was initially funded by Borecki and his girlfriend selling their apartments and by the couple’s drinks import-export business providing support.

He does not plan to seek external funding arguing — unlike many start-up founders — that “everything should be done slowly”.

Rising input costs however are a key challenge this year for Wild Grass and for other food and drinks companies. Even before the Russian invasion of Ukraine drove up prices for key food ingredients with wheat reaching record highs a surge in commodity prices had already prompted multinationals such as Unilever to predict a squeeze on margins.

Gousto has only once raised a product price — one box increased by 16p a serving this February — as it has instead sought to cut costs through efficiencies and economies of scale says Boldt.

Another challenge as for any fast-growing start-up is deciding whether and when to sell. Boldt says he currently has no plans to list or sell Gousto. Lynch reckons the biggest risk to the business “is probably from any acquirer that seeks to integrate the operation into their e-tailing operations which could risk derailing the magic ingredients”.

At Waterdrop Murray acknowledges that his business is “still a mosquito on the back of an elephant” of the global drinks business. The company which also sells reusable water bottles and bacteria-killing caps that measure customers’ hydration is aiming for €400mn of annual sales by 2025 partly by expanding from direct sales into conventional retail.

Murray says he would consider listing or finding a “strategic partner” in the future adding that his main goal is global expansion. “I want to be the brand that is associated with the term ‘Drink more water’.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vY2VuLmFjcy5vcmcvYnVzaW5lc3MvZWNvbm9teS9jYXNlLWRpcmVjdC1haXItY2FwdHVyZS8xMDAvaTEw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The case for direct air capture,"Credit: Climeworks

Direct air capture (DAC) sounds too good to be true. Humanity is threatened by an excess of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere so build a giant DAC machine that can remove it.

By the numbers ▸ 415 ppm 2022 Atmospheric CO 2 concentration in 2022 ▸ 280 ppm Atmospheric CO 2 concentration in 1850 ▸ 1080 Gta CO 2 added to the air since the start of the Industrial Revolution ▸ 36.3 Gt per year Ongoing global greenhouse gas emissions ▸ 1.3–29 Gt per year Estimated hard-to-abate greenhouse gas emissions ▸ 10000 t per year Estimated current direct-air-capture (DAC) capacity ▸ $300 to $400 per metric ton Cost of DAC credits for large corporate buyers Sources: CDR Primer South Pole Carbon Engineering Lux Research International Energy Agency. a gigatons equivalent to a billion metric tons.

And it can be done. Right now in Iceland a plant built by the DAC start-up Climeworks is pulling CO 2 out of the air at a rate of about 4000 metric tons (t) per year and pumping it deep underground. The CO 2 reacts with basalt rock there to form stable carbonate minerals. The plant named Orca runs on low-carbon geothermal electricity and waste heat so it is by all accounts a carbon-negative process.

But DAC is expensive and energy intensive. Critics of DAC say that other forms of carbon removal are cheaper and that reducing emissions in the first place will always be a better investment in the fight against climate change. So the question isn’t if DAC works; it’s if DAC makes economic sense. There’s a lot riding on the answer.

In an influential report in 2018 the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that humanity can keep global warming below 1.5 °C and dodge the worst consequences of climate change if we can reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

The strategies for getting there fall into two buckets: emission reduction and carbon removal. Emission reduction is anything that results in less CO 2 being released including point-source carbon capture improved energy efficiency electrification renewable energy regenerative agriculture and forest management and reengineering of industrial processes. Carbon removal is anything that pulls CO 2 out of the air including nature-based methods such as planting trees and technologies such as DAC.

Though the two approaches sometimes compete for investment and for buyers of the emissions-offset credits they create many experts say both will be needed. Marcius Extavour vice president for energy and climate at the XPrize Foundation says the IPCC report and its follow-ups lay out the need clearly. “If we want to avoid warming beyond 1.5 °C every scenario is going to require some kind of carbon removal in addition to reducing emissions immediately and as fast as possible.”

Even within the area of carbon removal DAC has competition from other methods most of which are lower cost. “In the nature-based solutions community they say ‘It’s a no-brainer. We’re the cheapest or the most abundant’ ” Extavour says. At the same time he adds many people in DAC “think direct air capture is the only thing that’s really scalable.”

Extavour is leading the Carbon Removal XPrize a competition that will award $100 million to groups developing DAC and other carbon removal methods. Eighty million of that will be split between up to four teams that demonstrate systems that remove 1000 t of CO 2 per year and present a clear techno-economic path to expanding to a megaton scale. On April 22 Earth Day XPrize will announce 15 contestants that will receive $1 million each in milestone funding to develop their concepts.

DAC has a lot in common with point-source carbon capture in which CO 2 is scrubbed from the flue gas of power plants or other industrial facilities. But the two address very different markets and needs according to Thomas McDonald the former CEO of Mosaic Materials. Mosaic has developed CO 2 sorbent materials based on metal-organic frameworks for both DAC and point-source carbon capture.

Applied to combustion power plants McDonald says point-source carbon capture can result in clean electricity that competes with renewable and nuclear power. It can also handle process emissions such as the CO 2 produced by yeast during ethanol fermentation or by refineries and chemical plants.

DAC comes into play to deal with CO 2 emissions that are unavoidable and can’t be captured with point-source methods such as those from aviation. It’s also necessary to remediate historical greenhouse gas emissions—the CO 2 the world has been spewing for the past 100-plus years.

Exactly what emissions can and can’t be avoided is the subject of some debate. “There’s going to be a fight across the economy for every sector to be considered hard to abate so they don’t have to change” says John Noël a senior climate campaigner at the environmental nonprofit Greenpeace.

The CDR Primer a digital textbook about carbon dioxide removal published in 2021 by a team from the University of Pennsylvania estimates truly hard-to-abate emissions at 1.5–3.1 gigatons (Gt) of CO 2 per year. That number assumes that the electricity and industrial sectors can be completely decarbonized. It thus includes only some shipping aviation and heating CO 2  along with emissions of nitrous oxide—a greenhouse gas more potent than CO 2 —from agriculture wastewater and landfills.

Other estimates classify some emissions from power and manufacturing as hard to abate including those from the chemical industry. They range from 5 to 29 Gt per year.

According to the International Energy Agency an intergovernmental organization 19 DAC plants including Orca currently operate for a total capacity of roughly 10000 t per year. Most are pilot-scale facilities built to develop the technology rather than to capture a meaningful amount of CO 2 ; several are not even net negative in carbon.

DAC companies are developing two basic business models: sequester the CO 2 underground and sell credits to companies looking to offset their emissions or sell the CO 2 to companies that can use it.

We want to remove our emissions today. And this means we must limit our investment in direct air capture where plants are still under construction. Mario Tuthorn marketing manager Thermo Fischer Scientific inorganic mass spectrometry group

The aviation industry is one hoped-for customer for CO 2 from DAC. Carbon dioxide can be combined with hydrogen to produce hydrocarbons such as kerosene-type jet fuel though that technology is also not yet at commercial scale.

“Direct air capture is an essential step to decarbonization in the sense that it should be in the longer term the only way to produce synthetic kerosene” says Matteo Mirolo sustainable aviation policy officer at the nonprofit Transport and Environment. Flying all European Union–originating flights on such “e-kerosene” would consume 365 million t of captured CO2 per year Mirolo says.

Climeworks is bullish on fuels derived from captured CO 2 . It’s part of a consortium called Norsk e-Fuel that recently announced plans for a plant in Norway that it expects to produce 25 million L of jet fuel per year from DAC CO 2 and renewable electricity.

But critics say better options will be available to decarbonize jet fuel too. Biomass-derived fuels can in principle be carbon negative if plants use waste biomass and are fitted with carbon capture. The biofuel company Gevo for example has aviation fuel partnerships with Archer Daniels Midland Chevron and Delta Air Lines. And Strategic Biofuels is working with regulators on an injection site in Louisiana for a jet fuel project consuming forestry waste.

Other DAC firms are racing to join Climeworks in having steel in the ground. Carbon Engineering is working with Oxy Low Carbon Ventures a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum on megaton-scale DAC plants in Norway and Texas. Carbon Engineering’s system uses a set of calcium-chemistry “loops” to isolate the CO 2 it catches using a potassium hydroxide solution.

The firm’s Norwegian plant will inject its CO 2 underneath the ocean floor. Oxy will use the Texas plant’s CO 2 to push more oil and gas out of depleted wells a practice called enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Global Thermostat with backing from ExxonMobil and the US Department of Energy is working on both EOR and ways to use captured CO 2 as a feedstock for fuels and plastics.

Greenpeace’s Noël calls using captured CO 2 to extract more oil a “joke” and warns that partnering with the oil and gas industry is a dangerous path. “It is a Trojan horse for these companies to maintain their access and influence over climate policy and design and implementation going forward at the state federal and global level” he says.

At the same time EOR operators are willing to pay some of the highest prices for CO 2  and DAC needs customers in order to grow.

Former Carbon Engineering CEO Steve Oldham who left the firm in January says EOR from DAC can be carbon neutral. But the firm is also looking at e-fuels and pure sequestration. “DAC is fundamentally a service” Oldham says. “You and I pay someone to take garbage away from our house. DAC is a model that makes sense for hard-to-decarbonize sectors.”

The market for removing carbon the way we remove the trash is gaining steam McDonald says. “There’s an incredible amount of demand that’s coming to purchase these and there’s actually not enough supply of high-quality additional verifiable credits.”

Despite that need DAC has struggled to catch on because of high prices and limited capacity.

Thermo Fisher Scientific’s experience is instructive. The company launched a line of carbon-neutral mass spectrometers in 2021 using carbon removal credits to offset the emissions created during the instruments’ life cycle. The firm’s inorganic mass spectrometry group calculated that 15 kg of CO 2 is emitted for every 1 kg of spectrometer delivered.

“Emission reduction is obviously the most important long-term goal for decarbonizing the economy” Mario Tuthorn marketing manager for the group said in a presentation on the program. But that’s hard to do in precision manufacturing where performance of the final device is very sensitive to material and design choices he added. “If we want to make a change today the most practical approach is to offset our emissions.”

If we want to avoid warming beyond 1.5 °C every scenario is going to require some kind of carbon removal in addition to reducing emissions immediately and as fast as possible. Marcius Extavour vice president for energy and climate XPrize Foundation

Avoided emissions such as those gained from planting or protecting trees were not good enough in the team’s analysis because they are hard to calculate and track. “Will the forest you paid to protect still be protected in 50 to 100 years’ time?” Tuthorn asked. “A much more rigorous offsetting approach is carbon dioxide removal.”

In a white paper the group detailed how it shopped for carbon removal credits. It emphasized permanent removal of CO 2 that would not have been removed other ways. Priority also went to technologies that have the potential to scale but need investment now to drive down costs.

Though Thermo Fisher sounds like the exact customer DAC firms are courting DAC won only 3%—which went to Carbon Engineering—of the program’s 2021 carbon removal spending. Instead 78% went to construction with sustainable timber and insulation with recycled paper. Biochar and bio-oil projects which heat plant matter to convert it to charcoal or pyrolysis oil that is then buried or injected into old wells shared 19%.

Though Tuthorn described DAC as the gold standard for carbon removal alongside biomass-based energy plants that sequester their CO 2 emissions he said it wasn’t ready and affordable yet. “We want to remove our emissions today” he said “and this means we must limit our investment in direct air capture where plants are still under construction.”

Price was also a concern. Thermo Fisher was willing to spend an average of $80 per metric ton of carbon removed more than most other initiatives want to spend. Market watchers estimate the current price of DAC offsets at about $400 per metric ton. At that price DAC could be only a small part of the pie. Over time Tuthorn said DAC will gain a bigger share of the credits the program buys.

DAC similarly won only a small chunk of Microsoft’s fiscal 2021 carbon removal credit purchases. The software giant bought 1400 t of removal credits from Climeworks 4000 t from biochar and bio-oil projects and 193000 t from soil carbon management. Most of its purchases—1.1 million t—were from forestry projects.

In 2022 Microsoft replaced DAC in its offset portfolio with a project to mineralize CO 2 in old concrete. The company paid an average of $19.40 per metric ton for its 2022 offsets.

Microsoft detailed the problem in its 2022 carbon offset white paper. “High-durability solutions are critical but supply is limited and expensive and many companies cannot yet afford them at scale” it says referring to biochar bio-oil mineralization and DAC. “We need expensive higher durability solutions to become more affordable.” Microsoft says it is both an offset credit customer of Climeworks and an investor in the firm through its Climate Innovation Fund.

“It’s great to have these customers” says Christoph Beuttler head of climate policy at Climeworks. But it’s a chicken-and-egg moment: for prices to come down DAC needs to scale up and to do that DAC needs customers buying carbon offsets. “We are a technology right? So we’re expensive now; we get cheap as—if—we scale up. We need the money now” Beuttler says.

He estimates that DAC needs $100 billion in R&D investment to reduce the price to a point where the technology can really compete.

In a 2021 paper in Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research Klaus Lackner and Habib Azarabadi of Arizona State University were more optimistic. They argue that DAC costs could fall with increased use as solar photovoltaic costs have; it might take only $200 million of carbon credit purchases to bring the cost of DAC down to $100 per metric ton (DOI: 10.1021/acs.iecr.0c04839).

“In just the chemistry there’s still a lot of potential that we can tap into” Beuttler says. “But obviously there’s also a lot to gain from economies of scale. The ones behind me are handmade in Switzerland” he says pointing to a photo of a Climeworks DAC module. That is “probably not the most cost-efficient way to produce them” he adds. “If we continue making them by hand it will remain a luxury product.”

Climeworks is planning to build a plant in 2024 that will be 10 times as large as Orca moving the firm in the right direction on both chemistry advances and economies of scale Beuttler says.

Nearly everyone working in DAC agrees that emission reduction is the low-hanging fruit in fighting climate change and should be harvested as quickly as possible. The importance of carbon removal will grow over time though and DAC may be the most scalable trackable and tradable way to cover the “last mile” of hard-to-abate and historical emissions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2U2Njk2ODVkLTFmNGYtNDJlNS05NmIwLTk2MDlhMzU5OTY1MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Milk prices rise as Ukraine war threatens cow feed and fertiliser supplies,Today's FT newspaper for easy reading on any device.

After her team pulled off a close win over Jackson State in the first round of the NCAA Tournament Mulkey's character was shining at the press conference.

A reporter asked for Mulkey's reaction to a video 'Kim Mulkey has got it coming' that circulated on social media before the matchup with Jackson State.

Mulkey laughed it off.

First she started by singing her own version of Jim Croce's 'You Don't Mess Around with Jim.'

""You don't tug on superman's cape. You don't spit in the wind. You don't pull the mask off that old lone ranger...and you don't mess around with Kim"" Mulkey sang.

But she figured that reference might be outdated for some of the reporters in the room.

The song came out in 1972.

So she sang ""Say my name say my name say my name"" before walking out of the room.

Say My Name was released in 1999.

Watch that moment in the press conference in the following video:

The Megababe founder and influencer is teaming with Amazon’s The Drop — the company’s fashion arm that offers limited-edition collections with celebrities influencers and brands — for an eight-piece spring fashion collection that is the most size-inclusive range ever carried on The Drop. Sizes for the apparel collection range from XXS to 5X.

More from WWD

“Amazon brings something really unique to the plus-size space” Sturino said. “First of all they offer plus-size clothing already and have for a while. They also have the ability to offer trendy affordable and fashionable items for plus-size women. I think that’s something unique and I’m excited to be a part of it.”

Sturino was inspired by the Milanese woman for the spring collection looking to bright reds yellows and pinks in an array of chic yet comfortable styles.

The collection includes pieces like a red jumpsuit a pink and red checkered caftan a casual red blazer and matching trousers a yellow and white caftan and other pieces.

“I wanted bright colors because I know that’s how I feel most confident and comfortable when I’m wearing something especially just a single tonal look” she said. “I wanted pieces that were going to allow women to style them with their wardrobe that they already have or they can buy the full look.”

Sturino explained the caftans are her favorite pieces from the collection as they’re a comfortable option to wear daily but that she also loves the separates like the red blazer and yellow trousers because they can be matched with other pieces in her wardrobe.

“Even though it may sound intimidating to wear a red jumpsuit the whole point of my platform is that everyone should have fun with fashion and express themselves” Sturino said. “This collection makes it easy for women of any size to do that.”

Sturino has become an influential player in the fashion industry over the years growing her social media following to roughly 683000 Instagram followers with her fashion series like #MakeMySize which encourages popular fashion brands to be more size inclusive and #SuperSizeTheLook where she recreates looks seen on celebrities models and influencers.

She also launched her beauty brand Megababe in 2017 to address body-discomfort issues that were rarely addressed in the beauty industry like thigh chafing or body sweat. The brand has since grown to offer other personal care products and is now sold at Target.

The Drop x Katie Sturino collection will be available to shop starting March 22 on Amazon’s The Drop website. All pieces retail for under $100.

That same day see here I asked if this would be the start of a Bear market crash. My Elliott Wave Principle (EWP) and technical analysis (TA) based answer was “Not so fast” as I concluded “With today’s low at SPX4115 the index achieved its goal and has done enough to put in a longer-lasting bottom. A break back above SPX4590 will tell me the run to SPX5000+ is underway.” Please note that already on February 6 see here I was looking for “the SPX can still try for a last stab lower to SPX4150+/-50 to complete a more significant 4th wave...”

You probably may have thought I was crazy and wrong as essentially all traders investors and market pundits had jumped on the bearish bandwagon proclaiming the end of the world and WW-III. Still it is objective data-driven analyses using time-tested methods that work. However the score is once again “EWP and TA 1 vs. emotions 0.” That is why people join my premium major market service to filter out all the daily noise. Or as Joe Friday once said “Just the facts ma’am.”

Although the index has not broken back above SPX4590 yet the market breadth readings are so strong (see here and here for example) that a “breadth thrust” and trend reversal have most likely occurred. I can therefore confidently apply a bullish EWP count to the index. See Figure-1 below.

Figure 1. S&P500 daily candlestick charts with detailed EWP count

A relatively uninterrupted rally to SPX4700 before another 200-400p decline?!.

The SPX has seen four consecutive >1% rallies this week. A feature that only has happened four times before in the index’s history. Such a strong rally is often the hallmark of a 3rd (of a 3rd) wave. In this case (grey) minute-iii of (green) minor-3 of (red) intermediate-i. The latter is in turn part of (black) major-5 but I will get to that in a minute.

Minute wave-iii should ideally top around SPX4500+/10 then a wave-iv back down to SPX4430+/-10 etc. See figure 1. Ideally the index should top out around SPX4700+/-50 for (red) intermediate-i before a multi-day/week correction kicks in: wave-ii. Of course the market does not have to follow the ideal Fibonacci-based EWP pattern but often it does.

Thus it is a great guide and road map. Once intermediate wave-ii completes (in the red target zone 4350-4450) waves iii iv and v can ultimately target around SPX5600+. How can I calculate that? Wave-i from 4100->4700 wave-ii at 4400 then wave-v to 4400 + 2 x (4700-4100) = 5600. That should be the ideally (black) major-5 target.

Story continues

Bottom line: By providing just the facts I had accurately forecasted where the SPX should bottom (4150+/-50 vs. 4115) and found when Russia invaded Ukraine the “index achieved its goal and has done enough to put in a longer-lasting bottom.” Three weeks later and the SPX has already rallied an additional 150 points. Applying a short-term EWP path forward suggests we should see a local top at around SPX4700+/-50 then a drop back to around $4400+/-50 from where the index can rally to ~5600.

During a Yahoo Finance Presents interview this week the 46-year-old governor laid out a bit more detail on what that could actually mean for people living there.

“It's frankly not as exciting as it sounds” he said with a grin. “It's a basic convenience thing” for citizens when they interact with the government.

Recently Polis said Colorado will soon accept cryptocurrency — either Bitcoin (BTC-USD) or Ethereum (ETH-USD) — for state taxes and for fee payments starting this summer.

We are getting a payment provider to accept crypto equivalent and deposit the dollars into the state’s treasury for that amount. It is kind of like credit card payments with the bonus that there are no returned payments! pic.twitter.com/H8MaFV1ojE — Governor Jared Polis (@GovofCO) February 23 2022

Polis says he plans to expand further in the coming months to apply the same ideas to other state fees.

“It won't be too long before renewing your driver's license hunting passes fishing passes you'll be able to do it in crypto” he says.

'We're not holding the crypto to be clear'

The plans come with an important caveat: “We're not holding the crypto to be clear.” He calls it a new transactional layer: Anyone can pay in cryptocurrency that's immediately converted to dollars. Everything inside the government still happens with fiat currency otherwise known as regular money.

The governor compares this type of transaction to paying with a credit card — “but with thankfully significantly reduced transactional costs.” He also expects only around 1% of his constituents to take up the government’s offer right away.

Polis has long been one of the most crypto-fluent public officials in the U.S. In 2014 he became the first member of Congress to accept donations in Bitcoin. While in Washington he co-founded the Congressional Blockchain caucus in 2016 and often spoke about the industry in its early days.

During his recent speech in Denver he laid out more potential uses for crypto in government — including using the blockchain to help with voting overseas and even to keep track of livestock.

Prior to his stint as governor Polis served in Congress for a decade representing Boulder and Denver’s northwestern suburbs. Since being elected governor in 2018 Polis has proven popular with voters and is expected to win a second term this fall. During this week's conversation he also touched on topics like a better way for Democrats to approach inflation and his conversations with the oil industry in his state.

Decoding Arthur J. Gallagher & Co (AJG): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Robust Brokerage Segment: AJG's brokerage segment is a cornerstone of its financial stability consistently generating the majority of the company's revenue. This strength is underpinned by a diverse client base ranging from middle-market entities to individuals and a wide array of insurance products. The segment's success is driven by AJG's ability to negotiate favorable terms with insurance companies reflecting its strong market position and negotiation leverage.

Strategic Acquisitions: AJG has a proven track record of successful acquisitions such as Willis Re Buck and Cadence Insurance which have expanded its service offerings and geographic footprint. These strategic moves not only enhance AJG's revenue streams but also provide cross-selling opportunities and access to new markets contributing to the company's growth and competitive advantage.

Financial Performance: The company's financial health is solid with the latest 10-Q filing indicating a healthy balance sheet. AJG's revenue and net income figures underscore its financial resilience and operational efficiency which are critical in maintaining investor confidence and supporting strategic initiatives.

Weaknesses

Integration Risks: While AJG's acquisition strategy is a strength it also poses integration risks. The assimilation of large acquisitions requires significant resources and management attention and there is always the potential for unforeseen liabilities such as cybersecurity issues or compliance violations. These risks could lead to financial strain and distract from core business operations.

Story continues

Dependence on Economic Conditions: AJG's performance is closely tied to global economic conditions. Factors such as high inflation increased interest rates and geopolitical instability can impact the insurance industry's risk-taking capacity and client demand for AJG's services. Economic downturns could lead to reduced revenues and pressure on profit margins.

Competition and Market Pressures: The insurance brokerage industry is highly competitive with constant pressure from both established players and new entrants. AJG must continually innovate and adapt to maintain its market share which requires ongoing investment in technology and talent retention.

Opportunities

Technological Advancements: AJG has the opportunity to leverage technology data analytics and artificial intelligence to enhance client services and internal efficiencies. By investing in technology-based solutions AJG can differentiate itself from competitors and offer value-added services to its clients.

ESG Initiatives: There is a growing emphasis on environmental social and governance (ESG) factors in the corporate world. AJG can capitalize on this trend by integrating ESG considerations into its service offerings and operations potentially attracting clients who prioritize sustainability and responsible business practices.

Emerging Markets: AJG can expand its presence in emerging markets where insurance penetration is typically lower and growth prospects are higher. By establishing a foothold in these regions AJG can diversify its revenue base and tap into new client segments.

Threats

Global Economic Volatility: AJG operates in a global environment that is subject to economic and geopolitical volatility. Events such as recessions political unrest or trade wars can disrupt markets and negatively impact AJG's operations and financial performance.

Regulatory Changes: The insurance industry is heavily regulated and changes in laws or enforcement policies can have significant implications for AJG's business model. Compliance with new regulations can be costly and time-consuming potentially affecting profitability.

Cybersecurity Risks: As a company that relies on data and technology AJG is vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. A significant data breach or cyber-attack could damage the company's reputation result in financial losses and lead to legal and regulatory consequences.

In conclusion Arthur J. Gallagher & Co (NYSE:AJG) exhibits a strong market position with a robust brokerage segment and a strategic approach to acquisitions. However the company must navigate integration risks economic dependencies and competitive pressures. Opportunities in technology ESG initiatives and emerging markets present avenues for growth while global economic volatility regulatory changes and cybersecurity risks pose significant threats. AJG's forward-looking strategies including leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses will be crucial in maintaining its competitive edge and ensuring long-term success.

Charles René La Presse

Le VUS compact CX-60 est le premier modèle du constructeur fabriqué sur sa toute nouvelle plateforme à propulsion une matière de base nécessaire pour assurer une concurrence à armes égales aux marques de luxe allemandes. Il ne sera pas offert en Amérique du Nord mais donne des avant-goûts technique et esthétique pertinents pour dresser un portrait sommaire du CX-70 le modèle nord-américain qui devrait avoir une apparence un peu plus costaude.

PHOTO FOURNIE PAR MAZDA Le Mazda CX-60 est le premier modèle du constructeur fabriqué sur sa toute nouvelle plateforme à propulsion.

Adoptant un design en ligne directe avec le langage Kodo que le constructeur parfait depuis des années il affiche des ressemblances avec le CX-5. Son capot nettement plus proéminent et ses formes plus galbées trahissent cependant son plus haut statut.

Sous le capot ce CX-60 est introduit avec un groupe propulseur enfichable qui a aussi été promis à la gamme nord-américaine de Mazda en plus d’un six-cylindres en ligne turbo. Composé de l’assemblage d’un quatre-cylindres de 25 L et d’un moteur électrique de 100 kW il affiche une puissance totale de 323 ch. Cela en fait le modèle Mazda le plus puissant jamais produit tout en assurant une autonomie électrique de 62 km selon le protocole de mesure européen.

PHOTO FOURNIE PAR MAZDA L’habitacle du Mazda CX-60

Then the suspect’s relative is found dead in the gunman’s home,"CNN —

An armed man gave no warning as he walked toward the front of Jesus’ Dwelling Place Church in Pennsylvania on Sunday raised a gun toward the pastor’s face and pulled the trigger.

What happened next may have been divine intervention Pastor Glenn Germany said.

“I’m thankful to God that I’m still here because he definitely pulled the trigger” Germany told CNN affiliate WTAE.

The gunman “attempted to shoot but the firearm failed to discharge” Pennsylvania State Police said in a statement.

The incident in North Braddock was captured on the church’s livestreamed video. Immediately after the gunman pulled the trigger a church member tackled the suspect to the ground.

Police say Bernard Polite tried to shoot a pastor in North Braddock but the gun wouldn't discharge. Jesus' Dwelling Place Church

State police identified the suspect as 26-year-old Bernard Junior Polite.

It’s not clear why the suspect tried to shoot the pastor. Germany said he had never seen the gunman before Sunday WTAE reported.

“All of a sudden I just seen a gun pointing right at me” the pastor told the affiliate. “And at that point all I could do was run for cover.”

As Germany ran and hid behind a lectern the church’s cameraman rushed the gunman and tackled him to the ground according to WTAE. The pastor quickly emerged from behind the lectern and helped subdue the suspect.

Polite faces charges of attempted criminal homicide aggravated assault and recklessly endangering another person court records show.

He was arraigned early Monday morning and was denied bail. He is being held at Allegheny County Jail and his preliminary hearing is scheduled for May 13.

It was not immediately clear if Polite has an attorney.

After the attempted shooting at the church police found the body of a man who was shot in Polite’s home Allegheny County police told CNN. The homicide victim was identified as 56-year-old Derek Polite a relative of the suspect from the church incident.

“County Police can confirm Bernard Polite a suspect in a previous incident Sunday morning at a North Braddock church is known to live at the residence where the shooting occurred and is a relative of the shooting victim” police spokesperson Jim Madalinsky told CNN in an email.

“At this point no charges have been filed in connection with the homicide and it remains an active investigation.”

(1:09)

Open Extended Reactions

CINCINNATI -- Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow marked a major offseason milestone on Monday.

As the team started the second phase of voluntary workouts Burrow was in uniform and throwing a pass in a video shared by the team.

The Bengals were closed to the media on Monday. But quarterbacks coach Brad Kragthorpe told the team's website he was pleased with how Burrow looked in his first practice back since suffering a season-ending wrist surgery last November.

""He looked like the Joe Burrow we're used to seeing"" Kragthorpe said. ""I didn't see any difference. I thought the ball came out of his hand well. Confidently. I'm happy where he's at.""

HE IS SO BACK. pic.twitter.com/ZsZjzkZEmg — Cincinnati Bengals (@Bengals) May 6 2024

On Nov. 27 Dr. Thomas Graham repaired the scapholunate ligament in Burrow's right wrist a source confirmed to ESPN following an initial report by the Cincinnati Enquirer. In March Burrow told ESPN that he expected to be fully cleared following his surgery. He noted that the timetable for his return if he remained on track was no different than other offseasons.

""In a normal offseason I wouldn't be throwing until OTAs really anyway"" Burrow said. ""I can lift basically normal now which I'm excited about.""

Burrow missed the final seven games of last season after he suffered the wrist injury in a Week 11 loss to the Baltimore Ravens. It capped an injury-riddled year that started with a strained right calf that he suffered during the first week of training camp in 2023 and re-aggravated in Week 2.

The Bengals were closed to the media on Monday as they started Phase 2 of their offseason program. During this three-week period coaches are allowed to work with players on the field and teams are allowed to run plays at a walk-through pace under certain conditions.

The Bark dataset for training and evaluation of CNNs was prepared by combining two different datasets: BarkNet 1.027 and the additional dataset collected for this study. In terms of size and number of species BarkNet is currently the only publicly available dataset of its kind and contains more than 23000 bark images captured from 23 tree species found in Quebec City Canada with 10–40 repeated captures from different angles and heights of individual trees. The captured raw images were pre-processed in the dataset by two discrete crop processes: trimming off two vertical border lines between the trunk and the background (side-crop) and then cropping into square-shaped patches to match the input shape for CNNs (square-crop). In this study side-cropped images of the BarkNet dataset were utilized. As the images in BarkNet were captured with a large number of repetitions this might lead to high train–test dataset similarity which impedes efficient training of CNNs. Consequently four images were randomly sampled from each of 10 to 40 repetitions and then manually filtered out of images that share a large portion of each other.

For the additional dataset the images were captured according to the protocols of BarkNet with minor modifications. The protocols were as follows: captured from September to November 2020; in parks and forests near Seoul City Republic of Korea; with a wide range of crown density; under various weather conditions from sunny to cloudy and rainy; using an iPhone SE2 camera; at a distance between 20 and 60 cm away from the trunk; with three to four repetitions from different angles per individual tree. The species selected were common species that can be easily found in most parks and forests in the Republic of Korea. We collected samples from multiple species in each genus to investigate intra-genus similarities.

Consequently two datasets consisting of 3672 images (20 species; BarkNet 1.0) and 5703 images (23 species; for the present study) were prepared having one species Pinus strobus in common. A more detailed list of species and the corresponding number of captured images in the two datasets are given in Table 2.

Data pre-processing and augmentation

The overall pre-processing and augmentation are illustrated in Fig. 6. Before aggregating the two datasets side-crop and masking were applied to our dataset. Because our dataset contained images that had non-vertical boundary lines all images were side-cropped to a length that did not cut out pixels of barks and the remaining background was masked by black pixels. After the images were cropped and masked BarkNet and our dataset were aggregated and split into two subsets along with each class: 80% and 20% for training and testing respectively.

Figure 6 Demonstration of data pre-processing procedures. Raw images were side-cropped to a length that did not cut out the bark (A) and the backgrounds were masked with black pixels (B). Then the images were sampled using random window sizes (40–60% of total width) and position (B). If the window contained more black pixels than the pre-defined threshold (0.05 in the present study) the window was re-sampled. After the batched crop images were prepared (C) they were resized to match the model input size and ‘RandAugment’ was applied (D). These procedures were performed concurrently during the training phase. Full size image

For the training dataset a random square crop with thresholding was applied to the images before putting them into the CNNs. Unlike previous studies the images were randomly square-cropped by proportional length instead of fixed pixel lengths such as 224 × 22427 and 256 × 25640. For each crop the pixel length of the crop was first randomly selected in the range of 40–60% of the total width and then the position of the cropping square was randomly sampled. To exclude excessive background the ratio of masked pixels to total pixels was calculated and if the ratio was higher than the threshold (0.05 in this study) the crop region was re-sampled. This approach has several advantages: minimizing the loss of bark features that overlap with crop region flexible cropping that copes with varying resolutions and cropped images that require no manual filtering.

For data augmentation a process that increases the training data by giving slight modifications ‘RandAugment’ was utilized41. RandAugment is an automated data augmentation process that randomly selects a predefined number of augmentation functions and then applies them with a randomly sampled magnitude from a predefined range. The ‘candidate’ functions include equalization rotation solarization adjustment of contrast brightness and color. The entire list of augmentation functions and hyperparameters regarding RandAugment could be found in the provided Python scripts (“Materials and methods”: Data and code availability).

These random square-crop and augmentation processes were applied concurrently with the training. More specifically side-cropped training samples remained unmodified the random square-crop followed by augmentation was performed and the output images with the number of predefined batch sizes were fed into the CNNs. For the testing dataset each side-cropped sample was square-cropped by 50% of the total width without randomized sampling and no augmentation was applied. All training and testing samples were resized to 331 × 331 before data augmentation.

Convolution neural networks

In this study among numerous CNN architectures that have been extensively studied and released the following architectures were adopted and compared: VGG-16 and EfficientNet4243. As one of the early CNN architectures released in 2014 VGG-16 remains a widely used CNN architecture due to its simple structure and powerful performance in various computer vision tasks including classification44 detection45 and segmentation46. In contrast EfficientNet is currently the most powerful CNN architecture showing the highest benchmark accuracy on ImageNet (26) while reducing the number of parameters compared to other recent models. EfficientNet is an approach that searches for the best scaling coefficients in terms of the width depth and resolution of CNNs. In this study EfficientNet with the smallest scale size (B0) was used to match the input size with VGG-16.

Using two CNN architectures each model was modified for effective transfer learning by following sequences: (1) truncate the final fully-connected (FC) layer which contained neurons for predicting 1000 classes (in the original ImageNet dataset) (2) reshape (flatten) the output of the final convolution layer and apply dropout (3) insert a new FC layer with the same number of neurons as the prediction classes (42 species) (4) apply softmax activation with cross-entropy loss functions.

Here a convolution layer performs element-wise multiplication between the input data and the weights; a pooling layer simply reduces the dimensions of the input data; a dropout layer randomly sets input node values to zero and prevents overfitting; and a FC layer connects all nodes in one layer to every node in itself.

Extracting diagnostic features with class activation mapping aggregation

Since CAM was first proposed by Zhou et al.33 there have been several advances in CAM techniques. The original CAM had certain limitations in that it required a global average pooling layer in the architecture along with laborious re-training. These limitations were overcome by Selvaraju et al.29 in gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) using a back-propagation gradient in any target convolution layer. An advanced method called Grad-CAM++ has recently been proposed which provides better localization capability than Grad-CAM especially with multiple object instances occurring in a single image. Considering that the diagnostic features would show multiple occurrences in a single bark image Grad-CAM++ was utilized in this study as the CAM extraction method.

To build a general representation of diagnostic features over the entire bark rather than individual square-cropped patches aggregation and averaging methods were applied referred to as CAM aggregation (Fig. 7). The CAM of each tree image was calculated using the following steps: zero-padding CAM calculation from sliding windows and taking the mean of CAM outputs. More specifically bark images of whole trees were padded with black pixels with corresponding widths and heights so that the window slides over the bark area for an equivalent number of times. Then the receptive window slid over the padded image with a predefined stride of half window size and calculated the CAM of the cropped image. All CAM calculations were then combined and averaged along the entire bark image.

Figure 7 Demonstration of the consecutive process of CAM aggregation. The black background and red-bordered squares in (a) indicate the zero-padded pixels and sliding windows respectively. The patched heatmaps in (b) represent the CAM outputs of the corresponding window calculated from the last activation layer of each model. (c) Aggregated and averaged CAM outputs over the entire bark. (d) Superimposed image of the heatmap to the original image. Full size image

Performance metrics

Two CNN models were evaluated using four performance metrics: overall accuracy and macro-averaged precision recall and f-score with \(\upbeta\) = 1. Each metric was calculated by the multi-class classification performance measurements adopted from Sokolova and Lapalme47 using overall accuracy instead of average accuracy in this study.

Training details

When training VGG-16 and EfficientNet we utilized the following hyper-parameters: 10−5 as the learning rate Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) as the optimizer 50% for dropout rate of the fully connected layer and training batch size of 8. Two CNN models were pre-trained with the ImageNet dataset and then fine-tuned until the maximum overall accuracy on test dataset did not increase for 10 consecutive epochs. CNN models were trained and tested under Windows 10 pro 64-bit OS and Python version 3.8.5 with hardware specification of an AMD Ryzen 5 3600XT CPU 32 GB of RAM and an NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti GPU. Tensorflow (2.4.1) and Keras (2.4.3) were utilized as deep learning frameworks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhYnJpY2F0b3IuY29tL3RoZWZhYnJpY2F0b3IvYXJ0aWNsZS9jYWRjYW1zb2Z0d2FyZS9zb2Z0d2FyZS1hdXRvbWF0aW9uLWluLWEtaGlnaC1taXgtc2hlZXQtbWV0YWwtc2hvcNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Software automation in a high-mix sheet metal shop,"Artificial intelligence is a trendy term often used loosely to describe all kinds of problem-solving software. It can seem arcane but under the hood AI is nothing more than a tool to take information and make decisions with it.

What might that look like? Your cell phone might use AI to focus its camera automatically on people. AI software might be used to predict the weather using satellite imagery. In the fab shop AI might predict scrap rates and handling times produce more efficient material nests and create highly optimized production schedules.

The operative word here is might. The term “AI” properly refers to a particular class of decision-making algorithms. Cameras were autofocusing and software was predicting the weather long before it became popular to call it artificial intelligence. In fact many complex problems may be solved easily without the use of AI but people will want to call it artificial intelligence anyway.

That’s not a problem per se. But as we explore the possible applications of AI in the fab shop it’s worth pointing out that software automation is powerful not because it uses AI but because it simplifies and automates things. Sometimes AI helps under the hood sometimes it doesn’t. At the end of the day you probably wouldn’t care either way as long as the software does its job.

Software automation as a whole has a host of applications in the fab shop doing in seconds what it used to take people days or even weeks to perform. AI is just one of many tools that make the magic happen.

Going Lean with Software

In the “2021 Financial Ratios & Operational Benchmarking Survey” published by the Fabricators & Manufacturers Association Intl. fabricators reported an average operating margin of just 8.7% slightly lower than the long-term average of 9.1%. Slim margins are usually the name of the game in the highly competitive metal fabrication industry and there is enormous competitive pressure to eliminate waste.

If a shop could conceivably eliminate a step without changing the finished product in any way that step isn’t adding value. Under that litmus test many normal and until recently unavoidable metal fabrication tasks are arguably complete waste.

Bidding is necessary but much of that labor fails to produce work and none of it intrinsically adds value. What if your shop didn’t have to hire and train estimators? The physical product wouldn’t be affected in the slightest except to make it more profitable.

File prep also represents waste. Importing and converting customer-provided files remodeling parts from prints fixing design problems and prepping production programs all add significant overhead. Billed nonrecurring engineering costs might provide added revenue but at the expense of higher costs to the customer.

When parts finally go to production a host of opportunities for waste arise. Creating production programs nesting parts tracking down raw inventory loading material into machines thumbing through paper travelers tracking down missing parts scrapping or reworking parts setting up tooling and other activities should be considered waste. It’s not enough to say that they are unavoidable. If they could be eliminated the finished product would only cost less.

It’s not possible to remove all forms of waste of course but software automation is changing the landscape. Processes long seen as unavoidable can now be eliminated or dramatically streamlined and some practices designed to minimize overhead are becoming obsolete. A software-enabled shop might be dramatically different from a traditional shop from quote to cash. Here’s how that might look.

AI-driven Quoting

First the front office is highly automated. There are no estimators no accounts receivable or purchasing personnel. There are no dedicated design engineers CAD designers or CNC equipment programmers. Employees may have those skills but most of that work is automated.

Quoting occurs online where customers upload their files and obtain accurate pricing and lead time in any quantity. Software calculates everything that might affect the cost of the part including production times raw material and consumable usage setup and handling labor as well as scrap and rework rates. A customizable pricing model is then used to provide prices based on costs and a target margin.

To ensure that costing information is accurate the quoting engine is fed detailed manufacturing data directly from the shop floor. Measured data includes production times consumable costs and labor costs for every part ever produced and for every step of the manufacturing process. Altogether the quoting engine can see how long it has taken and exactly what it cost to produce similar or equivalent parts in the past. This detailed connection to data allows the software to bid both aggressively and accurately.

Part analysis is automated as well. Software performs design-for-manufacturability checks by analyzing the part geometry and highlighting potential issues that require attention. In clear cases software automatically reports issues to the customer and declines the job with no human involvement at all.

When computing lead times the quoting engine analyzes real-time production data to determine availability and scheduling constraints. Lead-time options are provided along with pricing and customers can select lead times as short as same-day delivery at least when production capacity allows for it.

Manufacturing prep also is handled automatically. Customers’ CAD-native files are used to prepare production programs and no engineering staff is required to reproduce geometry from a print or clean up customer-provided files. Design changes required prior to production are performed automatically with clear automated communication to both the shop and the customer. To the extent that large or complex jobs require human intervention all required information is available at a glance.

Automated quoting is perfectly scalable. With quotes and manufacturability checks provided automatically by software tens of thousands of parts can be analyzed and quoted in a single day with zero labor overhead from shop personnel.

High-mix Fabrication at Scale

Automated quoting makes it remarkably easy for customers to obtain prices and place orders. There is no delay no long wait for quoting no frustrating back-and-forth to get manufacturability feedback or explore pricing in different materials and quantities. The AI-enabled shop receives hundreds of orders of varying sizes and types every day. To meet the high-mix demand scheduling software analyzes parts material types and due dates to automatically combine orders schedule them for production and produce numerical code for production.

Using the same historical data as the quoting engine the automatic scheduler predicts operation and handling times for every part in every stage of production. Bottlenecks are predicted days in advance informing labor allocation decisions or (similarly) taking future labor shortages into account. Process starvation is also predicted days in advance.

The scheduler uses this data to perform production leveling. Part production is spread out to help eliminate bottlenecks and jobs are planned and released strategically to keep all machines and stations busy without overwhelming them.

If new orders arrive that might affect the schedule or an existing nest the production plan is dynamically and automatically adjusted to accommodate the change. The same is true if in-production parts are scrapped. Software automatically notices a deficit selects raw material from inventory nests with other parts to improve efficiency and releases the job to production.

With hundreds of high-mix orders received and fulfilled every day it would usually be extraordinarily difficult to predict material needs and keep the right inventory on-hand. Instead scheduling software automatically creates purchase orders for approved vendors if there isn’t enough inventory on-hand. Purchasing becomes as simple as sanity-checking the schedule and approving POs significantly reducing the amount of cash that has to be tied up in inventory.

The first time anyone at the shop sees a new part it has already been analyzed priced prepped for production scheduled nested with other orders and released to production. If there is insufficient inventory on hand a PO has already been created. This all takes place without human interference.

When a job finds its way to production—often just minutes after a customer orders it—automation equipment is used to retrieve raw materials and start production. Here shop workers finally become involved in the production process.

The shop is designed to simplify every aspect of fabrication. CNC laser and punch programming is performed automatically by software with lead-ins and microjoints placed strategically based on heuristics and historical data about tip-ups. If relevant punch tooling is selected to minimize production time.

While the automatically generated production programs are usually just fine a human operator can intervene if there are unforeseen issues. Without leaving the machine the operator can open the program on a touchscreen modify it and redeploy. On-demand operator intervention minimizes downtime in the event of a manufacturing exception.

Such changes are recorded automatically by production management software. As more issues are caught and fixed by skilled operators production software learns from its mistakes and becomes continuously better at predicting and avoiding issues that could stop a machine. In effect the human operator’s job is to keep an eye on production and train the AI so that it does a better job in the future.

After a sheet finishes at the laser or punch denesting and sorting are performed automatically by automation equipment. Parts are removed from the deck and placed on autonomous unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) that safely move parts to the next production step. Human operators intervene only to handle edge cases like small parts that might have fallen into the machine or large parts that can’t be moved by a UGV. Production software automatically detects missing or abnormal parts during denesting and signals a request for attention if there is an issue.

Inventory is managed automatically during denesting as well. If remainders are produced they are labeled added to the inventory database and stored for later use. Every raw sheet and remainder maintains full traceability with production history going back to the original PO used to order the original raw sheet. Similarly the system can report every part produced on any sheet of material with traceable certs and lot/heat information from the mill.

Every manufacturing step is equipped with a software console that clearly communicates design needs and constraints and provides operators the tools they need to do their job. Operators can access and modify production data mark parts as finished and ready for the next production step scrap parts or task them for rework leave notes and communicate with their managers or other operators.

Production consoles provide the bulk of the data collection used by the quoting and scheduling engines. Software measures scrap rates and setup processing and handling times for every part ever produced. This rich and detailed data is used to continuously train the scheduling software and the quoting engine. The more parts received the better the system gets at predicting prices and avoiding scheduling bottlenecks.

Finally shop workers are automatically notified when orders finish production and pass quality control. When orders require shipping workers scan finished parts into boxes. A matching packing list is then automatically printed along with a shipping label. When the order is shipped the customer automatically receives an email.

Outcomes

In some ways this software-driven shop is theoretical. In others it is already a reality. New shops are rethinking traditional fabrication and applying software tools to extraordinary effect. Orem Utah-based OSH Cut a software-driven fab startup co-founded by the author yields net margins approaching four times the FMA-reported industry average and revenue productivity per employee more than three times above the average.

In fairness performance is a function of many things including target market and business model so software can’t be credited for everything. It’s worth noting that software automation isn’t a silver bullet. A shop specializing in mass production might rightly look askance at tools that benefit a high-mix shop. And even among high-mix operations the scenario described here is rather specific. Every shop operates a little differently.

A tech-heavy shop also has other concerns and overheads that a more traditional shop won’t have. OSH Cut doesn’t have quoting staff but it does have a team of full-time software engineers and that’s expensive. Custom software is easy to write at first but the bigger and more complex it gets the more effort it takes to maintain and improve it (that’s called “technical debt” in the software world). IT infrastructure is also beyond critical and information security is an omnipresent concern.

A shop should evaluate its own needs and take action step by step. Going paperless could represent a major and easy step toward improved efficiency. Buying pre-existing software to aid quoting could reduce bidding times and improve bid-win rates as quoting times decrease. Off-the-shelf production management software might help eliminate waste even if it doesn’t tie into a quoting system.

Nonsoftware solutions can move the needle and set the stage for growth. For example a whiteboard Kanban system for production tracking could reduce headaches and help organize things on the floor all for the cost of a rolling whiteboard some markers and a pile of sticky notes.

Hiring developers to design custom software might be explored last of all considering the complexity and cost. At the end of the day the problem should drive the solution. A tightly integrated highly automated software-enabled operation represents one vision of a particular kind of shop. Only you can decide where you lose most of your time and what you can do to get it back.",,,,,,,,,

Supply chains in food construction fashion fast-moving consumer goods electronics automotive professional services and freight account for more than half of all global greenhouse gas emissions.

The importance of supply chains to companies’ sustainability goals is now widely accepted.

A report by Accenture reveals that CEOs agree that technology is enabling new business models and will unlock the future of industry decarbonisation. The ability to track every stage of the product journey from raw materials to the consumers doorstep through to the end-life of the product is now top of mind for businesses. In fact research by EY lists end-to-end visibility as the number one factor in creating a successful supply chain. Furthermore as global supply chains continue to be affected by challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic this is a way to build resilience and future-proof supply chains from disruptions.

To fully leverage the transformational opportunities that technology can unlock organisations need effective data management and item-level visibility across the value chain - but this can’t be accomplished without the right technologies.

Traceability leads to visibility

When we look at the future of sustainability from net-zero goals to circular business models none of it is possible if companies don’t first understand the what when where why and how of their products at each stage of the supply chain.

This is where the benefits of digital identity technologies can have a profound impact. By assigning each product its own ‘digital twin’ companies can unlock sophisticated real-time monitoring of their supply chains. This helps them to make supply chain decisions that can reduce waste increase efficiencies and create circular processes.

A prime example is the use of digital twins in the food sector capable of driving better management of expiry more precise product removal during recalls and improved monitoring of temperatures to avoid spoilage. Based on pilot studies we believe radio frequency identification (RFID) tagging can help grocers reduce food waste by as much as 20%.

Chipotle Mexican Grill recently announced it is testing RFID technology to enhance its traceability and inventory systems across approximately 200 restaurants in the greater Chicago area. A leader in food safety Chipotle is one of the first major restaurant companies to leverage RFID case labels to track ingredients from suppliers to restaurants via serialization. The ambition is to save suppliers time on inventory management and stock rotation mitigate human error and increase expiration date visibility and accountability.

Driving decarbonisation

To meet the urgency of curbing climate change it’s critical that businesses act to eliminate GHG emissions and when we consider that the food supply chain alone represents a quarter of global GHG emissions the possibilities are huge and the supply chain’s role in decarbonisation could be an absolute game-changer.

Avery Dennison is working with a major sports retailer who is piloting our atma.io connected product cloud solution to trace the carbon footprint of its raw materials. By assigning every product a digital identity which is connected to the cloud the sports retailer can determine the carbon cost of each product from manufacturer to store shelf.

The next frontier of supply chain decarbonisation is to ensure companies are measuring and managing their total value chain. Scope 3 emissions account for 65-95% of a company’s emissions but progress on tracking these emissions has been slow. The latest updates to the atma.io connected product cloud have been created to help brands meet net-zero targets and reduce waste across the supply chain. The atma.io Real-time Carbon Impact Analytics tool provides brands with data-driven insights regarding the carbon footprint of their products including Scope 3 emissions and beyond. It captures data from every stage of a product’s journey from raw material to consumer and can help firms as they work to comply with forthcoming EU ‘Digital Product Passport’ regulations.

Supply chains for value-driven customers

Consumer behaviour is changing and given the COVID-19 pandemic transparent and real-time information is becoming critical to ensure health and safety but also to align with consumers’ increasing demands for sustainability.

The information made possible by digital identity technologies goes way beyond a product’s origins to letting people know where their product has been giving them access to behind-the-scenes footage of where products are made to information on how or where to recycle or resell their clothing.

As the global economy is transitioning away from a linear model to a circular one digital identity technologies provide consumers with information through a smartphone scan or tap on how or where to recycle or resell their clothing and by providing resellers with the authenticity of a garment enabling its second life.

For example Levi’s partnered with Hong Kong upcycling brand The R Collective to create a fully traceable denim collection. Each item has an Avery Dennison-enabled digital label with a QR code that informs consumers how to care for their garment and how to recycle at its end of life. French lingerie brand Etam is deploying RFID technology across its entire range of bras and underwear as a means of tracking and tracing product throughout its journey from factory to store shelf. This provides a global vision of its stock wherever the product happens to be allowing the brand to take full advantage of its inventory whether it is being showcased in stores in stockrooms or in warehouses. As part of its commitment to transparency shoppers can scan QR codes on product labels to beam short videos about factories and product insights directly to their smartphones.

Transparent supply chains are fast being seen as ‘business as usual’ not an innovative extra with digital twins being used all the way from item creation to optimising manufacturing operations to end of life. The evidence around the commercial benefits is extensive.

According to an Accenture study across five use cases digital twins can unlock US$1.3tn in economic value and 7.5 Gt CO2 emissions reductions till 2030. We have the societal and the business case for change coupled with the technology required now we just need to see more urgency and action.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In a 2022 NFL offseason filled with shocking trades stunning free-agency reversals and surprise un-retirements the Las Vegas Raiders' acquisition of wideout Davante Adams feels like just another big move.

It's a massive addition though—one that might be the trade of the offseason in a different year. It's not just noteworthy because the Raiders landed one of the game's best receivers or that they only yielded first and second-round picks in the 2022 draft and handed out a new five-year $140 million contract to make it happen.

It's also a huge deal because it reunites Adams with his college quarterback Derek Carr. The two played together at Fresno State and Adams—who played his high school ball in Palo Alto California—had a ""lifelong dream"" of playing for the Raiders and with Carr according to NFL Media's Ian Rapoport.

If Carr and Adams can quickly rekindle the chemistry they had at Fresno State they could emerge as one of the NFL's best quarterback-receiver duos. Carr is a three-time Pro Bowler who's had 30 game-winning drives. Adams is a five-time Pro Bowler and a two-time first-team All-Pro.

The Raiders are not alone in trying to reignite a spark that existed in the college ranks. We've recently seen multiple teams pair quarterbacks with one of their top collegiate options. It's a trend that may well continue.

How does the duo of Adams and Carr stack up against some of the top college QB-WR tandems who reconnected in the pros? Let's dive into five of the top pairings and examine what they've accomplished in college and as pros and look at their potential.

5. Trevor Lawrence and Travis Etienne Jr.



Mike McCarn/Associated Press

The Jacksonville Jaguars constructed this tandem during the 2021 draft. Jacksonville claimed Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence with the first pick and snagged his college teammate running back and receiver Travis Etienne Jr. with the 25th pick.

While Etienne was primarily a running back with the Tigers he did his fair share of pass-catching. In 2019 he amassed 1614 rushing yards 37 receptions 432 receiving yards and 23 combined touchdowns.

Jacksonville was working with Etienne as a wide receiver last offseason before injury ended his rookie campaign.

""Right now we're focusing on the fundamentals of wide receiver play learning the offense from wide receiver"" former Jags head coach Urban Meyer told reporters.

Etienne suffered a Lisfranc injury during the preseason that ended his year and Meyer has since been replaced by Doug Pederson. We haven't seen this duo perform as pros yet and the new regime might not have the same plan of using Etienne as a wideout.

However Lawrence and Etienne were a formidable college tandem and could be elite in the NFL. They'll reside at the bottom of our list until they're more proven as pros but they could rise rapidly in 2022.

4. Jalen Hurts and DeVonta Smith

The Philadelphia Eagles drafted former Alabama and Oklahoma quarterback Jalen Hurts in 2020's second round. A year later they grabbed former Alabama wideout DeVonta Smith with the 10th pick.

Hurts and Smith had limited experience together at Alabama. In Hurts' final season with the Crimson Tide 2018 he only had 70 pass attempts as Tua Tagovailoa had overtaken him as the full-time starter.

In Smith's first season at Alabama 2017 the receiver had only eight receptions for 160 yards and three touchdowns.

Still there was a familiarity there and Hurts and Smith showed they had chemistry as Eagles last season. Hurts helped take Philadelphia to the playoffs while Smith proved to be a reliable top target.

Smith finished his rookie season with 64 catches 916 yards and five touchdowns. He helped post a passer rating of 102.1 when targeted.

This is a playoff-caliber duo that should showcase the sort of connection they didn't get a chance to establish in college. It wouldn't be a shock to see Hurts and Smith help each other become Pro Bowlers in 2022.

3. Tua Tagovailoa and Jaylen Waddle

Wilfredo Lee/Associated Press

The Miami Dolphins took Hurts' Alabama successor Tagovailoa with the fifth pick in the 2020 draft. A year later they took explosive Alabama receiver Jaylen Waddle with the sixth selection.

Unlike Hurts and Smith Tagovailoa and Waddle had a strong connection during their collegiate days. In 2018 for example Tagovailoa passed for 3966 yards and 43 touchdowns with only six interceptions. Waddle caught 45 passes for 848 yards and seven touchdowns that season.

Their connection picked up where it left off in Miami last year. While Tagovailoa (90.1 passer rating) was inconsistent under center Waddle was an immediate star.

""You know the urgency and the passion he plays a game with and you can tell he was a guy that was going to come in and be a pro early"" new wide receivers coach Wes Welker said of Waddle per Alain Poupart of FanNation.

Waddle caught 104 passes for 1015 yards and six touchdowns while helping Tagovailoa go 7-5 as a starter.

While Tagovailoa is the least accomplished quarterback on this list next to Lawrence—the other three have been to the playoffs—he and Waddle have the sort of chemistry that can carry Miami to the postseason multiple times in the not-too-distant future.

2. Derek Carr and Davante Adams

As far as accomplishments go Carr and Adams are at the top of the pack. We've already examined some of their individual accolades but it's worth diving into what they did together on the collegiate field.

Despite playing only two seasons at Fresno State—he redshirted as a freshman—Adams set school records in receptions (233) and receiving touchdowns (38). In all Adams racked up 3031 yards in his two years playing with Carr.

Carr meanwhile led the FBS with 5083 passing yards in 2013. In his two years with Adams he threw for 9187 yards and 87 touchdowns.

In short Carr and Adams were phenomenal together in college and both are now accomplished pros. Adams is arguably the best wide receiver in the game and while Carr might not be considered elite he's well above average.

A year from now Carr and Adams might just be at the top of this list. They haven't yet had the opportunity to shine together on the pro stage however which gives the top spot to a duo that has appeared in both college and NFL championship games.

1. Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase

Brett Carlsen/Associated Press

While Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase have had only one pro season together the Cincinnati Bengals' tandem is already one of the NFL's best.

Burrow helped carry the Bengals to their first Super Bowl in more than 30 years but he couldn't have done it without Chase. The 2021 Offensive Rookie of the Year was simply spectacular catching 81 passes for 1455 yards and 13 touchdowns while making the Pro Bowl.

More impressive though was the chemistry that Burrow and Chase exhibited on the field. It's a connection that dates back to their time together at LSU.

""Guys around the offense laughed about the 50-50 ball. They said 'Hey in this room with Ja'Marr and Joe it's an 80-20 ball'"" former LSU co-offensive coordinator Steve Ensminger said per ESPN's Ben Baby.

Burrow and Chase won a national title together in 2019 while having two of the greatest collegiate seasons ever. Burrow passed for 5671 yards and 60 touchdowns with only six interceptions. Chase caught 84 passes for 1780 yards and 20 touchdowns.

The two have picked up where they left off that season and Burrow and Chase appear poised to be a Super Bowl-caliber tandem for years.

It will be interesting to revisit this list in a year and it will be fun to see if any new duos are formed during the 2022 draft—the New England Patriots for example could pair quarterback Mac Jones with Alabama receiver John Metchie III.",,,,,,,,,
BAC,Bank of America,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vYmFua2VyYW5kdHJhZGVzbWFuLmNvbS9iYW5raW5nLXdoaWxlLWJsYWNrLXN0aWxsLWhhcHBlbnMtZXZlbi1pZi15b3VyZS1mYW1vdXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Banking While Black’ Still Happens Even If You’re Famous,"“Banking While Black” is trend we seem to hear more about as conversations of equity grow. The stats show the lack of relationships banks have with Black people. Almost half of Black families are underbanked compared to 19 percent of white families Black business lacked access to PPP loans and continue to get declined for loans at higher rates up to 80 percent by some studies.

In the latest Banking While Black news “Black Panther” director Ryan Coogler was arrested in a Bank of America branch in Atlanta trying to withdraw $12000. Coogler wrote a note on a deposit slip asking the teller to count the money in another room as he was “trying to be discreet.” An alert went off for the teller as she attempted the transaction and the teller and her manager thought Coogler was trying to rob or scam the bank and called the police. The police detained and handcuffed Coogler until the mistake was realized.

There is so much to unpack in this incident. But let me begin here. Ryan Coogler is an example of Black exceptionalism. A record-breaking award-winning film director. Which probably helped him get out of handcuffs once they verified who he was. But what if he was a no-name Black guy who was just hoping to be discreet with his money? Would police have leaned into this robbery story and charged him to let the courts work it out? Would he have had to prove he wasn’t robbing the bank and he just didn’t want anyone to know he was about to walk out with $12000? If Ryan Coogler was a random “Ryan” this action could have ruined this man’s life.

History Has a Long Impact

Bank of America has made some bold pledges around ending racism especially after they had to pay over $300 million in fines for discrimination in 2011. But the intention has not impacted the culture of their branches. Some in the news have made it a point to say that the teller was Black. They don’t mention the name of her manager who insisted that she call the police so I assume their race is not helpful to the situation. This mention adds insult to injury as it attempts to temper the story by removing the element of race. It’s a white privilege way to think about it. The color of the teller doesn’t matter any more than the color of the cop. It’s the color of the victim that matters.

Beyond the danger that Black people can so easily find themselves in when police are called banks need to stop and realize their misguided assumptions on who is a “worthy customer” within their 21st century customer base. We work with our banking clients on the idea of “dignified banking for all.” Whether someone is cashing a check or closing a mortgage they should be seen as valued customers. Dignified banking stands on three legs.

Recognize the history of banks taking advantage of Black people. Banking While Black is actually getting better. As we have historically learned banks have redlined Black communities created predatory practices that lead to stealing Black wealth for hundreds of years. If staff do not understand Black customers walking into a bank with that truthful narrative they will not understand why Black people are so quick to assume the bank is trying to take advantage of them.

Question Who’s a ‘Good Customer’

Doing a cultural customer service audit is an important first step. Take stock of the policies and procedures tellers have. Do they reinforce opportunities for your tellers to build relationships with customers? Or are they completely transactional while ignoring the realities of customers’ lives. Wanting to be discreet about $12000 should not have raised suspicion. It actually sounds like a reasonable request from a customer. Processes become culture so training and incentivizing culture becomes a critical next step.

All customer service training must have an anchor in cultural and behavioral training. We work with our clients to help develop a culture that takes into account how tellers and other front-line workers view “good and bad customers.” When I hosted a focus group with people who use check cashing and we asked them why they like check cashing the responses were a little surprising. A majority of people said they feel belittled at banks and hidden fees make them hard to trust. They preferred to pay exorbitant fees up front to avoid the feelings of judgment and surprise fees. Centering training in how others perceive banks is critically important to be able to provide equitable customer service.

Bank CEOs understand the role branches play. Tellers are gatekeepers to customers’ money. The control they have over these dollars is so much greater than their pay scale would suggest. Banks need to take that responsibility seriously which includes providing people dignified access to their money. Bank of America may want to take a Starbucks moment and remind its branches the new brand is trying to build one dedicated to equity.

A sea of runners hit Chicago streets Sunday for the unofficial kickoff to outdoor running season as the Bank of America Shamrock Shuffle returned following two years of cancellations due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The iconic Chicago race saw thousands of runners flooding city streets on a new course route capping off a week of St. Patrick's Day festivities in the city that began with the Chicago River dyeing last weekend.

Tai Dinger finished first for the men's race and Natosha Rogers came in first place for the women's competition. Samantha Schroth came out victorious for the wheelchair race followed by Michael Panther Mayen for the men.

Organizers announced the race would follow a new new course last month in the countdown to the big event.

As usual the 8K began and ended in Grant Park and featured views of many familiar sights.

This year's course guided participants along the Chicago River for an impressive view of the city's annual holiday festivities.

But during miles 1 and 2 runners instead went past the newly-constructed Bank of America tower before heading east on Washington Boulevard.

And it wasn't just runners hitting the streets. The event also hosted a two-mile walk Sunday which began and finished in Grant Park taking participants on a scenic course along the lakefront.

While the city may be marking an end to another year of St. Patrick's Day celebrations it is also marking the start of much more.

The race known as the unofficial kickoff to outdoor running also falls on the first day of spring in the city.

Sunday's events come nearly one month after Chicago lifted many of its COVID restrictions including mask and vaccine mandates ushering in what officials say is a new phase of the pandemic that forced the cancellation of the race for two straight years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzMxZGNkNzQ4LTI2ZDItNGY3YS1hZDNkLWEzZWZjMDVjMGYyNdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US banks take $4.6bn revenue hit from equity raising drought,Today's FT newspaper for easy reading on any device.

Bank of America’s CashPro App has been recognized by Celent the global research and advisory firm for the financial services industry as a winner of a Model Bank award for Corporate Digital Banking. According to Bank of America earlier this year the CashPro App was also named Best Mobile Cash Management Software by Global Finance magazine and Best Mobile Technology Solution by Treasury Management International.

“This industry recognition is a credit to many teams across the bank but also to our clients who partner with us on idea generation design and feedback” said Tom Durkin global product head for CashPro Platform. “By making business easier the CashPro App has become an essential offering to our clients.”

Client activity on the CashPro App has grown exponentially since its introduction in 2017 when the App processed just US$40 million in payment approvals. Last year that figure was US$378 billion with new records being broken on a weekly basis. In terms of client sign-ins the App saw a 55% increase in 2021 from the year prior. The steep adoption signals the greater comfort and trust that clients have in using the App to manage a greater portion of their treasury needs.

Thousands of representatives from businesses around the world use the CashPro App to manage loans deposits payments and trade finance. In singling out the CashPro App from the competition Celent’s Head of Corporate Banking Patricia Hines noted its ability “to bring the convenience of mobile to cash management” and the bank’s “unrelenting focus on user experience and design which differentiate the solution from its competitors.”

Celent and Global Finance also recognized the bank’s efforts to continually enhance the app citing respectively: “eight major releases in 2021 alone” when the bank delivered new capabilities that “reduced friction for clients forced by the pandemic to work remotely” and that the bank “has sped product development as treasurers look to do more via apps.”

Celent’s annual award program recognizes financial institutions as ‘model banks’ for their outstanding technology initiatives. In order to win the initiatives must demonstrate clear business benefits innovation and technology or implementation excellence.

Farmer Joe was enticed to take a bath with Claire both of whom developed a connection with each other during their first 24-hour date together.

But while their latest date was meant to be a romantic scene viewers back home said they could hardly watch the pair fumble in the water reported Yahoo Lifestyle.

The cattle and sheep farmer 33 offered another 24-hour date up for grabs with the marketing manager 36 pulling out all the stops to win.

'I saw the bathtub near our tent so yeah I just wanted to set up a little spot for us to share some time together' Claire told producers.

Farmer Wants A Wife Australia fans said they were left 'cringing' away from the TV on Sunday night as they watched an awkward date between two of the contestants

However it seemed the plan 'fell flat' when awkward scenes showed the pair stripping down and stepping into the warm bath looking shy in front of the cameras.

The pair appeared uncomfortable sharing affections while in their underwear on TV but did attempt to share a kiss and caress one another in a cringey display.

'I couldn't watch the bath just a bunch of giggling it was so cringe' one person wrote on Facebook.

Another added: 'I know I felt awkward for watching haha not even a conversation going.'

'Yes it was so cringeworthy it was hard to watch' one user commented.

Others noted that it was only awkward because Farmer Joe did not appear to be as interested in Claire as she was him.

But while their latest date was meant to be a romantic scene viewers back home said they could hardly watch the pair fumble in the water reported Yahoo Lifestyle

One wrote: 'To me that date thing that Claire planned for Joe fell flat I honestly don't think he's feeling it for any of the women.'

'No he is not feeling it with any of them but well and truly enjoying the game!' another agreed.

If your mother enjoys the outdoors and appreciates the delicate beauty of birds what better gift is there than a bird bath? More specifically a solar-powered bird bath fountain. It only needs a little bit of sun exposure before it begins blasting water into the air giving all of your flying friends a chance to wash off that sky dust.

(For even more ideas check out our roundups of the best Mother's Day gifts for every budget and the best last-minute Mother's Day gifts to shop now.)

Why is this a good deal? 💰

At over 30% off this matches the best price we've seen this year. It's also one of the most affordable options on all of Amazon with most other fountains starting at $17 and going up from there.

Why do I need this? 🤔

Running water makes for an attractive feature in any space and this fountain pump will spray water high into the air using nothing but solar power. You don't need to plug it in anywhere; just place it in the bird bath and after about three seconds it will begin spraying water. It doesn't store energy so it may be somewhat less effective on cloudy days.

There are also six different nozzles that you can swap out for different water patterns so you can mix things up from time to time. If you keep it in the middle of a properly-sized bird bath you won't lose a lot of water over the sides. It will minimize the amount of refilling you have to do. That said you should clean it every so often to prevent the pump lines from clogging — the company suggests doing so at least once a week.

Splish splash they were takin' a bath! Mom will enjoy the feathered fun this bird bath will bring to her garden. (Amazon)

What reviewers say 💬

With over 7900 five-star reviews a lot of fans have added this touch of whimsy to their birdbath.

Pros 👍

Despite concerns over sun exposure fans say this fountain works well even with indirect light. ""I have a bird bath with a shallow basin and only 1/2 day of direct sunlight. My concern was that I did not want to have stagnant water that could attract mosquitoes. This solar fountain pump works great. It even works at lower capacity using only reflected light when the bird bath is in a shadowy part of the day.""

Another bird-watcher said ""This little thing is beautiful. It aerates the water and the birds love it.""

It isn't limited just to bird baths either. ""I bought it for my neighbor's koi pond but he put it in his pool. It sprays water about 3 feet in the air. He loves it.""

Cons 👎

One fan said it can be a little noisy. ""I love them! I have one in my front and back garden. Only downside is they make a sputtering noise when they’re not in full sun.""

Another shopper warned that it might actually be too powerful. ""I found that they have too much power for my small birdbath. I put a half-inch square of electrical tape over one of the solar collectors and wait and watch. If the spray is too strong I put another piece on. it usually takes three pieces.""

But the Holburne Museum in Bath is staging a groundbreaking exhibition called Henry Moore in Miniature a collection of the great artist’s works that could fit into the palm of the hand.

The museum’s director Chris Stephens said its relatively small spaces meant one of the themes of its programme was to showcase the intimate in art – and the retrospective of mini Moores met the brief perfectly.

He said visitors to the exhibition which opened on Friday would be able to imagine Moore industriously working away in his studio finding new shapes and textures.

“The exhibition serves as a reminder that sculpture is as much an art of the hand – in its making and appreciation – as of the eye. An object may be small in size but large in scale” he said.

The show billed as the first of its kind features sculptures in stone wood terracotta plaster lead bronze and Plasticine and takes in themes recurrent in Moore’s work: the reclining female figure mother and child the human head the fallen warrior. It has works from every decade of his career from the 1920s to the 1980s.

The first piece the visitor encounters is a mother and child from the 1920s modelled in Plasticine which pleasingly was invented at the end of the 19th century by a teacher at Bath Academy of Art William Harbutt. It sits next to a small animal head made of boxwood in 1921.

Another intriguing display features of a pair of mother-and-childs from the 1930s modelled in plaster and cast in lead which Moore melted in saucepans on a kitchen stove. Stephens said the lead gave the pieces a “poisonous” air which perhaps reflected political times as the world headed towards war.

View image in fullscreen ‘An enormous amount of Henry Moore’s work began with his modelling’ his daughter said. Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian

Seen in public for the first time is a collection of small terracotta heads that Moore modelled while planning two carved heads for a church at Much Hadham in Hertfordshire in the 1950s.

Stephens said: “These reflect his interest in classical traditions tribal masks and perhaps the graffiti carved into walls in Paris captured by the photographer Brassaï.” Moore’s fingerprints and tool marks are clearly visible in the heads.

The final displays are maquettes for yet more mother and child sculptures dating from the late 1970s and early 1980s and a cabinet of found objects from his studio that Moore worked with – bones flints stones.

Presented in partnership with the Henry Moore Foundation the exhibition features more than 60 works gathered in one room on the top floor of the museum. Moore’s daughter Mary Moore said she was delighted these smaller pieces would be seen.

She said: “An enormous amount of Henry Moore’s work – particularly the starting point for his universally familiar large-scale sculpture – began with his modelling with his turning moulding and forming in the palm of his hands.”

By way of contrast a second show that opened at the Holburne on Friday stars a very different artist – Sam Cox better known as Mr Doodle who has almost 3 million followers on Instagram sells his work for hundreds of thousands of pounds a time and has covered every inch of his Kent home with his intricate patterns.

Mr Doodle! Museum Mayhem is the first UK museum exhibition of his work with the Holburne allowing Doodle to take over parts of the building and daub it with his “graffiti spaghetti” of black ink on white background.

He has also been given the go-ahead to replace some of its pieces with his own work. For example John Constable’s Flatford Lock from the Bridge (circa 1814-17) has been replaced with Doodle House from the Gates (2024).

Doodle studied illustration at UWE Bristol and used to bring a suitcase of his work to Bath to try to barter for a meal or a drink. “That was mostly unsuccessful” he said. “It’s cool to come back and do something grander.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvYmVkLWJhdGgtYmV5b25kcy1uZXctcGFyZW50LWNvbXBhbnktc2F5cy1pdHMtc3RpbGwtd29ya2luZy1vbi13aW5uaW5nLWJhY2stcmVwZWF0LWN1c3RvbWVycy0xZDZhYmRhM9IBigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L2JlZC1iYXRoLWJleW9uZHMtbmV3LXBhcmVudC1jb21wYW55LXNheXMtaXRzLXN0aWxsLXdvcmtpbmctb24td2lubmluZy1iYWNrLXJlcGVhdC1jdXN0b21lcnMtMWQ2YWJkYTM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bed Bath & Beyond’s new parent company working on winning back repeat customers,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bed-bath-beyonds-new-parent-company-says-its-still-working-on-winning-back-repeat-customers-1d6abda3 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvYmVkLWJhdGgtYmV5b25kcy1uZXctcGFyZW50LWNvbXBhbnktc2F5cy1pdHMtc3RpbGwtd29ya2luZy1vbi13aW5uaW5nLWJhY2stcmVwZWF0LWN1c3RvbWVycy0xZDZhYmRhM9IBigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L2JlZC1iYXRoLWJleW9uZHMtbmV3LXBhcmVudC1jb21wYW55LXNheXMtaXRzLXN0aWxsLXdvcmtpbmctb24td2lubmluZy1iYWNrLXJlcGVhdC1jdXN0b21lcnMtMWQ2YWJkYTM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

5 under the radar managers who swapped British football for adventures abroad

Owen Coyle became the latest face familiar to British fans to win silverware abroad this month when he led Indian Super League side Jamshedpur FC to the Indian Super League (ISL) League Winners’ Shield.

The club which was only founded in 2017 finished top of the regular league table after 20 games five points clear of their nearest challengers.

Despite falling short in the four-team play-offs former St Johnstone Burnley Bolton Wigan and Blackburn boss Coyle has still been rightly praised for the job he has done.

His success has not gone unnoticed either with reports in the last few days claiming Scottish League One team Queen of the South are ready to lure Coyle - who was born in Scotland but picked up one cap for the Republic of Ireland as a player - back to Britain.

Here Mirror Sport looks at five bosses who have also ventured abroad to far-flung destinations as managers - with varying degrees of success.

Stuart Baxter

Even at the age of 69 Baxter is still going strong.

Despite being born in Wolverhampton Baxter enjoyed a short playing career in England before setting off on his globe-trotting career.

He played in Australia Sweden and the United States before moving into management in 1985. He has managed clubs in Sweden Norway Portugal Japan South Africa Turkey and India as well as undertaking international roles with South Africa Finland and England's under-19s.

Last year he returned to one of his former clubs Kaizer Chiefs and led them to a first-ever CAF Champions League final which they lost 3-0 to Al Ahly.

Neill Collins

Collins was a defender in his playing days most notably for Wolves Sunderland and Sheffield United.

He finished his career out in the States with Tampa Bay Rowdies and upon retiring in 2018 he was made head coach of the Florida club.

And he has certainly made a success of the job.

Collins has lead the Rowdies to back-to-back Eastern Conference titles.

The quest now is to seal the club’s first USL Championship (won via play-offs) after finishing runners-up last year and seeing the 2020 showpiece finale which they also reached cancelled due to the pandemic.

Collins was recently joined by a former Sheffield United teammate in the shape of former forward Jon Stead who will work as an assistant coach.

John Gregory

Gregory was a well-known name in English football thanks to spells in charge of Derby Aston Villa and QPR.

So when in 2009 he decided to take up a job at Israeli side Maccabi Ahi Nazareth it led to many eyebrows being raised.

The job wasn't a success and the club were relegated in Gregory's first campaign. That didn't put Gregory off though and he landed another job in Israel and then Kazakhstan. A two-year spell back in England with Crawley followed before he was lured abroad in 2017.

This time he went to India as boss of Chennaiyin - who he would lead to the Indian Super League title in 2018.

That gong was the second of his career after winning the Intertoto Cup with Villa in 2001. He left Chennaiyin in 2019.

Adrian Heath

Former Everton Man City and Burnley forward Heath is managing in the States with Minnesota United.

The 61-year-old has been in his current post for five years and has been in the US since 2008.

He was at Orlando City for five years prior to them being admitted into the MLS.

He then moved to Minnesota and oversaw their progression into the top tier. After three games so far in the 2022 season Heath's side are seventh in the 14-team standings.

He became a viral hit in 2020 for a blunt but entertaining post-match interview in which he provided a 20-second response on his summary of a match.

Steve Kean

Kean's appointment as Blackburn Rovers manager back in 2010 remains one of the strangest in Premier League history.

Despite a solid background as a first-team coach he had no managerial experience prior to replacing Sam Allardyce in the Rovers' hotseat.

He kept them up that season but relegation followed in 2011-12. Kean resigned from the post early into the following campaign.

Speaking to Sky Sports about the pressure of the Rovers job Kean said last year: ""It was only when I came out of it that I realise.

""It was almost like the pressure cooker lid comes off and you decompress.

""You realise that mentally you are a bit battered by it. It took a few months for me to get my energy back just mentally.""

Once his batteries were recharged Kean would make a left-field move and joined Brunei team DPMM. He spent four years there and won the Singapore Premier League and a League Cup.

He also had a spell as Brunei national team coach before working as caretaker at Australian side Melbourne Victory.

Last November the Scot was appointed Academy Director of Hibernian.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVzb3V0aGFmcmljYW4uY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9iYXh0ZXItemFiYWxhemEtdGhlYXRyZS1mZXN0aXZhbC1yZXR1cm4td2VzdGVybi1jYXBlLXBvZXRyeS1hd2FyZHMtd3JpdGVyLWRpcmVjdG9yc3MtYXByaWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Baxter Zabalaza Theatre Festival returns this April,"From 2 to 8 April 2022 The Baxter Zabalaza Theatre Festival – now in its 12th year – takes over The Baxter with 32 brand new productions from across the Western Cape showcasing the best in dynamic and original developmental theatre.

Famed investor Warren Buffett has a sense of humor -- and a way with words. The chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway is known for sharing complex investing topics simply and artfully. He uses that skill in interviews and in his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders.

Buffett's 2020 shareholder letter includes a lesson for investors that's worth revisiting in 2022 given the current state of the stock market. This is what he said:

Indeed a patient and level-headed monkey who constructs a portfolio by throwing 50 darts at a board listing all of the S&P 500 will -- over time -- enjoy dividends and capital gains just as long as it never gets tempted to make changes in its original ""selections.""

Read that quickly and you may think it's a joke. But in true Buffett style he's delivered a four-part investing class in fewer than 50 words. Read on for my breakdown of the takeaways.

1. Process trumps expertise

It's significant that Buffett chose a monkey as the star of his story. The investing monkey is not a slick Wall Street pro who's armed with real-time data and algorithms. Just the opposite the monkey presumably has no financial expertise given that it picks securities by throwing darts.

What the monkey does have is a process. And following that process to the letter is how the monkey generates dividends and capital gains over time.

2. Choose quality

As a first step the monkey chooses quality assets. Yes there are darts involved but the random selection is taken from S&P 500 stocks. These are the largest most successful public companies in the country. Many of them have longevity financial strength loyal customers and experienced leaders -- qualities associated with long-term share price appreciation.

3. Diversify

Buffett's monkey invests in 50 S&P 500 stocks. That means each stock comprises just 2% of the overall portfolio to start. Diversifying across that many positions protects the monkey if any one of those companies fails. Even if two or three stocks lost all their value the monkey would see a dip of less than 10%.

4. Buy and hold no matter what

The monkey's returns develop over time and only if the original stocks aren't traded away. To translate that into investor-speak the monkey is practicing buy-and-hold.

The buy-and-hold approach generates earnings by riding the natural long-term growth of the stock market. That growth averages about 7% annually after inflation.

Importantly the 7% average is more reliable over longer timeframes. In any one year the stock market could be down by double digits. In the next year share prices could rise by double digits. These ups and downs average out to 7% but it can take 10 or 20 years for that to happen.

This is why Buffett's monkey must be ""patient and level-headed."" Effective buy-and-hold investors don't panic and sell when the market gets volatile. They know growth potential increases the longer they hold their positions. Plus selling would take them out of the running for recovery gains that follow downturns.

In short it's critical for buy-and-hold investors to stay invested and stay the course. Riding out market turbulence is how you use the market's long-term average growth to your advantage. It's also the simplest way to come out ahead on the other side of a correction.

Invest like a...monkey?

You don't need deep expertise (or darts) to build wealth in the stock market. You do need patience and a process however. Fortunately the buy-and-hold approach makes for a simple process. Invest in a diversified group of quality stocks consistently for decades even through down markets.

Buy-and-hold may not have made monkeys rich but it has made millions for ordinary and extraordinary investors. It can do the same for you too.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL2ZvcnR3b3J0aHJlcG9ydC5vcmcvMjAyMi8wMy8yMC9jb2x1bW4tc2F5aW5nLWdvb2RieWUtdG8tam9obi12LXJvYWNoLWZvcnQtd29ydGgtbGVhZGVyLWluLWJ1c2luZXNzLWNpdmljLWFmZmFpcnMtYW5kLWVkdWNhdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Column: Saying goodbye to John V. Roach Fort Worth leader in business civic affairs and education,"A titan of Fort Worth business civic and educational institutions has left the stage.

John V. Roach 83 who led RadioShack though its most profitable and influential era helped bring Warren Buffett to Fort Worth and led TCU to new heights died on Sunday March 20.

Though he had slowed down in recent years his influence was still felt. On Feb. 7 Roach passed the gavel for the Fort Worth Executive Roundtable an influential group of local CEOs and business leaders to Mike Berry president of Hillwood and Dee J. Kelly Jr. a partner at the Kelly Hart & Hallman law firm.

After more than 20 years at the helm John V. Roach handed the reins of the Fort Worth Executive Roundtable to a pair of new leaders on Feb. 7. Reporter David Moreno captured Roach’s full remarks about the highs of his career including his tenure as CEO of RadioShack.

“I don’t think anyone really in our history has had more impact on the growth and evolution of business and innovation in our city” Berry said at the meeting when Roach stepped down.

Berry is likely right. Roach likely belongs up there on that mythical Mount Rushmore of Fort Worth leaders who have created immense change in the city —think Ben E. Keith Dee Kelly Sr. Sid Richardson the Bass family and Jim Wright.

Moreover Roach was as friendly and approachable as anyone who wields great power can be. Certainly for a journalist like me. He always had a quote a quip or a story I could use. He knew what we scribes needed and he wanted to provide it.

Sometimes he had more. I was asked to interview Roach for a technology group several years ago and I lept at the chance. I had covered RadioShack’s parent company Tandy Corp. when Roach was a leader there for several computer publications.

While at the time — the mid-to-late 1980s – I was primarily focused on the up-and-coming Dell Computer and Houston powerhouse Compaq I relished the opportunity to speak with someone from my Fort Worth hometown who spoke with a drawl.

Though technologically-savvy Roach was less concerned about bits and bytes than more technology-focused leaders like Michael Dell and Compaq’s Rod Canion. But you shouldn’t let Roach’s drawl and polite manners fool you; he was as sharp a businessman as they come.

It is probably hard to believe now but Fort Worth – via Tandy and Roach – was a technology powerhouse back in the day when computers were primarily sitting on one’s desktop and not in the palm of the hand.

Roach was born in Stamford Texas but his family relocated to Fort Worth when he was 4. He worked at his father’s store growing up and graduated from TCU joining RadioShack as a data processing manager in 1967. In the late ‘70s Roach had pushed RadioShack’s then-leader – Charles Tandy another Fort Worth legend – to enter the then small-but-growing computer business.

The ever-practical Tandy had agreed saying that if the computers didn’t sell RadioShack could use them in their stores to tally sales and inventory. The Fort Worth retailer which had about 8000 retail locations at the time debuted its computer in 1977 in New York. That was back when if you wanted national press for something you went to New York.

It didn’t look much like the computer we think of today. The $600 TRS-80 (the TRS was for Tandy RadioShack) included a monochrome monitor a keyboard and a cassette player that loaded and stored data. No matter its wonky look and lack of performance the company was overwhelmed with orders Roach recalled at the time.

During my conversation with Roach he also mentioned working with a young entrepreneur named Bill Gates who licensed the software needed to run the computer to Tandy.

Roach wanted to buy the software from Gates and his company but Gates then in his early 20s wanted to license the product. It was a strategy he would use with other computer manufacturers and one that would make him eventually one of the wealthiest people in the world.

Tandy’s interactions with Gates and Microsoft continued for many years. There’s a great blast-from-the-past ad featuring Bill Gates advertising Tandy computers from a 1983 RadioShack catalog.

Also in 1983 RadioShack launched one of the first commercial laptops working with Microsoft on the machine which had a built-in keyboard and a small eight-line display.

As a journalist at the time I remember those too. We cursed them and those small hard-to-read displays that are a far cry from the high-powered sharp displays we have today. But we had to have them traveling the world to cover the very industry that provided them.

Tandy rode high in the late 1980s on the heels of its personal computer sales and made a tidy profit to boot. But eventually time and technology ended Tandy’s reign as a computing giant. The by-then ubiquitous personal computers – most running Microsoft operating systems – left Tandy with few advantages. By the early 1990s other manufacturers were competing on price and service and RadioShack opted to sell their machines in their stores as well.

Roach was already taking a high-profile role in Fort Worth civic affairs as CEO of Tandy. In 1990 he took one in education after being elected chairman of TCU’s Board of Trustees. He made an impact there as well with the school’s endowment more than doubling to more than $1 billion during his tenure.

“His leadership of the Board of Trustees and University during a time of unprecedented change and growth has made TCU the top national university it is today” said TCU Chancellor Victor J. Boschini Jr. in a statement.

Roach didn’t leave the executive ranks for long taking the reins from another Fort Worth legend John Justin Jr. at Justin Industries.

Roach came in and led a restructuring that turned around the business in a little over a year and then received a phone call that changed the company and eventually Fort Worth.

He took a call from Warren Buffett leader of Berkshire Hathaway who eventually agreed to acquire the company for $600 million. It was the first Fort Worth-area acquisition for Buffett but not the last. The Omaha-based company would eventually add TTI BNSF Mouser Electronics and Acme Brick which was part of the Justin Industries acquisition.

I saw Roach several times over the years at official functions and recently at a small restaurant having lunch with longtime friend former TCU Chancellor Bill Tucker. I spoke with him in February after he handed over the gavel to the Executive Roundtable group that he had co-founded in the late ‘90s when he and many other local business leaders were retiring.

As always he was ready with a story about the founding of the group.

“Pier 1 was changing TCU was changing” Roach said. “The goal was to keep the people retiring involved with others in the community and bringing the new leadership up to day with the public and private partnerships that have served our city well. That was a big goal of the organization.”

“We wanted to be sure that everybody knew everybody basically. It’s perpetuated itself for 20 years or so.”

I’ll miss hearing that familiar drawl when he answers the phone but he left quite a legacy that we’ll be hearing about for a long time to come.

But inside Blackstone Inc. plans are afoot to develop its first private equity fund targeting such individuals as part of a project codenamed “BXPE.” The goal: build new war chests that would eventually gather tens of billions of dollars to invest in deals piped in from various Blackstone teams according to people with familiar of the matter.

The fund would potentially offer multimillionaires exposure to a swath of assets unavailable on public markets such as Silicon Valley unicorns closely held corporations and even stakes in other buyout shops said the people who asked not to be named because the discussions aren’t public. In contrast with the usual practice of locking up institutional investors’ money for years customers would have periodic opportunities to withdraw the people said.

It’s the latest effort by President Jon Gray to expand fundraising beyond pensions sovereign wealth funds and other sources able to pledge hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars in one go.

The firm co-founded by Steve Schwarzman became an $881 billion financial superstore by helping the biggest institutions chase returns higher than those typically achieved with stocks and bonds. Gray has said individuals are an $80 trillion market. Adding them as customers will bring Blackstone closer to a goal to running $1 trillion.

The firm has been hiring executives for the effort and staff have been carrying out research in the past year on how buyouts can be part of a fund for individual investors.

It’s unclear exactly how many millions of dollars someone will need to participate in the fund. Some Blackstone staff had hoped to design a vehicle for accredited investors with as little as about $1 million in net worth one of the people said. But that’s not on the table. Going so far downmarket would subject the fund to additional regulations potentially affecting the collection of carried interest and the extent to which it can make private-equity investments.

A spokeswoman for the company declined to comment. Blackstone’s plans may still evolve as internal discussions continue and as the industry pushes to loosen rules safeguarding investors from hard-to-sell investments.

Blackstone has developed other funds for smaller investors focusing on credit and real estate. Indeed the New York-based firm already oversees some $200 billion for individuals through wealth managers bank wirehouses and other channels that connect to smaller investors. Some new money in the past year went to a non-traded real estate investment trust known as BREIT. The fund has snapped up apartments industrial parks and shopping centers over the past half-decade to become a $54 billion force in the U.S. property market.

One reason why private equity firms are pursuing smaller investors is that the institutional fundraising circuit has gotten crowded. A benefit of creating a perpetual vehicle in which individuals can come and go is that it creates a longer-term source of fees.

While developing BXPE Blackstone has been thinking through how it will give customers the option to buy and sell stakes in the fund at multiple points in a year according to the people. The typical buyout fund locks up investor cash for a decade.

Blackstone’s executives have been urging regulators to give people more access to investment vehicles previously reserved for the most sophisticated investors. Legal chief John Finley for example weighed in before the Securities and Exchange Commission incrementally loosened rules defining accredited investors in 2020.

As companies delay selling shares to the public the number of companies listed on public markets is shrinking he said in January of that year.

“This is a fundamental change that regulators and the industry will have to deal with” he said."

Those participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will find many items that are eligible for purchase at Costco. All Costco locations accept EBT cards and adhere to the state’s laws on what can be purchased. Even if you don’t have an EBT card specifically whatever you load your SNAP benefits onto can be used at Costco. Buying at Costco specifically can be beneficial since purchasing items in bulk can save you more money than getting them at the local grocery store.

When it comes to midsize SUVs we need to separate two-row models from three-row models. Among the second group which one gets our Best Buy award for 2022? Answer: the same as last year.

Winner

Yep the Kia Telluride once again is the best three-row midsize SUV on the market in our opinion. The 2020 World Car of the Year keeps racking up awards and accolades since its debut two years ago.

Offering generous interior space a long list of features for the price and pleasant handling on top of that the Telluride is a well-rounded SUV. Let’s not forget the 291-horsepower V6 lying under the hood which is a strong yet flexible performer and a lot smoother than some turbocharged four-cylinder engines found in the competition.

Other Finalists

The Hyundai Palisade is a close runner-up obviously as it shares many components with the Telluride including the chassis and powertrain.

Handling is somehow not quite as dynamic however and all-wheel drive doesn’t come standard. We also think the interior is a bit too gaudy. But if you personally like it go ahead and buy a Palisade with confidence.

As for third place in the segment the Honda Pilot is our pick despite the current generation being around since 2016. The interior is roomy and family-friendly handling is always satisfying and the strong V6 engine delivers great performance especially at higher revs.

On the other hand the Pilot’s technology content and material selection are not on the same level as more recent competitors. Dependability is stellar though so you’ll still make a great purchase.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vY29zdGNvLWJlc3QtYmVhdXR5LXNraW4tY2FyZS1idXlzLWFjY29yZGluZy10by1zaG9wcGVyLXBob3Rvcy0yMDIyLTPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I Shop at Costco for Just Myself — Best Beauty Things I Get + Photos,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='businessinsider.mx', port=443): Read timed out.

Exchange traded funds that invest in fixed income are dominated by three leading providers: BlackRock Vanguard and State Street. But new regulations and rising demand for actively managed variants in this segment of the market are allowing more players to make their mark.

Fixed-income ETFs had until recently been skewed towards products that passively track different tranches of the bond market. At one end of the spectrum stands BlackRock’s LQD fund which gives investors broad exposure to the US investment-grade corporate bond market. Or for a more targeted strategy investors could seek out Vanguard’s short-term inflation-protected bond ETF (VTIP) for example.

However the adoption of new rules by the US Securities and Exchange Commission in 2019 has made it easier for actively managed ETFs to be launched. Since then a wave of ETFs often developed by smaller asset managers has flooded the market.

Actively managed ETFs allow providers to distinguish themselves by their particular bond-selection strategies. And they also allow their managers to generate bigger profits: the average fee among US actively managed bond ETFs is about 0.5 per cent according to Morningstar compared with 0.3 per cent for passive indexed funds.

This may partly explain their proliferation. While fixed-income ETFs are growing at about the same pace as the broader ETF market — roughly 23 per cent over the past five years — actively managed fixed-income funds are growing at nearly twice that pace: 43 per cent according to Capital Group.

Since the beginning of 2021 65 of the 105 new fixed-income ETFs that have come to market in the US have been actively managed according to Morningstar. Net flows into actively managed bond ETFs were also the largest on record in 2021 according to EPFR data.

Passive strategies still dominate though: in the US active bond ETFs had $26.5bn of net flows in 2021 while traditional passive ETFs had $161.3bn. Globally active bond ETFs pulled in a net $32.7bn versus $218.4bn in passive funds.

“What rule 6c-11 [the new regulation adopted by the SEC in 2019] did was really democratise the ability to bring new ETFs to market” explains Holly Framsted the head of ETFs at Capital Group who previously worked at BlackRock.

In February Capital Group made its first foray into the ETF market with six actively managed funds five of which are in equities and one in fixed income.

“There is a large opportunity for us to see greater diversification among the premiere ETF providers just as there is broad diversification among the premiere asset managers in the mutual fund space today” she says.

The emergence of new entrants has been helped by the broader adoption of fixed income funds by investors.

“You look more broadly at the ways bond ETFs have taken root in the fixed income ecosystem” says Ben Johnson director of global exchange traded fund research at Morningstar. “People trading bond ETFs now sit side by side with their peers that are trading bonds whereas they used to be pushed off in a corner doing their own thing.”

Part of this shift in the market can be attributed to demographic trends that have increased demand for fixed income instruments — in many developed economies a growing percentage of people are in or near retirement and are therefore inclined to rebalance their portfolios away from stocks and towards bonds.

In addition to the growth in active bond funds ETF providers have also expanded their offerings in other areas. Fixed-income ETFs linked to environmental social and corporate governance concerns have been in high demand for the past few years and new ESG investment vehicles have continued to proliferate.

Net flows into ESG and socially responsible fixed-income ETFs last year reached $102.1bn — an all-time high surpassing the previous record of $61.3bn in 2020 according to data from EPFR.

BlackRock remains best known for its large indexed bond ETFs but it continues to develop products with exposure to more niche segments of the market including in ESG.

Carolyn Weinberg global head of product for iShares and indexed investments at BlackRock says ESG investing “has been a huge growth area”. She says widely used funds such as LQD and HYG are “important vehicles of price discovery” in the market — but “high liquidity of 96000 trades a day is not what we’re looking for from all of our ETFs.”

ESG offerings in the fixed income arena are not limited to passive vehicles either. Fidelity this year launched an actively managed high-yield sustainable ETF. “We were looking for a way to differentiate ourselves in the market” says Benjamin Harrison who along with Michael Cheng manages the Fidelity Sustainable High Yield ETF (FSYD).

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the consequent market turmoil have only driven up demand for fixed-income assets as investors seek safe ways to stash cash.

Inflows into fixed-income ETFs have increased since the middle of February after investors pulled $1.2bn from the funds in January — the first month of outflows in bond ETFs since the start of the pandemic according to EPFR data.

But the problems that had investors concerned in January may create challenges ahead for bond ETFs.

Returns on bonds are particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates — so as central banks globally tighten monetary policy to tamp down inflation investors could be caught out by higher yields and lower prices.

Groceries cost more gas costs more everything seems to cost more. This past week the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in an effort to tame the highest inflation in 40 years.

The cost of rent is really through the roof. Residential rents across the country went up an average of 15% last year – nearly twice the overall inflation rate. That's particularly painful for tenants because according to Census Bureau data they now often have to spend as much as half their total income on rent.

Why are rents rising so much? Well it turns out that big Wall Street firms are playing a role but we found the fundamental problem was years in the making…and will take years to fix.

Lesley Stahl: How much did your rent go up?

Justin Blocki: They attempted to raise it $400 a month.

That would have been a 40% jump for Justin Blocki and Brittney House. She's a nursing student and he's an occupational therapist in Jacksonville Florida. When they first rented their apartment a year and a half ago they were paying just over a thousand dollars a month.

Justin Blocki and Brittney House

Justin Blocki: I eventually came to terms with them for a 30% increase which was $300.

Lesley Stahl: Still 30%--

Justin Blocki: I've never heard of anything like that.

Lesley Stahl: Do you know why your rent jumped that much?

Justin Blocki: They told me the market justified it. And they were right. Because I looked at 30 other apartments and they were all way too-- too much for us to afford.

Lesley Stahl: So when your rent goes up 30% what's the impact? Are you having to give things up?

Brittney House: Yeah our fridge is-- does not look the same as last year before our lease.

Lesley Stahl: Really--

Brittney House: It's-- yeah--

Lesley Stahl: You're really cutting back on groceries.

Brittney House: Yeah.

Daryl Fairweather: It's pretty much universally true rents are going up all around the country. But it's even more severe in migration destinations. Like the sunbelt of the country Austin Phoenix Florida. A lotta people are moving there and there's just more demand for rents.

Daryl Fairweather is the chief economist at Redfin a nationwide real estate brokerage firm that pulls together real-time statistics on both the sales and rental markets. For example their numbers show that rents increased 31% in Jacksonville last year 40% in Austin Texas.

Lesley Stahl: What's causing this?

Daryl Fairweather: We are not building enough housing for everybody who needs a place to live. We built fewer homes in the 2010s than in any decade going back to the 1960s and at the same time millennials are the biggest generation and they're entering into home-buying age. Millennials aren't living in their parents' basement any more or shacking up with roommates they want a place of their own and we didn't build any housing for them in the last decade because we are still so traumatized by the last housing crisis. We didn't put any investment into housing.

Daryl Fairweather

In the economic crisis of 2008 and 2009 construction of new housing came to a grinding halt. But even when the economy recovered home construction didn't.

Lesley Stahl: So how big is the rental shortage in the United States?

Daryl Fairweather: The government has estimated that we are short about 4 million homes in this country and that number is likely growing especially since the pandemic.

Lesley Stahl: 4 million shy.

Daryl Fairweather: Yes. That's the hole that we're in that we need to build ourselves out of.

Lesley Stahl: That number 4 million is that mainly in the south and southwest? Or does that include New York City and San Francisco?

Daryl Fairweather: That's the entire country.

With something as essential as housing in such short supply you'd have to figure that Wall Street would see an opportunity buying modest single-family houses the kind you'd see on any middle class suburban street and then renting them out.

Daryl Fairweather: In places like Jacksonville Atlanta Charlotte investors are buying almost 30% of the homes that are available for regular home buyers.

Gary Berman: This is a home we bought. This is 3518 Shiner Drive in Jacksonville.

Lesley Stahl: Right.

Gary Berman: This home is 1700 square feet.

Lesley Stahl: How many bedrooms?

Gary Berman: Three bedrooms. Two baths. It was built about three years ago.

Gary Berman is CEO of Tricon Residential a Toronto-based company that has quietly become one of the largest owners of single-family homes in the United States.

Gary Berman: So today we own about 30000 single family rental homes across the U.S. largely in the Sun Belt. And we've got probably about 75000 people living in our homes.

Lesley Stahl: You are a multi-billion dollar company. You're publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

Gary Berman: Correct.

Lesley Stahl: And the--

Gary Berman: Toronto Stock Exchange.

Lesley Stahl: --Toronto Stock Exchange. I even read in one of your own documents that your revenue went up last year by 67%? Is that correct?

Gary Berman: Yeah-- we're expanding. I mean when you think about it we have an incredible amount of demand for what we do. So Lesley in any given week we might have two or 300 homes available.

Lesley Stahl: For renting?

Gary Berman: For renting. And we get about 10000 leasing inquiries a week.

Gary Berman

Tricon is trying to buy 800 houses a month and there are companies even bigger. Invitation Homes owns more than 80000 rental houses American Homes 4 Rent close to 60000. Some of the all stars of finance – Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Blackstone - have put hundreds of millions of dollars into these companies. They all offer rental homes online and all focus on the sunbelt.

Gary Berman: Our largest-- portfolio w-- would be in Atlanta in Charlotte in Phoenix in Tampa.

Lesley Stahl: And those are the cities that young millennials are flocking to?

Gary Berman: This is where Americans wanna be. We're finding that Americans are moving from the Northeast from the Midwest to move to the Sun Belt because taxes are lower. It's a friendlier business environment. It's better weather. And so there's a movement taking place. And the pandemic unleashed powerful nesting trends and work-from-home trends.

Lesley Stahl: Nesting trends?

Gary Berman: Powerful nesting trends. When we survey our residents 'Why did they move-- to be with us?' The number one reason is they want more space.

Lesley Stahl: Big investment companies like yours are being blamed for this huge increase in rents across the country. And you can set the rent any way you want really given the demand you're talking about.

Gary Berman: First. I mean corporate landlords represent 2% of all single-family rental housing. So there's a lot more going on than just corporate landlords bidding up homes. It's a very competitive and difficult environment.

It's true that big investors don't own nearly as many houses as mom-and-pop landlords people who might have just a few properties. But big firms like Tricon do play a larger – and growing – role in the sunbelt cities where they're active.

Rent increases are all over the map: 35% in New York but just 9% in Chicago. 29% in Portland only 10% in LA. And in only one big city were rents actually down last year: Kansas City.

Berman says Tricon strictly caps how much it will raise rent on existing tenants when they renew their leases.

Lesley Stahl: But let's say I had come in as a new renter here. Would the rent here be 30% more than it was about a year ago?

Gary Berman: It could be. Because it-- we-- when we come in and buy a home we have to pay a market price for the home. And then we have to set a market rent right?

Here are two examples of homes Tricon recently bought in Jacksonville. This one they're charging 40% higher rent than the previous owner asked this one 30% higher.

These before-and-after pictures taken by Tricon show how they fix up many of the houses they buy. They also have a fleet of trucks and technicians to service them.

Gary Berman: This is-- a standard Tricon home.

Lesley Stahl: And you put in the kitchen? These-- you put in the appliances--

Gary Berman: This home was built three years ago. We put in about $15000. Most of our homes are a little bit older. We probably put in about twenty or $25000. This is very typical of what our product looks like when you move into it. It's in move-in-ready condition. It's broom swept.

Lesley Stahl: And if things go wrong-- if there's a leak--

Gary Berman: If things go wrong--

Lesley Stahl: We call you.

Gary Berman: If we have a leaky faucet or the-- you know oven or microwave's not working you will call us. You'll call and our maintenance techs will come and-- and service the home.

The houses Tricon and other investors are buying in places like Jacksonville are what might be called ""starter homes"" usually selling for about $300000. When one of those comes on the market investors are ready with all-cash offers.

Heather Kruayai: I would say probably a third of the listings that I'm putting up are getting investor offers.

Heather Kruayai

Heather Kruayai is a Redfin real estate agent in Jacksonville. She represents both buyers and sellers.

Heather Kruayai: You are seeing a lot of these Wall Street investors that are coming in. You know you put a house on the market and within an hour I'm getting offers full price cash. And so these-- the sellers are seeing that and-- ""Oh okay. Cash. We can close in 15 days."" It's very enticing to people when they see that offer come across.

Lesley Stahl: So when you sell are you having to stage the house? Paint it? Put furniture in make it look really nice?

Heather Kruayai: Not now. It's not necessary now in this-- this way the way the market's going now. You really don't need to do anything to your house to sell it. Typically the-- investors never look at the home. Never.

Lesley Stahl: They don't even look at the home?

Heather Kruayai: They never look at it.

That plus the fact that investors often waive inspections puts would-be first-time home buyers at a serious disadvantage. Before they can even see a starter house it's gone.

Justin Blocki: Most people our age are not gonna be able to have $350000 in liquid cash.

Justin and Brittney the young Jacksonville couple facing steep rent increases are starting to lose hope they'll ever be able to buy a home.

Even Tricon's own presentation to investors says quote ""homeownership is increasingly out of reach.""

Gary Berman: In our portfolio the majority cannot buy a home. Cannot afford to buy a home or don't have the credit to buy the home. So for example they may have student debt or they may have medical debt. And therefore they can't qualify to get a mortgage. And if they want access to a single family home which we think's incredibly important this is the best way to-- for them to obtain it.

I think if you asked a lot of millennials and that tends to be our primary resident-- they would probably tell you they don't necessarily desire to own a home or to own a car. They've grown up in the sharing economy. And for what's important to them is lifestyle right? And so if they can move into this what we call a turnkey or a hotel ready home and have a low-maintenance lifestyle that's very compelling for them. Very compelling.

Lesley Stahl: We were told by the head of one of these big companies that people your age want to rent that you're not as interested in buying a house.

Justin Blocki: No. I mean (LAUGH) I think the American Dream is owning your own property and having your own dirt that you own. And that's specifically why we moved here was to own a house.

Brittney House: I realize my first house is probably going to be a starter home. It may not be that dream house but it's a house. It's a home. Now the-- our dream is now unattainable. It's-- it's very-- it's disturbing.

Daryl Fairweather: Most people desire that single-family home with the picket fence. And if they can't buy it because they can't afford it their only option is to rent it.

Lesley Stahl: Yeah but the investor's buying it.

Daryl Fairweather: Yeah and they're getting that wealth that normally or in previous years would've gone to the person living there.

Lesley Stahl: So what's happened to the American dream? When we used to say that it meant owning a house. What's the American dream now?

Gary Berman: Well if we think the American dream is-- is embodied in a suburban home with a yard and-- and a white picket fence then I think we're making the American dream much more accessible.

Lesley Stahl: Rent your American dream.

Gary Berman: You can rent the American dream.

That is if you can afford the rent.

Energia All-Ireland Cup Finals Reaction: Title Delight For Railway And Blackrock

Match Photo Gallery: Cooke 12 Blackrock College 24

With her side trailing 12-7 experienced centre Shiels kicked a penalty before half-time and then converted her own try and Maggie Boylan’s 56th-minute effort for a hard-earned 24-12 win.

Coming into the final with three straight wins Cooke laid down an early marker as tries from Katie Hetherington and Naomi McCord propelled them into a 12-10 half-time lead.

Blackrock hit back with a Judy Bobbett score converted by Shiels before they kicked it up a gear in the second half despite Ann-Marie Rooney’s sin-binning.

It was a superb performance from Cooke but Blackrock’s greater experience told as they ended the season with silverware bouncing back from their recent All-Ireland League final defeat to Railway Union.

Ulster captain Beth Cregan was central to Cooke’s strong start in the sunny conditions her quick-tapping of penalties producing two early try-scoring chances.

Helen McGhee was pulled back for a forward pass from Amanda Morton but the quick-thinking Cregan brought Cooke up to the line again in the fifth minute and flanker Hetherington was able to lunge over from the ruck.

Following Morton’s missed conversion Blackrock who were without their 15s and Sevens internationals wasted little time in threatening a levelling score with former international Shiels and their pacy back-three making headway.

Blackrock also sought a high tempo with Lisa Mullen’s quick tap and pass allowing powerful lock Bobbett to barge over to the right of the posts. Shiels converted for a 7-5 ‘Rock lead.

Cooke moved back in front midway through the half a typically forceful carry from Ilse van Staden igniting the attack and a sidestepping Dolores Hughes gaining further ground out wide.

Centres Lucy Thompson and Kelly McCormill brought them closer before another quick tap from Cregan paved the way for their second try athletic lock McCord breaking in behind the posts with Morton supplying the extras.

Cooke’s defence then stood firm despite a brilliant break from deep by Blackrock full-back Boylan. Meadbh Scally carried closer in but the ever-influential Cregan managed to hold her up.

Ben Martin’s Blackrock side had a late purple patch approaching the interval maintaining their presence in the Cooke half and a Shiels penalty to cut the gap to just two points.

The Meath woman increased her influence on the restart threatening from a chip-and-chase before she used scrum ball to wriggle free from two defenders and touch down on a clever burst to the whitewash.

Shiels converted her own try edging the Dubliners into a 17-12 lead and with Boylan and Caoimhe O’Callaghan showing their speed in the wide channels Cooke’s defensive workload was ramping up.

It took its toll in the 56th minute Mairead Holohan going close with a strong carry before a neat necklace of passes via Mullen captain Val Power Shiels and Ellen Taite freed up Boylan to make it 22-12.

Shiels’ deft conversion cleared the crossbar to take her tally to 14 points but Cooke knuckled down looking to profit from Rooney’s sin-binning for a high tackle on the hour mark.

With their scrum becoming more of a weapon Cooke hammered away and excellent number 8 India Daley and van Staden did get them into try-scoring range.

However Blackrock kept them out a combination of Shiels and Scally earning a relieving penalty and they closed out the game in Cooke territory grinding out a deserved result in the end.

Concrete plans are now in the works for a long-awaited memorial to honour the Irish community in Quebec.

Construction is set to begin in 2025 on a memorial park commemorating the imprint of the Irish in Quebec society.

The Point-Saint-Charles park will facilitate access to Black Rock a stone monument commemorating Irish immigrants who died of typhus on their way to Canada

The monument located near the Victoria Bridge stands atop the burial grounds of roughly 6000 of these immigrants many of whom left their homeland to flee the potato famine in the 1800s.

The Irish Monument Park Foundation has spent more than a decade fighting for a proper memorial here.

“Much of the history has been lost people aren’t that familiar with it” said foundation representative Fergus Keyes.

Irish newcomers helped lay the foundations of Montreal digging the Lachine canal laying the bricks St. Patrick’s Basilica and building the Victoria Bridge.

It was during that last construction that Irish workers uncovered the bodies of their compatriots.

“Whenever I’d drive past this stone my grandfather would say ‘that’s yours don’t forget it’” said Victor Boyle another representative for the Irish Monument Park Foundation.

He wants to honour his grandfather and his entire community by ensuring the memory lives on.

The city has pledged $15 million to make that a reality.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kdW5kYWxrZGVtb2NyYXQuaWUvbmV3cy9ob21lLzc2OTk1OC90cmlwLXRocm91Z2gtdGltZS10aGUtbG9ha2Vycy1pbi1ibGFja3JvY2stYW5kLXNvbWUtc3Rvcmllcy1hYm91dC1kdW5kYWxrLWJheS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trip Through Time: The Loakers in Blackrock and some stories about Dundalk Bay,"Since I wrote about the area on the way into Blackrock Village from Dundalk called ‘The Loakers’ I have received several interesting comments from local people about the origins of the name.

It appears from these reflections that local poet Noel Sharkey was correct when he suggested that it comes from the Irish for rushes ‘An luachain’.

One of the most interesting communications however comes from my good friend Charlie McCarthy of the Coast Guards House who has provided me with much valuable information about this unusual part of Dundalk Bay that stretches from the Soldiers Point to McGuigan’s Rock where Blackrock proper begins.

He refers to an old journalist Jim Conlon who lived in a house he called ‘St. Gerard’s’ on the slope overlooking the entrance to the Village before you come to The Square which must have been the original fishing settlement which became known as ‘The black rocks’ because of the colour of the sharp rocks that stick up out of the sand for a couple of miles.

I knew Jim very well because when I started journalism with the Dundalk Democrat he was the Editor of the old Examiner newspaper in Clanbrassil Street which ceased publication in the early 1960s.

Jim then joined the staff of the Argus and he was also a prolific correspondent for the Irish Press and for many years provided the overprints with local news and sports results for the Evening Press from a premise in the Demesne.

What I had not realised was that Charlie McCarthy himself had grown up in that part of Blackrock and apart from his extensive marine knowledge has a great understanding of that area of Dundalk Bay.

This knowledge in turn sparked my own memories of that part of County Louth which goes back for the best part of a century.

It made me realise that this area on the outskirts of Dundalk has changed perhaps more than any other part of the environs.

It would be an understatement to write that it has become urbanised over the past century and that much of the character of that part of Dundalk Bay has changed utterly!

To begin I would point out to my readers that 150 years ago it must have been nearly impossible to approach The Square area of Blackrock by this route and Dundalk people would have had to go miles out of their way to get to the Promenade at Blackrock by way of the Dublin Road.

That area where the Sea Rampart ends would have been a lonely and desolate place that was covered by tidal sea water for much of the time and a place where wild life species of birds and fishes that have long disappeared lived and thrived.

My own first memories of that road through The Loakers was being pushed in a ‘go-car’ the old name of a child’s buggy by my mother on the road past the ‘Broken Turn’ to the sands at Blackrock.

I can still recall that it was usual for the high tide to come right up to the road and sometimes the road itself would be flooded and we might have to turn back.

Sometime later I think about the time when World War II started my father used to carry me on the bar of his high bicycle to a little cove that existed at the foot of McGuigan’s Rock where we could bathe in the sparkling waters of the Bay.

People could not do that these days as houses have been built over the entrance to that cove and the green vegetation has spread right over to the Rock to cover the sands.

I describe this area as ‘sand’ but it was mostly a dark muddy surface which some Dundalk people believed had a curative quality and would squelch through it to try cure their feet of imperfections.

I recall my father telling me that Mrs Donnelly who had a chemist shop in Park Street and had a summer house at Blackrock had assured him that to walk through this mud was good for the feet and that she herself would do this regularly!

Another thing I remembered about that stretch of the Bay was that Jim Conlon pointed out a part of it where he and his siblings (he was a member of a large family who were children of of a caretaker employed on the Whitworth Estate which was later purchased by the Dundalk Golf Course) used to gather shell-fish for food in his home.

One of his stories that intrigued me was the method by which they gathered razor fish which he described as being ‘delicious to eat when boiled’!

He said after the tide receded two of them would run would run out with a long rope and knock over the long razor fish when they would rise out of the sand; otherwise he said the shell fish would be nearly impossible to collect because they could quickly slide back under the mud when they sensed footsteps approaching.

Another subject that I recall Jim telling me about was that it appears local business people had believed that they might be able to reclaim land from the sea on the shores of Dundalk Bay.

It appears that somebody had contacted a Dutch marine expert who had been involved in the reclaiming of the Polders from the Zider Sea and persuaded him to come over to look at the Dundalk Bay with a view to doing the same here.

According to Jim this Dutch engineer had told the sponsors of this project that he would build a dyke for them from about Gyles Quay to Annagassan for the amount of gold sovereigns that could be laid side by side across the distance.

Needless to say according to Jim this would have been a lot more than could be raised in Ireland at the time.

Now Jim was not above embroidering a good yarn but there may well have been some truth in his story - one has to wonder if given modern engineering machinery and the growing need for more land because of increasing populations at some time in the future such a project might be undertaken?"

In many histories of Samuel Slater’s mill there is a reference to a Black man providing power for Slater’s earliest machines. Two early records provide initial clues. In one record book the newly arrived Slater was given money to pay a man named “Samuel Prime for turning the wheel.”1 In October 1790 Slater received money for his investors to pay for hire of “the black man who turned [provided power] for him.”2

These account books are sparse. A more detailed (and possibly fabricated) story was published in the 1870s. Massena Goodrich’s Historical Sketch of the Town of Pawtucket (1876) described Slater’s early “operations” and offered significant detail on the man named Prime. “What power was needed was supplied by a wheel propelled by an aged negro of the name of Prime. He boasted a fuller name or a brace of them — Samuel Primus or Primus Jenks. Having once been a slave of some of the Jenkses he bore that reminder of his former relation to them.”

Did this worker really have “a brace” of names? Or was this simply a case of careless recordkeeping? Over time the identity of the man who worked directly with Slater on these first machines has become difficult to determine. The 1790 census shows that a Primus Jenckes lived in Smithfield RI and a Primus Hopkins lived in Providence RI. This worker could be one of these men or someone else entirely.

Other records do suggest that there was precedent for this type of arrangement. Prior to Slater’s arrival in the United States merchants in Providence RI were experimenting with textiles machinery. The machinist David Wilkinson recalled that some work on “a machine for carding cotton” took place in the 1780s. One “card was put in operation in the Market House chamber in Providence and was turned by a colored man named Prince Hopkins [.]” Wilkinson also provides an unsubstantiated detail about Hopkins’s war service unsure as to how he “lost one leg I think and one arm…a few years before.”

The confusion over Hopkins and the question of who did the turning for Slater point to the lack of care and attention given to Black laborers in Rhode Island. In some cases writing a fuller biography may not be possible. What can be determined is the significance of Black workers in this early period before Black people were barred from working in such mills.

A Pawtucket Gazette and Chronicle article on Slater’s “Yellow Mill” includes the important note that in addition to “the cotton factory they had a grist mill and an oil mill…these last two were under the direction of a colored man by the name of “Prince.”’3 There are also records of other Black laborers including a “Black John” or “John Bucklin” living and working within Slater’s world. Bucklin was employed by the Wilkinsons in a different mill. Early on a man named Sylvester Daby was also paid by Almy and Brown “for baskets” in December 1789. Men referred to as “Black Prince” and “Underwood” also appear in passing in historical records from the time.

John Prince Sylvester and Primus or Prime or Samuel were on the ground floor of important developments in the textiles industry in the United States. Though their contributions have not been recognized with consistency or clarity these and other Black workers were essential to the industrial revolution.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbmd0aWFuZGkuY29tL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlL2JsYWNrc3RvbmUtc2VsbHMtMzAtamFwYW5lc2UtcmVzaWRlbnRpYWwtYXNzZXRzLXRvLW1nLXJlYWwtZXN0YXRlLWZvci00MjRtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,M&G Buys Japan Multi-Family Properties From Blackstone,"UK-based asset manager M&G Real Estate has acquired a portfolio of 30 residential properties in key Japanese cities from Blackstone for JPY 49.2 billion ($424.3 million).

The purchase comprises 1575 apartments across Tokyo Osaka and Nagoya and was made on behalf of the M&G Asia Property Fund bringing the vehicle’s assets under management in Japan’s multifamily sector to JPY 109.3 billion ($942.6 million) M&G said Friday in a release.

“Japanese multifamily residential has proven itself through various economic shocks highlighting the ability of the asset class to enhance risk-adjusted returns for core investors” said Richard van den Berg manager of M&G Asia Property Fund.

An M&G representative told Mingtiandi that the seller was a global alternative investment management company. A person familiar with the deal identified the vendor as Blackstone with JLL advising the US private equity giant on the disposal.

Market Springs to Life

The portfolio’s flagship assets include the 2007-vintage Grace Residence Tokyo a 12-storey building near Hatchobori railway station in the capital’s Chuo special ward and the Luxe Shin-Osaka I & II complex developed by local builder Chinju and owned by Singapore’s Straits Trading from its completion in 2016 until late 2019.

The big-ticket transaction comes after a Japan rental residential market that set new records in 2020 fell back to earth last year. Transactions of rental apartment assets fell 59 percent year-on-year in 2021’s fourth quarter to JPY 119.3 billion and dropped 40 percent to JPY 602.5 billion for the full year according to a recent report by Real Capital Analytics.

Benjamin Chow RCA’s head of real estate research for Asia noted that 2020’s standout volume included deals like Blackstone’s JPY 300 billion ($2.7 billion) acquisition of the Anbang residential portfolio and AXA IM’s JPY 70 billion ($669 million) purchase of a Tokyo apartment portfolio.

Blackstone had bought back the 221 rental apartments from troubled insurer Anbang in Japan’s biggest-ever real estate transaction after selling them to the Chinese firm for about JPY 260 billion three years earlier.

Walking the Walk

M&G Real Estate entered Japan’s residential market as early as 2014. The firm’s previous deals in the country include the 2018 purchase of a portfolio of residential buildings in Chiba Fukuoka and Osaka for $83.7 million which marked the firm’s fifth acquisition in the country since the launch of its core Asia property strategy in 2006.

M&G paid $50 million for two Osaka residential buildings containing 280 units in a deal announced last May.

During an online briefing in January M&G executives said healthy demand for real estate in Japan’s major cities would drive growth in Asia’s second-largest economy this year. Van den Berg reiterated that conviction in Friday’s statement saying the latest portfolio acquisition would bolster the resilience of M&G Asia Property Fund from an income stability perspective.

“Our increased allocation to the residential sector also provides diversification benefits as residential assets are often regarded as counter-cyclical investments relative to the commercial office and retail sectors” the fund manager said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZnJhbmtsaW5vYnNlcnZlci50b3duLm5ld3MvZy9mcmFua2xpbi10b3duLW1hL24vNzA1MzkvZmlyc3QtcmVzcG9uZGVyLWxvZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,First Responder Log,"Thursday Evening March 15 Chief Lynch and the Town Council recognized recent Police Department promotions and a new hire to the department.

Then came the COVID-19 pandemic and we saw British Airways Virgin Atlantic and Qantas all bid farewell to the ""Queen of the Skies"" in a relatively short period of time.

At this point when it comes to the Boeing 747 I take nothing for granted — nothing.

The mere existence of the 747's upper deck is an ironic story of how Boeing designers and engineers thought the jumbo jet would ultimately have a limited passenger role.

During the design phase of the 747 in the 1960s the Boeing 2707 supersonic transport (SST) was on the horizon and that was believed to be the future of passenger air transportation. In Joe Sutter's book ""747: Creating the World's First Jumbo Jet and Other Adventures from a Life in Aviation"" the manager of Boeing's 747 design team describes how the Queen's distinct bulge was created to allow for easy loading of cargo through the aircraft's nose — Boeing's bet that the 747 would live on mostly as a freighter.

The American SST never happened and 52 years after the 747 entered service with Pan Am the plane is still hauling passengers across oceans and around the world.

It's also a very popular freighter. In fact the last 747 produced is scheduled to roll out of Boeing's gargantuan Everett Washington factory by the end of this year.

But given the events of the last few years it feels like the 747 passenger variants are something of an endangered species even though the newest generation of the 747-8 variant only entered service 10 years ago.

So when I saw that Lufthansa (an early and prominent 747 operator) was bringing the Queen back to my home airport of George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) in Houston after its second COVID-era absence I knew I had to jump at the opportunity to fly on it. What better way to savor the moment than by flying on the upper deck a truly magical AvGeek experience?

My girlfriend and I had a large stash of Avianca LifeMiles that we purchased before the pandemic and wanted to use. We knew we wanted to go to Europe and we noticed that flying round trip in business class to Frankfurt including the return on the Queen was within our budget.

So we went for it. For 122760 LifeMiles and $211.17 in fees each we flew to Frankfurt Airport (FRA) on Air Canada via Toronto Pearson International Airport (YYZ) and returned on the Queen.

That return flight was worth every mile and penny. The chance to ride on the upper deck of a 747 for the first time was the part of the trip I was looking forward to the most. Could you blame me?

The experience

Entering a Boeing 747 always feels like you're walking into a vast cathedral of modern engineering — it's huge! Not Airbus A380 huge of course but when boarding one of these incredible machines you never feel like you're entering a metal tube. (I was on a plane recently that very much felt like a metal tube so I can confidently say that the 747 feels very different.)

Entering the Queen through door 1L and passing through the downstairs business-class cabin I felt a tad bit bad for the people in those seats who wouldn't get to experience the upper deck (in truth unless they were AvGeeks like me they probably didn't care). Any 747 experience is great but my business-class experience on the upper deck would truly be special I said to myself.

While schlepping a rollaboard bag up the 747's staircase wasn't the easiest thing in the world it was more than worth it. It's certainly easier than it would have been on earlier 747 variants which featured a now-iconic spiral staircase. I quickly noticed the two windows over the staircase — a new feature for the 747-8. Those windows even had their own window shades.

The first thing that hits you when you reach the upper deck for the first time is that this is not a narrow-body experience bolted to the top of a wide-body plane. It really does feel wider and more spacious especially when configured in a common 2-2 business-class configuration.

Not only does the upper deck feature Boeing's modern space bins — a design hallmark of the 787 Dreamliner and late-model 737s — but it also has a ton of extra storage space in the form of side bins. These deep side bins were large enough to hold two backpacks and were more convenient than having to store personal items in the overhead bin as is common when flying a premium cabin product. It also served as a convenient shelf to store pre-departure beverages plus service items like pillows during the flight.

The side bins really made Lufthansa's somewhat-dated business-class hard product — one that lacks industry-standard direct-aisle access — a lot much better.

As for the flight itself it was great. There were three flight attendants serving the upper deck: two who interacted more with passengers and a third who was working the galley assist position (yes the upper deck has its own galley). The service felt more personalized as a result — yet another perk to sitting upstairs.

Bottom line

The 747's upper deck is a unique AvGeek mecca that enthusiasts should experience in the next few years before the remaining passenger variants are retired or converted to freighters. Lufthansa's 747-8s could easily fly passengers for another decade as could Korean Air's and Air China's but there's truly no way to know for sure just how much time we have left to fly this plane at any of the airlines still flying it.

This summer Lufthansa has plans for an expanded 747 schedule from its Frankfurt hub which will include both the 747-400 and the 747-8. Here's where you can find it this June:

Booking a business-class seat on Lufthansa via the airline's Star Alliance partners including Avianca LifeMiles (as I did) United MileagePlus and Air Canada Aeroplan is not particularly difficult especially if you're flexible. After all you can transfer American Express Membership Rewards points Capital One miles and Citi ThankYou points to LifeMiles and Aeroplan as well as Chase Ultimate Rewards points to MileagePlus.

The airline is looking to launch a tender to find a replacement for its existing 737 fleet.

Its fleet currently consists of almost 40 Boeing 737 all but two being 737 NG. Due to the pandemic only 27 Boeing 737-800 and one 737 Max 8 are active at the moment. Royal Air Maroc was originally due to receive four Boeing 737 Max 8 but the company decided to cancel two of them. It no longer has any outstanding aircraft orders.

Speaking to International Flight Network on Thursday 17th March Royal Air Maroc Chairman of the Board and CEO Abdelhamid Addou said that the airline will open a tender for a 737 NG replacement next year. He indicated that it is not certain the company would ‘automatically’ pick the Boeing 737 Max over the competing Airbus A320neo even though it already operates two Max planes. At an earlier press conference on the same day the CEO said there are currently no plans to order more Boeing 737 Max.

The airline removed a total of ten aircraft from its fleet during the Covid-19 pandemic consisting of seven that were sold to cut costs and three where leasing contracts were not extended. Royal Air Maroc became the first African member of the Oneworld alliance in 2020 amid the pandemic.

It specializes in offering transfer connections to various west and central African destinations. Since it is the only African member Royal Air Maroc serves as the Oneworld hub on the continent. The airline says the alliance is proving to be helpful in expanding its international market share among transfer passengers. It is looking to further expand its African connections and return to pre-pandemic levels within the next two to three years.

Boeing P-8A team members and Spirit AeroSystems employees have laid the keel beam for New Zealand’s first P-8A. This process also called ‘keeling’ was done at the Spirit AeroSystems facility where all Boeing 737 fuselages nacelles and pylons are designed and built. Laying the keel is an important production milestone during the build of any ship or aircraft and represents the cornerstone of this latest P-8.

Rosemary Banks New Zealand’s ambassador to the United States who was on hand to witness the keeling said “Today’s keeling ceremony is the beginning of a new era for New Zealand’s maritime patrol and response capability. Our four P-8A Poseidons will better equip our defense forces to extend their reach into the Pacific and beyond working with our partners and friends.”

An aircraft keel runs the length of the fuselage belly. Due to the innovative in-line approach to the build of commercial derivative aircraft pioneered on the P-8A the keel beam on a P-8 is different from the typical 737 keel beam. The P-8 keel includes unique aspects of the P-8 configuration such as the integration of an internal weapons bay.

“The excitement of seeing this come together was contagious” said Brian Stuart P-8 program manager for New Zealand. “Not only are we kicking off the journey to the first New Zealand P-8A delivery but we are strengthening our relationships with suppliers like Spirit as well as our U.S. Navy and Royal New Zealand Air Force customers.”

The panel and other fuselage components will be completed on Spirit’s existing 737 production line. Spirit will ship the P-8A fuselage to a Boeing Commercial Airplanes facility in Renton Washington for final assembly. After that Boeing Defense Space & Security employees will install mission systems and complete testing prior to delivery to New Zealand later this year.

In total four Boeing P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft will eventually replace New Zealand’s current fleet of six aging P-3K2 Orion aircraft providing advanced capabilities to maintain situational awareness in neighboring waters on and below the surface of the ocean.

The New Zealand Defence Force is a P-8 foreign military sales customer and is one of eight global customers. Current P-8 operators include the U.S. Navy the Royal Australian Air Force the Indian Navy United Kingdom’s Royal Air Force and Norway’s Royal Norwegian Air Force.

To date the global operating P-8 fleet has amassed more than 400000 mishap-free flight hours. The P-8 is a long-range anti-submarine warfare anti-surface warfare intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft capable of broad-area maritime and littoral operations. In addition the P-8 performs humanitarian and search and rescue missions around the globe."

Pure electric vehicle companies have adopted numerous strategies to stand apart from the competition. Tesla makes a lot of its components in-house including its vehicles’ electric motors. Even Lucid Motors which is still ramping the Air’s production ramp has been proudly highlighting that its electric motors which were also developed in-house are amazingly compact and efficient. Rivian on the other hand appears to have adopted a different strategy.

Information service provider IHS Markit took a look at several automakers’ motor sourcing strategies especially amidst the emergence of the electric vehicle sector. As per the firm’s analysis it appears that established electric vehicle makers such as Tesla seem to see electric drive units as vital to their efficiency and a potential source of competitive advantage. An example of this could be found in the Tesla Model S and Model X Plaid’s new electric motors which feature carbon-sleeved rotors.

It was a technology that was developed and eventually produced in-house and it does provide the Model S and Model X Plaid with notable advantages over their equally-priced rivals. Lucid is the same way with the company taking special care in ensuring that its motors are as compact and efficient as possible. This is a strategy that is not shared by some veteran carmakers like General Motors some of whom have opted to source their electric motors from Tier 1 suppliers like Bosch.

Rivian could be seen as an outlier of sorts in IHS Markit’s analysis. This was because the electric truck maker initially fully outsourced its electric drive units allowing the company to accelerate its product launches. However it should be noted that even Rivian is also developing its own electric motors which means that the company will likely adopt an insourced strategy in the future as well similar to rivals like Tesla and Lucid. IHS Markit for its part noted that insourcing would likely be more prevalent in the coming decade.

“We forecast a steady shift toward electric drive insourcing in the coming decade driven in part by the US OEMs. However there will be many situations where outsourcing continues to make sense. For example Rivian has initially fully outsourced its electric drive which helped accelerate its first product launch while subsequently developing its own. BorgWarner’s recently announced acquisition of motor supplier Santroll shows Tier 1s still see significant volume growth in this space. Carmakers may never insource electric drives completely. As mature as the internal combustion engine is that industry is 90% insourced while 10% of engines are externally sourced” IHS Markit noted.

Rivian may still be in the process of ramping its vehicle deliveries but the company has already shown signs that it would be willing to adapt to the market. Just recently and as nickel prices soared amidst the ongoing war in Ukraine CEO RJ Scaringe stated during the company’s Q4 and Full Year 2021 earnings call that Rivian would be using nickel-free lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) cells for its Amazon delivery vans. This is quite impressive on the company’s part seeing as its Amazon delivery vans will likely account for a substantial portion of Rivian’s production output in the near future.

The blue-collar workers immigrants retirees and middle-class families who contribute to this dense city’s vibrant culture are seeing their apartment buildings sold and landlords raising the rent. With the citywide eviction moratorium that protected residents during the pandemic expiring at the end of April concerns about displacement are rising.

SOMERVILLE — For years many in Somerville have been watching their city gentrify around them. Homes selling for increasingly out-of-reach prices. Fancier cars parking on their block. Longtime neighbors disappearing.

The neighborhood around Union Square has seen some of the largest rent increases in all of Greater Boston over the past six months according to real estate site Zillow. It’s where Julia Machada 54 lives with her 15-year-old son and two sisters near the Target store. Her rent is scheduled to jump $600 a month in June to nearly $3000 even though the building wasn’t sold and no renovations are planned.

“They told me the Green Line’s coming and we have to increase the rent” she said in Spanish through an interpreter. “The rent never forgives.”

The new Green Line service — its first spur to Union Square opens Monday — is quickening the transformation of this city of 81000 where two-thirds of residents rent. Apartments within walking distance of the stations are becoming hot property. And despite efforts by the city and community groups to help residents cope with housing costs many worry that by the time the train is fully operational later this year the working-class residents who could benefit from it most — riding the T to jobs or families — might be gone for good.

“The emergency lights are flashing red” said Ben Ewen-Campen a city councilor whose district includes Union Square. “We’re seeing it really reaching a crisis point.”

The Community Action Agency of Somerville has been tracking a “small army” of developers snapping up two-families and three-deckers along the new Green Line said Nicole Eigbrett the anti-poverty agency’s director of community organizing. They’re converting this working-class housing to condos or higher-end apartments forcing longtime low- to moderate-income tenants “already hanging on by their fingernails” into even more desperate situations Eigbrett said.

Vanessa Vela’s family has lived on Walnut Street since 2009 in a first-floor apartment near the new Gilman Square station. The 39-year-old keeps the gold-winged academic trophies she earned at Charlestown High School shortly after arriving from El Salvador as a teenager on a high window sill. A framed photo of her late grandfather rests on the mantel. Vela’s brother got a break on rent in exchange for fixing up the place and the monthly payments have remained far below market value.

But in September the six-unit building was sold. Vela and the other tenants including another immigrant family who has lived there for 37 years were told they had to leave. The new owner offered to help pay for moving costs but rescinded the eviction after they fought back with the help of CAAS. Vela’s rent has not yet been raised but two recently renovated units in the building were listed for $3000-$3350 a month far more than Vela can afford.

Vela 39 works as a veterinary technician at a cat clinic in Arlington and lives with her teenage son and her mother who was hospitalized with COVID-19 in the fall of 2020. Her mother who only recently went back to work at a factory in Everett doesn’t want to leave the area. Nor does her son an honors student at Somerville High School just up the hill.

“Everybody wants to be a millionaire in a minute” said Vela. “I am just tired of working for others to get rich. I’m not going to be stressed out working two and three jobs and leave my son alone just because [the owner’s] pockets are never filled.”

Vela keeps tabs on the growing wealth of her new landlord Lior Rozhansky a 2015 Brandeis University graduate. His Instagram page lists a 61-unit real estate portfolio valued at $21 million and he offers tips on investing in multi-family rental properties on his YouTube channel. Rozhansky declined to comment.

People’s homes aren’t the only thing in jeopardy. Jobs are being pushed out too. Machada whose rent is rising $600 a month works at the commercial laundry Royal Hospitality Services a 15-minute walk away in the heart of a massive development area. It’s slated to relocate in five years and Machada an immigrant like many of the 300 workers at the union shop is concerned about where it will end up. She’s also worried how she’s going to afford her place especially after one of her sisters moves out.

So far rents around the six new Green Line stations have not soared to the levels initially predicted in part due to COVID which dented Somerville’s rental market in 2020. In fact advertised rental prices in those neighborhoods have been all over the place rising in some places and dropping in others adjusted for inflation between 2013 and 2021 according to the Metropolitan Area Planning Council. Citywide however the rent for a two-bedroom apartment has risen 15 percent.

It may be that it’s too soon for a Green Line bump to factor into rents said Tim Reardon director of data services at MAPC which in a 2014 report about the Somerville extension projected that rents near some new stations could increase wildly anywhere from 25 to 70 percent. Somerville has also built a lot of housing he notes — the number of homes in Somerville grew faster than the population between 2010 and 2020 — which has likely helped keep rents down.

Still prices have ticked up in recent months according to Zillow with the “typical” rent in Union Square — the average of midrange listings — rising 4.9 percent between September and February to $2669 a much bigger increase than in the same period right before the pandemic.

Bill Cavellini has lived on Oak Street for 17 years a block and a half from the new Union Square station and an apartment tower going up next door. The retired cab driver and homeless case manager got involved with a coalition called Union United in 2016 and helped form the Union Square Neighborhood Council to help vulnerable residents from getting priced out and keep community networks from “disintegrating.”

“The old timers are moving out” said Cavellini 78 who with his wife rents the first floor of a property owned by his family. “Some of them by choice some of them not by choice.”

When people leave a place where they’ve had roots for generations Cavellini said “there’s a vacuum that’s left and it’s not always easily filled.”

As the long-planned train line opens in Somerville the city is seeing a wave of new investment both large-scale buildings in Union Square and the purchase of its stock of two-family and three-decker apartment buildings by landlords that aim to raise rents or convert them into for-sale condos. David L. Ryan/Globe Staff

Ann E. Camara cochair of the Union Square Neighborhood Council has lived in an area known as Duck Village for 45 years in the two-family house her Portuguese grandfather bought for $4000 in 1930. Camara a former nurse raised her sons there and ran a day care business in the home for 30 years. Her sister lives upstairs. And she’s horrified that a two-family house around the corner is selling for $1.6 million.

“Only the rich can come here now” she said. “Who else can buy that?”

As a massive multi-block redevelopment of Union Square moved through city approvals in recent years the Union Square groups pushed for “development without displacement.” They negotiated deals that require 20 percent of residential projects to be set aside at affordable rents and higher contributions to the affordable housing trust fund and a new job-training program.

The city is using “every tool possible to work against displacement” said Mayor Katjana Ballantyne noting that the housing crisis goes far beyond Somerville. It has opened an Office of Housing Stability instituted a program to buy homes on the market and provide subsidies to keep rents affordable and created an ordinance requiring developers to wait at least a year before converting apartments into condos.

But programs aimed at helping tenants — including the condo conversion ordinance and its provisions limiting rent increases — are also driving more longtime property owners to sell said Steve Bremis who’s been in the real estate business in Somerville for 41 years and is suing the city over the ordinance.

“They don’t like the climate” he said. “People who have had properties for 30 years are getting out.”

When buildings change hands rents usually go up and even a small hike can have a big effect on people already strapped for cash. About 38 percent of renters in Somerville pay nearly one third or more of their monthly income for housing costs; 15 percentpay more than half according to the most recent Census data. In the city’s Green Line service areas just under one third of the population is made up of people of color and around the same share live in low-income households according to the Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization.

Even those who qualify for assistance are struggling. Union United member Afruza Akther has had to move three times in the past seven years most recently to Winter Hill driven out when her building sold or landlords raised the rent beyond what her Section 8 voucher could pay. She also lost her job at a Subway franchise in Union Square after the owners closed it to convert it into another business. But Akther also a former Union Square Neighborhood Council board member is determined to stay in Somerville close to her husband’s family at least until her 16-year-old daughter finishes high school.

Akther and her husband are currently working two days a week at Bow Market in Union Square preparing Bengali food from their native Bangladesh while trying to get their own catering business off the ground. But Akther is always worried about the next rent increase. “All this pressure is piling on me” she said. “There’s no break.”

But others see opportunity.

In December South Boston-based developer G. A. Donovan Management Consulting Corp. spent nearly $11.5 million to buy six two-family homes and an artists’ studio space on one three-block stretch of Washington Street just outside Union Square. Candice Cole has lived in one of the buildings for four years paying “nice affordable rent” currently $2765 a month. But she’s been told that in June it will jump to $4000; so she and her three roommates are all moving out. (G.A. Donovan did not reply to a request for comment).

Cole who makes around $40000 a year doing telephone customer service is worried not only about where she’s going to go but about the other “longtime regular folks” in the neighborhood. There’s the older man next door who talks to his cats and the guy across the street who walks around in his bathrobe — people she said “who belong here.”

“Regular folks who have regular jobs can’t compete with these management companies” she said. “Where are we all supposed to go?”

Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated why the Union Square Subway franchise closed. The story has been updated.

Hernan 31 hails from Scituate and she considers herself bicoastal. She owns multiple properties along the South Shore as well as in Los Angeles. She founded the frozen food company Emma Leigh & Co. which is based in Hingham and she helps co-run family-owned seafood company Yankee Trader Seafood based in Pembroke.

Hernan recently wrapped up filming season five of “Selling Sunset” which is due to premiere this spring although Netflix has yet to announce an official date. The show debuted in 2019 and is one of the streaming platform’s most popular reality TV series. Hernan joined the cast over the fall and has over 1.5 million followers on Instagram.

“It was pretty second nature jumping on TV” Hernan told the Globe in a phone interview. “Initially there was massive hesitation opening my life up for the world to see ... but I thought I had a unique story and if I can inspire young girls out there to put their whole heart into something and work really hard that’s why I made the decision to come on.”

Hernan said she got into business and investing at “a very young age.”

“I was modeling and babysitting and doing everything I possibly could to make money” Hernan said adding that she started investing in the stock market and into startups as a teenager. When she turned 21 she moved to LA.

“LA is first to market with a lot of things” Hernan said. “I got in early with a CBD company and other [businesses] like that where I was able to accumulate a decent amount of money early on.”

Then around 2018 Hernan got into real estate. She started to work with the Oppenheim Group and met the Oppenheim brothers Jason and Brett while looking for her first home in Los Angeles. (The Oppenheim Group is the luxury real estate brokerage featured in “Selling Sunset.”) The brothers who were Hernan’s agents at the time persuaded her to get her real estate license after noticing her aptitude for the industry.

Hernan does the majority of her real estate work in Los Angeles but she has a partner on the South Shore who she works with on deals here too. She said the real estate market has been booming on the South Shore especially during the pandemic as many opted to leave cities in favor of the suburbs.

Still Hernan calls Boston “a great area to buy in.”

“Boston in general is always going to do really well” she said shouting out the city’s Back Bay neighborhood. “There’s a lot of history there.”

She said her biggest advice for people getting into the real estate market is “location location location.”

“I can’t emphasize it enough. You never want to buy the best house in the worst neighborhood you always want to buy the worst house in the best neighborhood” Hernan said. “I always buy homes that need a little work because you always want to add value if you can.”

Another piece of advice? Holding real estate.

“If you can get a condo in Boston hold it and rent it out” Hernan said. “We know the rent is [high] there so if you can pay off a mortgage and the earlier you start doing that the better your return end investment will be.”

In addition to business and real estate Hernan is passionate about the food industry. Her grandfather founded Massachusetts-based Yankee Seafood Trading Co. in 1994 that distributes seafood nationwide. It is now a third-generation family-run business and is a partner of Davio’s which has restaurants in the Back Bay and Seaport.

“It’s in my blood” Hernan said of her decision to launch her own business Emma Leigh & Co. which she started in the summer of 2020. In addition to being a partner of Davio’s Hernan also works with Beyond Meat. Frozen vegan empanadas have turned into the brand’s signature item.

“It’s a 100 percent woman-owned company” Hernan said adding that she’s gotten hundreds of offers from companies asking for first option to invest in the business and she’s turned all of them down.

“Starting a business is not easy. And as a woman it’s even harder” Hernan said. “I’ve been laughed out of meetings my entire life. So for me it’s been really important to show everyone what I can do and to show young girls and guys what you can accomplish if you go out there and work really hard.”

As far as the future goes Hernan said she’s excited to expand her business (Costco just placed an order) and she hopes to eventually see her products distributed worldwide.

Hernan is also looking forward to season five of “Selling Sunset” and for fans to get to know her a little better.

“I feel like audiences got to see a lot of the boss-business side of me” Hernan said. “But in real life I have a big heart and a goofier side. I think you’ll see more of that in season five.”

Dervan pioneered treating DNA as an organic molecule,"In 1975 Peter B. Dervan then an assistant professor of chemistry at the California Institute of Technology switched his research focus from physical organic chemistry to DNA. That doesn’t sound remarkable unless you realize what tools weren’t available at the time. There was no easy way to synthesize DNA and no easy way to sequence it. There wasn’t even a high resolution crystal structure of the right-handed helix. Those all came later.

At the time DNA was the domain of biologists and biochemists. It wasn’t something that organic chemists studied.

“Biology to many people was a forbidden zone because the philosophy is you go after problems you can solve” says Tadhg Begley who did his PhD with Dervan between 1977 and 1982 and is now a professor of chemistry at Texas A&M University. “So much of biology seemed intractable to chemistry in terms of its complexity.”

Dervan changed that perspective. He treated DNA as an organic molecule that was fair game for organic chemists. In doing so he laid the groundwork for the field that has come to be known as chemical biology.

“He was the first person to think about nucleic acids as a substrate for chemistry and how to design molecules that recognize DNA in a sequence-specific fashion” says Alanna Schepartz who did a postdoc with Dervan in the 1980s and is now a chemistry professor at the University of California Berkeley.

“Peter made the case that a biological macromolecule—DNA—is really just a molecule and we’re chemists and we should be able to do chemistry on that molecule” says Dennis A. Dougherty a longtime colleague at Caltech. “Nowadays it’s difficult to imagine that that would be a novel idea.”

In brief Peter B. Dervan started studying DNA through the lens of organic chemistry before the tools for sequencing and synthesizing it existed. He embraced risk and laid the groundwork for what became the field of chemical biology. Dervan’s team twice discovered ways to recognize specific DNA sequences—first in the minor groove and then in the major groove. In addition to his research he helped found Gilead Sciences served on the Scientific Advisory Board of the Welch Foundation for 33 years and was a trustee of Yale University.

Dervan’s “research into the chemistry of sequence-specific DNA recognition and cleavage established the utility of site-specific gene manipulation that paved the way for later genome-editing technologies including CRISPR” says Jennifer Doudna a biochemist at UC Berkeley who received half of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for helping develop CRISPR. “As a graduate student I read and loved Dervan’s elegant work on DNA binding and cutting not suspecting that years later it would have direct relevance to my own research.”

In recognition of his pioneering contributions designing molecules that bind to specific DNA sequences Dervan the Bren Professor of Chemistry Emeritus at Caltech is receiving the 2022 Priestley Medal the highest honor bestowed by the American Chemical Society.

Early days

It wasn’t inevitable that Dervan would become an eminent scientist. The son of Irish immigrants he had to avoid bullies in Boston’s Dorchester neighborhood the tough blue-collar community where his family lived. He managed to stay out of trouble and never got beaten up.

“I was a good kid and I owed it to my parents to stay out of trouble” he says. “I didn’t hide out in the house. I wasn’t a wussy but I was just a quiet serious kid. And they left me alone.”

He attended Boston College High School a Catholic all-boys’ school. His 4 h of homework each night kept him busy. By participating in the science club he discovered he had a knack for science and a love of chemistry. He won the first-year-student prize in the science fair for a project on the effects of radiation on yeast.

Dervan’s fellow students recognized his aptitude in chemistry. In his senior yearbook he was described as “always a gentleman” and “a whiz in chemistry.”

“A lot of young people need to search around to find what their passion is going to be” Dervan says. “I went to Boston College knowing that chemistry was what I wanted to do.”

While at Boston College he participated in a summer research experience. It convinced him that he didn’t know enough yet to be an independent researcher. “It made great sense to me that I should go to grad school and I needed to keep learning.”

Dervan also wanted to see more of the US. So after graduating from Boston College in 1967 he chose to go to graduate school at the University of Wisconsin–Madison where he worked with Jerome Berson a physical organic chemist.

At the time the specter of the Vietnam War loomed. After so many years of being the good boy Dervan responded to what he calls the “existential threat” of the war by embracing risk. Feeling that the draft could render all those years of working hard and keeping out of trouble pointless he took up skydiving on the weekends as a form of physical risk that he could control. He jumped more than 40 times.

When his draft status was reclassified he returned to Dorchester to petition for a 12-month occupational deferment from the draft. After an impromptu organic chemistry lecture punctuated by Dervan waving his arms to illustrate how broken bonds move the draft board granted his deferment.

At that point he felt he needed to give research his all. Rather than continuing to take physical risks he instead took intellectual risks. Berson moved to Yale and Dervan went with him. A golf player Dervan now views the transition as a “mulligan” that allowed him to “tee it up again.” He asked himself “Are you willing to take the risk of finding out that you’re not all that good?”

He threw himself into his research spending 6–7 days a week in the lab. For his thesis he did a four-pathway analysis of sigmatropic rearrangements of dipropenylcyclobutanes.

With a Yale PhD in hand Dervan accepted a postdoctoral position with Eugene E. van Tamelen a synthetic organic chemist at Stanford University. Soon after Dervan arrived at Stanford universities started inviting him to give talks. He thought he was just practicing for when he would seriously go on the market in a year or two but he received multiple offers. He accepted the offer from Caltech.

“I thought for sure I’ll go down there for 5 years they’ll find out I’m not a genius like the rest of them and I’ll get fired” Dervan says. “I went to Caltech not worrying about whether I was going to get tenure.” That attitude gave him the freedom to go in a new direction.

Changing course

Dervan was hired at Caltech as a physical organic chemist. For the first few years he studied the mechanisms of reactive intermediates such as 14-biradicals. Through his teaching he came to realize that he wanted to change his focus.

He taught an advanced organic chemistry class using original papers and the Socratic method. In the class he asked students to use the data from the papers to propose reaction mechanisms. As he taught the class Dervan realized how much groundbreaking work in physical organic chemistry had been done decades before.

“I can’t do this for 40 years” Dervan told himself. He decided he needed to do something radically different.

He chose to focus on molecular recognition. People such as Jean-Marie Lehn at the University of Strasbourg and Donald J. Cram at the University of California Los Angeles were already doing molecular recognition with host-guest systems but they were working in organic solvents.

“If I study molecular recognition and I just do the next host-guest thing I’m not going to distinguish my program” Dervan remembers thinking. He decided that he needed to work with biological polymers in water the solvent of life.

When he first started studying DNA the tools for working with DNA at a molecular level didn’t yet exist. The field was completely open. “My idea was that I would go into this dark area and try to turn on the lights” he says.

“I took this risky decision that was potentially career ending” Dervan says. If the tools for studying DNA hadn’t materialized soon enough he would have been unproductive and gotten fired he says.

“I was pretty sure that he was going to do really well because he was such a brilliant exciting colleague” says Harry B. Gray who was already on the faculty when Dervan joined Caltech. “His enthusiasm was so great that you just had to believe that he was going to do it.”

For his first foray into DNA research Dervan and his group set out to make a bifunctional molecule that could recognize a DNA sequence and then cut it. Such a molecule would essentially function like a synthetic restriction enzyme.

They made (methidiumpropyl-EDTA)Fe(II) (MPE) which comprises the DNA intercalator methidium connected to the metal chelator ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) by a short linker. MPE nonspecifically binds and cleaves DNA at multiple locations. The construct became a useful tool to reveal the binding of other small molecules by seeing where MPE’s intercalation and cleavage were blocked.

But Dervan also wanted something that could bind to specific sequences. Peter G. Schultz a graduate student with Dervan from 1979 to 1984 and now the CEO of Scripps Research synthesized another bifunctional molecule this time linking EDTA with the antibiotic distamycin which consists of multiple methylpyrrole amino acids. The distamycin would bind to DNA rich in adenine and thymine and the EDTA would cleave the DNA. John-Stephen Taylor a Dervan postdoc in the early 1980s and now a chemistry professor at Washington University in St. Louis did the polyacrylamide gel separation of the resulting DNA cleavage products.

They saw the pattern they expected for one DNA strand with the cleavage next to the binding site. But when they sequenced the cleavage sites on the other DNA strand they saw something unexpected. The cleavage pattern for the second strand was offset from the pattern on the first strand.

Taylor was puzzled but Dervan immediately grasped the implication that the distamycin was binding in the minor groove of DNA Taylor recalls. Dervan had a large model of DNA in his office and his careful study of it was paying off. “Clearly his mind was already prepared for the result” Taylor says.

Dervan’s lab continued to study polyamides to bind to DNA in the minor groove. Using various combinations of pyrrole hydroxypyrrole and imidazole his team could distinguish all four base pairs.

For recognizing the major groove of DNA Dervan and his colleagues focused on oligonucleotides that bind to DNA to form a triple helix. Heinz Moser a postdoc with Dervan in the mid-1980s and now executive director for global discovery chemistry at Novartis did the early work on the triple-helix approach.

“When I joined his group he only spent about 10 min with me to explain what I should do” Moser says. In those 10 min Dervan told Moser that they should be able to specifically recognize double-stranded DNA sequences by using a short oligonucleotide that binds to the DNA and forms a triple helix. Moser didn’t even know triple helices existed. “I matured as a scientist tremendously because I was thrown in the cold water and had to learn how to swim” Moser says. Six months later after many failures and with support from Dervan and his group Moser got the triple-helix approach to work.

As Dervan and his mentees continued to develop DNA recognition they increasingly moved toward using their bifunctional molecules for biological applications. Anna K. Mapp a postdoc with Dervan from 1997 to 2000 and Aseem Z. Ansari a postdoc with Mark Ptashne at Harvard University developed artificial transcription factors molecules that regulate gene expression. Ansari now at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital continued to collaborate with Dervan after starting his independent career at UW–Madison. Mapp’s time in Dervan’s lab “changed entirely the trajectory of what I was interested in” she says.

When Amanda Hargrove now a chemistry professor at Duke University was a postdoc with Dervan in the early 2010s the group was working toward applying DNA-binding polyamide molecules to mouse models of disease. The team focused on blocking the transcription of the androgen receptor as a way to slow the growth of prostate cancer. “It was a really exciting time to be there” she says.

Even in the face of other methods of DNA recognition and gene modulation and editing such as RNA interference and CRISPR a place remains for the polyamides that Dervan’s lab pioneered Ansari says. “Small molecules that can target the genome and can be delivered systemically will still be incredibly valuable in ways that CRISPR will not” Ansari says.

Popular destination

Dervan paved the way for what became chemical biology but he doesn’t consider himself a founder of the field. His lab was instead the “incubator” lab he says. In those early days it was “Chemical biology” with a capital C and a lowercase b he says.

“I was learning the biology as I went along and the methods weren’t big enough to do the big B” Dervan says. “When I was starting out you couldn’t sequence 10 letters of an oligonucleotide.”

The early successes made Dervan’s lab a popular destination for organic chemists looking to pivot to biological applications. Multiple group alumni say that they were inspired to join his lab after hearing him give a talk about the DNA work.

“If you were interested in what we now call chemical biology and you were coming from a really strong place and wanted to go to a really strong place Peter was like a beacon” says Samuel Gellman who did a postdoc with Dervan in the mid-1980s and is now a chemistry professor at UW–Madison.

“Being able to expand the ideas of organic chemistry into this biologically important molecule was super exciting” says Eric T. Kool who did a postdoc with Dervan in the late 1980s and is now a chemistry professor at Stanford University. “Peter’s enthusiasm about and communication skills about it really are what won me over.” In Dervan’s lab Kool designed new molecules that expanded the sequences that could be recognized by triple helices.

Dervan was “a pioneer in modular design; his compounds combined recognition with chemical reactivity” says Laura L. Kiessling who was a postdoc with Dervan from 1989 to 1991 and is now a chemistry professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The field has evolved since then. “I would no longer be a card-carrying chemical biologist today” Dervan says. “Today’s modern successful chemical biologist is a biologist. They are steeply taught both experimentally and intellectually how to do biology. I never had that training.”

Dervan fostered a collegial environment in his lab. He had a hands-off approach to mentoring that gave his students and postdocs a sense of ownership over their projects. It also encouraged them to help one another.

“There wasn’t a culture in the lab of shooting down ideas. There was a culture of making things better” says Martha Oakley a chemistry professor at Indiana University Bloomington who was a graduate student with Dervan in the early 1990s. “There was a lot of back and forth and people would give you good ideas” she says. “You were never made to feel like an idiot.”

Schultz started working with Dervan as an undergraduate at Caltech and continued through graduate school. He started out studying the biradical reactive intermediates and switched to DNA. “I was very fortunate to work for Peter because he gave me a real problem. He didn’t fool around with ‘Here’s a starter problem’ ” Schultz says. “Peter was pretty hands off in the lab. If you didn’t need guidance Peter really didn’t micromanage you.”

Group alumni recall Dervan’s push for unimpeachable data. “There were a lot of conversations in the lab about the requirement that Peter had to get the perfect gel” says Scott Strobel a Dervan graduate student from 1987 to 1992 and now the provost at Yale University. “You look at the data in those papers and there is nothing ambiguous about interpreting what’s in those data.”

“We would never cut and slice a gel. If there was a lane that didn’t run perfectly in my group you had to rerun that” Dervan says. “I’m sure the students thought I was the biggest jerk in the whole world that I made people run gels three or four times. Then I knew the data was reproducible.”

“There were definitely complaints about it at the time” Schepartz says. In retrospect as a principal investigator herself now “I know how important that exercise was because it ensured that nothing published was wrong or simply an artifact. It also taught everyone in the lab about the importance of data quality.”

Beyond the lab

In addition to his research Dervan has served the science community beyond Caltech. Shortly after Dervan’s election to the National Academy of Sciences in 1986 Michael Riordan recruited him to become one of the founders of what became Gilead Sciences. The company was going to focus on antisense oligonucleotides. “I wasn’t working on antisense at the time although the triple-helix stuff probably had that element to it” Dervan says. “He picked me reputationally.”

Dervan turned Riordan down the first time he asked. “People don’t remember that in 1987 if you were a serious scholar particularly at Caltech you would never get involved in a start-up” Dervan says. When Riordan tried again Dervan agreed to join the company as a founder. His main role was as a member of the scientific advisory board. “I took a chance that people would look at me a little funny for having gotten involved with a biotech start-up” he says. He remained a member of Gilead’s scientific advisory board until 2013.

Dervan also served on the Scientific Advisory Board of the Welch Foundation from 1988 to 2021 including 7 years as chair. When he was chair Dervan increased the representation of women on the SAB by appointing four women. They were not the first women to serve on the SAB but it was the first time there had been that many women on the SAB simultaneously.

Catherine Murphy a chemistry professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is one of those women. She served as vice-chair with Dervan and became chair when he retired. Dervan is “a great role model because he always seems like he’s having fun” Murphy says. “When you’re with a person who has a positive attitude it just makes you think ‘Let’s do this thing.’ ”

And Dervan’s service didn’t stop there. From 2008 to 2017 he was a member of the Board of Trustees at Yale University. During Dervan’s term on the board of trustees Strobel was Yale’s vice president for west campus planning and program development. Strobel would bounce ideas off Dervan in Dervan’s capacity as a scientist on the board.

“Peter’s a positive visionary person who calls it straight but at the same time does it in a way that is mentoring and nurturing as opposed to devastating and destroying” Strobel says. “He very much encouraged all aspects of the management of the university along this path of getting us to a major investment in the sciences with a plan for what we’re going to do.”

In his late 60s Dervan started planning for his retirement. “I decided that it’s hard for a human being to know when they’ve lost their fastball” he says. “I think I knew already at age 65 that I would give my laboratory space back to the institute around age 72 73 74 cognizant that I had this extraordinary spouse who was younger than me and still very active in her career.” His extraordinary spouse is Jacqueline K. Barton also a Caltech chemistry professor and recipient of the 2015 Priestley Medal (see box).

A teaching experience underscored for Dervan that the time for retirement was approaching. He has always prided himself on his board work. “I love a piece of white chalk and real slate and I could do beautiful board work” he says. “For years when I would lecture both in sophomore organic chemistry and in my advanced organic courses the board work was to be immodest really really good. And I think to be honest that’s the speed at which students can actually grasp the material.”

In the last 5 years he was teaching students still gave him good teaching evaluations for his lectures but they also noted that the quality of his board work was deteriorating. Structures still looked good but words were becoming less legible. Dervan says “That’s an example just in terms of my own personal standards of excellence that I made the right decision.”",,,,,,,,,

The members from the hit CBS procedural came down with a sudden illness Thursday morning including vomiting according to TMZ.

A source told TMZ that the members reported “mild symptoms” which seem to be due to potential food poisoning but there has been no confirmation of a cause.

NCIS is currently on its 19th season and recently said goodbye to its lead character Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs played by Mark Harmon according to PEOPLE.

During episode four of season 19 Harmon who was nearly killed during the season 18 finale left his job for good opting to stay in Alaska indefinitely after solving a case.

Gibbs told Special Agent Timothy McGee (Sean Murray) while fishing “I’m not going back Tim. I’m not going back home.”

And then Gibbs told McGee that he “could not have hoped for anyone better” to work with over the past 18 years before the partners hugged closing out the emotional scene.

Harmon told PEOPLE in 2019 “If there’s ever a time where the writers are walking into the room and going ‘I don’t know what to do’ then I think we all have to look at each other and call it a day. But we’re not there yet.”

Expressing his gratitude for his long-running spot on the show Harmon said “I’ve been around long enough to know what this is. That commitment is part of what I signed up for. I know when this show ends that’s it — there won’t be anything else like this for me.”",,,

At universities and colleges across the country police are sweeping through encampments supporting Gaza trying to clear protesters from the grounds. But at Brown University’s encampment on the campus’s main green in the middle of Providence Rhode Island the biggest drama last Shabbat was that the candles would not stay lit.

This was more or less the calm atmosphere of Brown’s encampment for the six days it stood; it was not plagued by the antisemitism violence or arrests that have dominated headlines about schools including Columbia and the University of California Los Angeles. There were no clashes with counterprotesters and no police presence. The encampment’s daily schedule included tai chi and a talent show alongside teach-ins and rallies. People tossed frisbees next to the tents.

On Tuesday the protesting students at Brown reached an agreement with the university’s administration and voluntarily dismantled their encampment.

Life on the Ivy League campus wasn’t always so calm. In the wake of Oct. 7 61 students were arrested at various sit-ins. Some student groups celebrated Hamas’ massacre. People took pictures of Israeli students on campus and posted on anonymous social media with captions disparaging them as Zionists.

Fractures deepened after a Palestinian Brown undergraduate Hisham Awartani was shot in Burlington Vermont along with two other Palestinian friends; they were all wearing kaffiyehs. Brown-RISD Hillel put out a statement mourning the shooting but also castigating “a torrent of antisemitic hatred” online saying that Hillel’s “support for Israel and Zionist students is unassailable.”

Some Jewish and Israeli students who had previously been involved with Hillel broke ties calling the email “tone-deaf” and “a disgusting response to a hate crime.” At a vigil for Awartani a speaker said his blood was on the hands of Zionist students.

But around May’s encampment that vitriol seemed to have dissipated. Chants were focused on the activists’ demands — divestment not from Israel as a whole but from companies involved in the oppression of Palestinians — and not on broader statements about Zionism or Israel’s existence. Some of Brown’s most vocal Zionist students members of opposing campus group Brown Students for Israel said that they felt safe.

Students told me that the encampment chose not to chant “from the river to the sea” — common at most protests — because one student who was part of the tent group said it made them feel uncomfortable. (The chant did occur once on the encampment’s final day.)

What enabled this shift? And who planted the seeds for compromise on Brown’s central lawn?

I asked this question of many at Brown students faculty and rabbis and their answers all pointed to a willingness to cross ideological divides. Where protesters at other campuses adopted “do not engage” policies at Brown they kept talking.

“On the periphery of the encampment there were a number of students in conversation with one another some of which I think people might have imagined were unlikely pairs to be having conversations across political differences” said Jason Klein the rabbi for Jewish life in the chaplain’s office. “That’s something I think that Brown students can often do well.”

This isn’t of course to say that everyone approved of the encampment or agreed with its demands. Some students and staff at the Brown-RISD Hillel harshly criticize the campus environment. And many activists call for more extreme measures and more rigid stances — most students I spoke with mentioned more radical factions on campus that don’t fret over upsetting their peers.

But they no longer dominate at Brown.

The encampment maintained a middle ground of sorts in part due to a monthslong committed dialogue organized and run by students to talk through the toughest issues and feelings and try to understand each other.

And many students said that the relative calm and success of the protest was thanks in large part to the deep engagement of Jewish students in the campus’s activist movements.

Jews at the center

The first sit-in for divestment at Brown in November last year was composed entirely of Jewish students. In their first statement in the student newspaper The Brown Daily Herald the group mourned the murders on Oct. 7 and affirmed its “connection to the amorphous spiritual entity” of Israel but declared itself anti-Zionist.

Soon after they named themselves BrownU Jews for Ceasefire Now; many of its members were part of Brown’s encampment. JFCN as most on campus call it has organized protests or actions but also created an independent study course for those grappling with Judaism Jewish identity and Israel; organized dinners for Jews who clash over Israel; and invited other students to come and ask questions of its members promising to cast no judgment. It has also hosted weekly Shabbat services — including the one at the encampment — as well as holiday celebrations.

Maddie a senior with JFCN who spoke on condition that only her first name be used so as not to compromise her employment prospects in the Jewish professional world said the group hosts large Shabbat dinners and has created an “alternative ritual space” for Jews “who don’t want to feel like they’re praying to a flag.”

About 24% of Brown’s student body is Jewish and most of them according to Rabbi Joshua Bolton the head of the Brown-RISD Hillel “exist in a broad center and in fact they don’t necessarily feel represented by activists on either side of this issue.”

Nevertheless Jewish students comprise a significant portion — it’s not clear exactly how large — of pro-Palestinian activists on campus. Their deep engagement and leadership seems to have helped insulate the movement from becoming as divisive as on other campuses.

When an outside group from Providence came to the encampment and handed out flyers urging a global intifada over the weekend students pushed back saying that was not part of their messaging. They kept their chants focused on divestment and criticism of Brown’s leadership.

“The heavy Jewish presence in these pro-Palestine circles ensures that there will never be the extreme blatant antisemitism” said Ma’ayan Stutman-Shaw a first-year student who is not involved with the protests. “And it’s Jews who are really engaged with the Jewish community not Jews who picked up Judaism on Oct. 10 because they wanted to fight for Palestine — Jews who have been thinking about this constantly they are the ones who are leading this movement on campus.”

Of course much of the pro-Palestinian organizing has been led by non-Jewish students as well.

But much of the pushback to pro-Palestinian protests — concerns about antisemitism and what they see as calls to dismantle Israel — have come from Jewish students who are concerned about antisemitism or who have ties to Israel. And that’s where the leadership of Jewish student activists has come in.

“Jewish students are going to have a better understanding of what will trigger other Jewish students” said Asher Radziner a senior who has been leading conversations on campus.

A safety blanket

Many Jewish students I spoke to said the university encouraged conversations among students over Israel and the war but never convened any that students found inviting.

“It hasn’t really provided those spaces” said Eiden Spilker a senior involved with JFCN. “There just haven’t been contexts to engage in good faith.”

So instead students built their own.

Outside the encampment while it stood JFCN students — none of whom were camping on the green — had set up a dialogue space: a blanket and a painted canvas that said “Questions? Comments? Concerns? Come talk.”

Every day that the encampment stood at least two students sat there waiting for people to approach them. The group also facilitated conversations during a student hunger strike in February when 17 students fasted for eight days to protest the refusal of the Corporation of Brown University which governs the investment of Brown’s endowment to hear a proposal for divestment.

JFCN members said they are looking especially to engage with Jewish and Zionist students. Spilker whose father is a rabbi and whose mother is a cantor said JFCN understands where they’re coming from.

“We’ve been there and we’re in a position where we can empathize with that” he said. “It’s less about trying to convince people and more about hearing them and having dialogue and creating a space that ideally Hillel would’ve created but because of their ideology and current leadership have not been able to make.”

(“We are a home for every Jewish student” said Bolton the director of the campus Hillel when told of the criticism from some Jewish students. “That doesn’t mean that we’re a home for every type of program.”)

On blanket duty one recent morning Spilker greeted a student who introduced himself as Kareem not giving his last name and had questions. He asked about the use of the term genocide and the impact of divestment. Spilker thought before he spoke and then drew on theories he learned in classes he’d taken.

“I think it is a question of at which stage do you call it a genocide — is it just at the final stage of mass extermination?” he said.

“That’s a good point” Kareem responded. “I hadn’t heard that before that it’s a process.”

Spilker said he’s had all kinds of people come up to him at the blanket: students from the campus pro-Israel group students from settlements in the West Bank alumni faculty a local imam worried parents of prospective students who had just taken the campus tours that walked by the encampment multiple times a day.

“That was the main goal in setting this up. Like: We’re here to talk to you we’re not a threat to you” he said. “There are people who understand what we’re doing here or may not fully agree but appreciate what’s happening and appreciate that we’re opening up this space.”

Caught in the middle

One of those appreciative students is Stutman-Shaw. She doesn’t feel comfortable being part of the group but said she still agrees with much of what JFCN is doing on campus particularly its work to keep students talking to one another. Those efforts have “made me really proud to go to this school” she said.

At the same time the Jewish involvement in the protest movement has put Stutman-Shaw into a difficult position. JFCN hosts a Shabbat service each week with two options for prayer: a Reform service and a traditional-egalitarian one that uses traditional liturgy but doesn’t divide servicegoers by gender. It’s so popular that it can make it hard for Hillel to field a minyan for its own version of that service several students told me.

But JFCN’s homemade siddur doesn’t sit right with Stutman-Shaw. It has a disclaimer explaining that the word “Yisrael” in prayers doesn’t refer to the country of Israel but to the Jewish people and to the biblical parable in which Jacob wrestles with God. For Stutman-Shaw that’s not how she views her spirituality; when she prays to Yisrael she said she does think of the country and the time she’s spent there.

That means she often finds herself without her preferred mode of prayer; instead she usually attends the Orthodox minyan at Hillel.

“JFCN right now is the best egalitarian service that you can find on campus” she said citing the passion of the students involved. “Part of me feels really happy for that and part of me like that really breaks my heart because I feel like I can’t really be there fully in who I am.”

Stutman-Shaw is attempting to resuscitate the Brown chapter of J Street U which describes itself as “the political home for pro-Israel pro-peace pro-democracy Americans.” The chapter dissolved in the wake of Oct. 7 because the national organization had failed to call for a ceasefire. She hopes it will be a place where student can both condemn Israel’s actions in Gaza and support the existence of the state.

Still while she endeavors to build her own Jewish space on campus Stutman-Shaw said JFCN has been integral to the success of Brown’s pro-Palestinian movement.

“A lot of Israeli students were leading the protests a lot of Jewish students with connection to Israel” she said. “So they were really trying to emphasize the importance of diverse ideological dialogue.”

Dinners across disagreement

Stutman-Shaw has been attending an event called Dinners in Progress created by two other students who hold differing views on the conflict in the Middle East that seeks to bring groups of the not-likeminded students together to talk about Israel Gaza and the atmosphere on campus.

“For the first time since Oct. 7 I see the SJP president who happens to be Jewish and someone who is from the Gush talking about Israel” Stutman-Shaw said referring to the school’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine and a group of settlements in the West Bank. “And that’s so exciting.”

Radziner who is one of the co-founders said the dinners arose from the idea that “it would be great to have a dialogue space that wasn’t controlled by the university that wasn’t run by faculty or adults but run by students for students — not run by an organization like Hillel or even JFCN.”

The office of student life at Brown put him in touch with another student Zoey Fisher and gave them funding to buy dinner which is always a draw for college students.

In the three dinners so far a cohort of 14 Jewish students discussed their personal connections to Israel were able to express frustration with each other and dug deeply into their disagreements.

“It’s very easy for people who feel very strongly about something and want to act on it to get together and take action” Radziner said. “But often that comes at the expense of continued dialogue with people who disagree with you.”

The dinners he said “keep it going.”

‘I’ve had too many bad experiences’

Not everyone feels that the conversation has been quite so welcoming. Rabbi Joshua Bolton the director of the Brown-RISD Hillel critiqued what he saw as students holing up in “ideological fortresses.”

“Wisdom is revealed in places where we know very little where there’s vulnerability” Bolton said. “And so it would strike me that the opportunity before students at Brown is not to build an encampment that keeps everyone of a differing opinion out but really embrace the idea of let us go camping together in the wilderness.”

He blames the Brown faculty in part for building ideological fortresses and setting a bad example for students.

In many ways Hillel has been the target of the worst of the ire from protests. Bolton and the assistant director of the Hillel Molly Goldmeier received death threats several months ago.

“It’s just very hard for me to imagine what I’ve endured” he said “and there not being a major campus revolt on account of it.” he said. The campus he posits would be outraged had the head of the Brown Center for Students of Color received such threats.

“I think that kind of reflects where students are at right now” he added.

Teddy Horowitz a senior said he too feels unwelcome on campus because of his Zionism; he said he’d lost numerous friendships because of his love for Israel and his membership in the campus pro-Israel group Brown Students for Israel.

Horowitz largely agrees with the activists’ demands for a ceasefire and an end to Israel’s occupation but is deeply concerned about antisemitism within the movement. He said the Brown SJP chapter had expressed admiration for Hamas and that he’s seen antisemitism rise on campus social media. He also saw no place to mourn Israelis murdered in the Oct. 7 attack because of the dominance of pro-Palestinian activism on campus.

Many of his activist classmates fall into two groups he said. “There are the Jews and students who think Oct. 7 was a victory and there’s the activists who are willing to put up with that” he said. “And I don’t want to deal with either group anymore; I’ve had too many bad experiences.”

Horowitz turned to the campus Hillel and Chabad where he found community with like-minded friends. But he remains discouraged by what he sees as echo chambers on campus.

To combat this he founded a new publication the Brown Jewish Journal. “When the Jewish Journal started one of the editors was an anti-Zionist and I was really suspicious of him at first” Horowitz recounted. But as they began to read and edit each other’s work that changed. “Now I really look forward to talking about Israel-Palestine with him” he said.

Horowitz who spoke to me in the days before protesters and the university struck an agreement to dismantle the encampment said the climate on campus had improved since the weeks after Oct. 7.

“I’m really pleasantly surprised with how well this protest is going” he said of the encampment. “Recently I’ve come to the conclusion that these people might be pretty chill.”

But he still feels “betrayed” by the campus community. “I love the outpouring of empathy for Palestinians — they need it!” he said. “I just wish some of the empathy was directed our way as well.”

A campus less divided than it looks

Every student I spoke to said they think even the groups at opposite ends of the ideological spectrum on Israel actually well mostly agree.

“You’ll find a lot more in common with BSI members and JFCN members than either of them would ever admit” said Stutman-Shaw.

But they did admit it. When I spoke with them both BSI and JFCN members made the same point — that most of them agree on a lot of points including criticism of the Israeli government horror at the deaths of civilians in Gaza and a desire for a ceasefire.

Talking with students from across the campus’s Jewish community the divides largely came down to details — students who want a ceasefire but are uncomfortable with using terms such as “genocide” or “anti-Zionist.” Or students who are reluctant to try to find common ground or engage with students who reacted to Oct. 7 in a way that upset them.

But many of them on all sides are trying to push through their discomfort to understand each other even when it’s difficult.

“Movements are imperfect” Radziner said. “Once you understand that you’re all working towards the same goal with different ways of getting there it lets you start to not overlook but push through the parts that you disagree with or find challenging.”

That’s what Klein the rabbi in the chaplain’s office hopes will define Brown’s protest movement.

“I was really proud that these students were still really in it and trying to make it imperfect for everyone” he said. “Everyone gets to be uncomfortable everyone gets to learn.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDMvYnVzaW5lc3Mvc3RlcmxpY2h0LWJyb3duLXVuaXZlcnNpdHktZG9ub3IuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Billionaire Donor Barry Sternlicht Assails Brown’s Deal With Protesters,"One of Brown University’s major donors the billionaire real estate mogul Barry Sternlicht on Friday sharply criticized the school’s agreement to hold a board vote on cutting investments tied to Israel calling it “unconscionable” and saying he had “paused” donations to the school.

Brown is among a small number of universities that have agreed to discuss their investments in companies that do business in Israel in order to persuade student protesters to dismantle encampments. Mr. Sternlicht in a scathing email to The New York Times which he copied to Brown’s president Christina H. Paxson said the arrangement amounted to sympathy for Hamas which attacked Israel in October and described students protesting Israel’s actions in Gaza as “ignorant.”

“There should never be a vote when people do not have the facts” he wrote. “It’s not education it’s propaganda.”

Mr. Sternlicht 63 said no deal with protesters could be fruitful because the two sides did not agree on “facts and moral clarity” as well as the scale of Israel’s invasion of Gaza after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack in which about 1200 were killed and another 250 were taken hostage. Israel’s subsequent intense bombardment of the tightly packed area has left more than 34000 dead and drawn international condemnation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNC9idXNpbmVzcy9icm93bi13aGl0ZS1lZ2dzLWNvc3QtY3VyaW91cy1jb25zdW1lci9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFSaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wNS8wNC9idXNpbmVzcy9icm93bi13aGl0ZS1lZ2dzLWNvc3QtY3VyaW91cy1jb25zdW1lcg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why do brown eggs cost more than white eggs? Blame the bird,"New York CNN —

It’s a moment many shoppers grapple with at some point during a grocery run: Why does a carton of brown eggs cost more than a carton of white eggs?

It’s not what you might think. It’s not about one type being healthier or more natural or fancier than the other but really about the nitty-gritty of farm economics. It costs more to keep the brown egg-laying hen happy and well fed.

“Basically there is no difference between a brown egg and a white egg nutritionally. It has to do with the breed of the chicken” explained Daniel Brey owner of Brey’s Egg Farm a fourth-generation family egg farm in Jeffersonville New York. The farm produces more than 200000 white eggs a day.

Some breeds such as White Leghorn chickens lay eggs with white shells while other breeds such as Rhode Island Reds lay eggs with brown shells. According to Brey the cost and taste of the egg you buy – white or brown - is determined by what – and how much – is fed to the hen.

“It has a lot to do with the chicken feed” Brey said. “It costs more to make a dozen brown eggs because the chickens that produce them tend to eat more.”

Egg farmers say brown and white eggs are closely matched in their nutritional value. Edmund McNamara

Edmund McNamara and his wife Rose run Sova Farms in Norwich NY about 200 miles north of New York City’s Central Park. Sova Farms he said is organic certified by the United States Department of Agriculture for its brown eggs and its chicken pork and lamb.

The farm currently produces about 350 brown eggs daily but expects to bump that up to over 1000 brown eggs a day after receiving a delivery of more than 700 pullets (or young hens) on this month.

“All our eggs are brown but every once in a great while a chicken will lay a very light brown” he said adding that the eggs are sold directly to consumers in New York’s Westchester County.

Harder to find

In stores brown eggs tend to carry a premium – even if it’s just because of their color anomaly.

“Eggs come in many colors not just white and brown. Depending upon the breed some are even blue and green” said Joan Frank assistant program director dietetics with the University of California David Department of Nutrition. Still there is no difference in nutritional value of eggs based on the color of the shell she said.

“I think consumers for some reason have come to believe that brown eggs are healthier which they are not” Frank said.

Sova Farms is currently selling a dozen large brown eggs for $8. Store prices for organic pastured brown eggs can be as high as $10 for a dozen while the price of conventional brown eggs is between $4.50 to $6 in most stores.

A dozen white eggs is about $2.50 in stores according to the latest weekly government data up from $1.50 a dozen from a year ago.

Yet McNamara too said “there is really no nutritional difference between white and brown eggs.”

Phil Lempert a grocery industry analyst and editor of SuperMarketGuru.com estimated how much more shoppers typically pay for brown eggs versus their white counterpart. “If there’s brown eggs next to white eggs typically you’re going to pay anywhere between 10% to 20% more for brown eggs regardless of free range or organic” he said.

The egg-onomics of it all

David Anderson professor of agricultural economics (with a specialty in livestock economics) at Texas A&M University has studied egg pricing and factors that affect it on farms and in the supermarket.

Egg prices regardless of the color of the shell generally respond to swings in demand he said. “You have short-term seasonal events such as Easter. We always see holiday demand for eggs. In the fall we also see demand increase for eggs for holiday-related activities such as baking” Anderson said.

Thrown into the mix are other influences on egg prices such as the cost of chicken feed. “Feed costs have been falling This is helping egg producers. We had a record large crop last year in the US and we have much lower corn and soybean meal prices right now he said.

Brown eggs generally cost more in stores than white eggs. It has to do with the cost of the upkeep of the chicken breed that produces brown eggs. Edmund McNamara

On the flip side the latest outbreak of Bird Flu could keep egg prices elevated versus last year. If egg producers aren’t able to meet demand because they’ve had to cull their chicken population due to bird flu then that can raise prices.

Looking specifically at the economics of producing brown eggs versus conventional white eggs Anderson confirmed it does indeed cost more to produce the brown variety. “If it costs more to produce they’ll probably be priced higher to the consumer.”

But as to the “perception” that brown eggs are healthier than white eggs?

“It’s almost like what comes first the chicken or the egg?” Anderson said. “Did the companies advertise that first or did it come from consumers who think that brown eggs just must be healthier?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9qYW5lbGxlLWJyb3duLWNlbGVicmF0ZXMtYmlydGhkYXktdHdvLW1vbnRocy1hZnRlci1zb24tZ2Fycmlzb24tZGVhdGgtODY0NDI3ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Janelle Brown Celebrates 55th Birthday Two Months After Son Garrison's Death,"Janelle Brown is marking a milestone two months after the death of her son Garrison Brown.

The Patriots met with Maye on multiple occasions including a trip to North Carolina for the Tar Heels Pro Day. During that trip Mayo and company spoke with longtime and well-respected coach Mack Brown. Mayo specifically said he received a “glowing recommendation” from the Tar Heels head coach and noted how that conversation eased any nerves about drafting Maye.

Brown a 46-year coaching veteran met with a handful of New England reporters on a video conference Monday and relayed what he told Mayo and company during the pre-draft process.

“I’ve learned that I want the high school coach to tell me the truth in recruiting so I’m very honest with the NFL coaches” Brown said. “This is important to them.

“So with Coach Mayo I knew this is huge for him just starting out in this first year. So I just told him ‘If I was the coach of the Patriots I would want Drake Maye. We all put our checks in the mouth of players and that’s what you’re (Mayo) gonna do. And I would rather have Drake Maye than anybody in the country leading my football team.’

I just told him ‘If I was the coach of the Patriots I would want Drake Maye.’ Mack Brown on conversations with Jerod Mayo

Brown’s recommendation to Mayo was echoed throughout the pre-draft process and again Monday. Brown praised Maye for his toughness competitiveness and ability to lead a rocker room with his mix of positive reinforcement and constructive criticism.

Brown even spoke to the Maye athletic and authentic family along with the quarterback’s longtime girlfriend. Maye introduced his three brothers and girlfriend to reporters during his introductory press conference at Gillette Stadium.

“He’s an unbelievable person” Brown said. “He’s one of the nicest toughest most competitive young people I’ve ever been around. I’ve said often I would adopt him. He’s that perfect of a kid. It sounds kind of corny but it’s true.”

Brown also relayed a story as to how Maye included other position groups whenever he was approached with an NIL deal. It was one of the many ways Maye proved his worth as a teammate.

“So if they came and said ‘We want you to do this advertisement.’ He said ‘Well the offensive linemen need to be with me and they need to be paid.’ Or ‘Well we want you to get fed through the seafood company for the year.’ And he said ‘That’s great the receivers and their families need to get fed too.'”

But Brown made it clear to New England’s organization the competitor they were getting too.

“He is not coming to Boston to lose” Brown said.

It seems that message was heard loud and clear throughout the Patriots organization."

(Review-Journal file)

Bill Acosta ""The Man of 1001 Voices headlined at two Strip hotels Luxor and Flamingo in the late-90s and early 2000s. (Ed Foster)

The master impressionist was the first Strip headliner I ever interviewed backstage. That night he said to me “The stage is my safe place.”

It seemed so unbelievable. To be onstage singing and telling jokes under bright lights in front of a packed crowd appeared terrifying. But not to Bill Acosta. He was so comfortable there a classic showman telegenic and moving easily in his tux. His friends compared him to Cary Grant with a microphone and they were right. Acosta was just born to do it as we say. I smiled through his recitations of Jack Nicholson Willlie Nelson Frank Sinatra Julio Iglesias Jack Benny George Burns and so many more stars.

The night we chatted in the spring of 1999 Acosta had just opened at his “Lasting Impressions” at Pharaoh’s Theater at Luxor. We know that room today as Atrium Showroom where Carrot Top and “Fantasy” perform. Built for Bill nearly a quarter-century ago it is still home to hit shows.

We lost Acosta the entertainer known as ‘The Man of 1001 Voices” on Jan. 26 after a long battle with Parkinson’s in Las Vegas. He was 74. Acosta’s family including his daughter Angela Knudson who is a dancer in “Legendary Divas” at the Tropicana and her husband Brett were at his side. So was his ex-wife and longtime manager Jeanne Bavaro who wrote Acosta’s productions and worked with entertainment icon Joel Fischman to bring Acosta to his Luxor residency.

There will be the final show for Acosta. His celebration of life is set for noon-3 p.m. Saturday at Italian American Club Showroom. A program featuring singers speeches video montages was put together by Acosta’s ex-wife and longtime manager Jeanne Bavaro. Clint Holmes Frankie Scinta and Frank Pizarro head up the performers who knew Acosta. Lounge great Joe Darro is also expected to perform.

Those who knew of Acosta mostly through Bavaro including Maren Wade of “The Cocktail Cabaret” and ex-“Jersey Boys” co-star Travis Cloer are also adding to the celebration. A final video performed to “How Do You Keep the Music Playing?” features more than 50 entertainers who worked with Acosta over the years.

Acosta had originally worked in Vegas in the early 1970s and was among the performers who opened Cleopatra’s Barge at Caesars Palace. He was first a great jazz singer working the nightclub circuit in Florida. The young showman was discovered by Dorothy McGuire of the McGuire Sisters who signed on as Acosta’s first manager.

Acosta started peppering his show with impressions. Acosta would open for the top touring headliners of the day including Henny Youngman Lola Falana Ben Vereen Frankie Valli and Rodney Dangerfield.

Acosta’s time as a Las Vegas headliner was impressive though too brief. He headlined at Luxor for a little less than two years then moved his expanded orchestral production to Flamingo Showroom (where he worked with legendary pianist Vince Falcone and the venerable Joey Singer). He went on to headline a few performances at Suncoast Showroom. But Acosta was forced to call it a career in June 2008 as his declining health began to strip him of his stage skills.

Acosta’s career was effectively over by the time he was 61.

“It was a shame that he could not go longer because he was so great and did so many impressions” his friend and contemporary Rich Little said. “But more even than a great showman he was just a great guy. He was such a nice nice man and a class act. Everybody loved Bill.”

Little invited a veritable Mount Rushmore-Plus of impressionists to his Las Vegas Walk of Stars ceremony on the Strip in December 2005. Scinta Fred Travalena Bob Anderson and Gordie Brown were all on hand. So was Acosta no question belonging in that class.

I often reach back to that night in ‘99 when Acosta invited me to his Green Room to talk of his passion for live performance. He strode in beaming his bow tie loosened carrying all that charisma. They call it star power and Bill Acosta had it in spades.

‘Enigma’ TBD

Lady Gaga’s “Enigma” production is still on the shelf. There is no formal promise it will return to Dolby Live though we expect that it will. Gaga has booked her fabulous “Jazz + Piano” production for nine shows April 1-May 1. But she has not performed her adventurous pop show since before the pandemic.

Gaga’s delayed “Chromatica Ball” world tour has been rescheduled from mid-July through its Sept. 10 closer at Dodger Stadium. It’s highly unlikely she would restart “Enigma” after three months on the road. We’d probably see “Jazz + Piano” back even in November-December before “Enigma” is reassembled. Look for the pop show’s return instead in 2023.

What to look for …

Celine Dion to be back onstage in November at the Theatre at Resorts World. This is through a read of many tea leaves.

We can’t claim to be fully back when …

“Atomic Saloon Show” has sold fewer than 30 tickets at The Venetian’s Grand Canal Shoppes and “Ka” has papered its crowd at MGM Grand with 300 comps. Both are recent midweek reports. The numbers outside of the weekends continue to be inconsistent and unpredictable. But the Silk Sonic return last week sold a massive number of tickets day-of on Wednesday to reach 90-percent at Dolby Theater.

Great Moments in Social Media

Adele tweeted for the first time in five weeks on Saturday. Twice. She plugged “An Audience With Adele” her NBC concert special set to broadcast at 9 p.m. Sunday. Fans went wild. Scary Spice showed up “and it was just the best knees up of a night.” Knees up is a party folks and it’s time to bring it to Caesars.

Cool Hang Alert

Jazz Outreach Initiative is playing a pair of shows March 27 both at Nicholas J. Horn Theater at CSN’s Cheyenne Campus. At 2 p.m. it’s “The Life And Music of Miles Davis” featuring the JOI Jazz Sextet in a show licensed by Jazz at Lincoln Center. At 7 p.m. it’s the JOI Jazz Orchestra with Holmes as guest star. Both shows are free but require separate tickets. Go to jazzoutreachinitiative.org for info.

The Tahoe Biltmore’s days are numbered after a 76-year run.

California-based real estate group EKN Development acquired the historic Lake Tahoe casino and resort last September for $56.8 million. The 15-acre property purchase is for EKN to make way for a luxury resort and residential complex overlooking Crystal Bay.

The new owners announced this week that its development plans remain on track. And step one of the rebuild includes a graduated shutdown — as required under regulations imposed by the Nevada Gaming Commission — that will begin on April 23. Come 5 am on April 30 the Tahoe Biltmore will forever close its doors.

Developers say demolition of the aging and deteriorating hotel and casino will then occur. EKN plans to build a luxury resort and “branded residences” in its place.

The project has the working name of Lake Tahoe Luxury Resort and Residences.

“Nestled into the lush wilderness of North Tahoe EKN’s 15-acre Lake Tahoe Luxury Resort is bringing luxury and sophistication to the iconic mountain town. Designed to accentuate Lake Tahoe’s unparalleled natural locale and modernize traditional mountain architecture in the region our alpine resort will welcome visitors and locals alike to experience all Lake Tahoe has to offer” EKN says on its website.

Developer Pledges Commitment

EKN is betting big on the north shore. Along with its purchase of the Tahoe Biltmore the group in late December agreed to purchase Beesley Cottages for $18 million. The acquisition comes with 10 rundown old cabins on 2.25 acres of land. EKN says the cottages will be demolished in favor of a new high-end lakefront beach club.

The Crystal Bay community is skeptical of EKN’s grand plans after several other developers have failed to deliver on their promises over the past decade-plus. But EKN wants to assure locals that it’s investing for the long term.

With all its projects EKN is committed to transparency and active communication with all stakeholders. We’re builders and operators. We build our projects to hold and intend to be a part of the community for a long time” Ebbie K. Nakhjavani founder and CEO of EKN told the Reno Gazette-Journal.

Details Scant But Gaming to Return

EKN isn’t publicly declaring the fiscal scope of its Lake Tahoe endeavors nor details on how many rooms and what sort of amenities the luxury resort might entail.

The Tahoe Biltmore project however has been approved for 334 units inclusive of guestrooms cottages and residencies. The Tahoe Biltmore currently has 113 total occupancies which includes 18 cottages.

EKN did say that it expects the demolition and then planning and building of the luxury resort and residencies to take roughly three-and-a-half years to complete. The company is targeting an opening in the third quarter of 2025.

Gaming is currently planned to return at the forthcoming resort by way of “an upscale and intimate casino.” EKN has no history operating casino gambling according to its online portfolio.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vYWtpaGFiYXJhbmV3cy5jb20vbWFyaW8taG8tZmFpbHMtdG8tc2lsZW5jZS13YWtheWFtYS1pci1taXNnaXZpbmdzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mario Ho Fails to Silence Wakayama IR Misgivings,"Akihabara News (Tokyo) — The appearance on March 17 of Mario Ho and other representatives of the Clairvest Group-led consortium aiming to build the ¥470 billion (US$4 billion) Integrated Resort (IR) including a casino in Wakayama city failed to quell the misgivings of some members of the IR Countermeasures Special Committee of the Wakayama Prefectural Assembly.

Clairvest is gradually filling some of the details about the shape of the consortium and its financing arrangements but even at the eleventh hour information gaps remain.

What is currently public is that 30% of the needed construction funds—¥145 billion (US$1.2 billion)—are expected to come from the direct investment of the partners and the remaining 70%—¥325 billion (US$2.8 billion)—is to be covered by borrowing.

The facts are not entirely clear with regard to either portion.

As for the investment segment 27.5% is expected to be put up by Clairvest Neem Ventures 27.5% by the Canadian mother company Clairvest Group 5% by casino giant Caesars Entertainment and 40% by “minority shareholders.”

And who exactly are these minority shareholders? Nishimatsu Construction is the only one that has been specifically named and it is not clear how much money they would be investing.

Similarly there are now three financial institutions that have been named in regard to the provision of loans—Credit Suisse Cantor Fitzgerald and Hanwha Investment & Securities—but it is not evident exactly how much they would loan to the project and it does not appear that they have yet made firm commitments beyond letters of intent.

Nevertheless Mario Ho (a son of the late Macau casino mogul Stanley Ho) gave an upbeat account to the committee through a video link from China declaring that he has full confidence in the plan.

Ho also promised that if construction expenses turned out to be greater than anticipated or other similar problems emerged then he would not seek compensation from the taxpayers of the prefecture.

“I decided to move forward after understanding the political risks” he says.

Takeshi Kaji of Clairvest Neem Ventures when asked about the impact of the Covid pandemic speculated that the local economy will likely pick up by the latter half of this decade when the facility opens its doors.

Wakayama Governor Yoshinobu Nisaka who has been the main booster for IR development since the beginning pronounced himself satisfied telling the committee “The certainty of the investment has increased considerably. I think this will work.”

Others are not so sure. Committee Chairman Masaki Fujiyama said “The plan is moving forward but I want them to respond more sincerely and to make it a more concrete and persuasive plan.”

However the Deben Road surgery is to close to almost all clinical services on April 4 with patients sent to either Norwich Road or Chesterfield Drive. Deben Road will remain the administrative centre for the practice.

When the new building opens all clinical work will be carried out from there and Chesterfield Drive and Deben Road will be closed completely. The Norwich Road surgery will be an administrative centre and retain some triage services but patients will go to the new surgery.

The new surgery would be built for Suffolk Primary Care by a partnership between the NHS and Ipswich Council which owns the land it will be built on.

A public consultation has been launched on the plans and people have until May 24 to comment on them by visiting a website set up to outline them and provide links showing what the new surgery will look like.

The Practice says the new building would allow it to expand as more people move into the area in the future.

James Cucchiarra managing director Suffolk Primary Care said: “The three buildings where we currently provide services from are no longer fit for purpose and in need of upgrade.

“We want to find out from local people how this proposal would impact them and if they believe the site is suitable for their needs as well as to share more detail about our ideas.

“We believe the proposed location is well served by public transport and accessible to the communities we currently serve. It would also allow us to review the way we currently provide our services.

“If the plans do progress it would mean more clinicians would be on site making it safer and there would be additional car parking available to our patients.”

The proposed site is about a mile from the Norwich Road Surgery - the furthest from it - but is nearer to the Whitton and Whitehouse estates and is not far from the Number 9 and 10 Ipswich Buses routes.

Cruise lines are unique work environments and the Carnival family is coming together to support its family members with connections to both Ukraine and Russia.

Carnival Supports Crew Members

In a letter provided to guests onboard its ships Carnival Cruise Line has commented that it is providing support to crew members from Ukraine and Russia. While the letter does not detail how many crew members hail from each country there are more than 120 countries represented across the Carnival fleet.

“Some of them are directly impacted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. We have both Russian and Ukrainian nationals across our fleet – none of whom have anything to do with the invasion but all of them concerned about their family and friends back home.”

The letter does not outline precisely what support options are being offered but does state that “we are providing support to those team members impacted just like we would do so for any team member that is dealing with a personal event or natural disaster back home.”

Measures Carnival has taken in the past include offering facilitated email or phone communication arranging safer travel plans for crew members ending their contracts and providing counseling support. It is likely that similar measures are now being offered for both Ukrainian and Russian crew members.

Recently Royal Caribbean announced similar support measures for its crew members from Russia and Ukraine. Carnival Cruise Line along with other major and smaller lines has also begun working to remove Russian ports of call from its itineraries in the coming weeks and months to ensure the safety of guests and crew members.

What Can Cruise Guests Do?

While it may not seem like cruise passengers can do much to help showing support for Russian and Ukrainian crew members can be done in many ways.

All Carnival team members have their home countries printed on their name tags. Guests who see Russia or Ukraine on a name tag can show support by simply asking the crew member about their family and listening to their story.

Offering small gestures such as a sincere thank you an extra gratuity or taking steps to make the crew member’s work lighter – such as keeping a stateroom tidy for a Ukrainian or Russian steward – can make a world of difference when a crew member’s personal life may be in turmoil.

Guests can also mention crew members by name in post-cruise surveys pointing out their exceptional work even while under such devastating personal stress. These surveys which are emailed to Carnival guests several days after a cruise ends are used in part to determine crew members’ bonuses and promotions.

Cruise Hive’s thoughts remain with all crew members from all cruise lines impacted by this conflict with hopes for a peaceful resolution and safety for everyone involved.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RyYXZlbC1ldXJvcGUtbGlmZXN0eWxlLWJlbGdpdW0tYnJ1c3NlbHMtOTU3M2U5OTk5OTU5ZWFjNzkwMTZhZDQ4NTkzNGI0MzHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Car runs into Carnival revelers in Belgium killing 6,"BRUSSELS (AP) — A car slammed at high speed into Carnival revelers in a small town in southern Belgium early Sunday killing six people and leaving 10 more with life-threatening injuries authorities said adding many others were lightly injured.

“What should have been a great party turned into a tragedy” said Belgian Interior Minister Annelies Verlinden.

The prosecutor’s office which gave the death toll also said two local people in their thirties were arrested at the scene in Strépy-Bracquegnies 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of Brussels. Prosecutors said in the early stages of their investigation there were no elements to suspect a terror motive.

In an age-old tradition Carnival revelers had gathered at dawn intending to pick up others at their homes along the way to finally hold their famous festivity again after it was banned for the past two years to counter the spread of COVID-19. Some dressed in colorful garb with bells attached walking behind the beat of drums. It was supposed to be a day of deliverance.

Instead said mayor Jacques Gobert “what happened turned it into a national catastrophe.”

More than 150 people of all ages had gathered around 5 a.m. and were standing in a thick crowd along a long straight road. Suddenly “a car drove from the back at high speed. And we have a few dozen injured and unfortunately several people who are killed” Gobert said.

The driver and a second person were arrested when their car came to a halt a few hundred meters (yards) further on.

Since Belgium was hit with twin terror attacks in Brussels and Zaventem that killed 32 civilians six years ago thoughts of a terror motive are never far away.

But prosecutor Damien Verheyen said “there is no element in the investigation at this time that allows me to consider that the motivations of the two could have been terror related.”

The prosecutor’s office also denied media reports that the crash may have been caused by a car that was being chased by police.

King Philippe and Prime Minister Alexander De Croo were expected to visit Strépy-Bracquegnies later Sunday to express support for the families of the dead and those injured.

Carnival is extremely popular in the area. Carnival festivities in nearby Binche have even been declared a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkaXJvbmRhY2tkYWlseWVudGVycHJpc2UuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy8yMDIyLzAzL2xha2UtcGxhY2lkLWNhcm5pdmFsLXJveWFsdHktY3Jvd25lZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lake Placid Carnival royalty crowned | News Sports Jobs,"The carnival court was able to host a coronation this year after the pandemic stalled ceremonies last year. Carnival usually takes place in January but the school postponed events this year in hopes that students could have a more “normal” experience with less pandemic-related safety regulations at carnival. Statewide mask mandates in schools were lifted March 2 two weeks before carnival.

The school’s auditorium was filled with parents students and staff on Thursday who clapped for and cheered on the court. This year’s carnival theme was “Circus” and the Winter Carnival band directed by Emileigh Kukuvka and Lake Placid Elementary School students gave themed performances.

Hemsley 17 and Armstrong 18 were selected as king and queen by a vote from teachers and students in grades 9 through 12. Armstrong said it’s “an honor.”

Armstrong described the king and queen as “the face” of the senior class or the school at the time of carnival. He said he was honored that all of his classmates selected him for that position.

“It’s a good feeling” Hemsley said “but I would have been just as happy for any of the other candidates if they won.”

Armstrong agreed that all of the candidates were equally deserving of the crown. Hemsley added that it was a little sad to have the other candidates who she said are her best friends hold the train of her cape.

Hemsley grew up in Lake Placid. She has played varsity soccer throughout her four years of high school. She was also on the ski team for two years played softball for two years and she’s played lacrosse for the last two years. She is the senior class secretary a member of the Key Club and a member of the National Honor Society. She plans to attend St. Lawrence University next year.

Armstrong moved to Lake Placid from Saugerties during his freshman year. He has played varsity soccer basketball and golf for the last four years. Armstrong is the senior class treasurer and a member of the National Honor Society. He most recently performed as Prince Eric in the school’s performance of “The Little Mermaid.” Armstrong plans to attend college in the fall and major in secondary education.

Armstrong and Hemsley agreed that being active in sports helped them to make friends and get involved with the school during their time in high school.

“Honestly if I didn’t play sports I don’t know where I’d be right now” Armstrong said. “I wouldn’t have met all of these great people.”

The day of Winter Carnival is traditionally packed with sport-related activities before the coronation and this year was no exception. Students attended opening ceremonies participated in egg fanning cup stacking and three-legged races as well as games of basketball volleyball ping pong and — Armstrong’s and Hemsley’s favorite — dodgeball. The seniors won that one.

“The seniors always win” Armstrong and Hemsley said.

The seniors swept all of the class awards at the coronation too receiving best sportsmanship best lip dub and top class competitor for the day’s activities.

Friday was Superintendent’s Conference Day and students had the day off. Armstrong and Hemsley said the break was welcome especially after a long day of carnival activities.

The Archbishop of this year’s carnival was Debbie Preston. King and queen candidates included Emma Adragna Elsie Fitzsimmons Hemsley Melanie Megliore Armstrong Coleden Lewis Caleb Mihill and Tristan Spotts. Junior class carnival court included Julia Crawford Sydney Lawrence Foster Wood and Alex Wright. Sophomore carnival court included Emily Kostoss Jesse Marshall Nadia Phillip and Josh Taylor. Freshman carnval court included Levi Barney Norah Galvin Parker Scanio and Emma Wylie. Hannah Wylie and Spencer Hoffman were this year’s Mistress and Master of Ceremonies.

The 19th Annual Thunder Bay Winter Carnival held on Feb. 7 1953 brought back fond memories for Sybil (Roundeau) Banks then 17 and her younger sister Beverly (Roundeau) Kindt of Alpena.

Sybil now 86 was overjoyed to hear that the Ice Fest was being held this year organized by Thunder Bay Arts. While not nearly as elaborate as Winter Carnivals of old Ice Fest offered activities such as ice bowling ice sculpture carving a huge bonfire downtown specials and festivities and more.

“Sybil was a cheerleader at Catholic Central very outgoing gal very beautiful” Kindt said of her older sister who had a twin Sylvia who has since passed.

Kindt took photos to Sybil recently and they both enjoyed looking through the photos and old newspaper clippings from the 1950s.

“I took these in to her and she was so excited to see her name and remember Joan Ferris the different girls” Kindt said. “Happy memories.”

Kindt 81 was excited to attend the 2022 Ice Fest held on Feb. 12. Although it was very cold she loved seeing all the people out enjoying the festivities. It reminded her of years past. She participated in figure skating during the 1950s at the carnival.

“I skated in 1957” Kindt recalled noting that they wore short felt skirts and no tights. “It was so cold I remember my teeth chattering … no tights bare legs. And I remember when my mother came to pick me up I said ‘that’s it. I’m quitting skating class. I’m never doing this again.’ And I didn’t.”

She was 16 at the time.

But that didn’t stop her from enjoying the carnival back then and today."

Some countries and regions have adopted carbon pricing such as carbon taxes and emissions trading as countermeasures against global warming. However there is a concern about cross-border carbon leakage when a country introduces carbon pricing. Even if carbon emissions decrease in that country as a result of carbon pricing carbon leakage increases carbon emissions abroad and in some cases even increases global emissions. Cross-border carbon leakage undermines a country’s attempt to deal with climate change.

The literature has identified the following three main channels of carbon leakage.

When carbon-intensive goods exporters or importers introduce carbon pricing the world price of fossil fuels falls which in turn increases fossil fuel consumption and carbon emissions in other countries (e.g. Bohm 1993 Felder and Rutherford 1993 Kiyono and Ishikawa 2004 2013 Hoel 2005). Firms shift their production plants from countries with carbon pricing to countries with lax emission regulations thereby increasing carbon emissions in the latter (e.g. Markusen et al. 1993 1995 Kayalica and Lahiri 2005 Zeng and Zhao 2009 Ishikawa and Okubo 2011 2016 2017). As carbon-intensive goods producers in countries with carbon pricing lose their competitiveness foreign rivals increase their production leading to an increase in their carbon emissions (e.g. Copeland and Taylor 2005 Ishikawa et al. 2012).

International trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) exert an important influence on the channels explained above. In fact many studies that analyse the effects of emission regulations from a global perspective incorporate international trade and FDI. However most of those studies do not consider international transport. Those that address the interaction between trade transport and the environment assume that the freight rates are exogenously given without an explicit model of the transport sector (e.g. Cristea 2013 Vöhringer et al. 2013 Shapiro 2016).

Furthermore the amount of carbon emissions created by international transportation itself is too large to ignore. According to the International Maritime Organisation international transport emitted approximately 920 million tonnes of CO2 in 2018 surpassing Germany's national emissions (the sixth-highest emission in the world). The Paris Agreement which came into effect in 2016 did not set specific targets for emissions from international transportation. Recently leaders of several countries and industry associations delivered a series of statements regarding global warming countermeasures related to international transport:

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) started the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) in 2021.

In May 2021 the EU announced that international aviation and shipping will be included in the Emissions Trading System (ETS).

In September 2021 the US government announced a goal to reduce aviation-related global warming gas emissions by 20% by 2030.

In October 2021 the International Air Transport Association adopted a target of virtually zero global warming gas emissions in 2050.

At COP26 22 countries sign the Clydebank Declaration to create zero-emission shipping routes.

In a recent paper (Higashida et al. 2021) we theoretically analyse the effect of unilateral carbon pricing on carbon emissions from production consumption and international transport by explicitly modelling the international transport sector. Our model is based on the endogenous transport cost literature which has found that the international transport sector is highly concentrated with transport firms having market power (Hummels et al. 2009). The transport firms charge asymmetric freight rates on shipping in different directions on the same trade route subject to the backhaul problem. The backhaul problem arises when the transport firm's shipping capacity is not utilised at the maximum level on the backhaul because of asymmetry in trade volumes. Notably endogenous determination of international transport volumes and prices explains a new mechanism of cross-border and cross-sector carbon leakage.

Figure 1 Top 10 deep-sea container shipping lines ranked by deployed capacity and market share May 2020

Figure 2 Inter-regional contract freight rates 2018–2020

Source: UNCTAD Review of Marine Transport 2020 Table 3.1.

The effectiveness of carbon pricing depends on the presence or absence of a backhaul problem.

If the exports from country A to country B (the fronthaul) exceed those from country B to country A (the backhaul) the backhaul problem is present. The equilibrium freight rate on exports from B to A is then independent of the marginal costs of shipping (Ishikawa and Tarui 2018). Therefore even though carbon pricing in shipping raises the effective marginal costs of shipping it affects the freight rates in an asymmetric manner when the backhaul problem is present. Under this situation carbon pricing on the transport sector reduces the fronthaul but affects neither the backhaul nor the associated emissions. We show that unilateral carbon pricing on goods consumption is effective. However carbon pricing on goods production results in ‘positive’ cross-border carbon leakage: country A's carbon pricing on production lowers the fronthaul but increases the production in country B and the backhaul and hence generates positive cross-border carbon leakage. These changes are conventional but the endogenous increase in the freight rate mitigates them meaning the behaviour of transport firms weakens cross-border carbon leakage.

By contrast if the fronthaul equals the backhaul (i.e. the backhaul problem is absent) we find that both cross-border and cross-sector carbon leakage caused by carbon pricing can be ‘negative’. In other words carbon pricing can be exceptionally effective because carbon pricing on a sector in a trading country may reduce emissions not only from the target sector but also from other sectors including those in other trading countries. For example carbon pricing on shipping increases freight rates for both directions leading to the decrease in both fronthaul and backhaul. Thus emissions not only from the transport firm but also from the manufacturing firms can decrease implying that negative ‘cross-sector’ carbon leakage can occur. This observation identifies a new source of carbon leakage due to endogenous transport costs. We also show that if the backhaul problem is absent any carbon pricing is effective because the global greenhouse gas emissions necessarily decrease.

Our analysis also indicates that carbon pricing on international transport may not reduce overall trade-related emissions once we consider the interplay between endogenous transport costs and manufacturers' decisions on FDI. Faced with a manufacturer that may engage in horizontal FDI (i.e. in local production) the carrier may deter it strategically because the demand for transport decreases if horizontal FDI does not induce any trade in intermediate inputs. Moreover even if the carrier accommodates such FDI it prefers FDI with a single foreign plant to FDI with two plants (a domestic and foreign plant) because there is no demand for international transport with two-plant FDI. Thus the carrier has an incentive to induce single-plant FDI. These strategic moves by the carrier also affect the global emissions.

These findings follow from our theoretical framework which addresses the interlinkage between trade transport and environment by considering the transport sector explicitly. They indicate another benefit of comprehensive regulation of emissions from both production (or consumption) and transport.

We argue that it is important to understand the market environment of the international transport sector when designing carbon pricing. In particular the backhaul problem impairs not only the efficiency of transportation but also the effectiveness of carbon pricing. The effectiveness of carbon pricing will increase if policies can be taken to eliminate the backhaul problem at the same time as carbon pricing.

The closure of Russian airspace to some international carriers including many in Europe has forced airlines to seek alternate routes. For some flights such as those linking Europe and Southeast Asia that’s especially problematic since Russia the world’s largest country stands directly in between.

The problem is best illustrated by Finnair’s flight from Helsinki to Tokyo. Before the invasion of Ukraine planes from Finland’s national carrier would take off and quickly veer into the airspace of neighboring Russia crossing it for over 3000 miles.

They would then enter China near its northern border with Mongolia fly in its airspace for about 1000 miles before entering Russia again just north of Vladivostok.

Finally they’d cross the Sea of Japan and turn south towards Narita Airport. The journey would take just under nine hours on average and cover nearly 5000 miles.

The last such flight departed on February 26. The next day Russia barred Finland from using its airspace forcing the temporary cancellation of most of Finnair’s Asian destinations including South Korea Singapore and Thailand.

Prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine many airlines traversed Russian airspace. FlightRadar24

By that point however the airline’s route planners had long been at work to find a solution. “We made the first very rough calculation about two weeks before the actual closure of the airspace” says Riku Kohvakka manager of flight planning at Finnair.

The solution was to fly over the North Pole. Instead of heading southeast into Russia planes would now depart Helsinki and go straight north heading for the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard before crossing over the pole and Alaska.

Then they would veer towards Japan flying over the Pacific carefully skirting Russian airspace. That’s not as straightforward as before: The journey now takes over 13 hours covers approximately 8000 miles and uses 40% more fuel.

Safety first

Finnair started flying via the polar route to Japan on March 9. So how does an airline completely redesign one of its longest flights in just over a week?

“All major airlines have their own computerized flight planning system which they use to plan routes and change them” explains Kohvakka. In the software the airspace of specific countries can be crossed out and waypoints can be manually inserted to help it calculate alternative routes.

The next step is a new operational flight plan which tells the crew what the planned route is how much fuel they need how much the plane can weigh and so on.

“From experience we knew we had two possibilities: one via the north and one via the south” says Kohvakka.

In addition to the polar route Finnair can also reach Japan by flying south of Russia – over the Baltics Poland Slovak Republic Hungary Romania Bulgaria Turkey Georgia Azerbaijan Turkmenistan Uzbekistan Kazakhstan to China Korea and then to Japan. It’s longer but if wind conditions are particularly favorable it can be used resulting in a similar flight time.

Then fuel consumption data together with navigational fees is used to estimate the cost for the flight.

“After that we need to check what kind of terrain we are flying over. For example to see if the elevation at any point of the route requires special planning in case we lose an engine or pressurization – something that is always considered when preparing a flight” Kohvakka says.

Once the new route is approved the focus shifts to aircraft equipment and the associated processes and regulations.

Among them is one called ETOPS (“Extended-range Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards”) which dates back to the 1950s when aircraft engines were less dependable and more prone to failing. ETOPS is a certification provided to aircraft that determined how far a plane with only two engines could fly from the nearest airport in case it needed an emergency landing due to engine failure. “We need to have a suitable airport where we can divert to within a certain time limit” says Kohvakka.

The regulation was initially set to 60 minutes but as airplanes grew more dependable it was gradually extended. Just a few weeks ago Finnair was operating under the widely adopted ETOPS 180 rule which meant that its twin-engine aircraft could fly up to three hours away from the nearest airport at any time.

The new Arctic route however flies over very remote areas where airports are few and far between. As a result the airline had to apply for an extension of that protocol to 300 minutes meaning the Airbus A350-900s it uses to fly to Japan can now stray as far as five hours away from the nearest airport while still meeting all international regulations and safety protocols.

Cold War route

Airlines routinely deal with closure of airspace for example during spacecraft launches and military drills and prior conflicts have curtailed or halted flight over Afghanistan Syria and Pakistan. A closure of this magnitude however has not occurred since Cold War times.

Because overflight rights are negotiated between nations rather than individual airlines Russia and Finland secured an agreement only in 1994 two years after the Soviet Union disintegrated.

Previously Finnair like most other European airlines did not fly over the Soviet Union at all. When it began operations to Tokyo in 1983 it also flew across the North Pole and Alaska.

“So this route is not totally new to us” says Kohvakka. Finnair was the first airline to fly the route nonstop using DC-10 aircraft whereas most others at the time had a refueling stop in Anchorage.

The new route increases fuel consumption by a whopping 20 tons making the flights environmentally and financially challenging. For that reason Finnair is prioritizing cargo where demand is stronger and limiting passenger capacity to just 50 seats (the Airbus A350-900s used on the flights could carry up to 330 people).

“The extra trip length will make fewer flights economically viable” says Jonas Murby an aviation analyst at Aerodynamic Advisory. “They become very dependent on a high mix of premium passengers and high-yield cargo; this in an environment where overall demand for travel along these routes is still relatively low. I doubt this will be a widely adopted strategy.”

Japan Airlines is so far the only other airline using the polar route for its flights between Europe and Japan. The London to Tokyo service now flies over Alaska Canada Greenland and Iceland which has increased the average flight time from just over 12 hours to about 14 hours and 30 minutes according to Flightradar24.

Northern lights

The A350 is said to be particularly resilient to cold temperatures. Finnair

An extra four hours of flight time also has an impact on passengers and crew further increasing costs.

“Usually we fly to Japan with a crew of three pilots” explains Aleksi Kuosmanen deputy fleet chief pilot at Finnair who is also a captain on the new flights. “Now we operate it with four pilots. We have a specific flight crew bunk where we can sleep and have a rest and we have also increased the number of meals.”

Passengers have reacted cheerfully to the new route according to Kuosmanen.

“I would say that people were enthusiastic” he said. “Many were asking at what time we would be going across the pole and if northern lights were expected.”

Finnair is giving out ""diplomas"" and stickers to certify passengers have flown over the North Pole. Finnair

There’s also an advantage to having a 300-seater capped at just 50 passengers: “I had a stroll through the cabin during the night and… let’s say they had space.”

Finnair is also giving out stickers and “diplomas” that certify to passengers that they have flown over the North Pole.

Technically the polar route doesn’t pose any extra safety risks.

“Cold weather is probably the first thing that comes to mind and it’s true that there are regions with cold air masses at high altitude but we’re fairly used to this when we fly northern routes to Tokyo in the Russian airspace anyway” says Kuosmanen.

One issue could be that the fuel temperature becomes too low but the A350 is particularly resilient against cold air Kuosmanen says which makes it ideal for the route.

There are other minor quibbles. For example satellite voice communications don’t cover the whole Arctic region so crews have to rely on HF radio a technology that is almost 100 years old.

In addition to that there are areas with strong magnetic radiation to be considered during the flight.

“We have a good old magnetic compass in the aircraft in addition to several modern navigational aids and it went a little bit haywire while we were flying over the magnetic North Pole” says Kuosmanen. (This causes no harm to the aircraft at all).

Overall from a pilot standpoint the polar route makes things more interesting but doesn’t fundamentally alter the job.

“The polar area is probably where every pilot who flies long-haul wants to operate” says Kuosmanen. “But once one is well prepared and well briefed it’s just another day at the office.”

Green hydrogen production was already set to take off this year globally and pass the 1-GW-milestone in 2022. However the war in Ukraine has turbocharged the sector. Green hydrogen’s potential win comes at the expense of its fossil fuel-linked blue and gray alternatives whose costs have increased by over 70% since the start of the war in Ukraine rising from about $8/kg to$12/kg in a matter of days. The EU has announced plans for a €300 million funding package for hydrogen as well as the Hydrogen Accelerator initiative from REPowerEU aiming at reducing the region’s dependence on Russian gas with a further wave of support packages for green hydrogen specifically likely to emerge. Individual member states have also accelerated their domestic plans. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine the economics of green hydrogen have become increasingly attractive with lower production costs of $4/kg (particularly in the Iberian Peninsula) compared to $14/kg for blue and $12/kg for gray in other part of Europe.

Green hydrogen promises energy security as well as potential new regional economies for renewable energy. While some countries are focused on domestic usage others are focusing on exports suggesting that we may be moving from a world where energy is sourced in a few key regions to a world where production is more spread-out. The decade ahead is a make or break one for the green hydrogen sector – if production can be increased as planned to more than 10 million tons globally by 2030 and costs cut to $1.5/kg or less then the industry will become a permanent fixture of the global energy mix.

While industry and governments are heading in the right direction their challenge is to lower the risks for green hydrogen investors and create incentives necessary to scale up quickly both the demand and supply. Fundamentally a world where green hydrogen fulfills the role currently played by oil gas and coal will look very different. Minh Khoi Le head of hydrogen research Rystad Energy

Regional and country breakdowns

For Europe in particular green hydrogen is an attractive alternative with Germany already planning to produce 25 gigawatts (GW) by 2040 and Spain on track to produce more than 4 GW by 2030.

However besides industry applications where hydrogen is already a key feedstock the amount of hydrogen required to replace gas and coal in Europe’s power sector is enormous – its own gas and coal usage is set to represent 1020 TWh and 602 TWh in 2030 and 2040 respectively in Europe’s power mix base case. If this was to be generated by hydrogen alone it would require about 54 million tons of hydrogen in 2030.

Europe is currently on track to produce 3 million tons green hydrogen per annum by 2030 so the gap is considerable. The new RePowerEU target put it at 15 million tons for Europe so significant ramp up can be expected. While it is challenging and unlikely for hydrogen to be used as a complete replacement fuel for thermal power plants mixing hydrogen with natural gas or co-fire ammonia and coal to generate power can be a step toward reducing the use of fossil fuel. This approach has been successfully tested in Europe China and Japan and would require no major infrastructure changes providing the hydrogen content is less than 20%.

India has announced a new policy on green hydrogen which is set to boost production. Costs are already low at $5 to $6 per kg and are expected to drop by 40% under the country’s new guidelines – eventually reaching $1/kg by the end of the decade. The planned production is earmarked for domestic use.

In Africa Mauritania is taking a regional lead with its 40 GW AMAN project aiming to export hydrogen and derivatives to Europe and other markets. In Latin America Chile too has plans to become a major exporter with capacity of 24 GW by 2030 and in Central Asia Kazakhstan is planning a 30 GW facility. Foreign direct investment and financial support will be key to getting these projects off the ground with abundant renewable potential space for mega facilities and low labor costs weighing on the positive side.

Green hydrogen dominates

Green hydrogen is set to dominate over fossil-derived production with carbon capture and storage (blue hydrogen). In 2021 188 electrolysis projects were announced versus 24 for fossil-based low-carbon methods.

Turquoise hydrogen which is derived from natural gas or biomethane intro hydrogen and solid carbon does not require expensive capital expenditure in carbon capture and storage solutions. Despite only having a handful of commercial scale projects in the pipeline more than $1 billion in funding has been promised to the sector.

Ammonia as a carrier

Ammonia is quickly standing out as one of the key carriers for hydrogen. Existing infrastructure for the 150 million tons used by the fertilizer industry each year can facilitate global trade. With the emergence of ammonia engines demand for it as a shipping fuel is expected to quickly rise doubling the current 150-million-tons-level from 2040.

Demand from the power sector is less certain. State owned utility giant China Energy successfully trialed a 35% ammonia mixing for a 40 MW coal-fired boiler. Japan and South Korea have set a target of 20% ammonia mixing by 2025 and 2035 respectively. If this were increased to 35% then overall demand for ammonia could double to above 300 million tonnes as early as 2030.

New Delhi: From being India’s first airline to entering the Guinness World Record for the largest evacuation conducted by a civil airline Air India has made history not just once or twice but multiple times. The 90-year-old airline has contributed majorly in the moments in history one being in 1962.

The world was introduced to jets in the 1930-40s. The jet engine revolutionised air travel as it let manufacturers develop resistant and long-lasting jets enabled aircraft manufacturers. It also transformed how Indians travelled the globe. But only a few would know that the beginning of India’s Jet Age was ushered in by Air India in 1960s.

The first jet that India and its first airline received was a Boeing 707-437. It was delivered from Seattle via New York and London to Mumbai and the distance of 4850 miles was covered in a record non-stop flight of 8 hours and 5 minutes.

First Asian airline to enter the Jet Age

Not only did Air India got a 707 jet in its fleet also it also earned fame as being the first Asian airline to enter the Jet Age!

First airline globally to run an all-jet fleet

2 years later by 1962 Air India took its fame global by bagging the title of being the first carrier in the world to run an all-et fleet!

Not did Air India redefined the aviation sector but also took a gigantic step for the nation’s economy and “wanderlust”.

In January 2021 too Air India set a world record for longest all-women cockpit crew flight. It’s longest direct route flight AI-176 landed at the Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru from San Francisco. The flight which covered a distance of about 16000 kilometres flew over the North Pole and had an all-woman cockpit crew.

Meanwhile 69 years after being nationalised Air India returned to its founder Tata Group which won the bid to acquire the airline in October 2021. Air India was officially handed over to the Tata Group on January 27.",,,

That’s what Project Caterpillar makes possible. Marc Durand of Atkins shares the story.



In many architectural firms the senior architects with decades on the job are uncomfortable with new technology while the junior architects can’t get enough of new technology but lack extensive professional experience. Marc Durand of Atkins explains how his team created an in-house app code name Caterpillar that converts simple hand sketches into full 3D models with rich data enabling you to do things like run massing studies after just a few minutes of drawing. “It’s what the old napkin sketch used to be where you could interact in real time” he says. It enables junior and senior architects to collaborate easily and makes the power of the latest digital design technologies accessible to professionals at all ends of the tech-comfort spectrum.

Charles Hughes To Vane Brothers,"Vane Brothers Baltimore a marine transportation provider on the U.S. East West and Gulf coasts took delivery earlier this year of the final boat in a series of four 3000 hp. Salisbury Class towboats. Named the mv. Charles Hughes Vane’s newest addition is the 20th Maryland-built towing vessel to join Vane Brothers’ fleet since 2008.

Designed and constructed by Chesapeake Shipbuilding the shipbuilders and naval architects best known lately for a series of five river cruise boats it has built for American Cruise Lines the Charles Hughes measures 94 by 34 by 10.5 feet with a draft of 8.5 feet.

The 3000 hp. boat is equipped with Caterpillar 3512 main engines conventional shafts rudders and flanking rudders. The Cats each produce 1500 hp. at 1800 rpm. and are connected to stainless steel Hung Shen troost-style five-bladed propellers through Twin Disc MGX-5600 gears with 6:1 ratio. The propulsion package gives the vessel a running speed of 10.5 knots.

The new pushboat will accommodate up to seven crew members and has large private and semiprivate quarters. A roomy pilothouse features both Simrad and Furuno electronics as well as dual Rose Point electronic charting systems. There’s tankage for 40000 gallons of fuel 15000 gallons of ballast water and 5000 gallons of water plus a 5000-gallon zero-discharge tank. Ancillary equipment includes 65-ton Patterson winches JonRie InterTech capstans and Fernstrum box coolers.

The boat features eight separate heating and air-conditioning systems that operate independently throughout the vessel. This enhances crew comfort in addition to augmenting fire-containment capability in case of emergency.

The Charles Hughes’ three sister vessels Salisbury Annapolis and Rock Hall were delivered in 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively. Designed to provide exceptional crew comfort reliability and operational efficiency all four Salisbury Class pushboats comply with federally mandated U.S. Coast Guard-enforced Subchapter M safety standards and are especially well-suited for operations along the inland waterways.

“Vane Brothers takes pride in providing our customers and crews with vessels constructed to the highest standards” Vane Brothers President C. Duff Hughes said in a statement announcing the delivery. “The Charles Hughes is another powerful peak-performing vessel that maximizes maneuverability where it is needed most.”

To create the Salisbury Class design Chesapeake naval architect John Womack worked in collaboration with Vane Brothers port captain Jim Demske who has overseen construction of 48 boats for Vane over the last two decades.

“Chesapeake has such a talented group of shipbuilders right in our back yard” Demske said. “Each tug capitalizes on safety comfort and productivity.” Along with the four towboats Chesapeake Shipbuilding has supplied sixteen 3000 hp. model-bow tugs.

The mv. Charles Hughes is named in honor of the late Charles F. Hughes former Vane Brothers chairman of the board and the father of Vane’s current president C. Duff Hughes. Hughes was a U.S. Navy veteran Johns Hopkins University graduate and Vane Brothers executive from 1951 to 2004.

A previous boat Charles Hughes built in 1975 and rated at 1800-hp. was acquired by Vane Brothers in 1991 and sold in 2019. The classic-looking name boards from the first Charles Hughes were refinished and are now proudly mounted on the new Charles Hughes.

Things started out great for this 150-foot (46 meters) pleasure craft. Built by one of the most prestigious shipyards in the world as a custom boat for a passionate and experienced owner who happened to be the former racecar driver and New Zealand businessman Neville Crichton this yacht seemed to have a bright future ahead. Originally named Como the Feadship yacht began its journey in 2014.Como was an instant success turning heads with its silver hull sharp silhouette and innovative architecture. It went on to win multiple awards in 2014 and 2015 including the ShowBoat Design Award for “Best Semi-Displacement Motor Yacht of 38m and above” the Finest Interior Award for the “Best Private Yacht Below 50 m” and the Baccarat SuperYacht World Trophy.With an exterior design by Dubois Naval Architects and interiors by the acclaimed Redman Whiteley Dixon (RWD) Como was innovative at the time mainly due to the extensive use of glass in the superstructure including very large windows that offered stunning uninterrupted views.Plus it was designed with a raised pilothouse that not only improved visibility but also allowed more space for what the builder calls a “gigantic” deck. This area was surrounded and covered by glass panels that could be lowered or raised depending on the weather and the mood. The result was a fantastic party space. “It is without doubt the best way to attend the Monaco Grand Prix” Crichton told Boat International  adding that 50 guests could easily enjoy the party on the deck.The interior was no less spectacular. In addition to the typical luxurious amenities the yacht included a unique salon with a circular seating area placed on a compressed air cushion so that it can rotate 360 degrees to face any part of the salon. White marble stainless steel and Macassar ebony were used throughout to create a sophisticated modern look.The boat’s performance was also up to par. Powered by twin 1900Caterpillar engines it boasts a top speed of 19 knots (21.8 mph/35 kph) and a range of 3000 nautical miles (3452 miles/5556 km). Designed to accommodate up to ten guests in five cabins the beautiful vessel unveiled a luminous master suite with great views thanks to the generous windows.But sadly Crichton was so passionate about floating luxury toys that he sold Como just as he had done with his previous eight yachts after just a couple of years. That’s when Guo Wengui came into the picture having reportedly bought the vessel for $38 million. By the time he made headlines in numerous scandals the vessel was known as Lady May.Everybody learned about the Lady May and its eccentric owner in 2020 when Steve Bannon Trump’s campaign manager and chief White House strategist was literally arrested for federal charges while onboard Wengui’s yacht. Unlike the original owner who used his experience with boats to create something new and exciting the Chinese fugitive billionaire only turned Lady May into an infamous luxury toy.At the beginning of this year the superyacht came under the spotlight again and not in a positive way. A $30 million loan that Wengui had taken back in 2008 and never repaid turned into a massive lawsuit against him. He then apparently tried to move the Lady May from the U.S. so that creditors wouldn’t get their hands on it.As a result last month a New York state judge ordered him to pay $134 million for moving and keeping the yacht outside the court’s jurisdiction. Bloomberg reported that Wengui was fined $500000 per day for each day he kept the Lady May hidden.As for the beautiful superyacht its fate hangs in the balance. Most likely it will be sold to a new owner one who will hopefully restore its initial reputation. Born out of passion and exquisite craftsmanship Lady May was never meant to be associated with political and financial disgrace."

CBRE now forecasts RevPAR will reach 2019 nominal levels by the third quarter of this year one year earlier than the previous forecast.

Occupancy is expected to rise 6.7 percent to 61.3 percent this year then rise 5.2 percent to 64.4 percent in 2023. ADR is forecast to rise 10.1 percent to $133.94 in 2022 and go up 6 percent more to $141.99 in 2023. CBRE expects RevPAR to rise 17.5 percent in 2022 overall to $82.04 and then rise 11.5 percent to $91.46 in 2023.

Positive trends such as high employment and the return to the office for many workers who had been working from home contributed to the revised forecast CBRE said. Other factors contributing to the improvement include below-average supply growth strong domestic leisure trends the resumption of inbound international travel and a predicted return to office later this year. However ongoing inflation and geopolitical tensions connected to the war in Ukraine still threaten progress.

In December RevPAR exceeded 2019’s levels for the first time since the pandemic began then dropped back to 21.7 percent below 2019 by January. A shift from the leisure-centric holiday season to the business-driven first quarter likely caused the drop along with heightened geopolitical and inflation risks.

ADR reached 2019 nominal levels in last year’s third quarter according to CBRE’s December 2021 edition of its Hotel Horizons report. CBRE expects ADR to again exceed 2019 levels this quarter following a pause. A recovery in higher-rated inbound international travel the resumption of more traditional business travel labor market tightness and higher overall inflation will lead to higher rates.

The U.S. consumer price index was 6.7 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2021 and hit 7.9 percent in February 2022 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. CBRE forecasts that CPI will reach slightly more than 6 percent in 2022 before dropping to around 2 percent in 2023 and after.

“Higher room rates will lead to a quicker return to 2019’s nominal ADR levels” said Rachael Rothman CBRE’s head of hotel research and data analytics. “But from a profitability perspective inflation will be a headwind through higher utilities supplies and labor.”

The effects of inflation on ADR won’t be uniform said Bram Gallagher CBRE senior hotel economist.

“Historically most hotels can respond to inflation with price increases but only luxury hotels have demonstrated that they can exceed the pace of inflation to achieve real gains” he said. “Economy hotels have the most difficulty raising prices enough to keep up.”

Domestic and drive-to resorts are expected to once again be top destinations in 2022 because the war in Ukraine and a resurgence of COVID in Asia could persuade wealthier U.S. travelers to lean toward domestic destinations closer to home. However elevated gas prices could hurt interstate hotels as fewer budget-minded consumers cut travel.

“Longer-term muted supply growth will mitigate the blow for the hotel industry. High construction-material prices including lumber steel and labor make the development of most new projects cost prohibitive limiting the delivery of new rooms over the medium to longer term” said CBRE. “CBRE forecasts that supply will increase at a 1.2 percent compound annual growth rate over the next five years well below the industry’s 1.8 percent long-term historical average.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvc2VydmljZXMvcHJvcGVydHktLy1jc3RydWN0aW9uLzMxLW9mLXRvdGFsLW9mZmljZS1zcGFjZXMtaW4tdG9wLTYtY2l0aWVzLWNlcnRpZmllZC1hcy1ncmVlbi1idWlsZGluZ3MtcmVwb3J0L2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkwMzM0NjMyLmNtc9IBrgFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvc2VydmljZXMvcHJvcGVydHktLy1jc3RydWN0aW9uLzMxLW9mLXRvdGFsLW9mZmljZS1zcGFjZXMtaW4tdG9wLTYtY2l0aWVzLWNlcnRpZmllZC1hcy1ncmVlbi1idWlsZGluZ3MtcmVwb3J0L2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85MDMzNDYzMi5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,31% of total office spaces in top 6 cities certified as green buildings: Report,"

In its report 'Indian Real Estate's ESG (environmental social and governance) Landscape and its Progress to a Sustainable Future ' property consultant CBRE has analysed office stock for the top six cities (Delhi-NCR Mumbai Pune Hyderabad Bangalore and Chennai) to ascertain the status of green-certified stock in these cities.""Certified green office stock grew by 177 per cent to 212 million square feet in Q3 2021 (July-September) from under 80 million square feet in 2011"" the report said.Over the past decade the consultant said green real estate assets have grown tremendously and their share in the total office stock has increased from 24 per cent in 2011 to 31 per cent in 2021.""Certified stock (of office space) has also increased substantially growing at a CAGR of 10.7 per cent compared to 7.7 per cent for the overall stock since 2011"" the report said.In the past five years CBRE said there has been a 37 per cent increase in the supply of certified buildings as compared to the previous five years (2012-2016).""This indicates that the Indian real estate sector is becoming more aware of its responsibility towards ESG principles and moving rapidly towards imbibing sustainability in its assets"" the report said.Delhi-NCR and Bengaluru together account for about 54 per cent of the total certified office stock of India.""ESG is integral to CBRE's business strategy from the way we operate as a business to serving our clients and in helping them meet their own targets"" said Anshuman Magazine Chairman & CEO - India South-East Asia Middle East & Africa CBRE.All major real estate companies that are into office segment -- such as DLF Prestige Embassy group Godrej Properties Macrotech Developers (Lodha) RMZ Salarpuria Sattva Kalpataru Hiranandani group K Raheja Group Hines India and Max Estates -- are focusing a lot on environmental aspects and have received green certifications from LEED or Indian Green Building Council (IGBC).The three Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) launched so far in India -- Embassy Office Parks Mindspace and Brookfield India Real Estate Trust -- are also giving a lot of emphasis on sustainability aspects.Max Estates COO Rishi Raj said: ""This COVID-led disruption has lent us a lifetime opportunity to transform where we work and how we work"".""Offices have now moved beyond the conventional idea of a standard brick and mortar building to a new modern and sustainable ecosystem that cares for you and your holistic well-being.""Raj noted that companies have now enhanced focus on ESG which has translated to their operations and choice of partners and workspaces.Max Estates lays great emphasis on sustainable design energy-efficient operations and employee wellness via our unique work-well philosophy he added.With ESG coming into major play the CBRE report said that green certification has also become an important metric for tenant decision making.To promote green buildings the report suggested that the Centre and states should incentivise developers and asset owners in the form of higher FSI lower statutory fees and lower incidental taxes.Apart from offices the concept of green buildings is now catching up in residential segments as well and many developers are constructing such projects.Kalpataru has recently announced plans to develop only green buildings and will provide EV (electric vehicle) ready parking in all its upcoming projects.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVob3RlbGNvbnZlcnNhdGlvbi5jb20uYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzAzLzE5L2RyYXN0aWMtOTktcmVkdWN0aW9uLWJhY2twYWNrZXItZW50cmFudHMtc3B1cnJlZC15b3V0aC1ob3N0ZWxzLXN0dWRlbnQtYWNjb21tb2RhdGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A drastic 99% reduction in backpacker entrants spurred youth hostels student accommodation and co-living to look at ...,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkZ2Vwcm9wLnNnL3Byb3BlcnR5LW5ld3Mvc2luZ2Fwb3JlLWhvdGVsLW1hcmtldC1zZWVpbmctbmFzY2VudC1yZWNvdmVyeS1ib3JkZXItcmVzdHJpY3Rpb25zLWVhc2UtY2JyZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Singapore hotel market seeing nascent recovery as border restrictions ease: CBRE,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.edgeprop.sg/property-news/singapore-hotel-market-seeing-nascent-recovery-border-restrictions-ease-cbre on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkZ2Vwcm9wLnNnL3Byb3BlcnR5LW5ld3Mvc2luZ2Fwb3JlLWhvdGVsLW1hcmtldC1zZWVpbmctbmFzY2VudC1yZWNvdmVyeS1ib3JkZXItcmVzdHJpY3Rpb25zLWVhc2UtY2JyZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3J0c21vdXRoLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvcGVvcGxlL3NwZWNpYWxpc3QtYmF0dGVyeS1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLWNvbXBhbnktbW92ZXMtZnJvbS13YXRlcmxvb3ZpbGxlLXRvLW5ldy1wcmVtaXNlcy1pbi1oYXZhbnQtMzYxODY5NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Specialist battery production company moves from Waterlooville to new premises in Havant,"The Vandapower team moving to Havant.

Dave Edwards UK operations manager said: ‘Our success and growth year on year meant that we had simply outgrown our existing premises. We were looking for quality new accommodation without moving our teams too far afield and Spring Business Park was the perfect choice.

‘We are delighted to be among the first occupants at this quality ideally-located site and are looking forward to continuing to grow our team while providing a first-class service to customers.’

The completion of Spring Business Park at the site of the former Buttericks factory in November last year released 12 new leasehold business units into the market.

It comes as Kingsbridge Estates continues to offer units to occupiers on a leasehold basis with Vail Williams and CBRE appointed as joint agents for the site.

Given the Federal Reserve's shift to tighter monetary policy the impact of rampant inflation on growth and now the deleterious impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine dusting off the recession playbook is in order.

What say you leading indicators?

The Conference Board's Leading Economic Index (LEI) is among the most reliable gauges of turning points in business cycles. Given the nature of its 10 subcomponents (more on that later) the broad index's moves generally signal when economic activity has reached a peak trough or slowdown.

Given the nature of this report it is perhaps apt to remind investors of our oft-expressed view that when it comes to the relationship between economic data and the stock market better or worse tends to matter more than good or bad. In other words the rate of change in the data is often where we can look for inflection points—that is what provides the ""tell"" as to whether we're entering a new phase of the cycle.

As such if we look at the LEI in year-over-year-change terms shown in the chart below you can see that the latest reading of 7.6% in February is strong relative to history though off the boil of 12.3% in April 2021. Base effects have helped up until this point—given the change in February 2021 was -0.9%— but comparisons will inevitably become more difficult moving forward. The economy is now also facing several headwinds from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and weakening trends among subcomponents.

The current change has yet to reach the average -1.4% reading in the month prior to past recessions. That is by no means a definitive threshold to guarantee the end of the cycle given the wide historical range but it tells us (for now) that there may still be a good portion of runway left.

Follow the leader

As mentioned trends are often more important than levels as possible inflection points. Thus peeling back the LEI onion one layer exposes flags (a couple of red otherwise mostly yellow) that are worth noting. Shown in the first portion of the table below are the 10 subcomponents of the LEI. While levels are generally healthy or fair (with the exception of average consumer expectations for business conditions) trends look less impressive.

Key to watch will be the emergence of additional worsening trends. Historically a consistent sea of red in the ""trend"" column has preceded weakness in the ""level"" column and eventually a deterioration in the Coincident Economic Index (CEI) which is shown in the bottom portion of the table.

Looking to the trend-setters

Source: Charles Schwab Bloomberg The Conference Board as of 3/18/2022. For illustrative purposes only.

What a recession is and isn't

The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)—the official arbiters of U.S. recessions—defines a recession as ""a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months."" The definition of a recession is not two quarters in a row of negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth; although many believe that is the ""traditional"" definition (it isn't).

Not coincidentally the four components of the CEI are what the NBER primarily monitors: ""The determination of the months of peaks and troughs is based on a range of monthly measures of aggregate real economic activity … [including] real personal income less transfers nonfarm payroll employment employment as measured by the household survey real personal consumption expenditures wholesale-retail sales adjusted for price changes and industrial production.""

The NBER's assessment is always made retroactively as the committee looks back to the peak in activity as end of the cycle and beginning of the recession. Thus while both the trend and level of the CEI look strong right now they don't tell us much about where we're headed.

It's tempting to find comfort in the fact that data look strong/good but the reality is that deterioration in trends often lurks in the background and can spread rather quickly. So far so good but investors should probably swap their ""level"" lenses for their ""trend"" lenses right now.

Consumers' confidence on shaky ground

The Conference Board also conducts the monthly Consumer Confidence survey which has a number of component parts. In addition to the ""headline"" reading of confidence broadly there are sub-questions about consumers' present situation confidence vs. their confidence about the future (the expectations component). Shown below the spread between the two—with expectations quite a bit worse than consumers' assessment of their present situation—has never been this low in history without a recession either pending in fairly short order or already underway.

Counter-cyclical inflation

It's no wonder consumers are feeling glum with hits having come from the pandemic and now exacerbated by inflation tighter financial conditions and the Russia/Ukraine war. We believe the current environment is better described as counter-cyclical (or cost-push) inflation—when high prices put downward pressure on demand/growth—than 1970s-era stagflation. That said it is worth keeping an eye on the Misery Index which was born in that era and simply adds the inflation rate to the unemployment rate.

Misery Index up but not high

Unemployment rate as lagging indicator

For now the unemployment rate is not the culprit in terms of the move up in the Misery Index but it is worth watching in the context of a possible recession. One of the most frequent questions we get when discussing recession risks is ""How could a recession be possible with the unemployment rate so low?""

Remember the unemployment rate is one of the most lagging of all economic indicators. As shown in the top chart below the unemployment rate has always been near its trough each cycle heading into recessions. A rising unemployment rate doesn't cause recessions recessions cause the unemployment rate to rise. In turn as shown recessions have always ended with the unemployment rate near its peak—and in many cases it was still rising after recessions had ended.

Unemployment rate lags recessions

Below is a table highlighting the relationship between recessions and the unemployment rate. There has historically only been an average 0.3% increase in the unemployment rate by the first month of recessions. In fact there have even been instances where a recession was declared as having begun yet the unemployment rate was still at its trough like in 1981. In sum don't take economic turning point cues from highly lagging indicators.

Slow yield curve inversion underway?

As mentioned at the start of this report the Fed's shift to start normalizing monetary policy—and the attendant tightening of financial conditions—is generally a good reason to dust off the recession playbook. Yield curve inversions have historically been a reliable precursor to recessions. The spread between 10-year and 3-month Treasury yields remains fairly steep; however the spread between 10-year and 2-year yields shown below is only about 20 basis points from being inverted. Inversions in that spread often pre-date inversions in the 10-year 3-month curve.

Flattening yield curve

Source: Charles Schwab Bloomberg as of 3/18/2022. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

According to Capital Economics' Recession Probability Models the 10y-3m spread implies a 5% probability while the 10y-2y spread implies a 20% probability. Regardless of which spread you look at there are two important caveats with regard to recession risk:

The very brief inversion in 1998 was not followed by a recession (in part because the Fed began cutting rates in the aftermath of the Asian currency/Russian debt default/failure of LTCM hedge fund crises)

The lead time of 10y-2y yield curve inversions relative to recessions is quite variable. There have been six official recessions since 1978 and the average span between inversion and recession was 12 months with a range of six to 22 months.

Yield curve inversions are often viewed as a cause of recessions when in fact they are better thought of as a symptom of the conditions that tend to lead into recessions. On the other hand spikes in oil prices have historically been a cause of recessions. The chart below shows the real (inflation-adjusted) Bloomberg crude oil price percentage change from its 24-month moving average. As you can see (denoted by the yellow dotted line) only once (in August 2005) since the early 1970s did the change move above 50% without a recession on its way or already underway.

Oil's slippery slope

Recessions often hold key to length/magnitude of bear markets

The S&P 500 has so far avoided a bear market using the traditional -20% from a peak (the same can't be said for either the NASDAQ or Russell 2000). Looking ahead if a recession becomes increasingly likely (not a layup call) it would likely mean more equity market pain is in store.

Using Ned Davis Research's data for the Dow Jones Industrial Average which has history back to 1900 shown below is the difference in the severity and length of bear markets depending on whether a recession occurred or not. You can see the percentage loss and length in market days for every bear market with or without a recession (the red and green dots respectively); and the mean loss/length (red and green squares). In comparison to all bear markets (black square) bears without recessions were shorter (213 days) and less severe (-25.4%) relative to bears with recessions which were longer (353 days) and more severe (-34.6%).

Past performance is no guarantee of future results.



Using a more ""modern"" era of the past 50 years the spread between recession and non-recession bear markets is wider. Recession bear markets had an average decline of 32.8% and an average length of 17.4 months while non-recession bear markets had an average decline of only 18% with an average duration of only 6.8 months.

Will Fed hike until ""something breaks?""

Since the 1970s there have been three primary reasons why tightening cycles have been followed by recessions:

Exogenous shock hits (like in 2020 alongside the onset of the pandemic).

Easy monetary policy leading to economic overheating and/or bubbles inflating (like in 2007-2008 and 2000-2001).

Inflation ""allowed"" to spiral with aggressive tightening of monetary policy necessarily following (like in the late-1970s/early-1980s).

Economic data has been generally weakening recently which is likely to persist increasing recession probabilities. A recession is not yet the base case but it is time to put it back on our radar screens. In pre-recession periods higher-quality higher-free cash flow and lower-volatility factors tend to outperform (as has been the case since the Fed announced balance sheet tapering last November). The recent rally had a lower-quality higher-volatility flavor to it. It's too soon to make a judgement that this market message is indicative of lower recession risk or just bottom-fishing among some of the harder-hit areas of the market during the correction.

A notable risk in this cycle is associated with the Fed's need to move further off the zero bound on rates and start shrinking its balance sheet amid elevated inflation pressures. The Fed's eye is now clearly on inflation and no longer on supporting the economy as it emerged from the worst part of the pandemic. In fact the Fed is actively pursuing tighter financial conditions and a slowing in aggregate economic demand. Last week's easing in financial conditions alongside the stock market rally and weaker dollar is unlikely to have legs longer-term.

This is a unique period in that the Fed has embarked on a rate hiking cycle with inflation this high and growth expectations as low as they are presently (Atlanta Fed's GDPNow forecast is only 1.3% for first quarter real growth). It's always difficult for the Fed to land the economic ""plane"" softly; perhaps even more difficult in today's unique inflation environment and with the added kicker of the Russia/Ukraine war.

In sum

The U.S. economy exited the lockdown phase of the pandemic with an incredibly sharp acceleration which persisted until late last year. The health of the labor (and housing) market offers some tailwinds against the headwinds of inflation and Fed policy but bouts of equity market volatility (and weakness) are likely to persist.

The recent stock market rally has had a better breadth tone to it and sentiment remains dour (a contrarian indicator). However given the unique uncertainties of the day this is not an environment to take on excess risk. Instead stick close to strategic asset allocations and benchmark sector allocations—using the disciplines of diversification and periodic rebalancing to navigate heightened volatility.

Get their bets in for horse racing’s Cheltenham Gold Cup by 3.30pm sort out their Fantasy Premier League team by 6.30pm send their bids for Chelsea by 9pm.

The first and last items on that list have lots in common: big field lots of hurdles massive prize. You have got to love the sports calendar — it never lets you down when you need a metaphor.

So who is in the race to replace Roman Abramovich? Who should Chelsea fans be rooting for? Where should casual observers be putting their each/way punts?

These are not easy questions to answer as this is a contest that seems to have more in common with the gloriously unpredictable race of attrition that is the Grand National — Britain’s other big steeplechase — than the more refined connoisseur’s affair that is the Gold Cup.

But there is no fun in sitting on the fence — no racing pun intended — so let us crack on with our rundown of the runners and riders in the Trivago (they still sponsor Chelsea right?) Stamford Bridge Stakes.

Early fallers and rank outsiders

We will start with names you should ignore or if you get them in a sweepstake rip up.

Turkish businessman Muhsin Bayrak was one of the first to link himself with a bid for Chelsea telling local media “the world believes we have a 90 per cent chance of completing the deal — Abramovich thinks the same”. This led some to wonder if Bayrak was simply going to keep the Premier League club warm for Abramovich while the sanctioned Russian waited for the war in Ukraine to finish and resumption of normal service in Londongrad.

That however was pure speculation. Unfortunately so is Bayrak’s bid. There is simply no way an unknown entity from Istanbul with investments in crypto is going to get this done.

Another to avoid is Aethel Partners who optimistically threw their hat into the ring on Thursday. The London-based investment firm is fronted by Portuguese entrepreneur Ricardo Silva and their main investment appears to be a loss-making iron ore mine in Portugal. In other words a large hole in the ground — there might be another metaphor in that.

Speaking of holes in the ground Ghanaian businessman and politician Bernard Antwi Boasiako is another Chelsea suitor whose wealth is built on mining. Boasiako claims to earn $1 million a day from his gold mining company Hansol and he has written to Chelsea to say he is willing to offer $3.1 billion (just under £2.4 billion) for the club.

Boasiako is a well-connected and high-profile figure in Ghana but it’s unlikely here’s even nearly rich enough to buy the European and World champions on his own. Could he front an African-based consortium? Maybe. Would that be good for the Premier League and Chelsea’s huge following in Africa? Yes. Will it happen? No not Chelsea and certainly not under these circumstances.

This sales process is unlike any other that British football has seen. On the one hand it is a straightforward auction run by a merchant bank on behalf of a wealthy man. Nothing unusual about that. But on the other hand it is also the forced sale of a frozen asset that must take place by the end of May or Chelsea will start to dramatically lose value and perhaps even go bankrupt.

It is further complicated by the fact Abramovich is sanctioned in Canada the European Union and the UK and can therefore receive none of the proceeds from the sale just in case they end up in Russian president Vladimir Putin’s hands and are used to fund his war against Ukraine. Abramovich denies there is any such link between him and Putin.

This means there are effectively two sellers — the Raine Group the New York-based bank running the process for Abramovich and the British government — and both want a combination of price speed and certainty. No fuss — just cold hard cash and a track record of competence.

That criteria probably rules out two bids fronted by well-known Chelsea fans too.

The first of those is the True Blue consortium which is fronted by John “captain leader legend” Terry and is trying to raise £250 million so it can buy a 10 per cent stake in the club. The plan is to do this by getting supporters players and staff to buy crypto-based fans tokens. This is pretty much the same idea that Terry has been plugging to fund his retirement and it has not gone well.

The second is Nick Candy’s… group? Supergroup? Funding proposal? We are not quite sure. But to mix our metaphors the British property developer did manage to find a backer deep in injury time on Friday when he teamed up with South Korea’s Catalina Kim and Hana Financial Group.

The 38-year-old Kim wrote a book last year about her experience as the only Asian woman working as a football agent in Europe and her LinkedIn page suggests it was a hit back home. Buying Chelsea would certainly provide a lot of new material for a second volume.

Kim announced her involvement in a bid just as Rachael Blackmore was becoming the first female jockey to win the Gold Cup. Blackmore however has already won loads of other races including the Grand National and was sat on the favourite A Plus Tard.

Candy Kim and Hana sound like a nice combination but they look like the longest of shots for this contest.

Value bets

OK these are the scraps of paper from the sweepstake that you want want to hold onto and we are going to run through them in reverse order of probability but with the caveats that all these guys have a chance betting is mugs’ game and what do we know really?

Woody Johnson the great grandson of the founder of the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical empire is understood to have been looking for a Premier League club for a while. He bought the NFL’s New York Jets in 2000 paying $635 million for the privilege. That was the third-highest fee ever paid for a sports franchise at the time and equates to about $1 billion (£760 million) today if we adjust for inflation.

That is not going to be enough to bag Chelsea though. The amount of interest in this trophy asset is likely to send the price over $3 billion (£2.27 billion) which is a remarkable number for a club that lost more than £145 million last season. In fact Abramovich has poured more than £1.5 billion of his fortune into Chelsea since 2003 and he says he does not want it back. That will certainly help sell the club but it does also indicate the level of subsidy Chelsea require if they are going to continue winning trophies.

US business magazine Forbes estimates Johnson’s personal wealth to be £4.5 billion but he is old money compared to Abramovich so he is not going to throw it around — and his track record at the Jets suggests this is not a man consumed by a passion for winning. He also turns 75 next month. He is in good shape but is he young enough to embark on a project that almost certainly involves building a new stadium? He did that for the Jets but it took him 10 years.

Some sources have suggested he has an inside track because of his stint as America’s ambassador to the UK under Donald Trump. Others believe that could be an obstacle.

Oaktree Capital is another stellar name in American business circles that is understood to have kicked Chelsea’s tyres.

Co-founded by Howard Marks one of the most respected investors on the planet and listed on the New York Stock Exchange Oaktree has a huge amount of money at its disposal and has already dipped its toe into football’s waters by lending Inter Milan cash.

Some (yes we are citing them again) think Oaktree is exactly the type of bidder Raine and the government are praying for; others see Marks tweet his investment philosophy — “It’s not what you buy it’s what you pay” — and think there is no way he is going to be dragged into a sealed-bids auction for a loss-making club that needs to build a billion-pound-plus stadium.

Oaktree’s involvement in Serie A is probably a complication too far as well. Inter fans may want to look away now but the football finance rumour mill thinks Oaktree could end up owning the Italian champions when the club defaults on its repayments. UEFA does not let two clubs controlled by the same entity play in its competitions.

Other potential Chelsea owners with conflicts of interest issues are David Blitzer and Josh Harris. Sorry we should probably have warned Crystal Palace fans that was coming as they have been co-owners at Chelsea’s London rivals since 2015. Buying Chelsea would clearly mean selling their Palace shares although they have already sold a chunk of them last year when fellow American John Textor joined the ownership group at Selhurst Park.

Blitzer and Harris made their fortunes working for huge American private equity firms. Blitzer is still a senior executive with Blackstone Group while Harris has now left Apollo Asset Management but he was one of its co-founders. The pair first teamed up to buy basketball’s Philadelphia 76ers in 2011 then added ice hockey’s New Jersey Devils in 2013 before repeating the trick at Palace two years later.

At 57 Harris is five years older than Blitzer and he is probably twice as rich too with a personal fortune of more than £5 billion. But Blitzer owns more sports teams as he now has also stakes in football teams in Germany Netherlands Spain and the US. Blitzer believes there is value in football.

Harris on the other hand has given the impression he is not so sure about that. In fact several sources have told The Athletic that if Harris is going to buy another football team it would be of the American football variety with the Denver Broncos up for sale at a similar price to Chelsea.

But it seems he has not quite given up on the Premier League just yet as he and Blitzer have teamed up with Sir Martin Broughton to form an Anglo-American consortium.

Broughton who also turns 75 next month is British business aristocracy. A former chairman of British American Tobacco British Airways and the British Horseracing Board he has also been the president of the Confederation of British Industry.

A lifelong Chelsea fan he was actually brought in by Liverpool’s creditors to sell the club in 2010 when the Premier League side was on the verge of bankruptcy. That was at the tail end of the Tom Hicks and George Gillett era at Anfield a calamitous period in the club’s history but Broughton helped ease them out and bring Fenway Sports Group (FSG) in.

So Broughton provides contacts credibility and experience. And if that is not enough he has teamed up with fellow Chelsea fan and British sporting aristocrat Lord Coe. The two-time Olympic gold medallist was also a Conservative MP which could be helpful and also worked closely with Prime Minister Boris Johnson when Johnson was Mayor of London. The former athlete also chaired the organising committee of the London Olympics.

This group definitely has a chance then but they might not be able to move as quickly and decisively as others.

The favourites

That leaves us with two heavily fancied groups who will also have sent Raine Group a bid proof of funds and a business plan by Friday’s deadline.

In a statement released on Wednesday the Ricketts family owners of the Chicago Cubs confirmed what many agents and bankers had been whispering about for weeks: they want Chelsea.

“As long-time operators of an iconic professional sports team the Ricketts family and their partners understand the importance of investing for success on the pitch while respecting the traditions of the club the fans and the community” the statement adds.

The family owe their wealth to the brokerage business Joe Ricketts founded in 1971 Ameritrade. It was bought and renamed TD Ameritrade in 2006 and was bought again in 2020 by the Charles Schwab Corporation. It has grown into a substantial business.

Joe Ricketts now 80 has subsequently invested in bison meat the film business and most famously baseball. Unfortunately he is probably best known right now for some very unpleasant remarks he made in a series of emails from 2012 that came to light in 2019.

In those emails he allegedly referred to Muslims as “his enemy” because of their “deep antagonism and bias against non-Muslims” described Islam as “a cult and not a religion” and shared offensive conspiracy theories about former US President Barack Obama.

Joe Ricketts and his four children who own the Cubs via a family trust have been apologising for those remarks ever since and have worked hard to rebuild links with Chicago’s Muslim community. It would probably be fair to say that the court of public opinion in the US has cleared the children of their father’s sins with the only debate about their ownership of the Cubs being about whether they invest enough in the team or not.

News of their interest in Chelsea however has reignited the controversy surrounding Joe Ricketts’ views not least because Chelsea have several Muslim players and lots of Muslim fans. Overcoming this might be the biggest challenge Tom Ricketts the 58-year-old chairman of the Cubs faces if he is going to finally land a football team.

He has wanted to add one to the family portfolio for years and is known to have looked at Chelsea in the past as well as AC Milan and Tottenham. The fact the Ricketts have weighed up a move for Chelsea before and done some due diligence is an advantage in a process where time is of the essence.

On their likely approach to running the club Tom Ricketts is understood to be a fan of what the FSG syndicate has done at the Boston Red Sox and Liverpool: investing in infrastructure to grow revenues while keeping a lid on spending and using data to make better decisions.

Under their ownership the Cubs bought swathes of land around the team’s Wrigley Field stadium and turned the area into an entertainment village. Can you see what they have in mind for Fulham Broadway?

Of course that will cost them but that is where the financial muscle of their associate Ken Griffin comes in. He runs the Chicago-based hedge fund Citadel and it has made him one of America’s richest men with a fortune of more than £20 billion.

Griffin is a guy who is used to getting what he wants. He owns property all over the world including a £100-million house near Buckingham Palace and last year paid nearly £33 million for a copy of the US Constitution outbidding a group of crypto enthusiasts in an auction at Sotheby’s.

Like Oaktree’s Marks Griffin has a reputation as a “value investor” so he is not going to be bullied or cajoled into overpaying for Chelsea but he is also known to be ambitious bold and driven. If he thinks there is value in owning the five-time Premier League champions he is not going to flinch at having to dig a bit deeper.

One US source sees him as the difference-maker.

“With Griffin the Chicago group have the most liquidity of any buyer… they will be able to go over £3 billion if they need to” he explains.

One question every Chelsea fan will have for this group though is do they want to win? The Ricketts will say yes of course and point to the Cubs’ 2016 World Series title and the team’s relatively high payroll.

But 2016 sticks out as there have only been four other trips to the play-offs which leads us to the last of the known entities: Team Boehly

Todd Boehly has packed a lot into his 48 years. Having studied finance in the US and UK he started his investment career at Citibank and Credit Suisse First Boston before moving to venture capital firm JH Whitney & Co.

From there he moved to Guggenheim Partners the firm first set up to invest the Guggenheim mining dynasty’s wealth where Boehly’s reputation for spotting trends and backing winners grew. He saw that energy giant Enron was about to go bust in 2001 and managed to safely navigate his clients through the financial crash of 2009.

In 2012 he and his boss at Guggenheim Mark Walter led a group that bought the Los Angeles Dodgers. At $2.15 billion it was the biggest cheque anyone had ever written for a sports team and it followed a highly competitive three-way auction after Major League Baseball had effectively repossessed the team from previous owner Frank McCourt.

The lesson here? Boehly has done this before.

The Guggenheim Baseball Management group included former Los Angeles Lakers great Earvin “Magic” Johnson tennis legend Billie Jean King and leading names from the worlds of baseball entertainment and finance. Once in charge they began developing land around the stadium and improving the ballpark as well as starting their own regional sports network.

They also started winning. In fact they won their division every year from 2013 to 2020 won the National League in 2017 2018 and 2020 and went on to win the World Series in 2020 too. Last season was not quite so successful but they maintained their streak of reaching the play-offs.

In an interview with Yahoo Finance last year Boehly said: “We‘ve got a really good group of owners who understood that we have a great market and that this market wants to win.

“And having Earvin Johnson as our partner he just pounded in on us all along that we have to win. If we’re in LA you have to win right?”

London is a bit like that too.

Boehly left Guggenheim in 2015 and set up Eldridge Industries a private holding company that owns stakes in 80 different businesses including a London-based real estate company fantasy sports firm DraftKings and stakes in the Lakers and women’s basketball team the LA Sparks.

Primarily Boehly sees sports teams as media rights businesses and he thinks it is only a matter of time before big-time professional sport moves to a direct relationship with fans at home not via a third-party media company. And that relationship will be richer in every sense.

Speaking to the Capital Allocators podcast in November Boehly outlined an experience where viewers at home can either “loyalty gamble” on the next piece of action earning discounts for their next visit to the stadium or online shop or actually gamble using the latest data to inform those bets. You will not be surprised to learn that among Eldridge’s investments are companies that can do all this pretty much now.

“Last year we made over a billion dollars” he told the podcast host Ted Seides. “Every year now we’re making so much money that we’ve got to keep reinvesting. We’ve got the ability to pivot into areas where we think there’s more growth.”

Just as he did with the Dodgers Boehly is not bidding for Chelsea on his own. Swiss-born California-based billionaire Hansjorg Wyss is providing some of the money and it was the 86-year-old who first revealed Team Boehly’s interest in an interview with Swiss paper Blick more than two weeks ago.

British lawyer Jonathan Goldstein a long-time business partner of Boehly’s is also on board as is American investment firm Clearlake.

And like Harris and Blitzer Boehly has started to build a fan- and government-friendly board with Times columnist and Conservative peer Danny Finkelstein and music industry veteran Barbara Charone lined up to be non-executive directors. They are both authentic fans and savvy conduits to people new owners of Chelsea might need to know.

Like Ricketts a redeveloped stadium is at the centre of their plan. And again Boehly and co have an advantage as they also tried to buy Chelsea before and did extensive research on the options at Stamford Bridge.

Redeveloping Stamford Bridge is central to Boehly’s vision for Chelsea (Photo: Getty)

It is understood they favour a slightly cheaper solution than Abramovich’s grand plan which involved digging down into the site to create more room. The problem with that is once you start digging in London you never know what you are going to find: Roman temples plague pits London Underground lines. The Abramovich vision would probably cost close to £2 billion now whereas a more modest upgrade could be done for £1 billion.

Apart from that it is standard American fare: data sensible investment a desire to win but not to blow the budget.

There has been some comment about the fact that Goldstein is a Spurs fan — in fact Goldstein has tried to get Tottenham’s owners into serious talks with Boehly for years — but as Finkelstein wrote on Thursday: “At Chelsea we sing songs for talented people who see the light and come to the Bridge.”

Are we missing anyone?

Well you do not need to spend long on social media to see who most Chelsea fans — the ones on Twitter anyway — are cheering for: the Saudi Arabia flags in their profiles rather gives it away.

If this was a vote rather than an expedited auction with added government scrutiny the Saudi Media Group (SMG) would have won this last week when the first reports of a £2.7 billion bid emerged. The rationale apparently is that Saudi owners do not care about returns on investment — they just want to sign Kylian Mbappe and Erling Haaland.

According to reports the bid will be led by SMG’s chief executive Mohamed Alkhereiji who studied in London and then spent three years working in the capital with Deutsche Bank. But his media business has an annual turnover of about £770 million which is not that much bigger than Chelsea’s so he could not be acting alone.

It has been suggested to The Athletic that the Saudi government has encouraged SMG to bid because it would help demonstrate that there are plenty of wealthy Saudis in the kingdom who are not linked to the state which is what they have been trying to tell us about the sovereign wealth fund’s investment in Newcastle United.

There is a problem with that idea though. It took the Saudis a year to prove to the Premier League that Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman would not be picking the team at St James’ Park. Chelsea have a couple of months at best to get this done and dusted. And if SMG really was being nudged into doing this well that is only going to make separation even harder to prove this time.

In fact it is not even certain that SMG has made a bid. Contrary to reports it had not made one prior to Friday and attempts to find wealthy backers in Saudi were proving difficult.

Are there other mega-bids out there? Sure former Chelsea player Tal Ben Haim is reported to have found a Gulf-based billionaire willing to put up £2 billion for a shot at the prize.

And The Athletic has heard a rumour about a potential bid from a man with access to one of the greatest personal fortunes on the planet — and no we are not talking about Vladimir Putin.

But perhaps we should. Because while this piece has tried not to be overly serious this is a serious process caused by a horrendous event in Ukraine.

The next week is going to feel a bit like transfer deadline day at times as Raine tries to pick a winner that best meets the criteria of this most unusual auction. The dozen or so bids made on Friday will soon be whittled down to three or four. Big promises will be bandied about but Chelsea fans will most likely have to get their heads around the fact that their club is going to be run in a very different way to the last 19 years.

That does not mean you will never win a trophy again but even if it did it is not as bad as an invasion. And if all goes to plan your club can carry on almost as before under new ambitious and rich owners who urgently want to build you a new stadium.

Members of United Steelworkers Local 5 voted down the company’s most recent contract offer and gave notice of intent to go on strike the union said in a statement Sunday.

The statement says Chevron refused to return to the bargaining table.

Chevron said in a statement Sunday night that it has negotiated with the union for months and believes the contract offered was fair and addressed union concerns.

If the strike shuts down the Richmond California refinery it could crimp gasoline supplies in the state which has the highest regular gas price in the nation at $5.847 per gallon according to AAA.

The union said in its statement that it reached a pattern agreement with the oil industry Feb. 25 on wages and working conditions. But about 200 bargaining units also have to agree on local issues before contracts can be approved.

The old contract with Chevron in Richmond expired Feb. 1 and workers have been reporting to their jobs on a rolling 24-hour extension the union said.

The company says that operations at the refinery will continue and it does not anticipate any supply chain issues.

The San Ramon California-based Chevron says on its website that the refinery produces gasoline diesel and jet fuel as well as lubricating oils.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt0dnUuY29tL25ld3MvY2hldnJvbi1yZWZpbmVyeS13b3JrZXJzLXRvLWdvLW9uLXN0cmlrZdIBRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt0dnUuY29tL25ld3MvY2hldnJvbi1yZWZpbmVyeS13b3JrZXJzLXRvLWdvLW9uLXN0cmlrZS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chevron refinery workers to go on strike,"article

Workers at the Chevron oil refinery are going on strike in Richmond tomorrow.

The unionized workers have been negotiating a new contract with the oil company since the end of January but those negotiations have broken down.

It’s a problem that has the potential to impact prices at the pump.

United Steelworker Union Local 5 says a proposed agreement was overwhelmingly voted down Saturday.

After that the union says Chevron did not want to continue meeting so workers decided to make plans to walk off the job.

Roughly 600 workers with UWS Local 5 will go on strike at the Richmond refinery Monday including machinists pipefitters plant process operators and more.

Though safety improvements and medical insurance contributions are issues the main sticking point is money.

Chevron has offered increases that run from 2.5% to 3.5% over four years.

""We countered with just a minimal bump and we were told by the corporation that there was no movement no money"" said BK White a worker with USW Local 5 involved in negotiations.

Chevron says it’s offered essentially the same deal in what’s called a ""National Pattern Agreement"" to nine other unions and six have ratified the agreements.

""The union’s demands exceeded what the company believes to be reasonable and moved beyond what was agreed to as part of the national pattern bargaining agreement"" Chevron said.

""We feel when a company can report 15 billion profit and the highest profit since 2014 they can give the people whose backs they’re making these earnings off of give them a little boost to help them out"" said White.

Chevron says it’s bringing in workers that have been training for a year to replace those on strike but won’t say how many adding ""We anticipate no issues in maintaining a reliable supply of products to the market.""

But that’s not guaranteed and could impact California’s current average price of gas now at $5.85 a gallon according to UC Berkeley professor Severin Borenstein.

""It would be coming at a very unfortunate time because we already have a shortage of refinery capacity in California right now and so losing even one or two percent of the state's refinery capacity would probably result in a noticeable increase in gasoline prices"" said Borenstein.

There are also safety concerns.

The Richmond Progressive Alliance which advocates for safety and a better environment worries about replacements operating dangerous systems that are prone to problems even during normal times with experienced union workers.

""We’re really concerned about the well-being of Richmond residents as the plant is being run by nonunion workers who haven’t received the proper training or have the proper knowledge of the Chevron or Refinery"" said Shiva Mishek with Richmond Progressive Alliance.

Chevron says for logistical reasons it was unable to continue negotiations that failed this weekend but has plans to resume talks.

The union says that’s news to them and that they have yet to be contacted about a date and time to continue discussions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTAzLTIwL3NhdWRpLWFyYW1jby1yYWlzZXMtc3BlbmRpbmctdGFyZ2V0LWZvbGxvd2luZy1vaWwtcy1zdXJnZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After Oil's Surge Saudi Aramco Hikes Spending to Boost Output,"Why did this happen?

Soaring oil prices are padding the fortunes of U.S. shale and gas tycoons even vaulting one into the ranks of the world’s 500 richest people for the first time.

American oil and gas industrialists on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index now have a collective net worth of $239 billion a jump of nearly 10% since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. The growth is being fueled by near-record high energy prices as sanctions by the U.S. and Europe threaten to choke off Russian exports.

Brent crude prices have spiked as much as 32% since the invasion began and were at about $106 a barrel on Friday. That’s caused markets in everything from airlines stocks to tech shares to gyrate but it’s been a boon to many companies that make money producing selling or transporting fossil fuels.

Harold Hamm 76 co-founder of shale giant Continental Resources Inc. has moved up 28 places on Bloomberg’s wealth index to 93rd and now controls an $18.6 billion fortune. Richard Kinder’s net worth has grown to $8.5 billion thanks to his stake in pipeline and energy-storage firm Kinder Morgan Inc while rising demand for liquefied natural gas has helped Freeport LNG founder Michael S. Smith crack the 500 wealthiest list for the first time.

‘Growing Production’

Even before the Ukraine war the U.S. oil and gas industry’s revenues had been growing rapidly as demand rebounded from pandemic lows. One segment of the hydrocarbon industry that’s reaping more profits is private companies.

Previous oil booms in places like Texas and New Mexico have been fueled by publicly traded companies as behemoths such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. consolidated their holdings in a rush to pump more product. That all changed with the pandemic. Public companies that once gorged on cheap debt have been forced to scale back by cautious shareholders while private companies have seized the moment to boost production.

“On the private side those pressures from shareholders aren’t nearly as acute” said Andrew Dittmar a director at energy-analytics and software firm Enverus. “It makes good economic sense for private firms to invest in growing production.”

It’s also helped boost the fortunes of private operators. Jeffery Hildebrand 63 the founder and sole owner of Lafayette Louisiana-based Hilcorp Energy is now worth more than $12 billion while Endeavor Energy Resources founder Autry Stephens 84 has capitalized on his company’s vast holdings in the Permian Basin to expand his net worth to $5.2 billion.

One closely held company that’s done well is liquefied natural gas exporter Freeport LNG which shipped its first commissioning cargo as recently as September 2019. The sale of a 25% stake in November to a Japanese energy company valued Freeport at an implied $9.7 billion.

That has propelled Michael Smith who owns about 63% of the company into 409th place on Bloomberg’s wealth list with a fortune of $6.2 billion.

Smith’s Houston-based company is poised to benefit if Europe -- which currently gets 40% of its natural gas from Russia -- turns to the U.S. to procure more supplies.

Even if that doesn’t happen the increased demand would raise prices and help the company’s bottom line. Prices of LNG -- gas that’s been chilled into a liquid to make it easier to transport -- have surged.

“Michael Smith’s bet on the U.S. gas industry has paid off” said Talon Custer a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. “And they have options to grow.”

Heather Browne a spokeswoman for Freeport LNG declined to comment on Smith’s net worth or the company’s plans.

Freeport LNG has faced delays in recent years expanding its export infrastructure because of difficulty obtaining government permits and low gas prices. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could speed up those plans as government and industry officials reassess their reluctance to ramp up production Smith told Bloomberg News last week.

“Hopefully this will change the narrative” he said.

My car is a Mini Cooper I bought years ago partly because it wasn’t a gas-guzzler. Now it’s guzzling dollars.

When I consider what’s happening in Ukraine I say what the hell. It’s a small sacrifice.

Yet guess who’s making no sacrifice at all – in fact who’s reaping a giant windfall from this crisis?

Big oil has hit a gusher. Even before Vladimir Putin’s war oil prices had begun to rise due to the recovery in global demand and tight inventories.

Last year when Americans were already struggling to pay their heating bills and fill up their gas tanks the biggest oil companies (Shell Chevron BP and Exxon) posted profits totaling $75bn. This year courtesy of Putin big oil is on the way to a far bigger bonanza.

How are the oil companies using this windfall? I can assure you they’re not investing in renewables. They’re not even increasing oil production.

As Chevron’s top executive Mike Wirth said in September “We could afford to invest more” but “the equity market is not sending a signal that says they think we ought to be doing that.”

Translated: Wall Street says the way to maximize profits is to limit supply and push up prices instead.

So they’re buying back their own stock in order to give their stock prices even more of a boost. Last year they spent $38bn on stock buybacks – their biggest buyback spending spree since 2008. This year thanks largely to Putin the oil giants are planning to buy back at least $22bn more.

Republicans will balk at any tax increase on big oil of course

Make no mistake. This is a direct redistribution from consumers who are paying through the nose at the gas pump to big oil’s investors and top executives (whose compensation packages are larded with shares of stock and stock options).

Though it’s seldom discussed in the media lower-income earners and their families bear the brunt of the burden of higher gas prices. Not only are lower-income people less likely to be able to work from home they’re also more likely to commute for longer distances between work and home in order to afford less expensive housing.

Big oil companies could absorb the higher costs of crude oil. The reason they’re not is because they’re so big they don’t have to. They don’t worry about losing market share to competitors. So they’re passing on the higher costs to consumers in the form of higher prices and pocketing record profits.

It’s the same old story in this country: when crisis strikes the poor and working class are on the frontlines while the biggest corporations and their investors and top brass rake it in.

What to do? Hit big oil with a windfall profits tax.

The European Union recently advised its members to seek a windfall profits tax on oil companies taking advantage of this very grave emergency to raise their prices.

Democrats just introduced similar legislation here in the US. The bill would tax the largest oil companies which are recording their biggest profits in years and use the money to provide quarterly checks to Americans facing sticker shock as inflation continues to soar.

It would require oil companies producing or importing at least 300000 barrels of oil per day to pay a per-barrel tax equal to half the difference between the current price of a barrel and the average price from the years 2015 to 2019.

This is hardly confiscatory. Those were years when energy companies were already recording large profits. Quarterly rebates to consumers would phase out for individuals earning more than $75000 or couples earning $150000.

Republicans will balk at any tax increase on big oil of course. They and the coal-industry senator Joe Manchin even tanked the nomination of Sarah Bloom Raskin to the Fed because she had the temerity to speak out about the systemic risks that climate change poses to our economy.

But a windfall profits tax on big oil is exactly what Democrats must do to help average working people through this fuel crisis. It’s good policy it’s good politics and it’s the right thing to do."
CMG,Chipotle Mexican Grill,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2RhcS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMS10YXN0eS1yZWFzb24tZm9yLWNoaXBvdGxlcy1odWdlLXN1Y2Nlc3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,1 Tasty Reason for Chipotle's Huge Success,"A winner that probably no one saw coming over the past two years has been Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG). Thanks to a strong digital presence the company has continued to post double-digit same-store sales growth while also opening new locations at a healthy clip. And shares are up more than 200% since bottoming out when the pandemic first hit in March 2020.

Chipotle's simple yet tasty menu is a big part of the reason the chain has been so successful. But from a customer perspective the convenience and value proposition is also unmatched. A recent announcement proves the business and its management can still find new ways to keep loyal fans coming back for more.

Even restaurants can innovate

Chipotle announced it would begin offering pollo asado to its menu in the U.S. and Canada. In its 29-year history this is the first time the business has added a new chicken offering.

""Chicken is easily our most popular protein with many of our most loyal Chipotle customers ordering it the majority of the time"" Chief Marketing Officer Chris Brandt highlighted in the recent press release.

Test results at select stores in Cincinnati and Sacramento were extremely positive. Customer feedback and sales of pollo asado were similar to the limited-time brisket offering which was Chipotle's best-selling menu introduction in recent years. That's a great sign for pollo asado's prospects.

This tasty development shows even companies in the restaurant sector can find ways to innovate. In Chipotle's case new menu items like this one can have a profound impact on engaging existing customers and attracting new ones. The menu might be simple and focused but Chipotle has shown that it can shake things up quite well.

CEO Brian Niccol previously held the same role at Taco Bell and in that position he similarly oversaw new menu introductions for the fast-food chain so it's no surprise he's bringing some of that expertise to Chipotle's operations. Since Niccol took over leadership at Chipotle in March 2018 its shares have skyrocketed almost 400%.

Navigating the inflationary environment

The current economic situation characterized by soaring inflation and a tight labor market has hit restaurants particularly hard. Even Chipotle regarded as a leader in the cutthroat industry isn't immune to these issues. Fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $5.58 exceeded Wall Street estimates but rising beef avocado and freight costs resulted in Chipotle's 8.6% operating margin coming in far below the previous three quarters.

But by continuing to introduce new menu items Chipotle is finding ways to keep its customers excited and coming back for more. Furthermore it gives the business an opportunity to raise prices. The new pollo asado entrees will cost an average of $9.11 in the U.S. $0.65 more expensive than the regular adobo chicken. Shareholders should appreciate this proven pricing power as it gives management another lever to help drive sales growth.

Compared to last year customers are paying about 10% more for their food orders due to strategic price hikes management has implemented. Revenue in 2021 was 26.1% higher than in 2020 demonstrating resilient demand for Chipotle's offerings. There are likely even more opportunities to increase prices should inflation stay elevated in the near term.

While Chipotle stock is expensive and priced for perfection with a price-to-earnings ratio of 68 this is a high-quality business that investors should keep on their watch lists.

In the KQEN Business Spotlight:

Chipotle Mexican Grill the national chain based in Newport Bay California has filed an application to build a new restaurant at the Roseburg Marketplace at the location soon to be vacated by Loggers Tap House.

John Lazur of the City of Roseburg Community Development Department told News Radio 93-9 FM and 1240 KQEN that the application was turned in on March 2nd. Developers plan to demolish the existing building and construct a 2325 square foot outlet. The site will include a drive-through and 300 square feet of outdoor seating area.

Chipotle founded in 1993 is considered to be one of the first “fast casual” dining restaurants. McDonald’s Corporation became a major investor in 1998 but fully divested itself by 2006. As of this year the chain has grown to 3000 locations. That includes in the United States along with stores in Canada the United Kingdom France and Germany.

While the process of locating in Roseburg has begun a company spokesperson remains somewhat vague. Sally Evans Analyst for External Communications for Chipotle told KQEN “We are currently scheduled to open a location in Roseburg at some point next winter”. Evans said those are the only details she could share for now.

The company has partnered with Miso Robotics to customize its latest robotics solution to cook and freshly season Chipotle’s delicious tortilla chips.

Chipotle’s culinary team guided Miso in trailing its technology to maintain the culinary integrity of the brand. Leveraging artificial intelligence Chippy is trained to replicate Chipotle’s exact recipe – using the same trio of ingredients (corn masa flour water and sunflower oil) – to cook chips to perfection. It can then season the chips with a dusting of salt and finish with a hint of fresh lime juice just like its two-legged counterparts.

It was imperative that the technique remained the same sot the customers receive delicious crave-able chips every time. Chippy’s AI capabilities will help ensure that Chipotle locations won’t run out of chips during the day.

“Everyone loves finding a chip with a little more salt or an extra hint of lime” said Nevielle Panthaky Vice President of Culinary Chipotle. “To ensure we didn’t lose the humanity behind our culinary experience we trained Chippy extensively to ensure the output mirrored our current product delivering some subtle variations in flavor that our guests expect.”

The company is currently testing the AI kitchen assistant at the Chipotle Cultivate Center Chipotle’s innovation hub in Irvine California to see if it can replicate the flavor texture and crunch of one of its signature side dishes. Later this year the robot will be integrated into a Chipotle restaurant in Southern California. The company is leveraging its stage-gate process to listen test and learn from the crew and guest feedback before deciding on a national implementation strategy.

“We are always exploring opportunities to enhance our employee and guest experience. Our goal is to drive efficiencies through collaborative robotics that will enable Chipotle’s crew members to focus on other tasks in the restaurant” said Curt Garner Chief Technology Officer at Chipotle.

Supply chains in food construction fashion fast-moving consumer goods electronics automotive professional services and freight account for more than half of all global greenhouse gas emissions.

The importance of supply chains to companies’ sustainability goals is now widely accepted.

A report by Accenture reveals that CEOs agree that technology is enabling new business models and will unlock the future of industry decarbonisation. The ability to track every stage of the product journey from raw materials to the consumers doorstep through to the end-life of the product is now top of mind for businesses. In fact research by EY lists end-to-end visibility as the number one factor in creating a successful supply chain. Furthermore as global supply chains continue to be affected by challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic this is a way to build resilience and future-proof supply chains from disruptions.

To fully leverage the transformational opportunities that technology can unlock organisations need effective data management and item-level visibility across the value chain - but this can’t be accomplished without the right technologies.

Traceability leads to visibility

When we look at the future of sustainability from net-zero goals to circular business models none of it is possible if companies don’t first understand the what when where why and how of their products at each stage of the supply chain.

This is where the benefits of digital identity technologies can have a profound impact. By assigning each product its own ‘digital twin’ companies can unlock sophisticated real-time monitoring of their supply chains. This helps them to make supply chain decisions that can reduce waste increase efficiencies and create circular processes.

A prime example is the use of digital twins in the food sector capable of driving better management of expiry more precise product removal during recalls and improved monitoring of temperatures to avoid spoilage. Based on pilot studies we believe radio frequency identification (RFID) tagging can help grocers reduce food waste by as much as 20%.

Chipotle Mexican Grill recently announced it is testing RFID technology to enhance its traceability and inventory systems across approximately 200 restaurants in the greater Chicago area. A leader in food safety Chipotle is one of the first major restaurant companies to leverage RFID case labels to track ingredients from suppliers to restaurants via serialization. The ambition is to save suppliers time on inventory management and stock rotation mitigate human error and increase expiration date visibility and accountability.

Driving decarbonisation

To meet the urgency of curbing climate change it’s critical that businesses act to eliminate GHG emissions and when we consider that the food supply chain alone represents a quarter of global GHG emissions the possibilities are huge and the supply chain’s role in decarbonisation could be an absolute game-changer.

Avery Dennison is working with a major sports retailer who is piloting our atma.io connected product cloud solution to trace the carbon footprint of its raw materials. By assigning every product a digital identity which is connected to the cloud the sports retailer can determine the carbon cost of each product from manufacturer to store shelf.

The next frontier of supply chain decarbonisation is to ensure companies are measuring and managing their total value chain. Scope 3 emissions account for 65-95% of a company’s emissions but progress on tracking these emissions has been slow. The latest updates to the atma.io connected product cloud have been created to help brands meet net-zero targets and reduce waste across the supply chain. The atma.io Real-time Carbon Impact Analytics tool provides brands with data-driven insights regarding the carbon footprint of their products including Scope 3 emissions and beyond. It captures data from every stage of a product’s journey from raw material to consumer and can help firms as they work to comply with forthcoming EU ‘Digital Product Passport’ regulations.

Supply chains for value-driven customers

Consumer behaviour is changing and given the COVID-19 pandemic transparent and real-time information is becoming critical to ensure health and safety but also to align with consumers’ increasing demands for sustainability.

The information made possible by digital identity technologies goes way beyond a product’s origins to letting people know where their product has been giving them access to behind-the-scenes footage of where products are made to information on how or where to recycle or resell their clothing.

As the global economy is transitioning away from a linear model to a circular one digital identity technologies provide consumers with information through a smartphone scan or tap on how or where to recycle or resell their clothing and by providing resellers with the authenticity of a garment enabling its second life.

For example Levi’s partnered with Hong Kong upcycling brand The R Collective to create a fully traceable denim collection. Each item has an Avery Dennison-enabled digital label with a QR code that informs consumers how to care for their garment and how to recycle at its end of life. French lingerie brand Etam is deploying RFID technology across its entire range of bras and underwear as a means of tracking and tracing product throughout its journey from factory to store shelf. This provides a global vision of its stock wherever the product happens to be allowing the brand to take full advantage of its inventory whether it is being showcased in stores in stockrooms or in warehouses. As part of its commitment to transparency shoppers can scan QR codes on product labels to beam short videos about factories and product insights directly to their smartphones.

Transparent supply chains are fast being seen as ‘business as usual’ not an innovative extra with digital twins being used all the way from item creation to optimising manufacturing operations to end of life. The evidence around the commercial benefits is extensive.

According to an Accenture study across five use cases digital twins can unlock US$1.3tn in economic value and 7.5 Gt CO2 emissions reductions till 2030. We have the societal and the business case for change coupled with the technology required now we just need to see more urgency and action."

What does TravellerShield Plus travel insurance cover?

The cheapest travel insurance plan distributed by DBS is the DBS TravellerShield Plus Classic which has pretty decent coverage for a sedate overseas trip with Covid-19 coverage of course!

However if you’re planning any form of outdoor activity such as scuba diving or skiing you must upgrade to (i.e. pay more for) Premier or Platinum to get covered. Based on their policy wording here’s a summary of activities are covered or otherwise by TravellerShield Plus travel insurance:

Outdoor activity Covered by TravellerShield Plus? Hot air balloon Premier & Platinum only Scuba diving Premier & Platinum only (up to 30m) Skiing and other ice/snow sports Premier & Platinum only (within ski resort) Hiking or trekking Yes (up to 3000m) Mountaineering or outdoor rock climbing Premier & Platinum only (up to 3000m) Marathons or other competitions Yes (marathons only – no ultramarathons biathlons or triathlons) Jet skiing Premier & Platinum only White water rafting Premier & Platinum only (up to Grade 4) Skydiving Premier & Platinum only Paragliding hang gliding or parachuting Premier & Platinum only Bungee jumping Premier & Platinum only

Conclusion: Should you buy travel insurance from DBS?

As a super lazy person I can totally understand why you would want to buy travel insurance from DBS. It’s affordable and more importantly so convenient. I mean which other insurer lets you pay with PayLah?

Coverage-wise the cheapest plan from DBS is adequate for say a shopping trip to Bangkok or a relaxing tour of Japan. It also covers leisure hikes up to 3000m so it’s fine if you want to climb Mount Ophir too.

But if you want to do outdoor activities like scuba diving skiing or even skydiving you will need to upgrade to the higher tier plan to get covered.

Unfortunately DBS doesn’t make this limitation in coverage clear from the outset – you need to do a super close reading of the FAQ or policy wording to figure that out. Minus points for that.

(KOLN) - A Southeast Lincoln church held a different type of Sunday gathering. This comes after a portion of their church caught fire early Saturday morning.

The congregation at New Covenant Community Church gathered in the parking lot this morning for a non-traditional service. Members arrived with lawn chairs and hope for the future.

Just before 3 a.m. Saturday morning Lincoln Fire and Rescue responded to the church for a fire coming from the roof. LFR says it’s estimated the fire caused $1.5 million in damage.

The damage included the sanctuary where they usually meet on Sunday mornings.

Lead Pastor Chris Shelton says he thinks this will only bring the church closer.

“We as a church are not defined by a building but by being together and being the weather was beautiful today” Shelton said “it was just a great opportunity for us to continue what we typically do every Sunday.”

As for what’s next for New Covenant Pastor Chris also said that this is a day-by-day situation and it’s unknown if they will continue with these outdoor services for the summer.

It was the music that changed first. Or maybe that's just when many people at the pale brick Catholic church in the quiet Wisconsin neighborhood finally began to realize what was happening. The choir director a fixture at St. Maria Goretti for nearly 40 years was suddenly gone. Contemporary hymns were replaced by music rooted in medieval Europe. So much was changing. Sermons were focusing more on sin and confession. Priests were rarely seen without cassocks. Altar girls for a time were banned. At the parish elementary school students began hearing about abortion and hell. ""It was like a step back in time"" said one former parishioner still so dazed by the tumultuous changes that began in 2021 with a new pastor that he only spoke on condition of anonymity. It's not just St. Maria Goretti. Across the U.S. the Catholic Church is undergoing an immense shift. Generations of Catholics who embraced the modernizing tide sparked in the 1960s by Vatican II are increasingly giving way to religious conservatives who believe the church has been twisted by change with the promise of eternal salvation replaced by guitar Masses parish food pantries and casual indifference to church doctrine. The shift molded by plummeting church attendance increasingly traditional priests and growing numbers of young Catholics searching for more orthodoxy has reshaped parishes across the country leaving them sometimes at odds with Pope Francis and much of the Catholic world. The changes are not happening everywhere. There are still plenty of liberal parishes plenty that see themselves as middle-of-the-road. Despite their growing influence conservative Catholics remain a minority. Yet the changes they have brought are impossible to miss.

The progressive priests who dominated the U.S. church in the years after Vatican II are now in their 70s and 80s. Many are retired. Some are dead. Younger priests surveys show are far more conservative. ""They say they're trying to restore what us old guys ruined"" said the Rev. John Forliti 87 a retired Twin Cities priest who fought for civil rights and reforms in Catholic school sex education. Doug Koesel an outspoken 72-year-old priest at Blessed Trinity Parish in Cleveland was blunter: ""They're just waiting for us to die."" At St. Maria Goretti once steeped in the ethos of Vatican II many parishioners saw the changes as a requiem. ""I don't want my daughter to be Catholic"" said Christine Hammond whose family left the parish when the new outlook spilled into the church's school and her daughter's classroom. ""Not if this is the Roman Catholic Church that is coming."" But this is not a simple story. Because there are many who welcome this new old church. They often stand out in the pews with the men in ties and the women sometimes with the lace head coverings that all but disappeared from American churches more than 50 years ago. Often at least a couple families will arrive with four five or even more children signaling their adherence to the church's ban on contraception which most American Catholics have long casually ignored. They attend confession regularly and adhere strictly to church teachings. Many yearn for Masses that echo with medieval traditions — more Latin more incense more Gregorian chants. ""We want this ethereal experience that is different from everything else in our lives"" said Ben Rouleau who until recently led St. Maria Goretti's young adult group which saw membership skyrocket even as the parish shrank amid the turmoil. They are Rouleau said happily out of touch with a liberal city like Madison. ""It's radical in some ways"" Rouleau said. ""We're returning to the roots of the church.""

Three decades of progressive change If this movement emerged from anywhere it might be a now-demolished Denver football stadium and a borrowed military helicopter carrying in Pope John Paul II. Some 500000 people descended on Denver in 1993 for the Catholic festival World Youth Day. When the pope's helicopter landed just outside Mile High Stadium the ground shook from the stomping. The pope whose grandfatherly appearance belied an electric charisma and who was beloved both for his kindness and his sternness confronted an American church shaped by three decades of progressive change. If the church is often best known to non-Catholics for its opposition to abortion it had grown increasingly liberal since Vatican II. Birth control was quietly accepted in many parishes and confession barely mentioned. Catholic social teaching on poverty suffused churches. Most priests traded in their cassocks for plain black shirts with Roman collars. Incense and Latin became increasingly rare. On some issues John Paul II agreed with these liberal-minded Catholics. He spoke against capital punishment and pushed for workers' rights. He preached relentlessly about forgiveness — ""the oxygen that purifies the air of hatred."" He forgave his own would-be assassin. But he was also uncompromising on dogma warning about change and cracking down on liberal theologians. He urged a return to forgotten rituals. Catholics ""are in danger of losing their faith"" he told crowds at the final Denver Mass decrying abortion drug abuse and what he called ""sexual disorders"" a barely veiled reference to growing acceptance of gay rights. Across the nation fervent young Catholics listened. Newman Centers which serve Catholic university students became increasingly popular. So did FOCUS a traditionalist organization working on American college campuses. Conservative Catholic media grew particularly the cable TV network EWTN a prominent voice for increased orthodoxy.

Today conservative Catholic America has its own constellation of online celebrities aimed at young people. There's Sister Miriam James an ever-smiling nun in full habit who talks openly about her hard-partying college days. There's Jackie Francois Angel who speaks in shockingly frank detail about sex marriage and Catholicism. There's Mike Schmitz a movie-star handsome Minnesota priest who exudes kindness while insisting on doctrine. Even today surveys show most American Catholics are far from orthodox. Most support abortion rights. The vast majority use birth control. But increasingly those Catholics are not in church. In 1970 more than half of America's Catholics said they went to Mass at least once a week. By 2022 that had fallen to 17% according to CARA a research center affiliated with Georgetown University. Among millennials the number is just 9%. Even as the U.S. Catholic population has jumped to more than 70 million driven in part by immigration from Latin America ever-fewer Catholics are involved in the church's most important rites. Infant baptisms have fallen from 1.2 million in 1965 to 440000 in 2021 CARA says. Catholic marriages have dropped by well over two-thirds. The shrinking numbers mean that those who remain in the church have outsized influence compared with the overall Catholic population. On the national level conservatives increasingly dominate the U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference and the Catholic intellectual world. They include everyone from the philanthropist founder of Domino's Pizza to six of the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices. Then there's the priesthood. Young priests driven by liberal politics and progressive theology so common in the 1960s and 70s have ""all but vanished"" said a 2023 report from The Catholic Project at Catholic University based on a survey of more than 3500 priests. Today's young priests are far more likely to believe that the church changed too much after Vatican II tangling itself up in America's rapidly shifting views on everything from women's roles to LGBTQ people. ""There really aren't very many liberals in the seminaries anymore"" said a young recently ordained Midwestern priest. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the turmoil that engulfed his parish after he began pressing for more orthodox services. ""They wouldn't feel comfortable.""

Slow shift toward orthodoxy Sometimes the shift toward orthodoxy happens slowly. Maybe there's a little more Latin sprinkled into Mass or an occasional reminder to go to confession. Maybe guitars are relegated to Saturday evening services or dropped completely. And sometimes the changes come like a whirlwind dividing parishes between those thirsting for a more reverent Catholicism and those who feel their spiritual home has been taken from them. ""You'd leave Mass thinking 'Holy cow! What just happened?'"" said another ex-parishioner at St. Maria Goretti whose family eventually left the church describing the 2021 promotion of a new pastor and a sudden focus on sin and confession. Like many former parishioners he spoke only on condition of anonymity worried about upsetting friends still at the church. Diocesan clergy did not respond to requests for interviews. ""I'm a lifelong Catholic. I grew up going to church every Sunday"" he said. ""But I'd never seen anything like this."" The new outlook has spilled across America. In churches from Minnesota to California parishioners have protested changes introduced by new conservative priests. In Cincinnati it came when the new priest abandoned gospel music and African drumming. In small-town North Carolina it was an intense focus on Latin. In east Texas it was a right-wing bishop forced out by the Vatican after accusing Pope Francis of undermining church teachings. Each can seem like one more skirmish in the cultural and political battles tearing at America. But the movement whether called conservative or orthodox or traditionalist or authentic can be hard to define. It ranges from Catholics who want more incense to Latin Mass adherents who have brought back ancient prayers that mention ""the perfidious Jew."" There are right-wing survivalists celebrity exorcists environmentalists and a handful of quasi-socialists. There's the Catholic news outlet railing against the Vatican's ""wicked entourage"" and the small-town Wisconsin priest who traces COVID-19 to a century-old prophecy and warns of looming dictatorship. There's the recent ""Catholic Prayer for Trump"" a $1000-a-plate dinner at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort featuring a string of conspiracy theorists.

Yet the orthodox movement can also seem like a tangle of forgiveness and rigidity where insistence on mercy and kindness mingle with warnings of eternity in hell. Looming over the American divide is Pope Francis who has pushed the global church to be more inclusive even as he toes the line on most dogma. The orthodox movement has watched him nervously from the first days of his papacy angered by his more liberal views on issues like gay relationships and divorce. Some reject him entirely. And the pope clearly worries about America. The U.S. church has ""a very strong reactionary attitude"" he told a group of Jesuits last year. ""Being backward-looking is useless."" A new vision of Catholic America You can find this new vision of Catholic America at Latin Masses in Milwaukee the pews crowded with worshippers even at noon on a weekday. It's in conferences held in California wine country at reinvigorated parishes in Tennessee and prayer groups in Washington D.C. And it's at a little Kansas college built high on a bluff above the Missouri River. At first glance nothing seems unusual about Benedictine College. Students worry about unfinished essays and the complexities of dating. They wear cutoff shorts on warm autumn afternoons. Football is huge. The cafeteria food is mediocre. But look deeper. Because at Benedictine Catholic teaching on contraception can slip into lessons on Plato and no one is surprised if you volunteer for 3 a.m. prayers. Pornography premarital sex and sunbathing in swimsuits are forbidden. If these rules seem like precepts of a bygone age that hasn't stopped students from flocking to Benedictine and other conservative Catholic colleges. At a time when U.S. college enrollment is shrinking Benedictine's expansion over the last 15 years has included four new residence halls a new dining hall and an academic center. An immense new library is being built. The roar of construction equipment never seems to stop. Enrollment now about 2200 has doubled in 20 years. Students many of whom grew up in conservative Catholic families jokingly call it ""the Benedictine bubble."" And it might be a window into the future of the Catholic Church in America.

In a deeply secular America where an ever-churning culture provides few absolute answers Benedictine offers the reassurance of clarity. ""We don't all agree on everything obviously"" said John Welte a senior majoring in economics and philosophy. ""But I would say everyone has an understanding of like truth."" ""There are certain things you can just know in your mind: This is right and this is wrong."" Sometimes people here quietly admit it goes too far. Like the students who loudly proclaim how often they go to Mass or the young man who quit his classics course because he refused to read the works of ancient Greek pagans. Very often talk here echoes the 13th-century writings of St. Thomas Aquinas who believed God could be found in truth goodness and beauty. Sometimes they say that means finding God in strict tenets about sexuality. Sometimes in the haunting beauty of Gregorian chants. ""It's a renewal of like some really really good things that we might have lost"" said Madeline Hays a pensive 22-year-old senior biology major. She takes the church's rules seriously from pre-marital sex to confession. She can't stand modern church architecture. She's seriously considering becoming a nun. But she also worries about poverty and America's wastefulness and the way Americans — including herself — can find themselves slotted into the political divide without even knowing it. She wrestles with her belief in an unerring Catholic doctrine that can see good people including some of her own friends as sinners. Yet she doesn't want change. ""The church wouldn't be the church if it changed things it had set down as 'This is infallible doctrine and this will not change through the ages' "" she said. They understand that in Benedictine's small mostly closeted gay community. Like the young man once deeply religious who suffers in silence as people on campus casually throw around anti-gay slurs. He's thought many times of leaving but generous financial aid keeps him here. And after many years he's accepted his sexuality. He's seen the joy that people can get from Benedictine how some will move back to Atchison after graduation just to stay close. But not him. ""I don't think I'll come back to Atchison — not ever.""

Remodeling a spiritual home For decades the pews at St. Maria Goretti were filled with the families of plumbers engineers and professors from the University of Wisconsin just a couple miles up the road. The church is a well-kept island of Catholicism tucked into the leafy residential streets of one of America's most liberal cities. Like so many other parishes it had been shaped by the ideals of the 1960s and 1970s. Poverty and social justice became tightly interwoven with sermons and parish life. Gay people felt welcome. Some of the church's moral absolutes like the contraception ban became forgotten dogma. Change arrived in 2003 with a new bishop Robert C. Morlino an outspoken conservative. Many liberals remember him as the man who lambasted the message of acceptance in the modern hymn ""All Are Welcome."" His successor Bishop Donald J. Hying steers clear of public battles. But in many ways he quietly carries on Morlino's legacy warning about ""the tangled thinking of Modernism."" In 2021 Hying named the Rev. Scott Emerson a one time top Morlino aide as pastor of the Madison church. Parishioners watched — some pleased some uneasily — as their spiritual home was remodeled. There was more incense more Latin more talk of sin and confession. Emerson's sermons are not all fire-and-brimstone. He speaks often about forgiveness and compassion. But his tone shocked many longtime parishioners. Protection is needed he said in a 2023 service from ""the spiritual corruption of worldly vices."" He has warned against critics — ""the atheists journalists politicians the fallen-away Catholics"" — he said were undermining the church. For some Emerson's changes were welcome. ""A lot of us were like 'Hey more confession! Sweet!"" said Rouleau who ran the parish young adult group. ""Better music!""

(KSLA) - Daniel Wimberly said he’s glad he took a chance after noticing social media posts that rapper Torence “Boosie” Hatch had been seen in Shreveport.

Wimberly and his wife Shantina were at a concert in Frisco Texas when they heard that the Louisiana rapper had been spotted. Not knowing whether he would respond Daniel sent Boosie a message inviting him to attend service at Greater Pleasant Grove Baptist Church.

“Daniel my husband always invites everyone to attend church with us. To us it was all about the ministry” Shantina said.

That Sunday Daniel was setting up when he spotted Boosie and his fiancée entering the church.

“While I was playing drums I was shocked because we are a small neighborhood church and here is this national recording artist who doesn’t even know me walking in to visit.”

Wimberly said he revealed at the end of the sermon that he was the one who invited Boosie. Wimberly thanked Boosie for coming and invited him to prayer.

“I told him ‘God bless him.’ Boosie smiled and you can see he was overjoyed. Then our pastor called him up to the front and asked him if he would like to say anything and Mr. Hatch asked for prayer” Wimberly recalled.

He said will never forget the conversation he had with Boosie after church.

“This means a lot to me he is one of my favorite artists and I grew up on his music. You never know what a person is going through so that’s why it’s good to reach out and invite someone to God’s house.”

Castellanos agreed to a five-year $100 million contract with the Philadelphia Phillies on Friday according to USA TODAY Sports. The Reds will receive an additional 2022 draft pick because Castellanos declined the club’s one-year $18.4 million qualifying offer in November which should end up as the No. 32 or No. 33 overall selection.

Reds General Manager Nick Krall reached out to Castellanos’ agent Scott Boras a couple of days before Castellanos came to an agreement with the Phillies to monitor his market sources told The Enquirer.

More:Cincinnati Reds pitcher Luis Castillo not worried about his own trade rumors

Castellanos was seeking at least a five-year deal after opting out of the final two years and $34 million in his Reds contract at the beginning of the offseason and he was in serious talks with the Miami Marlins before the lockout.

The compensatory draft pick will fall immediately after the first round of the MLB Draft because the Reds are a revenue-sharing recipient as a small-market club and because Castellanos signed for more than $50 million.

The Reds received a compensatory draft pick in the 2021 MLB Draft after Trevor Bauer signed his three-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Reds picked high school outfielder Jay Allen with the No. 30 overall pick in last summer’s draft a prospect who is rated No. 9 in the Reds’ farm system by Baseball America.

Krall said the Reds didn’t have contact with Boras about Castellanos immediately following the lockout but the front office created more financial flexibility after trading Sonny Gray Jesse Winker Eugenio Suárez and Amir Garrett in the past week. Their recent interest in Castellanos was believed to be on a potential short-term deal.

Castellanos had the best offensive season of his career in 2021 finishing with a .309 batting average 38 doubles a career-high 34 homers 100 RBI and 95 runs. He was selected to his first All-Star team voted as a starter by the fans and took 12th in the National League MVP voting.

He became a fan favorite for his intensity on the field. He flexed over St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Jake Woodford when he scored on a wild pitch in the second game of the season setting a tone for the rest of the season had a 21-game hitting streak in the first half of the season and played through a microfracture in his wrist after the All-Star break.

Castellanos signed a four-year $64 million contract with the Reds prior to the 2020 season with opt-out clauses after each of the first two seasons. It matched Mike Moustakas’ contract for the largest free-agent signings in Reds history.

The former LSU star was cut this offseason in an attempt to help save cap space in Dallas freeing the path for the Bengals to help protect quarterback Joe Burrow.

When the deal was announced the Cincinnati Bengals revealed that La’el Collins agreed to a three-year contract but did not release financial numbers. However a report from NBC Sports suggests that it is a “different sort of deal” which is “essentially worth $20 million over two years.”

According to Garafolo Collins planned to leave Cincinnati for another free agent visit after the meeting but the Bengals did not let him go. The deal marks the third offensive line shift the Bengals have made this offseason in an attempt to protect the future of their franchise.

After going undrafted in 2015 Collins signed with the Dallas Cowboys and played in 74 games over six seasons. The 6-foot-4 318-pound lineman started 10 games in 2021 but the Cowboys opted to release him after not finding a trade partner willing to give up assets for the remainder of his deal.

ESPN Analyst on Joe Burrow

Joe Burrow has taken the NFL by storm especially in the postseason. But Burrow has consistently been beaten up throughout his career. The Bengals have had issues on the offensive line for each of Burrow’s first two seasons. ESPN analyst Dan Orlovsky said that Burrow could be on the Andrew Luck track if the Bengals can’t fix their issues on the offensive front.

“This is what I’d say coming out of the game if I was Cincinnati and Joe Burrow” Orlovsky started. “I was incredibly impressed with him again yesterday. He right now is on the Andrew Luck track. That cautions me. You watch this kid get beat up game after game after game after game. This will not last in this league.”

Luck was the first overall pick by the Indianapolis Colts in the 2012 NFL Draft out of Stanford. He came into the league as a very promising young quarterback. The Colts went 11-5 in each of Luck’s first three NFL seasons making the playoffs in each of those years. But in 2015 Luck’s injury concerns began to catch up with him.

In his NFL career Luck dealt with a number of injuries. After 86 career regular season games and seven years in the league Luck decided to retire from playing football. In the six seasons Luck played in he was sacked 174 times.

Burrow was sacked 32 times in ten games as a rookie last season. He suffered a torn ACL in his 11th game ending his season. Burrow battled back to play this season and he has again taken a beating. This season Burrow was sacked 51 times in 16 regular season games. In four playoff games he was sacked an additional 19 times. That marks 102 sacks for Burrow in just two NFL seasons.",,,,,,,,,

Lombok Tengah (ANTARA) - Sepintas tak ada yang istimewa dari sebuah pohon yang tumbuh menjulang melebihi rumah masyarakat Sasak Desa Adat Sade Rembitan Pujut Lombok Tengah itu. Tak ada satupun daun tumbuh di sana apalagi buah.Tetapi pohon yang dinamai pohon cinta ini menyimpan arti mendalam bagi pasangan muda-mudi suku Sasak yang serius menjalin kasih ke jenjang pernikahan.Pohon cinta menjadi saksi bisu pertemuan rahasia mereka pada tengah malam. Ina Topan perempuan berusia 26 tahun dengan nama asli Yuli Nawamalini menjadi salah satu dari sosok yang mengakuinya.Beberapa tahun lalu dia diminta sang kekasih yang tak lain sepupunya bertemu di pohon cinta pukul 24.00. Tak lama bersua dia lantas dibawa menuju kandang sapi di kampung sebelah.""'Dek ayo menikah nanti malam. Saya tunggu di pohon cinta. Nanti jam 12 (malam) saya di atas pohon cinta'. Saya dibawa ke kandang sapi di kampung sebelah"" kenang dia kepada ANTARA dikutip Sabtu.Dalam tradisi masyarakat Sasak perempuan yang dipilih untuk dipinang akan dibawa pergi semalam tanpa sepengetahuan orangtua mereka atau disebut kawin lari. Namun bukan dalam arti kawin lari sebenarnya karena sang wanita semata dibawa pergi tanpa ada ritual apapun layaknya pernikahan pada umumnya. Orangtua yang tak bisa menemukan putri mereka dalam semalam harus menikahkannya dengan pemuda pilihan sang putri.""Pas malamnya enggak boleh kita disentuh-sentuh sebelum akad nikah. Dibawa sehari semalam. Enggak bisa dibawa orangtua harus sudah sehari semalam. Kalau ketemu bisa kita dibawa orangtua. Semisal ibu bapak kita enggak mau menikahkan kita"" tutur Ina Topan.""Yang cewek harus pintar-pintar cari akal ke orangtua. Mungkin dia ngakalin untuk pergi buang air kecil atau ke mana. Setelah itu celingak-celinguk keluar"" sambung dia.Walau begitu tak semua wanita Sasak di Desa Sade bertemu dengan pasangan terkasihnya di pohon cinta. Lelaki yang menyukai seorang wanita tak harus memastikan si wanita merasakan hal serupa. Dengan kata lain wanita umumnya akan menerima pinangan seorang lelaki tanpa didasari rasa cinta.""Tetapi kalau nikah sama sepupu walau kita tidak suka sama laki-lakinya kalau sudah suka laki-lakinya ayo aja. Jadinya cinta tumbuh belakangan. Dulu saya suka sama suka. Alhamdulillah"" ungkap Ina Topan yang kini dikaruniai dua orang anak itu seraya terkekeh.Warga Desa Adat Sade yang berprofesi sebagai pemandu Bayu mengatakan masyarakat di tempatnya tinggal masih melanggengkan tradisi menikah tanpa tunangan atau lamaran. Pasangan yang sudah mengikat janji setia dan suka sama suka pada malam hari bertemu di pohon cinta sebelum meminta izin menikah dari ayah sang wanita.""Setelah (bertemu di pohon cinta) itu dibawa kabur lari ke luar kampung. Besoknya langsung ada yang datang pihak laki memberitahu ke ayahnya perempuan bahwa anaknya tidak hilang tetapi diculik sama si A. Kalau tidak ada utusan yang datang orangtua kan mencari"" papar Bayu.Para perempuan di Desa Adat Sade umumnya menikah di usia 22 tahun. Bila melebihi usia itu maka warga setempat menyebutnya perawan tua.Setelah menikah mereka biasanya membantu perekonomian keluarga dengan menjual hasil tenunan mereka. Sementara suami mendapatkan rezeki dari bertani.Perempuan Sasak biasanya sudah diajari menenun sejak usia belasan tahun. Keterampilan menenun membantu mereka melatih kesabaran. Tenun yang mereka hasilkan nantinya dijual dengan harga beragam tergantung tingkat kesulitan pola dan luasan kain.

Klik untuk follow WhatsApp Channel & Google News

Semua orang pada dasarnya memiliki cara mencintai yang berbeda-beda. Terlepas dari bagaimana seseorang mencintai tentu yang paling tinggi kedudukannya ialah jika kamu dapat mencintai dan dicintai dengan tulus sepenuh hati. Ketulusan dalam mencintai biasanya tercermin dari bagaimana kamu dan pasangan saling memperlakukan satu sama lain.

Mulai dari kesetiaan untuk terus menemani di segala keadaan kesediaan untuk mau memahami dan memberi kepercayaan sepenuh hati. Ketulusan dalam mencintai dapat ditunjukkan dengan berbagai cara dan bentuk dan berikut ini adalah beberapa di antaranya.

1. Tidak memaksakan kehendak pada satu sama lain ilustrasi pasangan (pexels.com/August de Richelieu) Bentuk ketulusan dalam mencintai yang pertama ialah jika kamu tidak memaksakan kehendak pada pasangan begitu juga dengan dirinya. Kenapa hal ini menjadi yang pertama? Karena yang benar-benar mencintai dengan tulus sejatinya tidak mempermasalahkan ego. Menurunkan ego dan mengalah bukanlah suatu hal yang sulit dilakukan untuk orang yang kita cintai. Itulah kenapa bentuk dari cinta yang tulus dapat dilihat dari bagaimana kalian yang tidak memaksakan kehendak pada satu sama lain.

2. Memercayainya dengan sepenuh hati ilustrasi pasangan (pexels.com/Katerina Holmes) Bentuk ketulusan cinta juga tercermin dari bagaimana kamu yang mempercayainya dengan sepenuh hati. Hal ini memang memiliki risiko tinggi untuk gampang ditipu tapi di sisi lain kalau benar-benar mencintai dengan tulus pasti gak bakal setengah-setengah kalau percaya. Soal dibohongi dikhianati atau apapun itu urusan belakangan. Yang penting kamu memang benar-benar mempercayainya untuk menjaga cintamu yang tulus itu. Jika dia mengerti betapa berharganya kepercayaanmu ia pun akan menjaganya.

4. Menemaninya di setiap keadaan dalam hidup ilustrasi pasangan (pexels.com/Timur Weber) Jika dirimu sudah mencapai tahap mencintai untuk berusaha selalu ada di segala kondisi hidupnya itu juga merupakan salah satu bentuk ketulusan dalam mencintai. Tak peduli apa kata orang kamu tetap setia mendampingi lika-liku kehidupannya. Kamu pun dengan sabar menghadapi masalah yang datang bersama-sama. Karena sesungguhnya bagi seseorang yang mencintai dengan sepenuh hati hal ini merupakan keinginan yang tak dapat dibantah. Dan alangkah tulusnya dirimu kalau tidak mengharapkan balasan serupa dari pasangan karena tulus berarti ikhlas memberi."
CSCO,Cisco,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRlc21hbi5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy9wMDE5ODUyNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Narciso (“Cisco”) Garcia Obituary,"Narciso (""Cisco"") Garcia

Austin - Narciso (""Cisco"") Garcia left his body behind on Thursday March 10. He was diagnosed with a very rare and aggressive cancer in March 2021 and it finally took his body down. He was blessed with a large group of loving relatives and friends who visited cared for and loved him throughout especially during the last 6 months which included far too many days in hospital. We were also blessed to spend his last two weeks at Hospice Austin Christopher House. During that time so many folks were able to visit and talk with him and he died holding his wife's hand.

Cisco was born in San Benito Texas into a big extended Garcia family. He treasured the memories of his Ama María and Apa Pancho and his early childhood with aunts uncles and cousins in the RGV. The youngest of four children he was the first to be born in a hospital and among the generations of Texas Hispanic kids who were physically beaten at school for speaking Spanish.

Cisco's family moved to Austin around his third grade and he made lifelong friends at Baker. When that school was closed and the students reassigned to O. Henry he made many more friends including his future wife Anne Dunkelberg. Throughout his time at Baker O. Henry and Austin High he stood out as a gifted natural athlete a big spirit an indomitable rebel and—of course—a gorgeous hunk. Had the short-sighted coaches of the day not been hell-bent on domination (e.g. demanding he cut his hair if he wanted to play football) he could have contributed much more to athletic successes at AHS!

Cisco's natural competence common sense and leadership traits served him well in young adulthood when he worked at Manor Downs ran framing crews and did other construction jobs. He later spent a decade on gas production platforms in the gulf climbing the ranks despite his occasional habit of telling management truths about safety and compliance they'd have preferred not to hear.

In 1990 Cisco decided to make a change and pursue his passion to work with kids. (This was a very attractive quality to his new girlfriend/eventual wife Anne.) Having earned a GED he worked through ACC and UT Austin to earn a BA in History and helped SafePlace make its teen dating violence programs a success. In 2006 he embarked on over 3 years working in Los Angeles for the VIP Community Mental Health Center doing a wide range of youth outreach and violence- and gang-prevention work in Boyle Heights and South Central neighborhoods. He brought his talents back to Austin in 2009 when he joined Communities in Schools of Central Texas as a Program Manager at Webb Middle School. He served in that role later at Gus Garcia and Paredes Middle Schools.

Cisco influenced many folks who worked with middle school kids in his time with CIS earning a reputation for his unfailing commitment to supporting kids over institutions—even or especially those who were struggling the most. He had an amazing talent for connecting to students and making them feel heard known and respected. School administrators faculty and staff marveled at his ability to help students who were in a hard spot turn around and move ahead. He has a legacy of adults who learned from him and students who were able to grow and find successes through his hard work.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s Cisco organized a series of Christmas Parties for the Homeless. After a few less formal years it was hosted at Mercado Caribe on 6th street and notably at La Zona Rosa for several years. Those events were community love made manifest with food clothing live music and (strategically limited) beer rations donated by dozens of Austinites. Ask Gordon and Marcia for more.

Oh and there's golf. He loved it and taught intro golf for ACC for several years and served as a volunteer Marshal at Hancock golf course until the questionable decision was made to automate the course and eliminate volunteers.

Cisco is survived by his older Garcia siblings John (Aransas Pass) Santa (Dallas) his nieces and nephews and his madly devoted wife Anne Dunkelberg and her family.

Many of you will have much more to say about Narciso. An outdoor celebration of his life will be held at an April date TBD where we can all share those memories.

Donations in his memory are welcomed for Faith Food Pantry; Unstoppables Project; Austin Bat Cave; Amala Foundation; Safe Alliance; Hospice Austin Christopher House; and Communities in Schools of Central Texas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vcGF0ZW50bHlvLmNvbS9wYXRlbnQvMjAyMi8wMy9yZXF1aXJlZC1pbmZyaW5nZW1lbnQtZW5oYW5jZWQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What is Required for Willful Infringement and Enhanced Damages?,"by Dennis Crouch

Cisco Systems v. SRI Int’l. (Supreme Court 2022) [Petition for Writ of Certiorari]

In a new petition for writ of certiorari Cisco asks for guidance on whether enhanced damages under Section 284 require “egregious infringement behavior” or instead is it enough to find “deliberate or intentional infringement?”

The case has been up and down already. Here are the basics:

Jury Verdict : A jury sided with the patentee SRI over Cisco and awarded $23 million in damages and also found the infringement willful.

: A jury sided with the patentee SRI over Cisco and awarded $23 million in damages and also found the infringement willful. Enhanced Damages : Although the jury decided willfulness the award of enhanced damages is done by the judge. Here the district court relied upon the jury verdict and doubled the damage award as permitted by 35 U.S.C. § 284.

: Although the jury decided willfulness the award of enhanced damages is done by the judge. Here the district court relied upon the jury verdict and doubled the damage award as permitted by 35 U.S.C. § 284. Vacated on Appeal : In 2019 the Federal Circuit vacated — holding that the district court must focus on whether the infringer’s conduct was the “wanton malicious and bad-faith behavior required for willful infringement.”

: In 2019 the Federal Circuit vacated — holding that the district court must focus on whether the infringer’s conduct was the “wanton malicious and bad-faith behavior required for willful infringement.” 2nd-Chance No Enhanced Damages : On remand the district court recognized saw heightened standard and concluded that the evidence presented was not sufficient to meet this seemingly new requirement.

: On remand the district court recognized saw heightened standard and concluded that the evidence presented was not sufficient to meet this seemingly new requirement. Reversed on Appeal : Back on appeal in 2021 the Federal Circuit clarified that it had no intent to create a heightened requirement in its first opinion of the case: “it was not our intent to create a heightened requirement for willful infringement.” Thus the court reinstated the jury’s finding of willfulness and also reinstated the judicial award of enhanced damages.

: Back on appeal in 2021 the Federal Circuit clarified that it had no intent to create a heightened requirement in its first opinion of the case: “it was not our intent to create a heightened requirement for willful infringement.” Thus the court reinstated the jury’s finding of willfulness and also reinstated the judicial award of enhanced damages. Supreme Court: The new petition asks two questions “(1) Whether enhanced damages under 35 U.S.C. § 284 may be awarded absent a finding of egregious infringement behavior; and (2) Whether the court of appeals may award enhanced damages without first allowing the district court to exercise its discretion to decide that issue.“

The starting point for enhanced damages should begin with the statutory text found in 35 U.S.C. § 284. The text is simple and open ended and does not place any substantive limitations on the court about when damages may be enhanced: “the court may increase the damages up to three times the amount found or assessed.” § 284. Section 284 should be contrasted with Section 285 which allows for award of attorney fees to the prevailing party but only in “exceptional cases.”

The Supreme Court discussed enhanced damages in some depth in Halo Electronics Inc. v. Pulse Electronics Inc. 579 U.S. 93 (2016). In that case the Supreme Court rejected the Federal Circuit’s somewhat rigid two-part test for enhanced damages in favor of a more flexible approach coupled with district court discretion. The court’s “principal problem” with prior Federal Circuit precedent was “that it require[d] a finding of objective recklessness in every case before district courts may award enhanced damages.” In Halo the court noted that the objectively reckless standard meant that “many of the most culpable offenders” “deliberate wrongdoers” could be excluded from punishment by cobbling together an excuse after-the-fact. The court cited to its old precedent in Seymour v. McCormick 16 How. 480 (1854) – focusing on punishing the “wanton and malicious pirate” who intentionally steals the patentee’s business.

For the most part the old cases cited by the Supreme Court generally focus on “wanton and willful breaches” by the defendant as justification for enhanced damages. Thus we generally speak of enhanced damages only in terms of “willful infringement.” Some old cases used enhanced damages for full compensation but the Supreme Court in Halo concluded that those justifications were eliminated by the merger of Law & Equity and the availability of attorney fees under Section 285.

With this background the adjudged infringer here argues that it should not be held liable since – as the district court held “[t]here is no substantial evidence that Cisco’s infringement was ‘wanton malicious and bad-faith.’” The argument here was that the jury’s verdict of willfulness was wrong as a matter of law. On appeal the Federal Circuit concluded that a jury can find willfulness absent any showing of maliciousness or bad faith. Rather a jury verdict of willfulness can instead be supported by evidence of “deliberate or intentional infringement.” Here evidence of knowledge of the patent followed by induced infringement and then coupled with weak trial defenses were sufficient for a reasonable jury to find the infringement willful.

The enhanced damages does not mention willfulness but the courts have agreed that willfulness is a primary justification for enhancing damages. The ordinary procedure in these cases is that the judge permits the jury to determine willfulness and then the judge herself decides whether to enhance damages. The Cisco decision does not delve deeply into this but the Halo could be read as requiring that the judge find that the defendant was culpable beyond simply intentionally infringing. “The sort of conduct warranting enhanced damages has been variously described in our cases as willful wanton malicious bad-faith deliberate consciously wrongful flagrant or—indeed—characteristic of a pirate.”

In Cisco the district court identified additional reasons beyond just willful infringement: “Cisco’s litigation conduct its status as the world’s largest networking company its apparent disdain for SRI and its business model and the fact that Cisco lost on all issues during summary judgment and trial despite its formidable efforts to the contrary.” On appeal the Federal Circuit found those reasons sufficient for doubling the damage award even without a finding that the infringement was more egregious than your typical willful infringement.

[UPDATED on 4/3/2002 – Thanks to Prof. Tom Cotter for pointing out an error in my prior analysis.]

One note: the jury was instructed to only find willfulness upon “clear and convincing evidence” that the “defendant actually knew or should have known that its actions constituted an unjustifiably high risk of infringement of a valid and enforceable patent.”

MONDAY UPDATES:Wildfires in Eastland Brown other Big Country counties

New wildfires developed in Eastland and Brown counties Sunday while work continued to protect lives and property from fires that have burned more than 54000 acres in recent days.

The Texas A&M Forest Service reported early Sunday afternoon a 100-acre fire with 5% containment just northeast of Cross Plains and just inside the southwest corner of Eastland County.

The new fire named Blowing Basin Fire had grown to 250 acres (10% contained) as of about 3:15 p.m.

An evacuation order was issued at about 2:30 p.m. for residents in that area.

A grass fire also broke out Sunday in Brown County near U.S. Highway 67/84 and Farm to Market 585. Local agencies were responding and the fire as of press time had not been issued Forest Service support.

An evacuation order was issued just before 5 p.m. for property south of Lake Brownwood. The evacuation area is from Farm to Market 2632 south to Farm to Market 2125 and also up through 4 miles north of Farm to Market 2632 on Farm to Market 2125.

A fire also broke out near State Highway 6 between Cisco and Eastland (north of Interstate 20) prompting evacuations Sunday afternoon according to the Eastland Fire Department. The Forest Service dubbed the outbreak Cedar Mountain Fire (50 acres 0% containment as of 4:30 p.m.)

The Cedar Mountain Fire started about 3 p.m. on the north side of Interstate 20 and spread north to State Highway 6 and Cisco the Eastland FD reported. Local firefighters responded to the very active fire energized by high winds and low humidity. The fire jumped SH 6 and is burning towards the northwest.

The Snyder Volunteer Fire Department responded Sunday to a wildfire south of the city near the Lake J.B. Thomas. About 250-300 acres were burned.

Update on Eastland Complex fire

State agencies have added the Blowing Basin Fire to the Eastland Complex fires which includes three wildfires in Eastland and one in Brown County that were first reported late Thursday afternoon.

The Forest Service reported Sunday morning the following progress on the other Eastland Complex fires:

► Kidd Fire: 42333 acres 25% contained. Impacted areas include Carbon and Gorman. The fire has burned 142 structures but a differentiation between houses and outbuildings is not available yet.

► Wheat Fire: 7268 acres 40% contained. Fire crews are improving containment lines and mopping up. Impacted area is northwest of Rising Star.

► Oak Mott Fire: 4031 acres 60% contained. Impacted area is southeast of Rising Star.

► Walling Fire: 383 acres 100% contained. Impacted area is west of Nimrod.

The 8100-acre Crews Gap Fire that started early last week near State Highway 153 and the Runnels-Coleman county line is 90% contained as of Sunday afternoon the Forest Service said.

Arrest in Ranger Texas fire

A man has been arrested in connection with a fire that ravaged Ranger Thursday burning 11 buildings.

Robert James was arrested Saturday on five counts of state jail felony arson after warrants were issued according to a news release from the Ranger Police Department.

An investigation determined that the fire originated in the 400 block of South Marston the release said.

The investigation continues.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The Eastland County District Attorney's Office announced April 4 2022 that charges against James were dropped following review of a Texas Rangers investigation report into the Ranger fires.

Returning to its full scope following canceled and scaled-back events due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 Ogan said this year's offering is expected to be the biggest yet with more vendors than ever.

""It's free it's family friendly"" she said. ""We go to great extents to bring different local businesses and artisans and music acts and all of that kind of stuff in so that our residents can enjoy them.""

The growth the festival has seen in nine years is fitting for a project that began as the bank's way to encourage the revitalization of downtown Edmond. Ogan said the festival helps the bank show people that Edmond is a thriving town and hopes it persuades other Edmond natives like herself to stick around and raise their own families there.

""Now Edmond has this incredible vibe that has all these old established businesses that have been kind of the cornerstone of the Edmond community for so long and then that's next to all of these new trendy places"" she said.

Food trucks scheduled for Saturday range from barbecue tacos Jamaican and African cuisine to ice cream donuts and snow cones. Families can grab a bite and stroll along to the live music provided by Swim Fan Chelsea Days and Isaac McClung while browsing the goods sold by vendors selling everything from clothing and plants to books and coffee.

""People have a lot of options for where they spend their dollars and where they spend their time and so we try to make sure that Heard on Hurd is just the absolute best thing that they could be doing every third Saturday night"" Ogan said.",,,,,,,,,

The research arm of Maybank Investment Bank Bhd (Maybank IB Research) recapped that CMS has entered into four conditional sale and purchase agreements (SPAs) with Scomi Energy Services Bhd (SES) and its 100 per cent subsidiary Scomi Oiltools Sdn Bhd to acquire a total of 13 companies mainly involved in providing drilling fluids and drilling waste management services to the oil and gas industry.

“The proposed acquisition also includes a shop office in PJ used as Scomi’s office and inventories equipment and plant and machinery” Maybank IB Research noted.

“The total purchase consideration of RM21m will be contributed by CMS (75 per cent) and Local Capital Sdn Bhd (25 per cent) as shareholders of two acquirer companies.”

According to Maybank IB Research Scomi Oilfield and its operating units have been loss-making in the past three financial years ending June – US$12.1 million in FY19 (15M) US$57 million in FY20 US$14.8 million in FY21.

“Plans to turn-around were not disclosed. Scomi Oilfield group was also in a Net Liability position of US$38.6 million as of end-FY21. Its balance sheet details including group debt level were not available.”

Besides earnings risk the research arm is also concerned on the erosion to CMS group’s balance sheet as it consolidates the financials of the acquiree companies.

“Also unknown is the extend of equity injection (if any) required by CMS.”

Maybank IB Research gathered that the acquisition per CMS represents a strategic investment for it to expand and diversify into the global oil and gas sector.

“CMS also intends to leverage on Oilfield Group’s global presence in 15 markets across Asia the Middle East Europe and Africa to expand CMS’ clientele and into markets where the Oilfield Group has a presence.

The economic liberalization policies of the 1990s ushered in many international companies wanting to explore the Indian market with their brands. There was more competition and fear that local brands may suffer. However some brands were able to carve a niche for themselves. This is the story of one such iconic brand Thums Up.

Thums Up and the need to change

Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad

The earlier campaigns: “Happy days are here again with Thums Up” followed by “Food Friends and Thums Up” and “The Refreshing Cola” had done their part. Thums Up was at a crossroads again. Things needed to change with Pepsi on the way.

The drink Thums Up is more carbonated stronger and less sweet than the rest – a masculine/manly taste. The call was to move Thums Up away from the teens having fun to renowned action-driven men who would go to any extreme to sample the intense taste of Thums Up.

Evolution of “Taste the Thunder” campaign: Ashok Kurien of ad agency Ambience was stuck creatively. What campaign would help Thums Up stand up to the onslaught of the global juggernaut Pepsi? Exasperated he reached out to his friend Bugs Bhargava Krishna who was working at Contract Advertising and shuttling between Bangalore and Mumbai.

Ashok briefed Bugs. Bugs went back to Bangalore and drank many bottles of Thums Up. He liked the ‘Hit’ which Thums Up gave after every drink. At Bangalore Airport while returning he was having yet another Thums Up when a strong burp hit him - it was more thunderous bellow than a burp! Just then a Bangalore summer storm hit. The rumbling in the sky sparked the idea that drinking Thums Up was like tasting thunder. He wrote the line on a napkin and kept it with himself.

He met Ashok the next day and before presenting the line was building his case. The impatient Ashok said “ F&^% the preamble just tell me the line.” Bugs gave him the napkin. Ashok read it kept quiet and finally blurted out “you ba@$^#% you have done it!

And then they got themselves drunk in celebration.

The story behind the “Taste the Thunder” campaign: The following evening they met again with Elsie Nanji (co-founder and creative director) and her husband Hossi Nanji who composed the Thums Up jingle. They discussed many ideas for the television commercials and finally came up with 6 ideas for the launch of the campaign. It was lifestyle advertising but not too much more a way of life.

The stories revolved around situations where Thums Up was the winner. Which also tied to thunder as a round of applause. The team at Parle (which owned brand Thums Up then) was not convinced though. They questioned how a sound can be tasted. But Ramesh Chauhan of Parle decided to go ahead with the recommendation from Ambience.

Shantanu Sheorey a popular photographer had recently entered film production and he filmed the commercials. A secret not known to many is that Ashok wrote the Hindi translation – Toofani Thanda.

Insights into Competition: Ambience knew that Pepsi would follow a certain formula and adapt what works internationally. So Ashok studied Pepsi’s tactics and decided to pre-empt them in India. Thums Up took the following actions:

a) Since Pepsi was the ‘The Choice of the New Generation” they signed up Salman Khan for 10 years.

b) They did a taste test between Pepsi and Thums Up using Pooja Bhat and she selected Thums Up.

c) Since Pepsi leveraged Top Gun for its advertising Thums Up used the IAF fighter jets for a Top Gun-like television commercial.

Legacy of the campaign: The Thums Up campaign was so successful that the brand not only survived Pepsi’s entry into the Indian market but continued to maintain its market leadership.

Many years later Bugs was working with Saatchi & Saatchi and was in London. Bugs went to a pub and was introduced to an old gent and a young man. The older person was from McCann and was interviewing the young man.

Bugs offered to excuse himself but he was told to stay. After the interview the talk turned to India. The young man had visited Goa recently. Talking about India the older gent mentioned the problem McCann had in India. “There’s this bloody homegrown brand of Cola that is giving Coke hell in India. The brand just has too much traction.

Snowflake partners including systems integrators ISVs technology partners and third-party data providers are expected to leverage the capabilities of the new Snowflake Healthcare & Life Sciences Data Cloud.

Snowflake has unveiled a new data cloud service targeting the healthcare and life sciences space making good on the company’s stated strategy to increase its focus on specific vertical industries to maintain its rapid growth.

The new Healthcare & Life Sciences Data Cloud unveiled this week will provide healthcare and life sciences solutions for partners and enable them to develop their own solutions – both leveraging the interoperability and data sharing capabilities of the Snowflake platform.

The Snowflake announcement is indicative of efforts by leading IT vendors including Databricks and ServiceNow to build on their core systems with applications and services for vertical markets – creating opportunities for channel partners along the way.

The new Healthcare & Life Sciences Data Cloud centralizes integrates and exchanges high volumes of cross-cloud data at scale while ensuring high levels of data security and governance said Todd Crosslin healthcare and life sciences industry principal at Snowflake in an interview with CRN.

The new service is expected to attract healthcare providers seeking ways to leverage healthcare data including unstructured data such as clinical documents DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) files and radiology images to improve healthcare delivery and patient outcomes and enhance clinical and operational decision making.

Life sciences companies including pharmaceutical companies can use the service to integrate and analyze healthcare and clinical trial data for drug development purposes.

“There’s just tons and tons of unstructured data in our ecosystem” Crosslin said pointing to the healthcare and life science companies and organizations that Snowflake already works with including Anthem IQVIA Komodo Health Novartis Siemens Healthineers and Spectrum Health.

Snowflake sees vertical industries including healthcare and life sciences as key to helping the data cloud company maintain its rapid rate of growth. During a second quarter earnings call in August 2021 CEO Frank Slootman said Snowflake was putting increased emphasis on developing data services for clients in vertical industries such as financial services retail and consumer packaged goods manufacturing public sector education and advertising/media/entertainment.

Snowflake isn’t alone in targeting the healthcare space. Data lakehouse platform developer Databricks launched its Databricks Lakehouse for Healthcare and Life Sciences on March 9 targeting data management analytics and advanced AI use cases for disease prediction medical image classification biomarker discovery and other tasks according to the company.

That announcement was the latest of Databricks’ own growing portfolio of vertical industry-focused services following the debut of Databricks Lakehouse for Retail in January and Databricks Lakehouse for Financial Services in February.

Beyond the data management arena ServiceNow unveiled a strategy in 2020 to develop workflow solutions on its core Now Platform for specific industries including telecommunications banking and manufacturing.

In addition to tapping into the data sharing and collaboration capabilities of the Snowflake platform the Healthcare & Life Science Data Cloud leverages the Snowpark developer framework that developers data engineers and data scientists use to create data applications and manage pipeline and machine learning workflows.

“This is applying the workload capabilities of Snowflake to healthcare and life sciences” Crosslin said. “For our partners it’s really taking advantage of Snowpark and building solutions that are native to Snowflake. It’s a huge deal for our partners.”

The new service supports industry data governance and security requirements and standards including HIPAA and HITRUST and GxP compatibility audits. It supports the OHDSI OMOP data model and ecosystem according to Snowflake and can process and run HL7/FHIR messages.

Solutions and services developed and delivered by partners are a critical element of the Healthcare & Life Science Data Cloud Crosslin said. That includes systems integrators and consulting service partners such as Cognizant Deloitte Infosys and NTT Data who are already building solutions for their clients on the new platform.

Also benefiting from the new offering are ISVs and application developers in the vendor’s Powered by Snowflake program including Health Catalyst Strata and IQVIA who are building software – including analytics-as-a-service applications – that run on the Healthcare & Life Science Data Cloud.

The Healthcare & Life Science Data Cloud also enables third-party healthcare and life sciences data providers in the Snowflake Data Marketplace including Compile Equifax Invitae and SameSky Health who can market data without the need for data copying and data movement. And Snowflake’s technology partners including machine learning technology providers Dataiku and H2o.ai and data analytics tool supplier ThoughtSpot also work with data provided through the new cloud service.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvd3RvZ2Vlay5jb20vMjkyMDc2L2hvdy1kby15b3Utdmlldy1zc2wtY2VydGlmaWNhdGUtZGV0YWlscy1pbi1nb29nbGUtY2hyb21lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to View SSL Certificate Details in Google Chrome,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvd3RvZ2Vlay5jb20vMjkyMDc2L2hvdy1kby15b3Utdmlldy1zc2wtY2VydGlmaWNhdGUtZGV0YWlscy1pbi1nb29nbGUtY2hyb21lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vZmFyb3V0bWFnYXppbmUuY28udWsvZGFtbmluZy1pbml0aWFsLXJldmlld3Mtb2YtYm9iLWR5bGFuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The damning initial reviews of Bob Dylan,"The damning initial reviews of Bob Dylan

Come gather round critics who once condemned and admit that you were wrong back then. Yes indeed Bob Dylan may have still only been a young whipper snapping vagabond when he was heralded as the Voice of a Generation after the release of his second and third record but the uptake on the master songwriter was very slow to say the least and sometimes it was critically cruel.

When Dylan released his self-titled debut album in 1962 it sold 5000 copies in its first year just about enough to break even. He had been discovered a year earlier by John Hammond who said “Dylan was a born rebel and I figured that you know Dylan could capture an audience of kids that Columbia had lost years before.”

Having returned from service in World War II Hammond had grown disillusioned by bebop and other scenes that seemed at least to him to miss the cognizant point of reflecting the horrors that the world had seen and the introspective reverberations. This set about a musical itch in Hammond that was only scratched when in 1961 he heard the very singular folk stylings of a scruffy young kid in a session for Carolyn Hester.

He signed this weird new anti-star onto Columbia in a heartbeat and he was ridiculed just as quickly with fellow executives referring to the man who change the world as simply: ‘Hammond’s Folly’. In fact as Hammond recalled: “The vice president of Columbia Records said just right off the most horrible thing he’d ever heard in his life” he said. “Hammond’s folly.”

He would go on to produce the seismic singles of ‘Blownin’ in the Wind’ and ‘A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall’ and in 1968 he remarked: “What I wanted to do with Bobby was just to get him to sound in the studio as natural just as he was in person and have that extraordinary personality come thru…. After all he’s not a great harmonica player and he’s not a great guitar player and he’s not a great singer. He just happens to be an original. And I just wanted to have that originality come through.”

That sense of originality took a while to dawn on many critics. However importantly aside from being an original Hammond had also put his finger on a telling aspect of Dylan’s character that would later be revered. “He had a good sound and a point of view and an idea. He was very disenchanted with the social system” Hammond once said. “I encouraged him to put all his hostility on tape because I figured this was the way really to get to the true Bob Dylan.”

Critics however still couldn’t get past the “seemingly untrained voice frankly nasal” side of things and it took Joan Baez giving his songs a more palatable approach that finally began to bring him to the attention of the critics and audiences alike. Once that hurdle was ascended the penny finally dropped. As Leonard Cohen eventually opined when Dylan received his Nobel Prize: “To me [the Nobel] is like pinning a medal on Mount Everest for being the highest mountain.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndwdHYuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQveWUtbm8tbG9uZ2VyLXBlcmZvcm1pbmctYXQtZ3JhbW15c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ye no longer performing at Grammys,"NEW YORK (AP) — Ye will not be performing at the Grammys this year.

(WDAM) - With internet access becoming more of a necessity for households Comcast is offering a way for Mississippi residents to receive discounted internet services though a federal program.

The federal government’s Affordable Connectivity Program is providing Mississippi’s low-income households internet services.

“The program provides eligible low-income households in Mississippi a credit of $30 a month toward the cost of any Xfinity internet service including our internet essentials as well as our Xfinity mobile service” said Alex Horwitz vice president of Comcast public relations.

“So in some cases the $30 a month credit could provide free internet to a household”

For those who are interested in the program call 1-800-COMCAST or visit its website at xfinity.com/free to see about qualifications.

“You know being connected sets students up to success in the classroom and it sets adults up to get whatever resources they need including if they are working from home” Horwitz said.

“The pandemic showed just how many people didn’t have that reliable home connection so we saw cases where students would have to go to a Starbucks or a McDonald’s because they didn’t have a connection at home”

The company also has another program called Internet Essentials which has connected about 10 million Americans to internet at home.

“Between Internet Essentials and this ACP program there’s a lot going on for folks that want to get connected” said Horwitz.

According to Horwitz the Essentials program is $9.95 a month for qualifying households and has been instrumental for families and students getting connected to the internet.

“It’s crucial that everyone has the online resources they need to excel in today’s economy” Horwitz said. “We focused heavily on connecting those households that didn’t have internet access and so that’s why today’s news is really critical for Hattiesburg and Mississippi residents across the board.”

YOUNGSTOWN Ohio — BroadbandOhio is awarding more than $232 million in grants to 11 internet service providers to bring affordable high-speed internet to nearly 100000 households in Ohio that don’t have access to reliable connectivity.

The Ohio Residential Broadband Expansion Grant Program will fund 33 broadband expansion projects in 31 counties including Trumbull and Columbiana counties. The awards jointly announced Friday by Gov. Mike DeWine and Lt. Gov. Jon Husted will fund projects to bring high-speed internet access to more than 43000 Ohio homes they said.

As part of the grant process a number of providers have committed to fund 71 additional projects to serve some 52000 households in another 31 counties.

“High-speed internet is no longer a luxury – it’s a critical necessity for everything from school to work to health care” DeWine said in a statement. “We must end the digital divide in our state and by giving our rural and unserved areas access to affordable and reliable high-speed internet we will enhance economic growth in these communities and bring about new opportunities for residents.”

Comcast Cable Communications LLC will receive $9419150 for a project benefiting 2466 households in Belmont Columbiana Harrison and Jefferson counties according to state documents. Residents will have access to speeds of up to one gigabit download and 35 megabit upload.

By using hybrid fiber coaxial technology Comcast will be able to scale the project to support future expansion to support consumer and data demands.

Trumbull County will benefit from two projects. Spectrum will receive $262609 to provide 67 households with access to Spectrum Internet Gig service with speeds of up to one gigabit download and 500 megabit upload.

Additionally $142290.59 awarded to Windstream Western Reserve will benefit 29 households by providing access to Windstream WR service with speeds of up to one gigabit download and one gigabit upload.

Both Trumbull projects use fiber-to-the-premises technology which will enable both providers to scale the projects.

Mahoning County received no awards from the initiative. According to a service and infrastructure analysis conducted by the Eastgate Regional Council of Governments as part of its broadband feasibility study published in June 2021 Youngstown was the second worst connected city among the state’s mid and large cities in terms of at-home access.

According to the report 3238 Mahoning County households or 47.5% of total households have no broadband such as cable fiber optic or DSL.

Statewide all of the projects receiving funding will provide service access of at least 25 megabit per second (Mbps) download and 3 Mbps upload in areas that don’t have a provider that can supply service at this speed according to the release.

The average construction time for the new broadband projects is two years with some areas expected to receive improved internet access in 12 months.

“These partnerships will greatly expand internet access across the state and enhance the lives of tens of thousands of Ohioans” said Lydia Mihalik director of the Ohio Department of Development. “These awards highlight our commitment to ensuring all Ohioans are able to participate in the 21st-century economy.”

In a color-coded map released March 1 by BroadbandOhio and InnovateOhio Columbiana County was shown to have the worst internet accessibility in the three-county region. According to the map 67% of the populated area and 28% of households do not have access to a 25Mbps download/3 Mbps upload minimum. Of the 48611 households in the county 13739 are in areas that offer below the 25/3 Mbps minimum and 9123 can’t get better than 10/1 Mbps.

In Trumbull 39% of the populated area and 13% of houses do not have access to the minimum speed. Of the 96219 households in the county 12670 are below that benchmark and more than 6000 don’t have access to more than 10/1 Mbps.

Twenty-seven percent of the populated area in Mahoning County and 10% of households don’t have access to internet speeds of 25 Mbps download/3 Mbps upload. Of the 114165 households in Mahoning County 11817 are in areas that only have access to speeds below that 25/3 Mbps minimum and 46% of those households are in areas where speeds are below 10/1 Mbps.

The matter went legal after Ohio's L'uva Bella Winery was awarded the trademark to the title in 2019. The musician's estate — which is locked in multiple court procedures as a result of his death without a will — claimed ""likelihood of confusion"" and ""false suggestion of a connection"" meant the trademark should be canceled.

""The estate protects the intellectual property Prince created during his lifetime including his image and the trademark 'Purple Rain' which is strongly associated with him"" last year's estate filing read (via Rolling Stone). ""'Purple Rain' is Prince's most famous song album tour movie etc. and there can be no doubt that 'Purple Rain' signifies Prince.""

While the estate — led by Comerica Bank which was appointed to oversee the legal proceedings involving Prince's assets — had asked for the trademark's termination without trial lawyers for L'uva recently responded with a new argument against it: There can be no confusion because Prince didn't drink alcohol.

""To the extent Prince was famous he was equally famous for his disdain of alcohol"" read the new filing with the U.S. Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. ""Prince was a teetotaler who despised alcohol. Prince never lent his name to any product or enterprise during his lifetime and never endorsed or promoted any products let alone any products bearing the name 'Purple Rain.' The fans of Prince knowledgeable about his beliefs and views would never associate an alcohol-containing product with the artist.""

The lawsuit is yet another demonstration of what can go wrong when an artist dies without a will. For now the Purple Rain wine range remains on sale at $7.99 a bottle with variants including Tri-Blend Sangria and the award-winning Concord.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Will Shut-offs Follow? (Published 2022),"When the pandemic led to lockdowns that triggered huge job losses people in New York City and the surrounding region accumulated a mountain of debt. For many that included utility bills. Residents of New York and New Jersey owe the staggering sum of more than $2.4 billion to utility companies.

Now those companies are using the threat of shut-offs to collect for the first time in two years and advocates fear that struggling utility customers will have to choose between heat and electricity and other necessities like food and medicine.

At the start of the pandemic two years ago as millions of unemployed Americans were unable to pay their bills state-imposed moratoriums generally barred utilities from shutting off power. But most states including New York have lifted those restrictions in recent months. New Jersey’s moratorium one of the last in effect expired on March 15.

In New York advocates have pleaded with Gov. Kathy Hochul and state lawmakers to use federal pandemic aid to bail out residents who cannot pay. Without a bailout the state faces “the largest tidal wave of shut-offs in New York history” said Richard Berkley executive director of the Public Utility Law Project an advocacy group.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vcGVla3NraWxsaGVyYWxkLmNvbS80NTg0L2dvdmVybm1lbnQvcGx1Z2dpbmctaW50by1lbGVjdHJpYy1iaWxsLXN0YmlsaXR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Plugging Into Electric Bill Stability – Peekskill Herald,"The whopping Con Edison electric bills customers have been hit with this winter have generated sparks as well as outrage at the utility. About 5000 Peekskill residents who have Westchester Power supplying their electricity haven’t been subjected to sticker shock – and are reaping the benefits of having a fixed electric rate. Because Peekskill has been participating in Westchester Power since 2019 residents can opt-in to the 100 percent Green Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) program.

Three years ago the city joined other Westchester municipalities in a bulk buying program similar to a wholesale buying club like BJ’s or Costco to negotiate a stable competitive price for the supply of electricity by pooling consumer power. This program decreases the carbon footprint and gives residents a stable fixed cost for electricity supply. The contract which Westchester Power negotiated with Constellation New Energy for fixed rates making energy bills more predictable lasts through June of this year. A new contract is being negotiated now between the two entities. A customer using Con Edison to supply electricity saw an average rate in January of 16.9 cents per kilowatt hour – versus Westchester Power’s 7.41 cents per kilowatt hour for the same period.

New residents to Peekskill receive a letter from Westchester Power offering them the choice to opt in to the Westchester Power plan. Some residents who were given the opportunity in April of 2019 when the city joined Westchester Power may have opted out of the plan. They are eligible to opt back in. If a customer is using another supplier to provide energy they will see the name of the provider on page 2 of their Con Edison bill in the section under Your Supply Charges. If they are using Westchester Power they will see the name Constellation New Energy in the area that says Your Energy Supplier. If they are using Con Edison to deliver the supply that area will be empty.

A key component of Westchester Power which 145000 residents in the county are now getting their electricity supplied through is the stability against the fluctuating market. “It’s not primarily a savings program” said Dan Welsh director of Westchester Power. The non profit Sustainable Westcheter runs Westchester Power. “Think of it as an insurance policy cap” said Welsh. “There’s no fee to opt out unlike some other energy suppliers” said Welsh. He said it’s important to check if you’re on a contract with a supplier because there may be a fee to break the contract.

When the city was exploring Westchester Power as an option for Peekskill residents in March 2019 an informational program was hosted at the Neighborhood Center. A video of the program where viewers learned the difference between supply and delivery and how to decipher their bills from Con Edison is here. The delivery portion of getting electricity involves the poles wires and billing. Con Edison continues to handle that.

This unique way of working with the unconscious dynamics in family or group systems or “fields” can often lead to a great amount of insight and healing—for a variety of issues—in a short period of time.

Constellations allow the subtle or hidden bonds feelings and entanglements inside and between people to be graphically represented through a natural phenomenon called “morphic resonance” as explained by biologist Rupert Sheldrake. This allows for these patterns to be seen and felt consciously which can help repair ruptures in the psychic and social fabric.

Constellation facilitator Jack Blackwell explains: “Family constellations combines our spiritual nature and its inherent power with psychology in a way that is allowing people to experience profound life-changing shifts at a drastically accelerated pace compared to conventional therapies. The importance of a more rapid healing modality at this time on our planet cannot be overstated.”

The modality was founded by the late German therapist Bert Hellinger who drew on his experience as a seminarian living amongst the Zulu people of southern Africa and their strong emphasis on ancestral influences and inclusion as well as on a variety of established schools of therapy to formulate constellations work.

A recorded constellation session shows Hellinger in a group setting working with the mother of a so-called “schizophrenic” child. Over the course of the session the mother uncovers the deeper family dynamics and losses that underlie her child’s—and the whole family’s—suffering.

In a 2002 video constellations facilitator Emily Waymire offers an introduction to understanding constellations work showing a group of students the “schizophrenic” family system session as well as another in which a Native American woman from Washington State explores a tragic event that occurred in her grandparents’ generation. Both sessions movingly uncover the emotions that were hidden or blocked when the events took place and allow for a high degree of resolution as understanding is achieved and connection restored.

Waymire describes what constellations reveal about the “schizophrenic” dynamic within families:

“There’s really no such thing as a schizophrenic person… [but] there are schizophrenic family souls. And one person is brought into service to bring that split to light . . . And so this is one of the reasons why you see in a family so often: ‘Well gosh you know all the rest of us are fine what’s wrong with her?’ And so one person or that one sibling or child is also often then the one who’s excluded. Because they’re ‘problematic’ they’re a ‘pain in the butt’ they’ve got ‘problems in their lives’ and they feel like a ‘drain on us.’ And yet when you do this work you quickly in your body start to understand that that person in the family is the one carrying the load.

“And then when other people even if it’s just one other person in the family starts to see that and to include that person back in the family and back in their heart that then the whole family has peace. And so it’s no longer about you know this one person is carrying the whole burden.

“And in fact that’s one of the Orders of Love that Bert Hellinger found . . . that each member of the family soul has responsibility for how that family soul operates.”

At the time of writing Copart had listed five damaged Toyota GR 86s up for auction as well as a single 2022 BRZ. The damage sustained to the cars varies from totally destroyed and unrepairable to some that may need a few new components to return to the streets.

Watch Also: How Much Power Does The Toyota GR 86 Actually Have?

One 2022 GR 86 that will never return to the streets is a dark blue example located in San Bernadino California. It has suffered extensive damage across the front rear both sides and the roof indicating that it rolled multiple times. Another example to have suffered quite a lot of damage is a black GR 86 in North Boston Massachusetts. It was clearly involved in a front-end collision with the hood and bumper badly damaged.

A bright blue example with very similar damage will soon be offered up for auction in Tampa South Florida. Like the car in North Boston it has extensive front end damage and has 2905 miles (4675 km) on the clock.

A black GR 86 is available in Grantville Pennsylvania. Viewed from the front it appears perfectly fine but both rear quarter panels have suffered damage. The damage done to the driver’s side rear is particularly bad with the wheel and tire destroyed indicating some serious suspension issues. Similarly there is also a blue GR 86 listed in Portland South Oregan with damage to the driver’s side rear quarter panel and wheel.

As for the sole 2022 Subaru BRZ listed by Copart it can be found in Jacksonville South Florida and has a wrecked front end and badly damaged driver’s side.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Much of the plant had been torn down but the portion that remained was in rough shape. Trees were growing inside the building and pieces of the roof were falling in.

Despite that Eadon executive director of what was then known as the Tuscarawas County Port Authority showed the plant to the acting president and chairman of the board of Wisconsin-based Plymouth Foam. They wore hardhats because of the dangers from the roof.

Eadon recalled that the acting president did not like what he saw.

The chairman of the board however had a different view.

""The fellow that was chairman of the board turned around and he said you know what I can see it. I can see a manufacturing plant here"" Eadon recalled. ""I said I can too. I said I think we fix the roof we get rid of the trees that are growing inside the building we put in new HVAC new electric feed.

""The chairman asked if we were willing to lease it to them and I said absolutely. We would renovate it.""

The port authority borrowed money from the county commissioners and the state and made about $2.4 million in renovations to the dilapidated factory building.

Within two years Plymouth Foam bought the building for $3.2 million.

When the port authority bought the plant in 2005 no one was working there. Now it is occupied by Plymouth Foam and Progressive Foam Technologies and about 150 people are working there.

Eadon who will be retiring on March 28 from what is now known as the Tuscarawas Economic Development Corp. sat down recently with The T-R to look back on his 20-year career with the agency.

How Harry Eadon got started

Eadon and his family first came to Tuscarawas County in 1994 when he got a job at the old Handy & Harmon plant in Dover (now Meteor Sealing Systems). When the plant closed he had the opportunity to go to work for Handy & Harmon in Indiana but his family wanted to stay in Dover. He found other work.

In 2002 he was offered the chance to become the first executive director of the Tuscarawas County Port Authority. The organization was given the task of developing a golf course/hotel/conference center near Dundee but that project soon fell through.

The agency then shifted its focus to the old Reeves Mill in Dover which closed in the 1990s.

When Eadon took a tour of the facility he recalled that only four people were employed there four security guards. It was also home to lots of pigeons. The plant was owned by AK Steel which was asking $4.8 million for the property.

""When we took a tour I talked with the person that was in charge of real estate for AK Steel and I talked with him about the price. He said well you know what just make us an offer"" Eadon said.

Eadon offered the man $1.4 million and he agreed.

They closed on the deal on Dec. 31 2002 and the port authority had a lease agreement by mid-January 2003 with Owens-Corning which leased 252500 square feet in the building for five years. The rent the company paid the port authority paid for all renovations at the plant now known as the Reeves Mill Business Park.

Later Deflecto moved in. When Owen-Corning moved out Deflecto was in the process of expanding. It now leases almost 300000 square feet of the building. Extreme Trailers occupies much of the rest of the building.

About 225 people now work at the Reeves Mill Business Park.

Bringing change to Gnadenhutten

Eadon next turned his attention to the old Alsco plant in Gnadenhutten.

The plant was built in 1948 and housed Alsco-Anaconda for about 50 years until the company closed in 1997. About 6.7 acres at the site was listed as a Super Fund site in 1986 by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The area was cleaned up and delisted in 2001.

When Eadon first visited the plant it was owned by BP.

He toured the abandoned facility with the mayor of Gnadenhutten and a representative from BP.

""We talked about what we might be able to do to help them market it and they said we're terrible at this. We buy property. We're terrible at selling it. How about if we sell it to you?"" Eadon recalled.

""I said I have a dollar in my pocket. I could pay you a dollar for it. No we'd probably have to have more than that. I said how much more?""

BP wanted a couple of million dollars.

""I said it would be a hard sell. We went back and forth for five or six months. They finally came back to me and said we liked what you did at the Reeves Mill. We think you would be the right partner to do something with. So they sold it to us for $1.""

Soon after some executives from Plymouth Foam came from Wisconsin. They shared a facility with Progressive Foam in Beach City but they needed a place of their own. Eadon took them to Newcomerstown where one of their competitors Pacemaker Plastics was located.

He also took them to the Alsco plant but they weren't interested.

Two months later Plymouth Foam bought Pacemaker Plastics. Pacemaker had two plants in Newcomerstown but Plymouth officials knew they needed to be consolidated into one location. They were looking for 100000 square feet of space but none was available in Tuscarawas County.

In the winter of 2005 Plymouth executives called Eadon to set up another tour. But on their way to Ohio their plane crashed killing the two brothers who owned the company.

It was several months later when Eadon met with the acting president and chairman of the board.

""We looked around Newcomerstown"" he said. ""There was nothing nothing that big. And they didn't want to build because they didn't have time to build. So I took them to Gnadenhutten.""

And the deal was made.

Helping out with ODOT ... and more

Eadon was also involved in redeveloping the old Ohio Department of Transportation property on W. High Avenue in New Philadelphia. With a $700000 Clean Ohio grant his agency was able to tear down the buildings and abate the asbestos. Buffalo Wild Wings and a car wash are now located there.

The economic development corporation is now working on redeveloping the old Howden Buffalo plant in New Philadelphia. The plant closed in June 2014 and in 2020 Howden donated it to the agency.

Eadon and his successor Marla Akridge envision it as a mixed commercial and residential area.

He said three developers have already expressed interest in it.

Eadon is now looking forward to retirement.

He will be 69 in a couple of months. He and his wife Lorrie would like to spend more time with their three grandson and do some boating. Eadon said he will also have more time to umpire softball and referee football games which he enjoys.

He credits God for his success in economic development.

""The things that we've done some of them almost seem accidentally as I look back on the last 20 years"" Eadon said. ""They really do seem sort of accidentally but it's not. It's all the Lord that's been driving this and opening doors.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpYXNhdC5jb20vc2Ftc3VuZy1nYWxheHktYTUzLTVnLWFyb3VuZC1ycy0zNWstYXJyaXZlcy1pbi1pbmRpYS1uZXh0LXdlZWstMjI5Mjk5OS_SAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zaWFzYXQuY29tL3NhbXN1bmctZ2FsYXh5LWE1My01Zy1hcm91bmQtcnMtMzVrLWFycml2ZXMtaW4taW5kaWEtbmV4dC13ZWVrLTIyOTI5OTkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Samsung Galaxy A53 5G around Rs 35K arrives in India next week,"New Delhi: Samsung India is set to announce Galaxy A53 5G its first 2022 Galaxy A smartphone on March 21.

Those participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will find many items that are eligible for purchase at Costco. All Costco locations accept EBT cards and adhere to the state’s laws on what can be purchased. Even if you don’t have an EBT card specifically whatever you load your SNAP benefits onto can be used at Costco. Buying at Costco specifically can be beneficial since purchasing items in bulk can save you more money than getting them at the local grocery store. Here’s a look at the best items you can buy at Costco with an EBT or similar card.

Having won admiring reviews for her role of marketing boss Sylvie Grateau – who frequently butts horns with younger American marketing executive Emily Cooper played by Lily Collins – Leroy-Beaulieu is set to come to the attention of a whole new audience with a role in the fifth season of the British royal drama. Both are Netflix shows.

The Crown‘s next season will focus on tumultuous events in the 1990s when the headlines were dominated by the collapsing marriages of three of the Queen’s four children and even a fire at Windsor Castle the Queen’s weekend residence where she later spent lockdown.

Leroy-Beaulieu told the UK’s Mail on Sunday “It was a very small thing but it was a lot of fun and I was so so happy to be in it. Every episode is like a little film on its own. It’s crazily well written.”

The newspaper reported that the French actress’s role is that of Monique Ritz widow of Charles Ritz who sold his family-named Paris hotel to Mohamed Al Fayed in 1979. It was this hotel where Diana Princess of Wales and Dodi Fayed Mohamed’s son spent their final evening before the car crash that killed them both in August 1997 a tragedy that plunged the UK into mourning and tested the public’s affection for its monarchy in unprecedented fashion.

Leroy-Beaulieu who made her screen debut in 1983 in Roger Vadim’s film Surprise Party also starred as Catherine Barneville in the Netflix series Call My Agent! She told the newspaper of the similar casting offers she had received since “I have received a lot of offers but I have been lucky enough to be able to turn them down because they lacked imagination.”

The Crown’s fifth season will see some new faces in familiar roles including Imelda Staunton taking over from Olivia Colman as the Queen The Affair’s Dominic West as Prince Charles Elizabeth Debicki as Princess Diana Jonathan Pryce as Prince Philip and Jonny Lee Miller as British Prime Minister John Major.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocm9uaWNsZWxpdmUuY28udWsvbmV3cy9ub3J0aC1lYXN0LW5ld3MvbXVtLWF0dGFja2VkLXdvbWVuLXdpdGgtaXJvbi0yMzQzNzYxMtIBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocm9uaWNsZWxpdmUuY28udWsvbmV3cy9ub3J0aC1lYXN0LW5ld3MvbXVtLWF0dGFja2VkLXdvbWVuLXdpdGgtaXJvbi0yMzQzNzYxMi5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,North Tyneside mum attacked women with iron after hearing them talk outside her window,"Something went wrong please try again later.

A North Tyneside mum attacked two women with an iron after hearing them talk outside her window.

Leanne Geddes carried out the violent and unprovoked attack on April 13 2019 leaving one of the women with permanent scarring. Newcastle Crown Court heard that the 42-year-old used an iron as a weapon before kicking into one of the women as she lay motionless on the ground.

Geddes of Castle Square Backworth North Tyneside appeared at Newcastle Crown Court on Friday to be sentenced for two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. She had pleaded guilty to the charges at a previous hearing.

Jemima Stephenson prosecuting said at around 3.30am Geddes ""heard voices"" outside her house of two women who had been out socialising with friends. Geddes shouted at them from her upstairs window and the women came closer into her garden so they could hear what she was saying.

It was then that Geddes ran out of her house armed with an iron and hit one of the women on the forehead with it. The force of the blow knocked the woman to the ground and Geddes laid into her with kicks.

She also swung the iron at the second woman which also connected with the back of her head. The court heard that ""considerable injury"" was caused to one of the women and she had to be treated for a ""V-shaped laceration to the left side of her forehead"".

The victims fled to a nearby address and the police and an ambulance were called. In interview Geddes said she had thought she was ""under attack"" after an earlier unconnected incident involving her autistic daughter.

Penny Hall defending said Geddes had entered guilty pleas and had not committed any further offences since 2019. She said she has mental health difficulties and is also a carer for her daughter.

The court heard that the reason for the delay in sentencing was that soon after the offences were committed Geddes had to undergo treatment for cancer. As a result of her treatment Ms Hall said Geddes' ""memory is vague"" as it is affected by her medication.

""In respect of the circumstances of the offending the defendant's memory is vague her memory is affected by her treatment and medication"" she said ""A female had come into her garden and she accepts she committed the offences"" she added.

Sentencing Geddes Miss Recorder Davies said the assault was ""very dangerous"" and the injuries were ""considerable"" but called the defendant a ""very vulnerable individual"".

Geddes was given a 10 month prison sentence suspended for 12 months and must complete up to 20 rehabilitation days. She was also made subject of a three month electronic curfew and must pay a total of £600 compensation.",,,,,,

PEAK — CSX Railroad has given Palmetto Trail hikers another camping option along the 10.7-mile-long Peak to Prosperity passage.

The latest campsite brings the total along this passage to five. Located near Trestle 20 the campsite can be accessed by car from the closest parking area located at Kiblers Bridge Road about a mile away.

The primitive campsite was constructed by Palmetto Trail staff and will be maintained by the active volunteers who assist with many tasks along the Palmetto Trail and the Peak to Prosperity Passage in particular. Charles Weber along with Furman Miller laid out the passage. Weber continues to lead a group of volunteers that meets every Tuesday to keep the trail in good shape.

Set slightly off the trail but within sight of it the camping area has two campsites each with a picnic table fire pit ring and the all-important flat space to pitch a tent. There are no facilities so water must be brought in and waste carried out in accordance with Leave No Trace principles.

The campsite is ideal for those hiking some distance since the Newberry area is mid-way between the coastal terminus of the Palmetto Trail and the mountain terminus in Oconee County. However the site is also great for local families in the Newberry-Chapin-Little Mountain-Columbia area who want to experience camping but don’t want to travel very far to do it.

The CSX transportation network provides rail and intermodal services to some of the largest population centers in the U.S. and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The company notes that nearly two-thirds of Americans live within CSX’s service territory. The company’s Community Service Grants “assist organizations that make a strong quantifiable impact on their greater communities.”

Mary Roe executive director of the Palmetto Trail notes that “the Palmetto Trail is a great fit with CSX’s sustainability mission. Rail transportation is the most fuel-efficient way to transport goods on land and hiking is the most beneficial way to move a person. CSX is committed to engaging on issues related to sustainability and supporting sustainable developments and we are very grateful they chose to partner with us on this project.”

The Peak to Prosperity Passage begins (or ends depending on which way you’re heading) in Fairfield County at the Alston trailhead just across the Broad River from Newberry County. The Broad River trestle provides spectacular views from the 1100-foot-long bridge especially when bald eagles soar. Across the river in Newberry County the rail-trail skirts Peak and cuts an easy swath through piedmont forest with an additional 14 wooden trestles available to cross the meandering Crims Creek. German immigrants settled in the 1730s explaining why the area is known as the Dutch (an anglicized version of Deutsch — German) Fork.

The Palmetto Trail is one of 16 cross-state trails in the country constructed as a series of passages which together will stretch approximately 500 miles from the mountains to the sea when all sections of the trail are connected.",,,,,,,,,

Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) the custodian of cricket laws recently imposed a complete ban on the use of saliva while announcing its amended 2022 code which will come into effect in October this year.The MCC reasoned that applying saliva had no impact on the ball's movement according to its research.""I don't think so (permanent saliva ban will hamper the performance of the swing bowlers)"" Cummins himself a pacer told reporters ahead of Australia's third Test against Pakistan.""I don't think it has made a huge effect as big as we might have thought it would.

""I don't think it has made a huge effect as big as we might have thought it would.

Australia's captain Pat Cummins celebrates with teammates after dismssing Pakistan's Fawad Alam during the fifth and final day of the second Test cricket match in Karachi.

Cummins made history to become the first pace bowler to captain the Australian Test team aside from a one-off cameo from Ray Lindwall in 1956.

However his mettle was quickly tested when Test legend Langer resigned from his post after Cricket Australia refused to back him beyond the upcoming home T20 World Cup.

'If media reports are correct several senior players and a couple of support staff don't support me moving forward and it is now apparent the CA board ... are also keen to see the team move in another direction. I respect that decision' Langer said via email in his resignation.

That prompted a wave of backlash against Cummins and the senior players in the Australian team with former pace bowler Mitchell Johnson labelling Cummins 'disrespectful' and 'gutless'.

Johnson added the Test skipper had 'failed his first big test as captain pretty miserably'.

A host of former players lined up to defend Langer with former spinner Brad Hogg saying the West Australian had suffered 'disgraceful treatment'.

Langer's former Test opening partner Matthew Hayden also came at Cummins from the back fence.

'And now we hear Pat Cummins saying ""This is a high-performance environment we all go through a high performance review"". I'm sorry Pat but that's garbage … this just reeks of being orchestrated' he said.

Cummins has been handed a number of challenges in his short tenure as Australian Test captain including the resignation of Langer and a challenging and historic tour of Pakistan.

Now as the Aussies prepare to battle the Pakistan Test side for a 1-0 series victory Cummins has opened up on how the Langer firestorm impacted him as a person and as a captain.

'I don't think it was a pleasant situation for anyone to be honest but in terms of what I could have done differently – I'm not quite sure' Cummins said.

Lovely way to spend a day off here in Lahore. Great morning on the course. ⛳️ pic.twitter.com/GgFrXTZExt — Pat Cummins (@patcummins30) March 18 2022

'I'm not a decision-maker. I think I was probably perceived to have a bigger part in that as a captain than [the reality of] just giving feedback [from his players].

'I hadn't copped too much bad press before so I think it was a really good learning experience.

'If you try and spend your life looking to please everyone you please no one.

'It gave me clarity on what my role is and that is to try and do what's best for our team and our environment but also what I think is best for Australian cricket.

'It really strengthened my beliefs in what I think is right and who I should listen to and it made me think of where my responsibilities lie.'

Meanwhile Pakistan's marathon batting defence in the drawn second Test match against Australia has raised the hopes of head coach Saqlain Mushtaq ahead of the series decider.

Australia´s first tour to Pakistan since 1998 started off with a tame drawn first test at Rawalpindi where the Pindi Cricket Stadium was rated as 'below average' by the ICC. But the second Test was a thriller and now Saqlain said the epic draw had increased the confidence of Pakistan to surprise Australia.

'Before this series our mission was to beat Australia and win the series' Saqlain said. 'It´s not that we are just saying it we will try our best and produce a result in our favor in Lahore.'

Following the Test series the two nations will do battle in limited overs cricket with all matches now to be held in Lahore on the advice of the government.

On Friday Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed the minister of interior announced the three ODIs and one Twenty20 match will be played in Lahore instead of Rawalpindi.

'Due to political activities and scenarios we have decided it would be better to have the matches in Lahore as there will be a lot of movement and activities in Islamabad and Pindi during the time frame the matches are scheduled' he said.

The ODIs are scheduled to be held on March 29 31 and April 2 followed by the T20 on April 4.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzbWF4LnR2L2NyaWNrZXQvaXRlbS85NjQ1MS1jdW1taW5zLWNvbmZpcm1zLXVuY2hhbmdlZC1hdXN0cmFsaWEtbGluZS11cC1mb3ItdGhpcmQtdGVzdC1hZ2FpbnN0LXBha2lzdGFu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cummins confirms unchanged Australia line-up for third Test against Pakistan,"Australia skipper Pat Cummins has confirmed they will go in with an unchanged line-up for the series-deciding third Test against Pakistan in Lahore starting on Monday.

The tourists backed spinners Nathan Lyon and Mitchell Swepson despite both bowling in excess of 50 overs in the second innings of the second Test which ended in a draw on Wednesday.

Conditions are expected to be similar in Lahore as they were in the previous two Tests with Karachi and Rawalpindi where only 42 wickets fell overall.

""We were really happy with how all 11 players went last Test"" Cummins told reporters on Sunday.

""Everyone has pulled up really well. We gave them an extra couple of days to make sure everyone has come up good. But there's no injury worries everyone is freshened up so we're confident in the XI.

""Only having two quick bowlers I think reverse swing is going to be a big factor and the way Starcy played last game was fantastic.

""It's always tough leaving out someone like Joshy [Josh Hazlewood] even Scotty Boland. But the class and the difference Starcy brings as a left-armer a bit more air speed we think that's the best chance to take 20 wickets.""

Cummins added that he felt Australia could take the necessary 20 wickets needed to win the third Test having created chances that were not taken in Karachi as Pakistan resolutely batted out more than 171 overs to hold on for a draw.

""I think what's been clear... is the way we've gone about it is the right way"" he said. ""I've been really happy with how everyone has gone about their work (and) the tactics. I think it's just a matter of taking those chances.

""Wickets are at a premium in this series so you can't afford to drop too many chances. We created more than 10 chances [in Karachi] we just unfortunately didn't take them so that's going to be the challenge this week."""

The actor opened up about her experience in the industry during a recent appearance on the Smartless podcast.

The Academy Award winner told hosts Jason Bateman Sean Hayes and Will Arnett that in her early career she had believed she would return to the theatre.

“My husband said to me – and he is so supportive – but Sean [Hayes] you mentioned when I played Queen Elizabeth that happened… in dog years I was over the hill by the time I made a movie. I was 25” said Blanchett.

The actor played the titular monarch opposite Joseph Fiennes and Geoffrey Rush in the 1998 film Elizabeth.

“So my husband said ‘It’s great this is happening now [but] you’ve five years you know that? And then it’s ok you can go back to theatre’” said Blanchett.

“And so that’s what I’ve always said to myself it’s like you know I’ll take it when it comes and I’ve got this other thing that I love which is my real job is waiting for me.”

The Scenes From a Marriage star has reclaimed his place as Twitter’s favorite actor with his latest red carpet look which he donned for the London premiere of his new Disney+ series Moon Knight Thursday night.

Styled by Michael Fisher the suave Thom Browne set includes a slate gray blazer and matching pleated skirt falling just below knee-length with Isaac showing a bit of leg. The star finished the bold look with a white collared shirt and black tie black crew socks with white stripes and black lace-up boots.

Thursday’s skirt suit was Isaac’s second time rocking the menswear trend in so many weeks. For a Moon Night press event at the Berliner Theater in Germany the actor wore another pleated style from the New York–based label Commission pairing the darker-hued skirt with a leather jacket a graphic T-shirt and black Oxford loafers.

While the menswear skirt has been a feature of Thom Browne’s collections for years more male celebs have embraced the trend over the past few years as the gendered norms of clothing have continued to melt away. Seeing Isaac rock the garment has reminded us of how much we appreciate his viral red carpet moments.

For his latest television role Isaac will play the lesser known Marvel character Steven Grant a museum employee living with “a sleeping disorder” who “can’t tell the difference between waking life and dreams” as he says in the trailer. Eventually Steven discovers he has dissociative identity disorder and shares a body with mercenary Marc Spector the titular Moon Knight.

“As Steven/Marc’s enemies converge upon them they must navigate their complex identities while thrust into a deadly mystery among the powerful gods of Egypt” Marvel’s description reads.

Moon Knight premieres March 30 on Disney+.

Marking her feature debut the film focused on the relationship between a hearing speech teacher (Hurt) at a school for deaf children and a deaf custodian (Matlin) working there. For Matlin the Oscar win was the culmination of a lifelong dream that began at age 8 when she started appearing in children’s theater productions for the International Center on Deafness and the Arts in Northbrook Illinois. Henry Winkler who dealt with undiagnosed dyslexia as a child saw her in a play there and offered encouragement backstage.

More from The Hollywood Reporter

“The win reinforced what Henry Winkler told me when I was 12 that I should never give up doing what I love despite the critics and naysayers” Matlin tells THR. She admits her trip to the podium was a blur and she wasn’t sure what to believe when the category’s presenter Hurt whom she was dating at the time called her name: “I remember thinking at first that he was kidding but then I thought ‘He can’t be kidding on national TV!’ ”

THR noted in its coverage that Matlin was only the fourth actress to win with a first-time screen performance. - Credit: The Hollywood Reporter

The Hollywood Reporter

Her film CODA about the lone hearing member of a deaf family nabbed this year’s SAG Award for best film ensemble and has three Oscar noms including best picture and best supporting actor for Troy Kotsur who could follow in Matlin’s footsteps as the second deaf performer to win.

Thirty-five years after her Oscar moment Matlin remains grateful that Children led her down this path: “It was a timeless love story unlike anything that ever came before it and set the stage for what we see today in CODA.”

Maury Povich's long-running daytime talk show will stop production this year EW has confirmed after 30 seasons on the air and more than 3600 episodes produced. Representatives for distributor NBCUniversal confirmed that new episodes will air through September.

Reruns of Maury will continue to air in syndication after production on the show ends.

THE MAURY POVICH SHOW Maury Povich 1991-

Everett Collection

The series which EW's Kristen Baldwin once dubbed ""the lone survivor of the silly-shock genre"" premiered in 1991 under the title The Maury Povich Show; it would be retitled simply Maury in 1998. Like other daytime talk shows of its ilk such as Jerry Springer Maury featured ordinary people as guests rather than celebrities and dealt with hot-button and often sensationalistic issues ranging from domestic violence to unusual illnesses and phobias. Its trademark segment ""Who's the Father"" would use a DNA test to determine ""the correct baby daddy"" in cases of disputed paternity.

The show consistently ranked high in daytime ratings throughout its run with an average of 1.7 million daily viewers in 2020 according to NBCUniversal.

""[Maury episodes] touch so many classic themes whether it's love distrust conflict drama"" Povich told the Chicago Tribune in 2012. ""And the paternity shows in particular you've got he-said she-said is-he-the-father isn't-he. While soap operas play those themes out over six months we play them out over 12 minutes.""

Lawmakers want them to pay us back – KION546,"By Chris Isidore CNN Business

As crude prices surge oil companies are raking in money — enormous profits gained from practically no extra investment.

ExxonMobil made a $23 billion profit in 2021 its largest in seven years. And as oil prices rise it’s expected to make nearly $33 billion this year. BP meanwhile earned $12.8 billion in 2021 and is forecast to earn $15.6 billion in 2022.

This level of enormous earnings growth has driven talk on both sides of the Atlantic about the need for a windfall profit tax on Big Oil. Those taxes could provide direct financial assistance to consumers struggling with high energy costs.

Both the United States and United Kingdom have imposed windfall profit taxes in the past in with broad political support. But this time around support has been mostly limited to liberal parties in both nations.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has opposed the idea. His finance minister Rishi Sunak is expected to lay out the British government’s plans to help citizens deal with rising energy costs Wednesday.

In Washington Democratic supporters of a windfall profit tax argue it’s the only fair way to help people who can’t afford to drive or heat their homes.

“We need to curb profiteering by Big Oil and provide relief to Americans at the gas pump — that starts with ensuring these corporations pay a price when they price gouge” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren one of the 12 co-sponsors of the measure in the Senate.

The UK opposition Labour Party is calling for taxes on profits made by North Sea oil and gas companies to be raised for a year to help pay for a variety of financial relief measures. The US bill would tax the profits Big Oil companies make on crude prices above recent historical levels. It would pay hundreds of dollars annually to low- and middle-income taxpayers.

But that assumes average oil prices of $120 a barrel — and prices surged past that level two weeks ago. Though prices have since fallen back it highlights the challenge of writing legislation around a volatile commodities market. Brent oil closed Friday at just under $108. Retail gasoline prices have ticked down slightly though at a much slower pace than oil prices have fallen.

The US bill taxes the profits big oil companies get on crude prices above recent historical levels. But that assumes average oil prices of $120 a barrel. Prices surged past that level two weeks ago but have since fallen back.

But the Biden administration has yet to voice any support for the windfall profit tax proposal and the Senate lacks sufficient votes to pass it argued Greg Valliere chief US policy strategist for AGF Investments.

Trade groups for both the American and British oil industries argue the windfall profit tax proposals would work against calls to increase domestic production in those countries as a way of making up for the loss of Russian crude oil.

“Lawmakers should focus on policies that increase US supply to help mitigate the situation rather than political grandstanding that does nothing but discourage investment at a time when it’s needed the most” said Frank Macchiarola senior vice president of policy economics and regulatory affairs for the American Petroleum Institute.

Deirdre Michie CEO of Offshore Energies UK argues that a windfall profit would result in oil companies further cutting their investment in oil production “just when we most need our own oil and gas supplies” Michie said.

But oil companies haven’t been particularly eager to invest in more US or UK production.

“Oil and gas companies do not want to drill more” Pavel Molchanov an analyst at Raymond James said recently. “They are under pressure from the financial community to pay more dividends to do more share buybacks instead of the proverbial ‘drill baby drill’ which is the way they would have done things 10 years ago. Corporate strategy has fundamentally changed.”

Still Molchanov said proposals for a windfall profit tax are “political posturing plain and simple at a time when consumers are unhappy about high fuel prices” adding that “micromanaging tax rates based on short-term price swings whether up or down is counterproductive.” he argued.

Putin’s money

The sprawling billion-dollar palace that sits on a hilltop overlooking the Black Sea is seen by some Kremlin critics as the ultimate emblem of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s legacy of corruption.

Dubbed “Putin’s Palace” the 190000 square-foot mega-mansion was purportedly built for his personal use with funds from billionaire oligarchs whom he allegedly allowed to flourish in Russia’s notoriously corrupt economy so long as they shared the wealth — with him.

The property has its own amphitheater underground hockey rink and private seaport according to a documentary produced by jailed Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny’s anti-corruption group. There is a no-fly zone in the skies above and a no-boating zone in the surrounding waters.

The magnificent fortress stands in stark contrast to the tiny 800-square-foot apartment Putin claims in his official 2020 financial disclosure.

Yet despite the opulence of the hilltop retreat “I would be very surprised if Putin ever sets foot in there again” Nate Sibley an expert on Russian corruption who advises members of Congress told CNN.

Sibley said the palace symbolizes what he sees as a bygone era of Putin pursuing through the wealth of oligarchs a luxurious lifestyle that he could never afford on his government salary.

While Putin is believed to have amassed a hidden fortune by such means earlier in his career Sibley said he has since become less reliant on his wealthy benefactors over the years and has surrounded himself instead with government and military loyalists who share his hardline nationalist views.

That shift some Russia experts told CNN may make it more difficult to make Putin personally feel the sting of economic sanctions the US and its European allies have imposed to punish him for invading Ukraine.

Putin has positioned himself as Sibley put it “above the fray.”

MOLINE Ill. -- With spring right around the corner it's about to be a busy time for farmers.

John Deere recently revealed a new machine that the company said can help make farmers' jobs much easier -- a self-driving tractor!

Company officials said it's been in the works for about 25 years KWQC reported.

The future of farming is here with an autonomous tractor taking the farmer out of the cab.

""If you think back to going from horses to tractors and now from manned tractors to autonomous tractors -- this is definitely a very important point in our in our history"" said Deanna Kovar VP of production and precision AG production with John Deere. ""By bringing more automation to agriculture and the final step on that automation is autonomy. We can help make sure that the critical work is done on the farm when it needs to be done and done the way in which it needs to be done in order to grow all of the food for our growing population.""

With the growing worker shortage Kovar said this self-driving tractor helps make that easier for farmers - especially since it can not only be time-consuming but difficult too.

""Agriculture is outdoor manufacturing but nothing is consistent in the field: soil types are different moisture is different elevation is different. And so in order to get the job done with skilled labor on time and consistently it takes a lot and with autonomy. We can help solve those problems to help farmers be more timely be more efficient and also support their quality of life"" Kovar added.

(KWQC/CNN Newsource/WKRC) - John Deere recently revealed a new machine that the company says can help make farmers' jobs much easier.

Company officials say a self-driving tractor has been in the works for about 25 years. The future of farming is here taking the farmer out of the cab.





""If you think back to going from horses to tractors and now from manned tractors to autonomous tractors this is definitely a very important point in our in our history"" said Deanna Kovar VP Production & Precision Ag Production. ""By bringing more automation to agriculture and the final step on that automation is autonomy. We can help make sure that the critical work is done on the farm when it needs to be done and done the way in which it needs to be done in order to grow all of the food for our growing population.""

With the growing worker shortage Kovar says this self-driving tractor helps make that easier for farmers especially since it can not only be time-consuming but difficult too.

""Agriculture is outdoor manufacturing but nothing is consistent in the field soil types are different"" Kovar said. ""Moisture is different elevation is different. And so in order to get the job done with skilled labor on time and consistently it takes a lot and with autonomy we can help solve those problems to help farmers be more timely be more efficient and also support their quality of life.""

DEERE ADDS NEW TECH POWER TO 8 9 SERIES TRACTORS

John Deere has made updates to its 8 and 9 Series tractors for model year 2023 by adding new technology and power. For the largest models of 8 Series Tractors John Deere is offering a new stepless Electric Variable Transmission (EVT) that enables precise speed control and enhanced drivability. For 9 Series Tractors the largest models will be powered by a redesigned JD14X (13.6L) diesel engine.

For customers who prefer stepless transmissions for infinite speed control and ease of drivability the new EVT will be available for all 410-horsepower 8 Series Tractors including 8R 8RT and 8RX models.

As farmers look to the future the EVT will likely be the transmission of choice for many customers Deere expects. That's because EVT-equipped 8 Series tractors will optionally feature electric power generation capable of offboarding electricity to power implements. The EVT is the industry's only transmission that enables electric power generation (up to 100kW) Deere says. By using this electricity farmers could power implement fan drives replace implement hydraulic pumps or assist the tractor by powering the implement's axles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpZG5leWRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy8yMC9tY2NhcnR5dmlsbGUtc3QtcGF0cmlja3MtZGF5LXBhcmFkZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McCartyville St. Patrick’s Day Parade,"Snow Green and the Leprechauns float takes part in the McCartyville St. Patrick’s Day Parade on Saturday March 19.

Head To A Farm In US,"For years Americans have been told autonomous technology was improving and that driverless vehicles were just around the corner. Finally they’re here but to catch a glimpse of them you’ll need to go to a farm rather than look along city streets.

Beginning this fall green 14-ton tractors that can plow day or night with no one sitting in the cab or even watching nearby will come off the John Deere factory assembly line in Waterloo Iowa harkening the age of autonomous farming.

The development follows more than a decade-long effort by the world’s largest farm equipment manufacturer and marks a milestone for automation advocates who for years have been explaining why driverless cars aren’t quite ready for prime time.

“I’m glad to see they’re coming out and will stimulate the other technologies” said Raj Rajkumar a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and an expert in autonomous cars.

Deere isn’t saying yet how much the autonomous tractors will cost but the new technology will be added onto tractors that sell for about $500000 said Ben Haber a company spokesman. The company plans to operate the autonomous tractors on 10 to 50 farms by this fall before significantly increasing the number in following years.

For the past decade the supposedly imminent debut of autonomous vehicles on city streets and freeways has been repeatedly pushed off as companies struggled to guarantee their safety.

But Rajkumar notes tractors have it easier because they don’t need to contend with other vehicles pedestrians or the complexities of an urban scene. Tractors can make use of consistent GPS data unlike cars that can lose contact traveling through tunnels or amid tall buildings.

Or as Joel Dawson a Deere production director put it “You aren’t going to see a crosswalk in most cornfields in Iowa or Nebraska.”

Modern tractors already have GPS guides that handle steering and turning to ensure optimum plowing seeding and harvesting. They also use real-time streams of data to make changes if needed because of soil conditions the amount of fertilizer applied or other factors.

The autonomous tractor will now let farmers hook up a plow behind a tractor start the machine with a swipe of a smart phone and then leave it to rumble up and down a field on its own.

The driverless tractors are equipped with six pairs of cameras that work like human eyes and can provide a 360-degree image. When filtered through computer algorithms the tractor is able to determine where it is in the field and will abruptly stop if there is anything unfamiliar in its path.

Farmers often grow crops on different parcels of land that are miles apart so while the tractor plows in one field a farmer can work at another drive into town for supplies or spend time with their families at home. Given that less than 2% of Americans work on farms and rural populations have dwindled for decades the autonomous tractors also are expected to help with chronic labor shortages.

The shift to ever-more sophisticated tractors is part of a movement that emphasizes planting fertilizing and harvesting during narrow windows of time when conditions are perfect. If new technology can help farmers complete a job when soil and air temperatures are just right ahead of approaching wet weather for example it can mean more plentiful crops months later.

“If I don’t get this field tilled today and it rains tonight that could mean we don’t get the field planted for another week and that has real cost implications in a lot of operations” said Ryan Berman who works on agricultural technology issues at Iowa State University. “If you can move an extra 80 or 100 acres into that optimal window that can be worth thousands of dollars every year probably tens of thousands.

Still the tractor won’t be for everyone.

Ed Anderson director of research for the Iowa Soybean Association cited the substantial cost and noted that some farmers prefer hands-on work rather than overseeing operations via a smartphone.

Another industry giant CNH Industrial also is developing autonomous capabilities for its Case and New Holland tractors and other companies are exploring using numerous smaller autonomous machines to handle other farm work.

The order if it is placed will be a major win for Boeing as Delta has become a very solid Airbus customer with the A320 family and the A350.

In fact if the order comes off it will be the first order from Delta for Boeing’s 737 MAX and the first major Boeing order for the carrier in a decade says Reuters.

The win would come after two major losses last year at KLM and Qantas which switched to the A320 family.

Reuters reports that “in September Airline Weekly quoted Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian as saying there was a place for the MAX at Delta if the carrier could figure out how to bring them in.

“Asked about the MAX in London earlier this month he told reporters Delta was always looking at all airplane models” Reuters said.

That can inevitably mean three things – sky-high airfares packed planes and long waits at TSA airport security checkpoints.

Some people are already trying to get ahead of rising airfares by locking in trips now before prices start to really surge but you can’t exactly turn up the airport several months early in the hope of avoiding a long line for a pat-down body search.

Obviously the best way to skip the line is to invest in TSA PreCheck for expedited screening but if this just isn’t an option for you then expect long wait times ranging from anything from 15 minutes to more than half an hour at some metropolitan airports.

Delays are in part at least down to a chronic need to hire more TSA security officers as well as an alarming rise in the number of weapons being taken through airport checkpoints. The main reason though is because of the enduring need to remove laptop computers and liquids from hand luggage.

More than 15 years since the transatlantic liquid bomb plot travelers in the United States are still made to comply with the 3-1-1 liquids rule. The rule is relatively straightforward – only 3.4-ounce or smaller sized containers are allowed in a single 1 quart-sized resealable bag per passenger.

The resealable bag may be kept inside hand luggage but if any larger liquids are left in baggage then a secondary search will be triggered. Unsurprisingly lots of passengers still fail to follow the 3-1-1 rule or forget to remove electronics from their bags and this inevitably leads to long delays.

Thankfully there are new X-Ray machines available that completely eliminate the need to limit the amount of liquids or remove laptops from hand luggage and they are already in use in several countries around the world.

Passengers can breeze through security checkpoints without having to worry about the need to remove anything from their luggage. In fact some of these machines are already being used in the United States and lots more are on the way this summer.

On Friday the Transportation Security Administration announced it had placed two orders worth a combined $781.2 million to buy Computed Tomography (CT) X-Ray systems from Analogic.

What is Computed Tomography I hear you ask – Unlike older X-Ray machines CT scanners create a 3-D image using algorithms to detect weapons explosives and other prohibited items including liquid explosives.

The CT scanners will come with fully automated screening lanes which are already helping to cut wait times in a growing number of airports across the United States.

For nearly $800 million the TSA will get up to 469 base and 469 full-size systems which are set to start being delivered from this summer. There is though just one small catch. The Department for Homeland Security hasn’t yet authorized the machines for use on liquids above the 3-1-1 rule.

For this summer at least passengers will still have to limit the number of liquids in their hand luggage although the TSA confirms that the long-term goal is to remove this rule at long last.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS9iZXN0LWJ1c2luZXNzLWNsYXNzLXdpdGgtYW1leC1wb2ludHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best business-class seats to book with Amex points,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available.

Qatar Airways

Qatar Airways' Qsuite is one of the world's best business-class products. The suites are spacious and offer a ton of privacy thanks to sliding doors. Plus if you're flying with a companion and assign yourself to the two center seats positioned closest together you can set up a side-by-side double bed — a rarity in business class.

Qsuites can be found on select Boeing 777-200LRs 777-300ERs Airbus A350-900s and all A350-1000s on flights between Doha Quatar and U.S. cities like New York Seattle Miami Boston Chicago Los Angeles San Francisco and others. However there's no need to fret if you don't land yourself a Qsuite-equipped aircraft since you'll still get to enjoy top-notch amenities on board and restaurant-quality food.

How to book

You can transfer your Membership Rewards points to Cathay Pacific's Asia Miles program and book business-class awards from the East Coast to Doha for 75000 miles one-way. Taxes and fees run around $500 each way. As long as all of your flights are on Qatar Airways you can search and book the award online.

Another option would be to book your award with British Airways Avios — but that would require 105000 miles each way plus taxes and fees.

All Nippon Airways (ANA)

Another top-notch business class product you could book is ANA's ""The Room."" The seats offer excellent privacy thanks to closing doors and are incredibly spacious measuring a whopping 38 inches wide. TPG's Zach Griff went as far as calling it the gold standard for the industry. The only catch is that it's currently only available on select Boeing 777-300ERs flying from Tokyo to cities like New York and Los Angeles.

Business-class seats on ANA's other long-haul aircraft don't have doors but still offer direct aisle access. You'll also still enjoy ANA's impeccable service and amazing cuisine. Besides the usual bedding which typically consists of a pillow and comforter business-class passengers flying ANA can also expect a mattress pad and slippers on all long-haul flights.

How to book

ANA's Mileage Club program is a 1:1 transfer partner of Amex and offers fantastic award availability on many of its U.S. routes. Round-trip business-class awards between the U.S. and Japan range between 75000 and 90000 miles depending on the season plus about $500 in taxes and fees.

If you only need a one-way ticket on ANA you could book with Virgin Atlantic Flying Club from 45000 miles each way. Other transfer partners to consider include Avianca LifeMiles and Air Canada Aeroplan — neither of which impose fuel surcharges.

Delta

The Delta One suite is the only business-class product offered by the big three legacy U.S. carriers to feature sliding doors. Aside from the excellent privacy the seats are very comfortable when in bed mode and the new eco-friendly bedding is great.

You can find these private suites on Delta's Airbus A350s and A330-900neos flying to select Asian and European destinations. Plus you'll occasionally find them on some domestic routes. Although they don't offer doors Delta also offers updated business-class seats on some 767s and A330s.

How to book

Membership Rewards points can be transferred to Delta SkyMiles instantly at a 1:1 ratio. Sounds great right? Unfortunately though booking awards with Delta SkyMiles can be extremely frustrating. Because the airline doesn't publish an award chart award pricing can vary greatly — we've seen Delta One Suite awards to Asia for as low as 80000 miles one-way and as high as 375000 miles one-way.

Your best bet would be to transfer your points at a 1:1 ratio to Virgin Atlantic's Flying Club and book your award through that program. As long as there is saver award availability (typically whenever Delta charges under 100000 miles one-way) you can book Delta One awards to Europe at a flat 50000 miles each way and awards to Asia for 105000 miles and up depending on the distance. Plus you'll pay the same taxes and fees when redeeming Flying Club miles for Delta flights as you would when booking directly through Delta.

Singapore Airlines

Whether or not you're flying on the A380 that features the airline's latest and greatest seats flying business class on Singapore Airlines is always a treat. Singapore Airlines' long-haul aircraft feature stylish business-class cabins in a 1-2-1 configuration with fully lie-flat beds.

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

Business-class passengers can take advantage of the famous ""Book the Cook"" service and pre-order scrumptious meals — like the popular Seafood Thermidor — from extensive menus with over 60 dishes.

And if you're lucky enough to be flying on the A380 with the airline's latest business-class product you can enjoy a double bed with your travel companion by selecting two seats in the middle section of the cabin.

How to book

Booking Singapore Airlines business-class award tickets on long-haul routes is challenging since you can only do so through Singapore's KrisFlyer program. Fortunately that's not a problem for Amex Membership Rewards-earning cardholders — or cardholders of any of the three other major transferable points programs (Chase Ultimate Rewards Citi ThankYou Rewards and Capital One) — since you can transfer points to KrisFlyer at a 1:1 ratio.

Singapore Airlines operates several flights between the U.S. and Asia as well as several fifth-freedom routes between the U.S. and Europe. Award pricing varies based on zones and whether you need to add a connection on a Star Alliance partner but here are some of your booking options:

Route Miles required New York – Frankfurt 72000 KrisFlyer miles New York – Singapore 99000 KrisFlyer miles Houston – Manchester England 72000 KrisFlyer miles San Francisco – Hong Kong 89000 KrisFlyer miles Los Angeles – Tokyo 92000 KrisFlyer miles

Air France

If you can't get to Europe with Singapore Airlines or a Delta One suite your next best bet would be with Air France. The French carrier offers updated business class seats aboard its A350s 777-300ERs 787-9s and a few 777-200s. The carrier is also refitting its existing A330s with new seats. Aside from the A330s the new business-class cabins utilize a 1-2-1 configuration and provide each passenger a lie-flat seat direct aisle access and plenty of privacy.

France is known for its fine cuisine and the food on board the country's flag carrier is no exception. The airline has partnered with Michelin-starred chefs like Régis Marcon Michel Roth and Guy Martin to prepare multicourse meals that include an amuse-bouche salad main course cheese course and dessert complete with fine wines and champagnes selected by sommelier Paolo Basso and wine-guide authors Thierry Desseauve and Michel Bettane.

How to book

Air France/KLM's Flying Blue program is a 1:1 transfer partner of Amex. The program doesn't publish award charts but to give you an idea a one-way business-class award ticket between New York and Paris will usually range between 57500 and 75000 miles. However you'll need to fork over a few hundred dollars in taxes and fees.

You may be able to save some miles by booking through Flying Blue's Promo Awards a rotating set of cities with discounted award rates to Europe. For instance we recently saw business class awards to various destinations across Europe for less than 40000 miles each way.

Redrow has sent a letter to residents in the area with information on how they can get involved in the consultation for the homes south of Blundell’s Road.

In a letter to residents Andy Cattermole head of planning at Redrow Homes South West states: “As many know Redrow have an interest in land to the east of Tiverton south of A361 and both north and south of Blundell’s Road. The land has been allocated for development and is part of the Tiverton Eastern Urban Extension. We recently received reserved matters permission for 166 homes as part of phase one of our development to the north and south of the road.

“We are now looking to submit a reserved matters application for 122 homes to the south of Blundell’s Road linking to phase one. This application will include some affordable homes for families and first-time buyers as well as community outdoor leisure space and green transport infrastructure to help cut emissions and support carbon reduction.

“We are keen to ensure that before we submit a planning application later on this year we engage with the local community and get feedback on our plans. In doing so we can ensure that our application where possible and appropriate responds to local comments.”

The consultation website launched on Monday March 14 at redrow-blundells-grange.virtualexhibition.info and a in person event was held at Tiverton Golf Club on Thursday March 17. The virtual public exhibition takes place until Monday March 28.

Mr Cattermole said: “The consultation will include a virtual exhibition with an opportunity for you to submit comments or questions. We can of course provide paper copies of the consultation materials upon request.”

Utah continues to experience economic growth and recognition as a world-class destination. Each year more people from more places across the globe have chosen Utah to live work and visit. While Utah continues to attract people from all backgrounds there is not enough representation in outdoor recreation and especially skiing and winter sports.

Because of this Ski Utah state agencies and local and national businesses have teamed together on a new initiative Discover Winter. This program aims to increase the participation of BIPOC (Black Indigenous People of Color) individuals in winter sports by making The Greatest Snow on Earth more accessible to more people.

With generous funding through a CARES Act grant from the Utah Governor's Office of Economic Opportunity and the Larry H. Miller Foundation Ski Utah in its first diversity equity and inclusion (DEI) endeavor with its partner resorts can accomplish this by removing barriers to entry from transportation to equipment rentals lessons and the proper clothing and safety gear. Ultimately the long-term goal of Discover Winter and all of its partners is to foster a life-long love of skiing and snowboarding for all.

More diversity on the mountain

Winter sports are woefully behind other activities when it comes to more-diverse athletes enthusiasts and audiences. Despite BIPOC athletes participating and medaling in various events at the recent Olympic Winter Games Powder magazine reports that an overwhelming majority (88%) of recreational skiers and snowboarders are Caucasian.

That's the goal. To increase the presence of black and brown people in the mountains. The power of representation which brings inclusion which then can bring opportunity — so then we're all lifted up. –Lamont Joseph White

As Park City artist and snowboarder artist Lamont Joseph White explained ""That is essentially the message I'm trying to send through my artwork 'How about more of us come alongside?' That's the thought. That's the goal. To increase the presence of black and brown people in the mountains. The power of representation which brings inclusion which then can bring opportunity — so then we're all lifted up.""

However beyond race and ethnicity physical geographic and economic factors have played a part in keeping BIPOC from participating in winter sports. Money alone won't solve these issues and many Discover Winter participants are not economically disadvantaged but it attempts to foster a community and culture that welcomes and includes BIPOC especially those new to Utah.

Discover Winter has provided an opportunity for people who may have grown up in balmy climates to try skiing and snowboarding. Most participants are college students college graduates and/or working professionals as well as recent immigrants or refugees (according to the Kem C. Gardner Institute there are roughly 60000 refugees in Utah approximately 30%–35% of which are children).

Many participants hail from places that rarely if ever see snow including 23 African countries Venezuela Colombia Mexico Dominican Republic Puerto Rico and two Native American tribes. Discover Winter wants to break barriers in the ski industry and winter sports generally by among other things breaking down its barriers to entry.

What the Discover Winter program includes

Participating in skiing and snowboarding can be expensive but through the Discover Winter program the costs associated with the sport have been eliminated or significantly reduced for participants.

First there is the cost of lift passes and lessons. During the months of January February and March upwards of 150 participants from Future Scholars of Africa Weber State University's Diversity Clubs and Latinx members of Mountain Life Church in Park City have had the opportunity to visit a Utah ski resort four times for ski or snowboard lessons. Participating resorts include Alta Brighton Snowbird Snowbasin Solitude Mountain Resort and Woodward Park City.

Then there's transportation and equipment. Ski Utah provides free transportation to the resorts and resorts provide ski or snowboard equipment. Ski Utah members and partners have generously donated jackets pants helmets goggles gloves and neck gaiters for participants to stay warm and safe.

Finally the fun continues even when lessons are over! At the end of the program participants receive a Ski Utah Yeti Pass valid for one free lift ticket at each of Utah's 15 ski resorts. That way they can practice their newfound skills and become lifelong skiers and boarders. Moreover the season concludes with an après party to meet even more new ski friends and brag about the runs they slew and plan which resorts and runs to hit next winter.

""When we moved to Utah from Los Angeles over 10 years ago we didn't think skiing was something for us"" says Andrea Garavito Martinez a Discover Winter participant. ""But what really made a difference for us was skiing next to people that looked like us other BIPOC first-time skiers. When we met Lamont Joseph White we felt welcomed. Seeing and talking with him really made us feel like yeah this space and community is also for us.""

Kids can ski at discounted rates too

Although most of Discover Winter's participants are adults they aren't the only ones invited to partake in the fun on the mountains. Ski Utah's extremely-popular 5th and 6th Grade Passport Program makes skiing and snowboarding more affordable for young shredders. Fifth graders may ski or ride three times at each of Utah's 15 resorts for only $49. (That's 45 ski days!) Sixth graders have a similar deal but they can ski or ride one time at each of the resorts. (Still — 15 days on the mountain for just $49 is a huge bargain.) This program is open to all fifth and sixth graders regardless of residency or income.

Get geared up for next season

Discover Winter has already hit the slopes for the 2021–22 season. Information about how to participate or volunteer in the 2022–23 season will be available this fall. In the meantime Ski Utah is happy to accept financial or in-kind donations to the initiative from community members like you.

For more than three decades Dollar Tree a national discount variety chain that sells everything from craft supplies and beauty products to candy snacks and toys -- has maintained its “everything-for-one-dollar” philosophy managing its kitschy but successful retail concept even through several challenging inflationary periods.

Last year Dollar Tree announced it would be increasing its prices beginning in December.

Since Dollar Tree began increasing its prices to $1.25 the company’s rival Dollar General has seen an increase in shoppers while it sticks to its $1 price for items CNN Business reported.

Though the names of the two competitors brand “dollar” they are not true dollar stores. Dollar General has not sold everything for $1. Only 20% of the items purchased are $1 or less the report says.

However Dollar General recently began making changes with an increasing amount of $1 items while Dollar Tree increased its prices from $1 items to $1.25 for all products.

CEO of Dollar General Todd Vasos explained to CNN Business that the chain has leaned towards the $1 price now more than ever.

“Dollar General is really pushing that [$1] side of the business because I think our customers will need us even more” said Vasos.

Dollar General is advertising the $1 an item to show customers there is still a place for them to shop and save money while other consumer places are raising their prices according to the report.

Most Dollar General stores are located in low-income rural areas where it sells food and household essential.

The report describes the rival Dollar Tree as a store that targets “middle-income customers hunting for party goods and other knickknacks.”

Vasos said most Dollar General customers are those with fixed incomes and often run out of money at the end of the month.

One of the reasons why Andy Cohen considers Kandi Burruss to be the most business savvy housewife out of any franchise is because of her business acumen. Outside of music The Real Housewives of Atlanta star owns restaurants an adult toy line cosmetics and fashion lines and more. Her first restaurant is a soul food eatery OLG which is the subject of her latest spinoff. Burruss’ employees have been with her since the beginning but one of them doesn’t think Burruss pays them enough.

Restaurant staff complains about not earning enough money

In Ep. 2 of the spinoff series the staff goes out for drinks to catch up and discuss some of their grievances with the processes and procedures at OLG Initially they talk about the new Director of Operations Phillip and his assertive approach to management. Brandon thinks Phillip can be too harsh. As a group no one is convinced that he will even last at OLG long as management turnover is high.

The conversation then turns to payment. Shawndreca claims minimum wage in Atlanta is $15 an hour and she’s only being paid $12 an hour. She compares it to employees at the local Dollar Tree who she says is getting paid $17 an hour. Shawndreca thinks she deserves more because of the length of time she’s been working at OLG as well as what she has to deal with from customers.

Patrick Burruss’ cousin/godson grows irritated when Shawdreca complains. In his green screen interview he says he’s always going to be loyal to Burruss and says that if Shawndreca is not happy she can leave. He later tells Burruss about what Shawndreca said leaving Burruss frustrated by the gossip and says that Shawndreca can speak directly to her about her unhappiness with pay.

Kandi Burruss responds to the complaint

Burruss likes to reward her longtime employees. Since the restaurant opened five years ago Shawndreca has been a hostess at the restaurant from the beginning. Some of the managers and members of Burruss’ family don’t think Shawndreca is a good fit for the job anymore due to customer complaints about her attitude. Many of the online reviews about the service note Shawndreca doesn’t have a hospitable demeanor which Burruss agrees to a certain extent.

Despite Burruss keeping her around she was offended by Shawndreca’s claims that she’s underpaid. In response to her rant about pay Burruss tweeted “Minimum wage in Georgia is actually $7.25. Soooo she was tripping. She is not getting minimum wage.”

In a separate tweet she elaborated. “Minimum wage in Georgia is $7.25. So $12 is definitely not minimum wage” she wrote. “And the restaurant runs on a budget. Not an unlimited budget. I’m just saying.”

There have also been health inspection concerns at the restaurant

Aside from the issues with her staff OLG has also not had the best track record with the health department. Her steakhouse has also been the subject of bad inspection results. Per a 2021 report from Radar Online the restaurant hasn’t scored higher than a C rating.

The investigator noted on the inspection report that the restaurant was guilty of “displaying active managerial control to prevent foodborne illness.” Additionally they saw sliced cheese raw salmon and sliced tomatoes being kept at a temperature above 41 degrees. Another observation was that the main kitchen did not have hand soap and the sliced cheese raw hamburger shrimp chicken and crab cake weren’t being stored at the proper temperature.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9ob3VzdG9uY2hyb25pY2xlL25hbWUvcGF0cmljay1hc2tleS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMzY4MDE3NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Patrick Askey Obituary (1955 - 2022) - Houston TX - Houston Chronicle,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/houstonchronicle/name/patrick-askey-obituary?id=33680175 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9ob3VzdG9uY2hyb25pY2xlL25hbWUvcGF0cmljay1hc2tleS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMzY4MDE3NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zaGFyb25oZXJhbGQuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy8yM3JkLWFubnVhbC1idWRkeS1ndWVyaW5vLXVuZGVyY2xhc3NtZW4tYmFza2V0YmFsbC10b3VybmFtZW50LWJlZ2lucy1tb25kYXkvYXJ0aWNsZV81ZTVmMTFmMC1hOGMyLTExZWMtODA5ZS0wNzQwZjY0ZDJiZTkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,23rd annual Buddy Guerino Underclassmen Basketball Tournament begins Monday,"Sharon PA (16146)

LEXINGTON S.C. — An unusual sight may grace the skies above Lexington on Sunday but police want to the public to know everything is OK.

Lexington Police released a note on Saturday suggesting that around 8 a.m. on Sunday Dominion energy will be installing ropes on new transmission structures in the area of North Lake Drive and Columbia Avenue.

That in itself may not turn heads but the fact that the utility will be utilizing a helicopter is bound to get some attention. Police said the helicopter will be used to fly ropes across roadways. In fact some of the work may already be underway with at one resident reportedly spotting one of these helicopters on Saturday.

For drivers in the area Sunday's work may also mean intermittent traffic congestion since there will be a series of eight road closures throughout the day.

On the morning Paul and Melissa Kanarek visited the five-and-a-half-acre plot that would become their future home in Santa Ynez California Paul looked over to find his wife crying. “The first thing I thought was What have I done wrong?” he says. “But then she goes ‘This place is so beautiful. I want to spend the rest of our lives here and have our grandchildren play here.’” Then she pointed off into the distance and paused: “And I want to bury you right over there under that tree.”

By lunch they were in escrow—“You can bury bodies on your own land” Melissa jokes—and suddenly the pair former New Yorkers who had transplanted to Laguna Beach started their next life phase: becoming ranch people.

“We aren’t ranch people; we’re not even outdoors people” says Paul. “I have no idea why we did this other than we couldn’t stay in Orange County anymore during COVID and being in an open space has proven to be markedly cathartic.”

To start the transformation (of the land and of themselves) the empty nesters enlisted eco-conscious maker Hygge Supply to provide them a one-bedroom two-bathroom shelter and a one-bedroom ADU that they use as a guesthouse (The pool is an old shipping container from Mod Pools.) For them choosing a prefab home that they could order online was a no-brainer. “The finishes looked like what I would choose if I was starting from scratch myself—and I’m very picky” Melissa says of the black exteriors and hardwood floors.

Hampton Sun Lounge Harbour; Recycled Shipping Container Pool ModPools.

There were nature-inspired reasons for loving it too. First there was the fact that the structure would sit on piers so as not to damage the land and second the patio-style living area would be completely open air—not a door or window closure in sight. It’s where they sip their morning coffee reply to emails on their laptops and over Christmas hosted 20 family members. “It’s as if you’re looking out at a portrait” says Melissa.

Inside Melissa took the reins on decorating careful not to follow the ranch theme too literally but instead make it her own interpretation of Western country living. “I really don’t like when you walk into someone’s home and can tell that a designer did it and it doesn’t really incorporate their lives” she says. “Design can’t happen in one day. A home is something that’s collected over time.”

For example an 1800s bread-making buffet mingles with an 1930s Art Deco shearling sofa and an Eames lounger. There’s a fertility vase that they badly haggled for in Morocco. George Nelson lighting. A salvaged prison desk acts as a bathroom vanity. And then some pieces are a little more on the nose like the neon “Ranchy McRanch” sign a nod to the home’s Instagram account in the entryway. Finally a road trip to Round Top and Marfa Texas helped fill any design holes.

The landscaping a collaboration with Terremoto helped connect the two dwellings with a gravel road and what Melissa calls an “energy vortex” made from five boulders placed in a circle that help visitors (and the owners) reflect on the land which the couple filled with California-native drought-tolerant plants and recently nearly 50 citrus trees.

Other additions to the land? Two Scottish Highland cows two horses one llama and two dogs with a set of piglets on their way this spring. And to occupy the nine toddler-like goats on the property the couple built a playground with swings that the animals jump on at dusk every night.

For two people who never saw themselves as ranchers you could say they’ve settled into their roles nicely. In town Melissa is about to open Brass Tack a shop she describes as “if Dolly Parton and Georgia O’Keeffe crashed Fashion Week” but Paul says he’ll never get used to the fact that there’s nothing to do once the sun sets at 6 p.m.—though the blanket of stars helps. So do the animals. As Melissa puts it: “Nothing beats a baby cow coming to greet you in the morning.”

Technical Arts Group (TAG) an industry leader in event production and premium production equipment rentals provided SJ Lighting Inc. of Westlake Village California with IP65-rated Ayrton Perseo Beam and Domino fixtures for the New York edition of the Rolling Loud global music festival last autumn. ACT Entertainment is the exclusive distributor of Ayrton lighting in North America.

TAG was formed in 2021 and specializes in lighting audio video staging special effects and event management. The company has offices in Secaucus New Jersey and Miami. It furnished lighting sound and video equipment for Stage 4 of Miami’s Rolling Loud fest last July then was asked to supply lighting for New York’s two main stages and sound and video gear for the third. The three-day event at Citi Field drew more than 80000 fans to electrifying performances from some of hip hop’s biggest emcees.

The IP65-rated Perseo and Domino fixtures proved to be an inspired choice for the large outdoor venue as TAG’s CRO Kevin Mignone recalls. “The festival got tons of rain and high winds. The Perseos and Dominos definitely got wet but none failed – a real testament to the Ayrton fixtures. They also packed a punch and the SJ Lighting team made great use of them.”

The Deleón Stage where Maxwell T. Robin SJ Lighting’s Associate Designer and Project Manager served as Lighting Designer featured 68 Dominos. Most were mounted over centre stage and eight were FOH on delay towers.

“The Dominos were used as a stage wash to light the performers” Robin explains. “They were great fixtures because they are outdoor-rated with good gobos high beam quality and are reliable in all weather conditions. I didn’t have a single issue with any of the fixtures on this show.”

Fifty Perseo fixtures were used on the wings and through the deck and two Domino units were FOH on the Audiomack stage where David Hauss was the Lighting Designer.

“The Perseos were the main moving light detail for this stage” Robin says. “Creating aerial effects and providing big looks were the main purpose of these fixtures. The Dominos were hung at FOH to provide light for the banner that was hung over the stage. Both these fixtures were a good choice because of their IP rating reliability light output and the high quality of that light output. The framing shutters on the Dominos were critical for getting a clean focus on the banner over the stage.”

He notes that SJ Lighting has a history of using Ayrton fixtures. “From our installs to our festival stages we always appreciate the reliability and quality that Ayrton fixtures provide” he says. “We like that the Perseos and Dominos are IP rated with an LED engine. Being outdoor-rated means we can put them on any show in any location and any weather condition knowing they will hold up when faced with the elements. Rolling Loud New York in particular saw heavy rain and high winds throughout the load in and show without a single light being compromised. We also especially like Domino’s framing shutters and Perseo’s prism options. We absolutely will be specifying these two fixtures again.”

What's the largest number of toppings you've ever had on a pizza? Most pizzerias don't really limit you as long as you're willing to pony up a buck or more per additional topping but if you've ever been tempted to go overboard you may find out that it's not really worth it. Not only do you not really taste every topping but the excess weight tends to make the pizza soggy.

Still that hasn't stopped Domino's in Japan from going all-out on one particular pizza. This isn't the first time that Japanese Domino's restaurants have offered menu items that are a far cry from what we can get in the U.S. For one thing Domino's rice bowls are a Japan-only thing. For another it has some pretty unique-sounding pizzas on the menu from time to time. One such offering was a dessert pizza with mochi and boba while another was a pizza topped with fish and chips with a lemon slice garnish. This latest offering is truly over the top though as it features an unbelievable 34 different toppings!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9tb25leS9kb21pbm9zLXN0YXJ0cy1jaGFyZ2luZy0yLXBpenphLTI2NTAwNTg10gFLaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWlycm9yLmNvLnVrL21vbmV5L2RvbWlub3Mtc3RhcnRzLWNoYXJnaW5nLTItcGl6emEtMjY1MDA1ODUuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Domino’s starts charging up to £2 for pizza deliveries – and fans are not happy,"Pizza firm Domino's has begun bringing in a £2 delivery fee for orders under £35 at many of its restaurants and says it has no choice as its own costs are soaring

Domino’s starts charging up to £2 for pizza deliveries – and fans are not happy

Pizza firm Domino's is bringing in a delivery fee of up to £2 - and many customers are not happy.

Domino's which previously did not charge for delivery is now applying the £2 fee on orders under £35 at some branches.

But many fans of the American pizza brand took to Twitter to vent their annoyance at the extra charge.

Sophie wrote: ""Dominos are so sneaky man since when did they start charging £2 for delivery.""

Jeni B wrote: ""I have abandoned my pizza because I discovered only a very small proportion of your new delivery charge is being passed on to your drivers! Note the amount I paid to PJ’s includes a £2 donation to Ukraine and I still got free delivery …""

Another Twitter user said: ""Just noticed Domino's have started charging for delivery not cheap as it is off to look at the opposition.""

Joshi wrote: ""I always tip delivery drivers £2 so was very surprised that @Dominos _UK has just automatically added £2 for delivery. This is the first time and I am not going to pay £4 for delivery so the driver won't get the usual tip which is frustrating.""

A Twitter account dedicated to the £2 fee has also been set up - called Remove Domino's Delivery Fee.

A Domino's spokesperson said: “We have introduced a small delivery charge because like many businesses Domino’s is facing increased labour fuel and food costs. Our charges are low compared to many of our competitors who are facing the same pressures and are already charging for delivery.

""Our focus is to continue delivering fresh piping hot pizzas to our customers and to uphold the levels of service they know and love. Introducing a small delivery charge will enable us to continue doing this while covering the increasing fuel and food costs.”

They added: “Delivery charges minimum spend and the free delivery threshold is all set by the stores as we are franchisee business and prices have always been set by them. The majority of our stores are charging under £2 with some customers receiving a charge as low as 99p.”

The fast food chain said each Domino's store gets to decide if it charges for delivery as well as setting minimum spends and thresholds for free delivery.

The company employs 30000 people across the UK and Ireland.

Domino’s sold seven pizzas per second between July and September last year with the record standing at 13 per second on July 3.

Last year Domino's ruffled feathers when one of its Japanese restaurants invented the fish and chip pizza - which fans said managed to insult England and Italy at the same time.

The listed ingredients include crispy fish and chips lemon potato slices and basil with a tartar sauce and tomato sauce base.

A Domino's regular size fish and chips pizza is on sale for ¥3599 the equivalent of £23.

The listed ingredients include crispy fish and chips lemon potato slices and basil with a tartar sauce and tomato sauce base.

People were divided with some left feeling unsure about the whole lemon slices which include the rind of the sour fruit.

It sparked such an uproar that the official account for Domino's in Japan apologised after one man jokingly tweeted: ""Japan Dominos have invented a dish that insults both England and Italy.""

The official account replied: ""We are sorry our fish and chip pizza has caused so much trouble. We think it’s quite delicious.

She says people in the economic development field take calculated risks and try things. They also need good board members.

""It's an art and a science"" she said. ""You have to have faith and trust people and then you research them. I joke about it but we're researchers and we're private investigators and we trespass a lot. We trespass on property and check things out. You do your due diligence.""

She is replacing Harry Eadon who will be retiring from the post on March 28.

A native of the Belmont and Monroe County area of southeastern Ohio she earned her bachelor's degree in animal science from the Ohio State University and her master's degree in economics from Auburn University in Alabama.

At the beginning of her career Akridge held economic development jobs in Dyersburg Tenn. and Prattville Ala.

She also worked in Ashland Ohio. During that time Archway Cookies went bankrupt and closed its plant in Ashland.

She and the mayor of Ashland went to bankruptcy court to plead their case with North Carolina-based Lance Inc. to purchase the company. They met Lance executives in the courthouse elevator.

""Six flights up we did our elevator speech. I've always said you've got to have an elevator speech when you're doing project development because you never know. You might need it"" Akridge said.

Their efforts paid off and Lance bought Archway. The plant is still operating in Ashland.

She next went to Wake Forest N.C. where she worked with a man who was developing a wireless research center. The facility has incubated 52 businesses now and created more than 300 jobs.

Later she worked in Alleghany County Va. She was able to convince the county commissioners to allow the use of county-owned land for drone racing and drone development. Five businesses have incubated from that.

She came to Tuscarawas County from her last job in Leadville Colo.

""Then I found out about this job"" Akridge said. ""I'm from this area. I wanted always to come home. I never thought it would happen. I thought I would always have to work somewhere else.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMi8wMy8yMC9oYXJyeS1lYWRvbi1sb29rcy1iYWNrLTIwLXllYXItY2FyZWVyLWVjb25vbWljLWRldmVsb3BtZW50LzcwNzkyNjMwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Harry Eadon looks back on 20-year career in economic development,"DOVER — One of the biggest challenges Harry Eadon ever faced in promoting economic development locally was to find someone willing to buy the old Alsco-Anaconda plant in Gnadenhutten.

Much of the plant had been torn down but the portion that remained was in rough shape. Trees were growing inside the building and pieces of the roof were falling in.

More:Joint venture — Foam companies to operate out of same plant in Gnadenhutten

Despite that Eadon executive director of what was then known as the Tuscarawas County Port Authority showed the plant to the acting president and chairman of the board of Wisconsin-based Plymouth Foam. They wore hardhats because of the dangers from the roof.

Eadon recalled that the acting president did not like what he saw.

The chairman of the board however had a different view.

""The fellow that was chairman of the board turned around and he said you know what I can see it. I can see a manufacturing plant here"" Eadon recalled. ""I said I can too. I said I think we fix the roof we get rid of the trees that are growing inside the building we put in new HVAC new electric feed.

""The chairman asked if we were willing to lease it to them and I said absolutely. We would renovate it.""

The port authority borrowed money from the county commissioners and the state and made about $2.4 million in renovations to the dilapidated factory building.

Within two years Plymouth Foam bought the building for $3.2 million.

When the port authority bought the plant in 2005 no one was working there. Now it is occupied by Plymouth Foam and Progressive Foam Technologies and about 150 people are working there.

Eadon who will be retiring on March 28 from what is now known as the Tuscarawas Economic Development Corp. sat down recently with The T-R to look back on his 20-year career with the agency.

How Harry Eadon got started

Eadon and his family first came to Tuscarawas County in 1994 when he got a job at the old Handy & Harmon plant in Dover (now Meteor Sealing Systems). When the plant closed he had the opportunity to go to work for Handy & Harmon in Indiana but his family wanted to stay in Dover. He found other work.

In 2002 he was offered the chance to become the first executive director of the Tuscarawas County Port Authority. The organization was given the task of developing a golf course/hotel/conference center near Dundee but that project soon fell through.

The agency then shifted its focus to the old Reeves Mill in Dover which closed in the 1990s.

More:Three things to know about the Reeves Mill Chimney renovation

When Eadon took a tour of the facility he recalled that only four people were employed there four security guards. It was also home to lots of pigeons. The plant was owned by AK Steel which was asking $4.8 million for the property.

""When we took a tour I talked with the person that was in charge of real estate for AK Steel and I talked with him about the price. He said well you know what just make us an offer"" Eadon said.

Eadon offered the man $1.4 million and he agreed.

They closed on the deal on Dec. 31 2002 and the port authority had a lease agreement by mid-January 2003 with Owens-Corning which leased 252500 square feet in the building for five years. The rent the company paid the port authority paid for all renovations at the plant now known as the Reeves Mill Business Park.

Later Deflecto moved in. When Owen-Corning moved out Deflecto was in the process of expanding. It now leases almost 300000 square feet of the building. Extreme Trailers occupies much of the rest of the building.

About 225 people now work at the Reeves Mill Business Park.

Bringing change to Gnadenhutten

Eadon next turned his attention to the old Alsco plant in Gnadenhutten.

The plant was built in 1948 and housed Alsco-Anaconda for about 50 years until the company closed in 1997. About 6.7 acres at the site was listed as a Super Fund site in 1986 by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The area was cleaned up and delisted in 2001.

When Eadon first visited the plant it was owned by BP.

He toured the abandoned facility with the mayor of Gnadenhutten and a representative from BP.

""We talked about what we might be able to do to help them market it and they said we're terrible at this. We buy property. We're terrible at selling it. How about if we sell it to you?"" Eadon recalled.

""I said I have a dollar in my pocket. I could pay you a dollar for it. No we'd probably have to have more than that. I said how much more?""

BP wanted a couple of million dollars.

""I said it would be a hard sell. We went back and forth for five or six months. They finally came back to me and said we liked what you did at the Reeves Mill. We think you would be the right partner to do something with. So they sold it to us for $1.""

Soon after some executives from Plymouth Foam came from Wisconsin. They shared a facility with Progressive Foam in Beach City but they needed a place of their own. Eadon took them to Newcomerstown where one of their competitors Pacemaker Plastics was located.

He also took them to the Alsco plant but they weren't interested.

Two months later Plymouth Foam bought Pacemaker Plastics. Pacemaker had two plants in Newcomerstown but Plymouth officials knew they needed to be consolidated into one location. They were looking for 100000 square feet of space but none was available in Tuscarawas County.

In the winter of 2005 Plymouth executives called Eadon to set up another tour. But on their way to Ohio their plane crashed killing the two brothers who owned the company.

It was several months later when Eadon met with the acting president and chairman of the board.

""We looked around Newcomerstown"" he said. ""There was nothing nothing that big. And they didn't want to build because they didn't have time to build. So I took them to Gnadenhutten.""

And the deal was made.

Eadon was also involved in redeveloping the old Ohio Department of Transportation property on W. High Avenue in New Philadelphia. With a $700000 Clean Ohio grant his agency was able to tear down the buildings and abate the asbestos. Buffalo Wild Wings and a car wash are now located there.

The economic development corporation is now working on redeveloping the old Howden Buffalo plant in New Philadelphia. The plant closed in June 2014 and in 2020 Howden donated it to the agency.

Eadon and his successor Marla Akridge envision it as a mixed commercial and residential area.

He said three developers have already expressed interest in it.

Eadon is now looking forward to retirement.

He will be 69 in a couple of months. He and his wife Lorrie would like to spend more time with their three grandson and do some boating. Eadon said he will also have more time to umpire softball and referee football games which he enjoys.

He credits God for his success in economic development.

""The things that we've done some of them almost seem accidentally as I look back on the last 20 years"" Eadon said. ""They really do seem sort of accidentally but it's not. It's all the Lord that's been driving this and opening doors.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL2FmbG9hdC5pZS9wb3J0LW5ld3MvY3J1aXNlLWxpbmVycy9pdGVtLzUzODg4LXNvdXRoYW1wdG9uLWJhc2VkLXAtby1jcnVpc2VzLWZvcmNlZC10by1jbGFyaWZ5LWl0LWlzLW5vdC1saW5rZWQtdG8tcC1vLWZlcnJpZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P&O Cruises Based in Southampton Is Forced to Clarify it is Not Linked to P&O Ferries,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='afloat.ie', port=443): Read timed out.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 201.94 points or 0.6% to close at 34552.99. The blue-chip average was down more than 400 points at session lows. The S&P 500 finished marginally lower at 4461.18 having been up 0.4% at its highs of the day. The Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.4% to 13838.46.

Powell on Monday said ""inflation is much too high"" and pledged to take ""necessary steps"" to bring prices under control. He noted rate hikes could go from the traditional quarter-percentage-point moves to more aggressive half-point increases if necessary.

The comments at the National Association for Business Economics came less than a week after the Fed raised interest rates for the first time since 2018.

Last week the three major averages notched their best week since November 2020 boosted largely by growth stocks.

Addressing a roomful of people March 10 at the Boardwalk Plaza Hotel Rehoboth Beach historian Paul Lovett said the name recognizes Lorenzo Dow Martin’s cranberry-growing operation in that area decades before the city was founded in 1873. Martin had heard farmers in New Jersey were making good money growing cranberries and he thought he could do the same thing in Lake Gerar said Lovett.

Lovett has spent all of his life just feet from the Lewes-Rehoboth Canal. His family has owned property on the east side of the canal on Canal Street since the 1950s. Over the last handful of years he has painstakingly created a diorama of the city as it looked in the early 1900s.

Now as part of his continued desire to preserve Rehoboth Beach history Lovett is hosting a four-part lecture series on the city’s history. Martin’s life and his contributions to the founding of the city were the subject of Lovett's first lecture.

Situated on the corner of Christian Street and Scarborough Avenue Martin’s former farmhouse is Rehoboth Beach’s oldest structure. Lovett said the house’s existence was first recorded in 1836 when it was described as being included on the land of a farm for sale called Seaside Farm. Martin purchased the farm in 1848 said Lovett. The property is now owned by the Jack Lingo Realtor family but it was previously home to the Walls’ Apartments complex owned by Ann Walls McCool who operated vacation apartments and cottages for several decades.



Martin was born in Milton in 1810 and married his wife Kitty in 1829 said Lovett who speculated that Martin was named after Lorenzo Dow a popular preacher of that era. There’s not much available information about Martin until he purchased the farm Lovett said.

Lovett described the triangular piece of land Martin purchased as essentially encompassing all of the city’s current commercial district. He said its boundaries ran along the ocean from what is now Lake Avenue south to Philadelphia Street and diagonally out to where those two lines meet running southwest along what is now Lake Avenue and northwest along the combination of Philadelphia Avenue and Christian Street.

Martin eked out a living on his farm which would have had horses goats chickens cats and dogs for nearly 40 years said Lovett.

Ultimately Martin sold the farm to a Wilmington-based reverend named Robert W. Todd who is credited with turning the farmland into the camp meeting association. Martin purchased the property for $135 and sold it to Todd for $5000 said Lovett.

From the very beginning Todd appreciated the area said Lovett. Todd described the property as “one of the finest watering places in the world” he said.

Todd conducted the initial lot lottery for Rehoboth Beach in May 1873 and the first lot sold was 23 Surf Ave. which is where the Atlantic Sands stands now said Lovett.

Martin’s contribution to the founding of the city didn’t go unnoticed at the time. Lovett showed a slide of Martin’s obituary from 1926 where he was described as king of Rehoboth. Martin and his wife Kitty are buried in the cemetery at the Midway Presbyterian Church on Route 1 across from Atlantic Liquors said Lovett showing another slide of the headstones.

Future lectures for the series

Lovett will host three more lectures for his series on Rehoboth Beach history – Thursday April 14 will feature the premiere of a movie on 98-year-old Kitty Cole who has lived in Rehoboth her whole life; Thursday May 12 will be a discussion on Commodore William H. Shock who had a distinguished naval career before being one of the city’s founding fathers; Thursday June 9 will be about the wealthy barons of industry who built cottages on the Boardwalk in the 1880s.

All the lectures begin at 7:15 p.m. and take place in the Kent/Sussex Room of the Boardwalk Plaza Hotel 2 Olive Ave. The cost of each lecture is $25.

March Madness isn’t just for college basketball fans. That phrase is also an apt description of the volatility on Wall Street and this March is no different.

Just look at what stocks have done so far this month. It began with worries about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the spike in oil and gas prices. The Dow plunged nearly 800 points on March 7 as energy prices surged.

And if that weren’t enough the market was girding itself for the Federal Reserve’s first rate hike since late 2018. The Dow was down nearly 4% for the month as of March 8.

It has since come roaring back and is now up 2.5% in March. The S&P 500 has risen 2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has gained 1%. At one point this month the index plummeted as much as 9%.

March has often been a dramatic month for stocks. The dot-com boom of the late 1990s ended in March 2000 when the Nasdaq peaked and subsequently crashed more than 10% that month.

And just two years ago stocks plunged in March after the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak in America ground the US economy to a halt.

Hopeful signs despite awful start to the month?

The Great Recession (aka the 2008 Global Financial Crisis) peaked in March 2009. Stocks bottomed that month after a nearly 60% decline from a high in October 2007 putting an end to a brutal bear market.

If you have the stomach for it you can do reasonably well in March. According to data from Yardeni Research which looked into returns dating back to 1928 the S&P 500 on average rises 0.5% in the month. Stocks have gone up 57 times in March during that time frame and have fallen 37 times.

LPL Financial chief market strategist Ryan Detrick looked back at how the S&P 500 fared in the 17 times since 1957 when the market fell in January and February and found that stocks usually rebound. The S&P 500 rose by an average of 1.1% in March of those years and wound up with a nearly 4% gain over the final 10 months following the drops in January and February.

“Seeing the first two months of a new year in the red isn’t a great feeling but the good news is lately it hasn’t been a major warning sign” Detrick said in a report.

Soothing comments from Fed chair Jerome Powell about the economy after the Fed’s rate hike Wednesday could also be good news for stocks for the rest of March.

“There has been no doubt that it has been a rocky start to the year” said Angelo Kourkafas investment strategist with Edward Jones. “Powell struck a positive note about the strength of the economy and the market’s ability to withstand rate hikes.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdmlkZW9zL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIvMDMvMTkvc2hvdWxkLWFtZXJpY2Fucy1ib3ljb3R0LWNvbXBhbmllcy10aGF0LXdvbnQtZXhpdC1ydXNzaWEuY25u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Should Americans boycott companies that won’t exit Russia?,"1.

Guest columnist

Electricity is an absolute necessity not a luxury.

Yet for too many Floridians in Northwest Florida the outrageous monthly power bills from Florida Power & Light are simply unaffordable. The state’s largest utility gets away with gouging consumers who have no where else to turn for electricity because the utility regulators in Tallahassee are lap dogs rather than watch dogs — and because the utility controls Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Legislature with its army of lobbyists and millions in campaign contributions.

Throughout Northwest Florida residents are raising their voices and demanding change. In Pensacola there has been discussion about creating a municipal electric utility to try to lower rates. In Santa Rosa County residents are showing up at county commission meetings to express their anger and plead for help. I also have followed along as a Facebook group concerned about high power bills already has nearly 10000 members and plenty of posts from homeowners who are hurting and can’t afford the rate increases.

Editorial: FPL's 'good' news doesn't change company's bad actions

Mayoral candidate opinions: Where Pensacola mayor candidates stands on issues from FPL to housing

Petition to lower rates: Pensacola asks Public Service Commission to lower FPL rates cites 17K-signature petition

I am proud of the thousands of Floridians who are protesting these incomprehensible rate increases and I feel for those struggling to keep the lights on. We have to keep up the pressure and focus our efforts on Tallahassee. That is where the key decisions affecting your electric bills are made and that is where we must break the iron grip of the electric utilities.

Your electric bills are soaring because the Florida Public Service Commission — five utility regulators appointed by the governor — approved an indefensible rate increase for FPL last fall. The PSC even agreed to force residential customers to subsidize the rates of the state’s largest commercial and industrial users by $1 billion. That’s ridiculous.

On top of the rate increase add in more money for higher fuel costs that FPL and other electric utilities pass on to customers. The result: The typical monthly power bill for FPL residential customers in Northwest Florida has risen by more than 20%. That is way too much for middle class families to easily handle.

In fact our state has become unaffordable for too many Floridians. Exorbitant electric bills. High home prices and soaring rents. Rising premiums for property insurance and car insurance. Yet Gov. DeSantis and the Legislature would rather distract with culture wars than focus on the issues Florida families are facing every day.

When I served as your governor I fought unjustified rate increases for the big electric utilities and appointed consumer advocates to the PSC. I lowered property insurance rates. In Congress I have fought for housing affordability. And I will do it again if I am honored to be elected as your next governor.

Instead of working on the very real issue of exorbitant power bills Gov. DeSantis is expected to sign into law new legislation that would make it more expensive if you want to put solar panels on your roof. Florida voters rejected a similar attempt backed by FPL in 2016 but the state’s largest utility is at it again. It wants the control and the power. Not you.

As governor I took the fight to FPL and held them accountable for gouging Floridians. If you elect me governor in November I’ll take on the special interests in Tallahassee. I will appoint people to the Public Service Commission to represent you — not the powerful for-profit utilities. I’ve been governor I know it’s a governor’s job to put the people first. You are the boss — not the entrenched special interests that write big checks in Tallahassee.

Florida has become unaffordable and Governor DeSantis is making it worse. Northwest Florida I hear you about the pain of soaring electric bills. Come November help is on the way.

Henry Brown of Hanahan who served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2001 to 2011 said he was never made aware that the county rezoned his property in 1997. He called the change ""illegal.""

Brown's land is classified as being split-zoned. The first 1000 feet off of part of S.C. Highway 402 which affects 200 of the 500 acres on Brown's property is restricted to one house for every 15 acres through the county's ""R-15 Preservation Residential District"" zoning that was adopted 25 years ago. Two homes per acre are allowed on the rest of the property.

Brown wants to have all the acreage under the less-restrictive category.

Large-tract landowners near the Cooper River many with conservation easements on their property are pushing back. They say reversing the restricted land-use designation along parts of S.C. Highways 402 and 41 will undo the protections they've had for the past 25 years.

The opponents said they fear that if one parcel along the roadways is changed from one home per 15 acres it will set a precedent for others to follow and open the door to large-scale housing developments which already are cropping up along Highway 41 in the Huger area.

""The owners of large and small tracts in the Cooper River corridor do not want to see Mount Pleasant grow to Moncks Corner via Highway 402"" said Richard Coen the owner of nearly 2000 acres that stretch from his family's Halidon Hill Plantation off Cainhoy Road to Highway 41.

""This is not the time or place for high-density residential development"" Coen stressed.

Brown told the Berkeley County Planning Commission in January he wasn't formally notified in 1997 when the county reviewed and adopted the more restrictive uses for the land closest to the road.

We first caught up with Mama Duke hours after SXSW was canceled in 2020 moments before what would be her last in-person concert for over a year. As text messages poured in from friends offering condolences over this lost opportunity Mama Duke remained positive.

“SXSW canceled? No it’s not... Look at this” she said motioning to a tightly packed house. “You gotta keep going you gotta keep going.”

While the world was canceled for the foreseeable future Mama Duke kept going. She increased her social media presence keeping connected with fans and bringing them into a bit of her process and performing virtually with other local collaborators.

That work led to an appearance in SXSW’s first ever virtual conference in 2021. Mama Duke was given a chance to make up for her missed opportunity with a virtual performance. She said when she declined in an attempt to save that opportunity for 2022 organizers from KUTX insisted she take the virtual stage.

“They gave us an option” she said. “I saved it for 2022 but KUTX hit me up and asked if I want to be a part of it I was like… facts!”

As the world began to open a bit Mama Duke hit the ground running. From rooftop performances to shows in Europe Mama Duke was everywhere promoting her music. It’s the type of work that got her noticed by 4 Non Blondes lead singer Linda Perry as she put together her SXSW 2022 showcase Equalizer.

“When we were putting this event together it was important for me to find local artists” Perry said. “I just thought her energy was amazing. It felt like what I’m trying to do with Equalizer.”

The showcase was one of many performances for Mama Duke over the course of the 10-day SXSW festival. She said all of those performances and the recognition from Perry is a testament to the work she’s put in during the pandemic.

“When everybody went into hibernation you saw who was working” she said. “Now I’m reaping the benefits of all that work.”

“The music is great the energy is great it fits it works that’s what we’re doing” Perry said of Mama Duke’s music.

Mama Duke said she plans to take it all in and use this performance to further her career. With a co-sign from a musical legend it shouldn’t take too long for folks outside of Texas to know the name Mama Duke.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NvYnNlcnZlci5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2NvbGxlZ2UvYWNjL2R1a2UvYXJ0aWNsZTI1OTU5NjkyOS5odG1s0gFKaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAubmV3c29ic2VydmVyLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvY29sbGVnZS9hY2MvZHVrZS9hcnRpY2xlMjU5NTk2OTI5Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Duke vs Michigan State: Observations from NCAA tournament second-round game,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.newsobserver.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Dupont last year won World Rugby's Men's 15s Player of the Year and helped France's national team to win the Six Nations for the first time in 12 years with yesterday's 25-13 win over England also clinching a Grand Slam.

The 25-year-old scrumhalf spoke to Paris 2024 Board member Alexandre Mars on the PAUSE podcast and declared his interest in competing in the sevens discipline at the Games in two years' time French newspaper L'Équipe reported.

""It's really something that motivates me"" he told Mars.

""Just doing the Olympics it's so incredible when you're in front of your TV and you see all the events that follow one another with this patriotic fervour.

""It's so strong.""

While Dupont recognises that he would require approval from his club - Top 14 side Toulouse - he made clear that he hopes he will be permitted to play.

""It's not just me who has to agree they have to agree my club has to agree too"" he said.

""We have to talk about it with everyone at the table but my will is there that's for sure.""

Rugby sevens has featured on the Olympic programme since Rio 2016 where France finished seventh after beating Australia 12-10 in a playoff.

France did not qualify for the men's tournament at Tokyo 2020 although its women's side took the silver medal.

A rugby sevens match is 14 minutes long considerably shorter than the 80-minute contests in the regular 15-a-side format.

Dupont who has played 40 times for France acknowledged that the shorter and smaller format would require some adapting to but is confident he would be able to handle it.

""Afterwards it's hard because it's a discipline that remains different from the XV"" he said.

""Admittedly it's the same ball but it's not the same movements not the same races not the same strategies not the same physical efforts either so it will take time to adapt that's for sure.

""But I'm hot anyway.""

What they say about Antoine Dupont

Antoine Dupont has been collecting numerous gongs over the past few years including being named the world’s best player by Rugby World at the end of 2021.

On top of the individual honours he has won French and European titles with Toulouse and led France to a Grand Slam – a first Six Nations title in 12 years and a feat that brought him to tears.

But what is it that makes the France scrum-half so good? We asked a number of international nines past and present to explain what makes Dupont such a phenomenal player.

Here is what they say about Antoine Dupont…

Rory Lawson 31 caps for Scotland

He just doesn’t have any weaknesses. There’s no flaw in any part of his game.

If you consider the best scrum-halves in the world in the past decade or two you typically have your George Gregans Aaron Smiths Will Genias; those types of guys who manage a game well and have a really good skill-set.

And then you have your other type of scrum-half your Joost van der Westhuizens your Mike Phillipses the bigger scrum-halves more physical built like back-rows.

Dupont is 5ft 8in give or take but he has a physical presence he has proper man-strength whereby he can swat away weak defenders around the fringes of a ruck. So he can do that part of it the confrontation and he can also do the other part the creative.

He’s absolutely electric off the mark and his basic skills are world class. His pass is zippy he’s quick in and out of the ruck he has the ability to threaten the fringes himself but understands how to put others into space and like every great scrum-half his pace post-pass to either get to the next ruck or run that support line is fantastic.

Defensively he’s very good. As a kicker he not only has a really accurate kick but he has a really long kick when he needs it. And we’re starting to see his leadership come through now as well.

So no weaknesses and his strengths are so incredibly strong that you can’t pick any holes in what he does. An incredible rugby player.

Will Genia 110 caps for Australia

The thing that stands out most for me is his athleticism. He’s got an electric turn of pace and is very strong in the carry with a great sense of anticipation. You couple that with how ultra-competitive he is and it’s a scary prospect for opposition teams.

Greig Laidlaw 76 caps for Scotland

Antoine obviously has top-end speed which makes him dangerous to forwards in and around the breakdown but I think one of the things that sets him apart is his low centre of gravity. That makes him really strong so therefore tough to tackle.

When you see him break tackles it’s normally on the bigger men. Couple that with a strong fend – that’s why he breaks a lot of tackles and once he is into space that’s where his speed and his rugby abilities clearly take over.

Natasha Hunt 55 caps for England

The biggest thing that stands out for me is his hustle. He’s got relentless energy around the park and galvanises any team he’s in; he does it for club and for country. He never seems to dwindle never seems to drop.

His skill-set is one of the best out there. He’s so confident with his pass which every good nine is he brings flair he has a kicking game he is on top of where the space is.

Then there’s what he gives you in defence; he’s so powerful he’s like an extra back-row. At nine it’s about getting on top of people and that’s the way he thinks as well. He’s so powerful and he rarely gets it wrong; if he goes to make a shot and flies out of the line he always gets man and ball. So effective.

There’s his game awareness as well his decision-making. He looks for those opportunities to run a line and then goes; he always makes good decisions. Also because he’s so consistent there people look for him in support. Other nines might go every now and then but he is always on that line so people look as they know he’s going to be there.

Any nine is naturally a leader because of the role they play in the team and for me his energy and the way he goes about his business he really drags people up to that level. He’s definitely a lead-by-example kind of guy.

Aaron Smith 102 caps for New Zealand

It’s no secret that I really rate Dupont. I watch his play closely and he has a real impact. Everything good that happens around that French team seems to be around what he is doing. His ability to really pounce on an opportunity is impressive.

He gets an offload off a line break and he just finishes. It’s crazy. His kicking game has real nous and with his man-to-man ability he is a freak. He can run down the blind and step or fend defenders. I call him a sniper he sees an opportunity and just doesn’t miss.

You don’t play international rugby at nine if you don’t have a good pass. Both Faf de Klerk and Dupont have that and are dynamic passionate players. They punch above their weight as they are very physical in contact certainly more than me! They can bust a tackle and put a hit on. They pick and choose when to run it’s not just all-out speed.

I first faced Antoine in a 2017 Test in France. He played very well nipped and zipped around the ruck. We won that day but I remember thinking ‘He has some juice and a bit of go about him’.

Michael Bradley 40 caps for Ireland

He has all the physical attributes needed to be world class – strength speed stamina and technical skill level – but for me his ability to remain ‘cool’ and to ‘read/feel’ the key moments in a game and to then make the right decision make him stand out as the world-class operator that he is today.

The style that Toulouse and France play allows Antoine to express his natural talent week in week out. Maintaining your composure at the highest level in the key moments of a game is rare. He chooses from a large menu of options; most other nines are following team instructions.

Not for a dozen years have France claimed a Six Nations clean sweep but in many ways the dazzling beauty of this one lies in what might still lie ahead. On this evidence anyone else planning to win next year’s Rugby World Cup is going to be disappointed.

England’s players deserve considerable credit simply for hanging in the fight but once Antoine Dupont had surged irresistibly clear at the start of the final quarter to put his side clear at 25-13 it was in effect all over. Not a solitary English supporter in the bouncing stadium or sitting back at home could say the outcome of this compelling finale was anything other than totally deserved.

The final table rarely lies either and the best team in the tournament duly finished well ahead of the pack. England were a touch fortunate that Scotland and Wales both lost on the final day thus sparing them the indignity of a second successive bottom-half finish but there could be no hiding from the frequently uneven battle at the breakdown the power of the French forwards or the rock-solid composure of the home side’s outstanding defence.

With Melvyn Jaminet to slot the goals and the understated Gaël Fickou arguably the player of the championship it was also lucky for Eddie Jones’s outclassed side that a few early nerves affected their hosts’ handling. But if the stadium was rocking to its foundations just imagine the atmosphere when the Rugby World Cup kicks off next year. Were the tournament commencing this week Les Bleus would be favourites and they still look to have plenty of growth in them.

‘Super Saturday’ certainly lived up to its billing even if the most stunning performance of the day had already been delivered by Italy in Cardiff. As a beautiful sunny day gave way to a cool still evening there were so many tricolores around the stadium it felt more like a slickly orchestrated political rally than a game of rugby.

Highlights of past French triumphs on the big screen a stunning lightshow fireworks epic music‚ you half expected Fabien Galthié to be fired out of the tunnel from a cannon.

As Jones had acknowledged in the build up though this was also an acid test for England. Operation Grand Chelem screamed the headline on the front cover of L’Equipe and the mission statement needed no translating.

England in the final analysis offered stout defiance and an occasionally productive kick-chasing game but could not remotely match the all-court game of their opponents. Passion pride and perseverance are all important qualities but as Italy triumphantly demonstrated in Wales there is also a fourth ‘p’ in the mix. The positivity that oozes from the Azzurri’s young full-back Ange Capuozzo will be just as much of a crucial World Cup prerequisite on firm pitches at a French World Cup as set-piece solidity.

That said France’s defensive barricade is now a major stumbling block for all and sundry. Quite content to allow Ellis Genge to charge at them from deep the home side absorbed a short spell of early pressure with total composure and only a few fumbled balls saved England from shipping a couple of early tries.

By the 15th minute though the dam had already burst with Fickou gathering Romain Ntamack’s long pass to reward an ominous spell of all-court pressure.

1:09 'France are deserved champions': Eddie Jones looks back on Six Nations – video

Jaminet had already knocked over a scrum penalty and England were suitably grateful for three relieving points of their own from Marcus Smith. They were also fortunate not to be reduced to 14 men after Jack Nowell took out a soaring Jaminet in the air with the referee Jaco Peyper awarding a penalty the other way for obstruction.

With England getting regularly picked off at the breakdown however it did not remotely knock France out of their stride.

A second Jaminet penalty and Nowell’s premature departure with a hand injury further tilted the scales and after yet another butchered opportunity Gabin Villière and Anthony Jelonch combined to set up flanker François Cros for a stretching score just before the break to make it 18-6.

At least England can say that courage in adversity is not an area of concern. Over the course of the championship few have enhanced their top-level reputation more than Maro Itoje with Genge not far behind. Smith now also has a full championship season behind him and will ultimately be the better for it.

There was a flicker of try-scoring promise too Freddie Steward muscling his way over in the right corner after 47 minutes for only the third try his team have scored in four games away from Rome.

Steward and Joe Marchant both had good games but maybe there is a simpler bottom line: France are currently just better than England full stop.

Admittedly Luke Cowan-Dickie’s yellow card against Scotland when his side were ahead and Charlie Ewels’ second-minute red against Ireland both proved extremely costly but third position is a fair reflection of England’s middling season. Only one of these two sides presently looks like winning next year’s World Cup and it is not the battered and bruised men in white.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJvc3BvcnQuY29tL3J1Z2J5L3NpeC1uYXRpb25zLzIwMjIvZnJhbmNlLWxpdmUtdXAtdG8tc3Rhci1iaWxsaW5nLWFzLWFudG9pbmUtZHVwb250LXNjb3Jlcy10ZWxsaW5nLXRyeS10by1iZWF0LWVuZ2xhbmQtYW5kLWNsaW5jaC1zaXgtbl9zdG84ODUyNjI0L3N0b3J5LnNodG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,France live up to star billing as Antoine Dupont scores telling try to beat England and clinch Six Nations Grand Slam,"Antoine Dupont of France lifts the Six Nations Trophy with teammates after victory in the during the Guinness Six Nations Rugby match between France and England at Stade de France on March 19 2022 in Paris France

France ended a 12-year wait for a Grand Slam victory with a battling win over England at Stade de France.

Fabien Galthie’s side played the best rugby through the course of the Six Nations but still had to get the job done - after being pipped at the final hurdle by Wales 12 months ago.

England pushed them hard in Paris but there was no heartbreak for France this time round as they claimed a 25-13 win.

Tries from Gael Fickou and Francois Cros had France in the ascendancy at the interval but they were put under pressure in the second period by Eddie Jones’ England.

Freddie Steward cut the deficit and England continued to probe but Galthie’s side have shown an iron will in defence this year and they kept repelling England’s threat.

And Galthier has a magician in his ranks in the shape of Antoine Dupont and he popped up to collect a flicked pass before darting clear of two tackles and finishing under the posts to ease French nerves and set them up for Grand Slam success.

The France captain was named Guinness Six Nations Player of the Match for his performance in the Super Saturday finale as Les Bleus ended their 12-year wait for the title.

Dupont’s second-half try put the result beyond doubt after tries from Gael Fickou and Francois Cros had given the hosts a comfortable 18-6 half-time lead and left England playing catch-up.

Marcus Smith kicked eight points and Freddie Steward crossed for England’s try but it was not enough to deny a marvellous France side their first Grand Slam since 2010.

And Dupont who also made 51 metres from seven carries during the game said the Championship title had been a long time coming for this side after back-to-back runners-up finishes.

“It was our third Championship together” said the 25-year-old the reigning World Rugby Player of the Year.

“We’ve finished second twice and it was really frustrating because they were games that we could have won and it came down to tiny margins. It’s incredible.

“We knew this competition was hard and we know how long the supporters have been waiting for this win. We will enjoy this moment now.”"

(WILX) - A man who gave his life to save his daughter is being honored by the community.

On March 1st at about 1 p.m. something in the Droscha’s house exploded causing the home to catch fire. This left Jeremy Droscha injured. However he went back in to save his daughter who was still trapped inside.

Jeremy was able to save her and coming out with his youngest daughter only suffering a few scratches.

He was left with serious burns 2nd and 3rd degree to over 60% of his body. Four days later Jeremy succumbed to his injuries.

Sunday March 20 the community honored him. The smell of pancakes and orange juice filled the air at Eaton County fairgrounds on Sunday morning while people shared their memories of farmer leader and family man.

“Jeremy was just a special guy” one mourner said. “Always had a smile on his face.”

That’s how community members remember a man who was part of their everyday lives. A farmer a vice president on the Eaton County Fairground board and most importantly a dad and a husband.

Dottie Overmyer has a special connection with the Droscha family. Even though she’s now living in Indiana that did not stop her from heading north to show her support.

“It was just a given. I needed to take some time this morning and spend some time with their family and give them a pat on the back and make sure they’re doing okay” said Overmyer.

“It’s really hard to describe how you feel the surreal emotions that we’ve all gone through with the loss of Jeremy and just how the churches and the fair boards and the outpouring of people” said Jeremy’s mother Denise Droscha. “We don’t even know. It has touched us in so many ways. It’s what has carried us through.”

Pictures of memories coated the walls. A tractor pictures of his kids and his wife Jessica.

“I think he would like this. I think he would like everybody coming together having breakfast and remembering him” said Scott Underwood who worked with Jeremy on the Eaton County Fair Board.

A GoFundMe page has been set up for the family. You can donate here.

Former Syracuse All-American Jarret Eaton earned a bronze medal in the 60-meter hurdles at the World Indoor Track and Field Championships in Belgrade Serbia on Sunday.

Eaton finished in 7.53 seconds after a 7.52-second finish in the semifinals and is the only NCAA individual champion in Syracuse track and field history winning the 60-meter hurdles in 2016.

A 2012 U.S. Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches Association First Team All-American for SU Eaton finished sixth overall in the 110-meter hurdles at the NCAA Championship at 13.83 seconds. He qualified for that event with a school-record time of 13.44 seconds at the NCAA East Preliminary Round finishing second overall.

In his junior season he earned two NCAA Regional-qualifying times in the 110-meter hurdles winning the Big East title in the event with a 13.85-second finish. That was the season’s fastest time in the 110-meter hurdles from the Intercollegiate Association of Amateur Athletes of America preliminaries. Eaton was then named the Northeast Region Men’s Athlete of the Year.

On top of this world indoor bronze Eaton has three other professional medals on his resume. He earned silver at the 2018 world indoor where he set his career high in the event (7.43 seconds). He also won bronze in the U.S. Indoor Championship in 2016 and at the 2019 Pan-Am Games. Eaton currently ranks 30th nationally in the 110m hurdles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9uZXdzL3VrLWVuZ2xhbmQtbm90dGluZ2hhbXNoaXJlLTYwODA3Mjg30gFCaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvdWstZW5nbGFuZC1ub3R0aW5naGFtc2hpcmUtNjA4MDcyODcuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fox cub trapped in concrete saved by firefighters,"Sue Buck the founder of HARC said: ""When they tried to catch it it ran and got stuck between a garage and a wall where it was about 3in (8cm) wide.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpbWVyaWNrcG9zdC5pZS8yMDIyLzAzLzIwL2xpbWVyaWNrLWNvbW11bml0eS1mZWFycy1jb25zZXF1ZW5jZXMtb2YtYXVnaGluaXNoLXNhbmN0aW9ucy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Limerick community fears consequences of Aughinish sanctions,"TOWERING over a thousand acres along the Shannon estuary in County Limerick the giant red and white chimney stacks of the Russian-owned Aughinish Alumina refinery dwarf nearby homes and farms.

Built six years before the fall of the Berlin Wall the controversial alumina extraction plant is now facing dangers from a new Cold War one that could threaten the future of its 500 workers along with hundreds of other local jobs dependent on its existence.

Local ship chandler Vincent Kelly will be one of those affected if the European Union puts Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska on its sanctions list. It would he says simply be disastrous for his family-run business.

Kelly (71) has fed the Aughnish workforce every day and provided supplies to the ships that anchor at the Aughinish jetty for the past forty years.

“We supply the ships with deck engine stores chemicals cleaning chemicals food drink everything a ship would need or want. There’s two ships in Aughinish everyday so it would mean that 70 per cent of our ship business would be gone” he explained.

Deripaska a close associate of Vladimir Putin reduced his controlling stake in Aughinish in 2019 to 49 per cent after he faced US sanctions.

“If there’s any more sanctions against Aughinish it will affect the ordinary worker a lot more than the oligarch” said Kelly “It’s the workers and the community and the people who have local businesses that are going to suffer.”

“Aughinish was under construction when I came here. The Cold War was still going on and now we don’t know what’s going to happen.”

Like others Carmel Ryan vice-chair of the Askeaton Civic Trust fears the worst: “There’s at least a thousand jobs. Lots of people working in small businesses will be indirectly affected if the plant closes…shops grocery stores.”

Opened in 1983 the alumina plant has defined Aughinish and surrounding districts for decades. 6000 construction workers were involved in building it often staying as lodgers with local people.

“It put people on their feet it allowed people to buy a site and build a house with a loan put in a back kitchen have a second bathroom have a second car” Ms Ryan said.

“It also allowed people who had emigrated to England to come back home and get work.

“If there’s no more money you will no longer continue to have the local services we currently enjoy. If it is sanctioned it would devastate the place and there’ll be a whole generation who will lose” she warned.

Local Fianna Fáil councillor Kevin Sheahan says he must continue to support Aughinish workers despite the Ukraine bloodshed.

“My heart goes out to the people of Ukraine but my heart and soul are with the men and women working in Aughinish and their families.”

Sanctions that affect workers are not justified he said adding that larger European powers should start at home when it comes to imposing sanctions on Russians.

“We don’t have to be out in front of this posse at all.”

If Aughinish closes it may never reopen and if that happens the site must be returned to how it looked in 1979.

“Every taxpayer in this country would be landed with a bill of millions to restore it to its original state” Cllr Sheahan added.

However not everyone locally is a fan of the Aughinish plant.

The Cappagh Farmers Support Group have conducted a long-running campaign opposing the expansion of the refinery’s operations citing concerns about environmental risks to people and livestock.

Vast ponds of red mud that interrupt the estuary’s green hinterland are to be expanded if a planning application before An Bord Pleanala is approved.

The hazardous red residue is left after alumina is extracted from bauxite ore which arrives on ships from Guinea and Brazil. The alumina is then exported to be refined into aluminum at smelters all over the world while the residue remains in Aughinish.

Local farmer Pat Geoghegan has complained for years that his family’s health has suffered and his livestock have died from toxic waste carried on the wind from Aughinish onto his land at Boolaglass.

These claims have yet to be substantiated despite a number of investigations by the Environmental Protection Agency and the former Mid-Western Regional Health Board.

Rusal is also seeking to expand the height level of salt cake another hazardous material at the site but Pat Geoghegan claims the entire expansion development will pose an unacceptable risk to the protected estuary and human health.

“The one thing that has been forgotten about is that the sanctions have an impact on us people who live near the refinery. When the sanctions were put on there in 2018 we didn’t know ourselves. Rusal had to review production which meant that emissions went down and we thought we had a new farm we were able to walk around and breathe properly.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzbGl2ZS5jby56YS9zcG9ydC9zb2NjZXIvMjAyMi0wMy0yMC1jbGFzaWNvLWlzLXBlcmZlY3QtdGltZS10by1zaG93LXdoYXQtYmFyY2EtY2FuLWRvLXhhdmktc2F5cy_SAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy50aW1lc2xpdmUuY28uemEvYW1wL3Nwb3J0L3NvY2Nlci8yMDIyLTAzLTIwLWNsYXNpY28taXMtcGVyZmVjdC10aW1lLXRvLXNob3ctd2hhdC1iYXJjYS1jYW4tZG8teGF2aS1zYXlzLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Clasico is perfect time to show what Barca can do Xavi says,Please click here to view our site optimised for your device.

""Downtown and skyways are starting to have a noticeable pulse again"" said Patrick Skinner general manager of Wells Fargo Place the tallest office building in St. Paul's downtown.

The 37-story tower is 90% leased and Skinner now expects building usage to be 60 to 65% of pre-pandemic levels by the summer up from 30 to 35% now.

""Within the last couple of weeks we have learned that all of our tenants save for a couple smaller tenants are planning a return-to work-strategy for the near future"" Skinner said.

Loading...

Before most office employees started working from home in March 2020 about 1500 workers from Wells Fargo the Internal Revenue Service Merrill Lynch Wealth Management and other tenants were in the building daily.

""We are also seeing very encouraging improvement in activity and sales numbers for our restaurant tenants"" Skinner said.

Downtown Minneapolis and the areas around big corporate campuses such as 3M and Best Buy also will get a boost as more companies set plans for a hybrid schedule for workers.

In downtown St. Paul Wells Fargo workers started coming back last week as did the Travelers Companies' 2100 insurance workers in St. Paul. Securian Financial has set Tuesday for the start of its phased return while Ecolab corporate employees will return April 4.

Already the moves are leading to increasing activity on the streets said Joe Spencer president of St. Paul Downtown Alliance.

""Walking around downtown these days you can feel an anticipation and excitement brewing just under the surface"" Spencer wrote in an e-mail. He also pointed to recently opened bars and restaurants like Momento Lost Fox MetroNome Brewery and Hepcat Coffee.

Sunny skies plus the return-to-work announcements renewed St. Patrick's Day events the Minnesota boys high school hockey tournament — all are ""adding up to a feeling that's been missing for most of the last two years"" Spencer said.

The plummeting COVID-19 infection rates in recent weeks have led many Twin Cities employers to set in motion plans to add office days back into the mix.

Travelers is taking a ""flexible approach to work arrangements"" a spokeswoman said. ""This means that some employees have chosen to or have roles that require them to work from the office full time. While others have fully remote positions and some have chosen a hybrid arrangement.""

That's the approach most companies are taking although the details of hybrid plans differ.

3M reopened its headquarters campus in Maplewood last week and announced its ""Work Your Way"" model that lets most workers choose options.

While most lab and manufacturing employees have to work on-site 3M's U.S. office employees including the nearly 10000 in Minnesota were given a choice to return to the office said 3M spokesman Tim Post during a phone interview.

""Working from a 3M office will be another option for 3M's nonproduction employees as they find a schedule that best works for them"" Post said.

Best Buy's approach for most headquarters employees is more structured — three days in the office two at home or another location of their choice the company said. Some employees will be full time at the Richfield campus and other offices some will be fully remote.

Best Buy's new hybrid structure goes into effect the week of April 18.

Deluxe Corp. employees at the company's new downtown Minneapolis headquarters officially started hybrid work last week joining workers at employers such as the city of Minneapolis the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and Ameriprise Financial.

""We are definitely seeing an increase in workday activity especially in the middle of the week Tuesday through Thursday"" said Steve Cramer chief executive of Minneapolis Downtown Council.

But that is just as it should be as she has always been an uncompromising presence a fiery and sexy rebel with many causes and teller of uncomfortable home truths. Lunch has always been one for crushing cliches under her high heels. Today she’s often regarded as a kind of mama figure by her fans and she wryly describes her merch stalls as ‘the hugging booth’ but there is a sense that deep down in spite of her ferocious professional reputation she doesn’t really mind and gives great hugs.

The Lydian Spin the podcast she has co-hosted since 2019 with Retrovirus bandmate Tim Dahl is as expected outspoken and of course political featuring kindred spirits from the underground. Lunch and Dahl’s dynamic is amusing – Lunch is provocative and hilarious constantly spitting out zingers; Dahl seems more laidback and a self-confessed muso. Both often come across as cheeky loudmouthed siblings talking over each other grossing each other out with scatological humour and sparring with affection.

There have been film makers visual artists and actors on the broadcast but in the main it’s musicians and peers like L7’s Donita Sparks performance artist Ron Athey and ex-Sonic Youth guitarist Thurston Moore who are her most fascinating guests as she can flirt uproariously and swap candid anecdotes with them. Not for them the painfully hip or ephemeral artists with a limited shelf life – mostly integrity remains front and centre.

Recent warhorses have included The MC5’s Wayne Kramer who chats about growing up in Detroit and his move to bring prisoners musical instruments with his scheme Jail Guitar Doors; and performance art rock band Sloppy Jane’s frontwoman Haley Dahl who relays her fondness for recording in caves how to make art with limited resources and reclaiming the streets after experiencing a traumatic mugging at knifepoint which horrifically resulted in a trip to A and E and fifty stitches in her face.

The 100th episode featured electronic artist and animal rights activist Moby who displays a deadpan wit and speaks eloquently to current issues. He bemoans the lack of ‘lunatic cults’ in LA in the post-Trump era and ruminates on how conspiracy theorists particularly the likes of QAnon get sucked into such bizarre ideology.

‘Fear doesn’t inspire critical thinking’ he says. ‘A simple falsehood will basically always win over a complicated truth.’

Gail Ann Dorsey guitarist and singer who toured with David Bowie since 1995 and has worked with artists as diverse as Gang Of Four Lenny Kravitz and Tears For Fears comes across as a Zen-like artist of immense warmth and grace. Lunch gently teases her about working with Donny Osmond during his as Dorsey put it ‘leather jacket period’ saying to Dorsey’s delight ‘Any dirty laundry on Donny? It’s Marie’s undies I’d like to get into – she’s real cute in those commercials!’

As befits such a talented and eclectic musician a lot of talk turns to the minutiae of touring and how audiences perceive their onstage heroes. Dorsey says of being authentic when performing live ‘There’s beauty in imperfection. It’s the stuff that’s not perfect that’s emotional and that touches people they feel more connected to that… Emotion is everything.’

Other broadcasters’ recent podcasts feel mired in a kind of safe media-savvy culture where the end goal is to provide soundbites. The Lydian Spin defiantly eschews that. Lunch and Dahl were never going to be polite. They are not interested in selling empty product nor are they above goading their guests poking at them for answers or simply poking fun. Instead they take a more philosophical approach sounding out ideas and remaining unconcerned with being verbose or divisive at times.

With Beth B’s new feature film about her tumultuous life and career The War Is Never Over having just been released in America and soon to follow in the UK Lunch isn’t so much a grand dame as perpetual thorn in the side of the arts establishment but she finally seems to be getting her dues – and it’s not before time. I am sure she would balk at being deemed a trailblazer or even iconic (she’s far too subversive for that overused term) but her voice has inspired countless women from the late seventies to the present day to pick up instruments and take up spaces in the music industry otherwise afforded to men. ‘Art is the salve to the universal wound’ she often states during the podcast. Everything she says is sincere and at times her words sting like paper cuts. Just don’t get her started on Nick Cave or Courtney Love these days…",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRydWVhY2hpZXZlbWVudHMuY29tL240OTA0MS9maWZhLTIyLWZ1dC11bHRpbWF0ZS10ZWFtLWluLWZvcm1zLXNiYy1vYmplY3RpdmVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FIFA 22 Locker Room: What's new this week? (March 19th),"Our Pick: Parejo (Villarreal — CM — 87)

It's Week 26 for FIFA and we have a bit of a doozy this time around. Ronaldo leads the charge after his hat-trick against Spurs with a 92-rated ST card. It's slightly slower than we are used to for an R7 card but if you have the coins obviously buy it. Wojciech Szczesny has finagled another inform this one standing at 89-rated. Honestly I've just been using that Handanovic Fanta card for some time now and found it to be perfectly adequate. Of the highest rated cards Grifo from Freiburg comes in with an 86-rated CM card just pipping that Osimhen card to the post. Watford's Hernandez is the featured player of the week with a tidy 84-rated card with that glorious star above it.Of course if there was ever a card that was a shoo-in for our pick this week it was Parejo. The ancient and slow CM might not be the fastest man on the pitch but boy is he cultured.

NCAA: How One Man Pioneered NIL Deals Into Existence,"Twenty-seven years ago the UCLA Bruins were the kings of college basketball.

A kid by the name of Ed O'Bannon was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. He along with his brother Charles O'Bannon brought home their program's 11th national championship. Both went on to play in the NBA briefly. Ed became a lottery pick. Charles spent time playing overseas and had a son named Chuck O'Bannon who currently plays for the TCU Horned Frogs as they gear up for the 2022 NCAA Tournament.

Today's landscape of college athletics — one that now allows players like the younger Chuck to sign million-dollar deals with companies of his choosing — would have never been possible without the help of his uncle Ed O'Bannon.

How? Let's get into it.

The Landmark O'Bannon v. NCAA Case

It was in 2009 that Ed O'Bannnon well out of basketball by then sued the NCAA Electronic Arts and Collegiate Licensing Company over using his name image and likeness in a NCAA basketball video game.

By March 2010 11 former college athletes had joined O'Bannon's class-action lawsuit. NBA stars like Oscar Robertson and Bill Russell joined the suit later as well.

There's a full timeline of the case but the gist is this: In 2014 District Judge Claudia Wilken ruled that the NCAA's model of amateurism and thus not paying athletes had violated antitrust laws. As a result EA put a halt to its NCAA video games. The company was forced to pay $60 million after the lawsuit.

The ruling set in motion the dismantling of the NCAA's practice prohibiting athletes form being paid for their name image and likeness which didn't fully happen until 2021.

How O'Bannon's Case Paved Way For NIL Deals

It wasn't until National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Alston that the Supreme Court made a decision on the issue.

On June 21 2021 the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of Shawne Alston a former college football running back at West Virginia and student-athletes in the landmark case. In Justice Brett Cavanaugh's concurring opinion he wrote that the ""NCAA's business model of using unpaid student-athletes to generate billions of dollars in revenue for the colleges raises serious questions under the antitrust laws.""

Then under pressure from state legislators the NCAA finally allowed its student-athletes to benefit from their name image and likeness.

""This is an important day for college athletes since they all are now able to take advantage of name image and likeness opportunities"" NCAA President Mark Emmert said in a release in June 2021. ""With the variety of state laws adopted across the country we will continue to work with Congress to develop a solution that will provide clarity on a national level. The current environment — both legal and legislative — prevents us from providing a more permanent solution and the level of detail student-athletes deserve.""

Today there are hundreds — no probably thousands — of NIL deals out there for college athletes across the country. In the NCAA Men's and Women's Tournaments alone you'll find plenty: Gonzaga's Drew Timme and his wonderful mustache are partnered with Dollar Shave Club and UConn's Paige Bueckers has deals with companies like Gatorade StockX and Cash App likely totaling more than $1 million.

And more is on the way.

College sports will never be the same and football players basketball players and more can thank one man for kickstarting the campaign to allow them to profit off the use of their names images and likenesses: Ed O'Bannon.

""I knew a little bit of what he was doing or what he was trying to do"" his nephew Chuck O'Bannon told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram in a recent interview. ""Now that I'm older it all makes sense. I get it now. Back then I didn't.""

Now go get yourself a NIL deal Chuck. This one's on Uncle Ed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFvbmUuY29tL2RpZ2l0YWwveGJveC1nYW1lLXBhc3MtdWx0aW1hdGUtc2luZ2Fwb3JlLWRyb3BzLTEzOTktbW9udGgtYXByaWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for Singapore drops to $13.99 per month from April,"We’re said before back in 2020 that the Xbox Game Pass is the “Netflix for Video Games” and it still remains as such till now. Wondering how the Xbox Game Pass compares to PlayStation Plus and which one gives better value over there other? We’ve got you sorted.

The good news is starting from April 1 2022 the prices of Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Live Gold in Singapore will be reduced up to 33 per cent. This is thanks to Microsoft regularly evaluating the prices of Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Live Gold at a local level to best serve customers in each country. This means the Ultimate Plan (for gaming on console and PC) will be down to $13.99 per month from the original $19.99.

Not only confined to the Xbox console the Xbox Game Pass is a gaming subscription service that gives subscribers access to over 100 solid titles for only $1 in the first month. Think of it like a cable or Netflix subscription where one price brings you a huge selection of games to play.

Sure the service does revert back to $13.99 (for the Ultimate Plan) in the subsequent months but the value still remains the same even at the highest-paid tier. If you are for the PC Master Race the monthly price is $9.99 a month. Best of all both plans include Electronic Arts (EA) Play – the complete library of EA’s latest games.

LLY,Eli Lilly and Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAzLzE5L2NvdWxkLXRoaXMtYmUtZWxpLWxpbGx5cy1uZXh0LWJsb2NrYnVzdGVyLWRydWcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Could This Be Eli Lilly's Next Blockbuster Drug?,"Eli Lilly recently revealed encouraging results for the drug candidate mirikizumab in treating patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.

On Feb. 18 Eli Lilly (LLY 4.31%) announced impressive results from its first phase 3 clinical trial of mirikizumab in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) who didn't benefit from conventional therapies.

Eli Lilly also stated that data from the second trial would be shared in the first half of 2022. With the pharma stock set to file with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval of mirikizumab in the first half of this year this raises the following question: Could approval for a UC indication in the U.S. create another blockbuster drug for Eli Lilly?

Let's dig into the results from the first phase 3 clinical trial and the UC market in the U.S. to try to answer this question.

A potent treatment for a potentially disruptive condition

UC is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that results in damage to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The condition affects only the colon and the rectum which is a contrast to the other form of IBD called Crohn's disease. The symptoms of UC like abdominal pain weight loss and fatigue overlap with Crohn's disease. But the latter can impact any part of the GI tract from the mouth to the anus.

Healthcare professionals are able to determine the severity of UC by the number of a patient's bowel movements per day and whether the condition affects their daily life. Disease severity is often classified as mild if the patient has less than five bowel movements a day and is able to adapt to the disease. On the other hand moderate-to-severe disease entails up to 10 bowel movements a day and can interfere with work or school attendance.

It's estimated that in any given year 21% to 22% of the approximately 900000 UC patients in the U.S. have moderate-to-severe disease activity. The good news is that mirikizumab looks like it will provide a significant improvement in the quality of life for many patients experiencing moderate-to-severe UC.

Eli Lilly enrolled over 1000 patients in its first phase 3 study with moderate-to-severe UC that either never tried a biologic treatment or didn't benefit from biologic therapies in the past. Patients receiving mirikizumab achieved a much higher rate of symptomatic remission at week 12 than those taking a placebo. More specifically 45.5% of patients treated with mirikizumab had their symptoms clear up at week 12 compared to 27.9% of patients treated with placebo at week 12.

The drug boasted an exceptional safety profile to boot. Only 2.8% of patients receiving mirikizumab reported serious adverse events which was well below the 5.3% of the placebo group that reported serious adverse events during the clinical trial.

The indication would be a big boost for Eli Lilly

Based on the data from its first phase 3 clinical trial mirikizumab is an overwhelmingly safe and effective treatment for UC on its way to an eventual FDA approval. But what will that mean for Eli Lilly's sales?

There are roughly 200000 moderate-to-severe UC patients in the U.S. in a given year. Factoring in mirikizumab's efficacy and safety profile my best guess is that the drug can conservatively capture 8% of the patient share or 16000 patients. While the drug's efficacy and safety profile are major selling points there are numerous drugs on the market.

Although an annual list price for the drug won't be announced until its potential launch drugs like AbbVie's (ABBV -0.65%) Humira and Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ -0.46%) Stelara could be good gauges for what mirikizumab's annual list price may be. The former two drugs have respective annual list prices of approximately $80000 and $150000.

But I'll assume that mirikizumab will be priced at a lower annual price of $70000 to try to establish itself in a crowded field. Factoring in insurance adjustments and patient assistance programs I end up with a net annual price of $50000 per patient (likely paid mostly by the insurer).

This would work out to just short of blockbuster status at $800 million in annual sales potential. Even for a large-cap pharma stock like Eli Lilly this is enough to move the needle. If approved mirikizumab's UC indication would be a 3% bump over Eli Lilly's $25.9 billion in 2022 sales that analysts are forecasting.

Eli Lilly offers investors a deep pipeline

A potential UC indication alone for mirikizumab will probably fall short of blockbuster status for Eli Lilly. But with the drug also in phase 3 clinical trials for Crohn's disease there's a good chance it will be the next blockbuster for the company.

Even without it Eli Lilly has a pipeline of dozens of compounds. These include the immunology drug lebrikizumab potential diabetes mega-blockbuster tirzepatide and a host of other promising drugs. This is why I believe Eli Lilly will deliver low-double-digit annual non-GAAP (adjusted) diluted earnings per share (EPS) growth over the medium-term.

At a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 29.6 Eli Lilly appears to be a buy for growth investors with a long-term investing mindset.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3dlc3Rlcm4tY29tcGFuaWVzLXdyZXN0bGUtd2l0aC1ydXNzaWEtaGFsZi1leGl0cy0yMDIyLTAzLTE4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Western companies wrestle with Russia 'half-exits',ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/western-companies-wrestle-with-russia-half-exits-2022-03-18/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3dlc3Rlcm4tY29tcGFuaWVzLXdyZXN0bGUtd2l0aC1ydXNzaWEtaGFsZi1leGl0cy0yMDIyLTAzLTE4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkd2Vlay5jb20vYWdlbmNpZXMvdXMtbWVkaWEtYWdlbmN5LW9mLXRoZS15ZWFyLXNwYXJrLWZvdW5kcnlzLW5ldy1idXNpbmVzcy1tYWNoaW5lLXBvd2VyZWQtYS1tb25zdGVyLXllYXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Spark Foundry Is Adweek's 2022 U.S. Media Agency of the Year,"Publicis Media delivered an astonishing year of new business in 2021.

Ben Rector may not be a “hype person” — a point he has reiterated in interviews and on social media — but he’s been proud to tout “The Joy of Music” as the album he’s wanted to make for more than a decade.

Though Rector is known to be self-effacing such proclamations would set the bar high for any artist. Fortunately “The Joy of Music” (the Nashville singer-songwriter’s eighth studio album which hit streaming platforms last week) is his most vibrant emotionally robust work yet.

Like 2015’s “Brand New” and 2018’s “Magic” the 13-track set is full of wistful piano-pop melodies that touch on family fame and friendship. This time around the results are more sonically diverse than ever with featured assists from Dave Koz Kenny G and Snoop Dogg. Yes that Snoop Dogg.

Songs like “Steady Love” and “Clichés” reflect the domestic bliss Rector has found with his wife Hillary 4-year-old daughter Jane — who incidentally makes a surprise appearance on the album — and sons Roy and Robert both 1.

The 13 songs on “The Joy of Music” represent a major step up for Rector as a musician. (Photo: Amy Harris/Associated Press)

But time and fatherhood haven’t diminished Rector’s willingness to delve beyond the confines of his previous work. “Supernatural” is a standout track that could very well be the grooviest entry in his catalog juxtaposing Koz’s saxophone solo with a 1980s synth-pop beat. His mischievous wit is here too most notably on the percolating “Sunday” where he swaps verses with Snoop Dogg.

Rector’s desire to get outside his comfort zone extended beyond the recording studio. To accompany “The Joy of Music” he and director Ben Kadie wove six of the new songs into a playful short film that may as well be titled “Rector in Wonderland.” After a fruitless night at the piano Rector is transported into a dream world where he masters some Broadway-style dance moves — in his socks no less — and joins a band of superheroes for an impromptu jam session.

His co-star in the film is a custom-designed red Muppet monster created by Jim Henson’s Creature Shop that audiences can expect to see on his tour which kicks off May 5 in Madison Wisconsin before moving on to Boston New York and other cities.

Watch “Living My Best Life” from “The Joy of Music” short film below.

At 35 Rector may not be a household name or radio fixture. His folk-pop albums and heartfelt relatable lyrics however have endeared him to a massive fan base thus guaranteeing him a spot on streaming playlists and at wedding receptions for years to come.

Hollywood has caught on to Rector’s talents too. Last month the Screen Actors Guild chose “Sailboat” his collaboration with musician Cody Fry as the soundtrack for the “in memoriam” segment of the 2022 SAG Awards. In 2021 he appeared as a mentor on “American Idol” duetting with contestants Wyatt Pike and Graham DeFranco.

In spite of such triumphs Rector acknowledged having moments of self-doubt with regard to his artistry which he hopes to relinquish — or at the very least reassess — with “The Joy of Music” and beyond.

That focus has paid off and there’s no question “The Joy of Music” represents a major step up for Rector as a musician. “It’s the best that it has been in a long time” he croons on “Living My Best Life” the album’s gospel-tinged centerpiece. That sentiment applies to “The Joy of Music” in its entirety too.

The company Arkansas' largest electric utility has asked the state Public Service Commission to approve the rate increase which would raise monthly bills for the average residential customer by $8.27. Average usage is considered 1000 kilowatt hours per month and that monthly bill currently is $110.76 Entergy said in its filing.

The rate increase would automatically show up on bills in April unless an objection is filed to challenge the rate calculations Entergy filed with the PSC on Wednesday.

In the filing Entergy says it is paying more for fuel used to generate electricity and wholesale prices paid for additional electricity. The increase would appear as a fuel and purchased power line item on monthly bills.

""The total increase that customers could see on their bill will vary based on their individual energy usage and the kilowatt-hours consumed at their home"" Ventrell Thompson acting vice president of customer service for Entergy said in a statement Friday.

Under PSC rules Entergy's cost-recovery rider says the company must file an evaluation of its energy costs by March 15 every year. The utility is required to file working papers that outline the reasoning and costs related to the request -- regardless of whether it is a decrease or increase.

Rate adjustments go into effect automatically unless the commission's staff or other intervening parties challenge the company's calculations.

""Staff is reviewing this information now"" Donna Gray the commission's executive director said Friday. ""Absent staff or other parties raising any issue with regard to the calculation the rider provides that the new rate will go into effect for bills rendered on and after the first billing cycle of April. A procedural schedule or commission order is not required under the terms of the approved rider.""

Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge's office was non-committal when asked to comment Friday on whether it would challenge the rate change. ""The attorney general is reviewing this large increase as part of Entergy's filing"" spokeswoman Amanda Priest said.

A business consumer group is reviewing the request as well and also says it's too early to decide whether to oppose the request.

The Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers which represents large industrial and agricultural businesses is ""scrutinizing the filing to see whether there is any aspect of the requested increase that it can challenge"" Jordan Tinsley a Little Rock attorney for the group said Friday. ""Since our experts have not finished their scrutiny of the filing yet it is difficult for me to offer a prediction about what AEEC will advocate with regard to [Entergy's] filing.""

Tinsley noted that the rate increase is related to the severe weather Arkansas experienced in February 2021 when much of the state was covered in up to two feet of snow for weeks.

Entergy however said in its filing the request is primarily related to ""a large under-recovery balance as a result of higher natural gas prices in 2021 particularly in the fourth quarter.""

The company said total energy costs for 2021 spiked to $313 million a 17.4% or $46.5 million increase from 2020. That increase was ""driven by higher fuel and energy prices"" the filing said.

Gas prices escalated as the February 2021 winter storm ravaged much of the United States the company said adding that spot gas prices jumped up during the storm and remained volatile for the rest of the year.

Entergy is seeking to increase fuel recovery costs from just below 1 cent per kilowatt hour to 1.8 cents. That rate would be effective through March 2023. The utility says energy cost recovery accounts for about 9% of a residential customer's monthly bill.

Rates were lowered over the past two years the company said noting the current rate is the lowest in more than 10 years. Company officials noted the utility's efforts to bolster its energy supply through investments in areas such as nuclear power and other diversified sources has helped customers.

""At Entergy Arkansas we carefully plan and invest our resources to provide reliable power and keep rates as low as possible"" Kurt Castleberry director of resource planning and market operations said in a statement.

""Last year our nuclear generation sources set a record"" Castleberry added.. ""Low cost emission free power provides about 70% of the electricity our customers consume to help insulate them from the cost swings of natural gas. This kept the ECR [Energy Cost Recovery] rate from going even higher.""

Images courtesy of the companies.

Beginning this summer that applicant seeking auto financing might appear a little more worthy of being extended a contract because of upcoming changes by the three nationwide credit reporting agencies.

On Friday Equifax Experian and TransUnion announced significant changes to medical collection debt reporting to support consumers faced with unexpected medical bills.

The bureau said in a joint news release that these measures will remove nearly 70% of medical collection debt tradelines from consumer credit reports a step taken after months of industry research.

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation two-thirds of medical debts are the result of a one-time or short-term medical expense arising from an acute medical need.

After two years of the COVID-19 pandemic and a detailed review of the prevalence of medical collection debt on credit reports Equifax Experian and TransUnion said they are making changes to help people to focus on their personal wellbeing and recovery.

Effective July 1 the bureaus indicated paid medical collection debt will no longer be included on consumer credit reports.

In addition Equifax Experian and TransUnion said the time period before unpaid medical collection debt would appear on a consumer's report will be increased from 6 months to one year giving consumers more time to work with insurance and/or healthcare providers to address their debt before it is reported on their credit file.

In the first half of 2023 Equifax Experian and TransUnion also said they also no longer will include medical collection debt under at least $500 on credit reports.

The companies’ chief executive officer provided a joint statement on the decision to change medical collection debt reporting.

Mark Begor of Equifax Brian Cassin of Experian and Chris Cartwright of TransUnion said “Medical collection debt often arises from unforeseen medical circumstances. These changes are another step we’re taking together to help people across the United States focus on their financial and personal wellbeing.

“As an industry we remain committed to helping drive fair and affordable access to credit for all consumers” they added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy8xOS9idXNpbmVzcy9jcmVkaXQtcmVwb3J0aW5nLWFnZW5jaWVzLW1lZGljYWwtZGVidC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFSaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8wMy8xOS9idXNpbmVzcy9jcmVkaXQtcmVwb3J0aW5nLWFnZW5jaWVzLW1lZGljYWwtZGVidA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Most medical debt will not appear on your credit report if it's been paid off,"CNN —

Three of the country’s largest credit reporting agencies are removing nearly 70% of medical debt from consumer credit reports the companies announced in a joint statement Friday.

Starting July 1 Equifax (EFX) Experian (EXPGF) and TransUnion (TRU) will no longer include medical debt that went to collections on consumer credit reports once it has been paid off. That will eliminate billions of dollars of debt on consumer records.

In addition unpaid medical collection debt won’t appear on credit reports for the first year whereas the previous grace period was six months the three companies said. That will give people more time to work with their health insurers or providers to address the bills.

And starting in the first half of 2023 medical collection debt of less than $500 will no longer be included on credit reports.

Medical debt placed on credit reports can make it harder for consumers to gain access to credit or secure employment and housing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said in a report released earlier this month. It can also increase their risk of bankruptcy and prompt them to avoid future medicare care.

Even after the bills are paid the debt can linger on credit reports for up to seven years.

The three firms said they made the move after months of research.

“Medical collections debt often arises from unforeseen medical circumstances. These changes are another step we’re taking together to help people across the United States focus on their financial and personal well-being” the companies said in a joint statement.

The announcement follows research from the CFPB that shows that Americans had racked up $88 billion in medical debt on consumer credit records as of June 2021. It’s the most common debt collection on credit records the bureau said.

Medical debt can be volatile and unpredictable and can negatively affect many financially secure consumers. Black Hispanic young and low-income consumers are most likely to be impacted by medical debt the bureau said.

Concerns about medical debt have grown since the Covid-19 pandemic hospitalized millions of people and CFPB Director Rohit Chopra has been publicly critical of medical debt collections by credit reporting agencies. On March 1 Chopra said the CFPB will be “closely scrutinizing” the Big Three credit reporting agencies.

“We expect them to take seriously their role as major actors in the credit reporting system – a system whose integrity and accuracy can determine the financial futures of hundreds of millions of people” Chopra said.

Advocates at the National Consumer Law Center cheered the move though they warned that it will not help the most vulnerable patients whose serious illnesses or accidents have led to large medical bills.

“We are thrilled that the credit bureaus are removing the vast majority of medical debt from credit reports” Chi Chi Wu staff attorney at the center said in a statement. “Medical debt has damaged the credit reports of tens of millions of consumers for far too long.”

Nearly 1 in 10 Americans have medical debt

Although more than 90% of the nation has health insurance medical debt remains a major problem for millions of Americans according to a recently released Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of US Census Bureau data. That’s because many people with insurance still face high deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses.

“A serious injury or illness can cost thousands of dollars out-of-pocket to meet these deductibles and other cost-sharing requirements” the analysis’ authors wrote. “For people with a chronic illness even smaller copays and other cost-sharing expenses can accumulate to unaffordable amounts.”

Roughly 23 million people or 9% of adults owed more than $250 in health-related charges which Kaiser describes as significant debt as of December 2019.

About 1% of all adults owed more than $10000 Kaiser found. This group accounts for the vast majority of all medical debt owed.

Americans ages 35 to 64 comprised the highest share of those reporting at least $250 in medical debt. Senior citizens who are eligible for Medicare have the lowest rate.

Black Americans are far more likely to have significant medical debt with 16% reporting that they owe at least $250 compared to 9% of White and Hispanic Americans and 4% of Asian Americans.

Some 11% of women reported having medical debt compared to 8% of men. Some of the difference is likely related to childbirth costs and women’s lower average income Kaiser said.

Americans living in rural areas the South and the states that did not expand Medicaid to low-income adults were more likely to have significant medical debt.

The Census Bureau data suggests that Americans owed at least $195 billion in medical debt as of 2019 Kaiser found. The figure is much higher than the CFPB because credit reporting companies can’t see all medical debt and not all adults have credit reports.

Editor’s note: This article was updated to clarify that the credit reporting companies are removing medical debt that’s been paid off from reports starting July 1.",,,,,,,,,

The couple who have a 5-year-old son had been renting in South Slope since 2014. They began looking for something to buy about three years ago.

“Even though we’re not rolling in money we had a little bit of savings” said Ms. Dudley 41 who works in book publishing as does Mr. Dudley 45. Still not enough to buy in Brooklyn. “Anything we could possibly afford would be a stretch and a downgrade from our rental.”

Then the pandemic hit and their apartment suddenly felt small and the city itself felt claustrophobic. The couple decided to try another house hunt.

This time instead of looking in Brooklyn they looked farther out — much farther. Their plan: Keep their rental and buy a second home about three hours away in the Catskills. In August 2020 they paid $221000 for a move-in ready 100-year-old house in Roxbury N.Y.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9zZWF0dGxlL25ld3MvMjAyMi8wMy8xOS9hbWF6b24tZ3JhbnRzLWxvYW4tZm9yLTI1MC11bml0LWFmZm9yZGFibGUtaG91c2luZy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon grants $15M loan to help develop 250 units of affordable housing in Shoreline - Puget Sound Business Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/news/2022/03/19/amazon-grants-loan-for-250-unit-affordable-housing.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9zZWF0dGxlL25ld3MvMjAyMi8wMy8xOS9hbWF6b24tZ3JhbnRzLWxvYW4tZm9yLTI1MC11bml0LWFmZm9yZGFibGUtaG91c2luZy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWluc2NsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUvY3N1LW1heS1idXktZWRnZS1pbnZlc3RtZW50LWFjdGlvbi1jbGltYnMtc3R1ZGVudC1ob3VzaW5nLXNlY3RvctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CSU may buy Edge as investment action climbs in student housing sector,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.crainscleveland.com/real-estate/csu-may-buy-edge-investment-action-climbs-student-housing-sector on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWluc2NsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUvY3N1LW1heS1idXktZWRnZS1pbnZlc3RtZW50LWFjdGlvbi1jbGltYnMtc3R1ZGVudC1ob3VzaW5nLXNlY3RvctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL25ldy15b3JrLzIwMjIvMDMvMjAvdXB0aWNrLWluLWhvbWUtdmFsdWVzLXdvcnRoLW1vcmUtdGhhbi1vd25lcnMtc2FsYXJpZXMtaW4tMjAyMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uptick in Home Values Worth More Than Owners' Salaries in 2021,"Skyrocketing housing prices in 2021 turned homes into windfalls for owners some of whom earned more money thanks to the rise in the value of their property than they brought home in salary from their job.

Citing a study by the Zillow Group the Wall Street Journal is reporting the typical value of a home in the U.S. rose 19.6% in 2021 to $321634 an increase of $52667 from 2020 — more than the median income of a full-time worker which was about $50000 in 2021.

It was the first time since Zillow began crunching the numbers in 2000 that the value of a typical home was greater than inflation-adjusted median pretax income.

Home values surged around the country last year thanks to low mortgage rates and remote work allowing some to relocate from expensive cities to less expensive towns — which jacked up prices as the newcomers outbid the locals.

For some homeowners the swing between wages and home values was remarkably wide. In San Diego for instance typical homes increased in value by $160000 while the typical worker there brings in about $55000 — a difference of more than $100000.

But while the higher prices were was a boon to sellers they made it more difficult for new buyers looking to enter the housing market for the first time with less money down.

“The people who are winning the housing bids typically are folks who have higher incomes or have the equity from their previous home that they’re able to put forward” Nicole Bachaud an economist at Zillow told the newspaper. “That’s definitely a big challenge I think when we consider first-time buyers renters people who don’t already own a home and aren’t really benefiting from that equity.”

All told homeowners in the U.S. holding mortgages gained more than $3.2 million in equity last year compared to 2020 according to the report.

Halliburton announced Friday that it suspended future business in the country as the company complies with sanctions that prohibit transactions and work including for certain state-owned Russian customers. Halliburton said it will prioritize safety and reliability as it winds down its remaining operations in Russia.

Haliburton said it halted all shipments of specific sanctioned parts and products to Russia several weeks ago. Halliburton said it has no active joint ventures there.

Schlumberger said Friday that it immediately suspended investment and technology deployment to its Russia operations. It said it will continue to actively monitor this “dynamic” situation.

“Safety and security are at the core of who we are as a company and we urge a cessation of the conflict and a restoration of safety and security in the region” Schlumberger CEO Olivier Le Peuch said in a statement.

As the war continues and the deadly violence and humanitarian crisis worsens companies that remain are under increasing pressure to leave.

More than 400 U.S. and other multinational firms have pulled out of Russia either permanently or temporarily according to Jeffrey Sonnenfeld senior associate dean for Executive Programs at Yale University’s School of Management who has publicized a list of corporate actions in Russia.

Oil companies ExxonMobil Shell and BP along with some major tech companies like Dell and Facebook were among the first to announce their withdrawal or suspension of operations. Many others including McDonald’s Starbucks and Estee Lauder followed. Roughly 30 companies remain.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday asked Congress to press U.S. businesses still operating in Russia to leave saying the Russian market is “flooded with our blood.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

HubSpot user experience

HubSpot is best suited for small and medium businesses (SMBs). Users like HubSpot’s ease-of-use intuitive interface powerful dashboards excellent customer support easy integration with third-party apps and tools and free and comprehensive pricing plans. You can use each of the Hubs alone or you can connect them all under the CRM Suite.

On the downside it might not be affordable for some businesses as they scale because the cost builds up with new features and add-ons. Some users also found it lacking in advanced reporting capabilities and other in-depth functionality.

Is HubSpot right for your business?

When it comes to choosing the right CRM platform there’s no one-size-fits-all solution. HubSpot CRM is particularly suited for solopreneurs or small-to-medium business owners as it offers a free plan to meet the basic needs of your business.

As your business grows it might not be the best option since the cost accumulates quickly. A different CRM solution such as Salesforce Zoho Insightly and Nimble might be a better choice if you anticipate needing to expand your CRM capacity quickly.

You know I used to think sunflowers only came in the bright sunny yellow but then I found out about the gorgeous Black Cherry Sunflowers!

Then I found out there were hybrid varieties like the Midnight Oil Blue Sunflowers!

WeedandSeed – Etsy

Well today I found out that there is another hybrid variety called Midnight Oil Pink Sunflowers and they are spectacular!

The cool thing about sunflowers is that they are pretty easy to grow and keep up with.

They also grow pretty quickly and have huge beautiful crowning blooms!

Even I the lady with a severely black thumb can manage to grow sunflowers and that’s saying a lot.

These sunflowers are annuals so once you plant them you can collect the seeds and replant them every year if you like.

I love seeing open fields filled with sunflowers imagine how magical a field of different colored sunflowers would be.

Sunflowers also work great as a border plant and along your fence lines… plus they just make people happy.

Make sure you collect the seeds from your sunflowers when they die off so that you can share them with friends or plant more next year.

I found a couple of sellers on Etsy selling the Midnight Oil Pink Sunflower seeds so you can head on over and order yours now from WeedandSeed and HouseOfCardsByOmen.",,,,,,,,,

The Quonset Business Park in North Kingstown R.I. is similarly in the midst of a planned $234 million upgrade project a portion of which involves the rehabilitation and extension of a pier that can accommodate the needs of the offshore wind industry.

With a $40 million investment from Danish wind company Ørsted and its partner Eversource the Port of Providence is creating a new facility to be used for the fabrication and assembly of foundation components for offshore wind projects.

Examples of large investments in ports can be found up the Northeast coastline in anticipation of work for the burgeoning offshore wind industry. States are turning more and more to wind power and repurposing or building new ports to be used for staging and assembly of turbine parts or repair and maintenance facilities.

“All of the ports that can be utilized will be utilized” said Steven King managing director for the Quonset Development Corporation or QDC a quasi-state agency that serves as Rhode Island's de facto port authority.

The QDC oversees the 3200-acre Quonset Business Park which already has more than 210 companies nearly 13000 workers and is one of the top automobile importers in North America.

The QDC is also the terminal operator for the Port of Davisville — the state's only public port — in the business park. Plans are in the works for a major investment to upgrade its entire facility which includes two piers. King said there are plans to build a third pier to add more berthing capabilities and space to accommodate offshore wind businesses.

The Port of Davisville is strategically located near offshore wind lease areas where there are 2510 megawatts worth of projects in the pipeline. It was also the key port for development of Block Island Wind the five-turbine 30-megawatt farm developed by Deepwater Wind that became the United States' first operational offshore wind farm when it came online in 2016.

Quonset already bustling with 200 ships a year has signed an agreement with Ørsted and Eversource to homeport five crew transport vessels.

King said there will be competition among the states along the Northeast coast.

“We’re really focused on Port of Davisville being a logistics hub” King said. “We’re trying to position ourselves to be operations and maintenance in the long term. That’s where we see the jobs 25 years into the future.”

Opportunities for ports

The offshore industry was jump started by the Biden administration with a plan to have offshore wind farms producing 30 gigawatts of energy — enough to power 10 million homes — by 2030.

The power generated by wind turbines is measured in megawatts and the size of the turbines determines how much power is produced. The planned 62-turbine Vineyard Wind I project off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard for example is using new General Electric Haliade-X turbines with a diameter of 722 feet that will generate 800 megawatts of electricity annually enough to power 400000 homes. Block Island Wind Farm’s five turbines generate 30 megawatts enough to power 17000 homes.

States have established nearly 45000 megawatts of offshore wind procurement to date according to the American Clean Power Association. Developers plan to bring about 10300 megawatts of power online by 2026 with a dozen different offshore wind projects most in federal waters off the East Coast.

John Henshaw executive director of the Connecticut Port Authority agreed that the offshore wind industry is changing the face of ports up and down the coast. The state commitments for procurement of offshore wind as a green energy source paired with significant state and federal funding to support infrastructure projects “is making ports think about what role they might play in this evolving industry” he said.

The Connecticut Port Authority is overseeing the upgrade project at State Pier in New London that is funded jointly by the state and partners Ørsted and Eversource. It is to be used as a staging and assembly facility and one of the few ports that will be able to accommodate the massive 472-foot $500 million wind turbine installation vessel known as Charybdis which is under construction in Texas.

The State Pier project is expected to be completed in 2023 and in time to provide service to Ørsted and Eversource’s Southfork Wind project a 130-megawatt 12-turbine wind farm off Long Island. That project broke ground in East Hampton N.Y. in February and will feed power into the Long Island Power Authority grid.

New York has a goal of 9000 megawatts of offshore wind power by 2035 and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul recently announced a proposal to invest $500 million in offshore wind.

Southfork will be dwarfed by other projects in the pipeline.

The 800-megawatt 62-turbine Vineyard Wind 1 a joint venture of Avangrid Renewables and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners has broken ground on what is expected to be the nation’s first commercial scale offshore wind farm. The farm is expected to deliver power to Massachusetts next year. Avangrid Renewables is also developing Park City Wind a 804-megawatt project named after the city of Bridgeport. Avangrid is leasing space in Bridgeport’s Barnum Landing for a construction and staging location. That project is projected to produce about 14% of Connecticut’s electricity.

Ørsted and Eversource also have in the works the 704-megawatt Revolution Wind that is expected to provide 304 megawatts of power to Connecticut and 400 megawatts to Rhode Island by 2025. Sunrise Wind a 924-megawatt project also developed by Ørsted and Eversource will provide power to New York.

State Pier in New London will provide service to all three of Ørsted and Eversource’s projects. Delivery ships will arrive with the various parts of the wind turbines — the towers and blades — where they will be assembled and transported to the offshore wind farms and placed on foundations.

Advantages in New London

Connecticut is not alone in development of its ports with the aid of offshore wind investments.

The Marine Commerce Terminal in New Bedford Mass. lays claim to being the first port facility in the country designed to support construction assembly and deployment of offshore wind projects.

Ørsted and Eversource signed a $86 million supply chain contract to construct foundation components for wind turbines at the Port of Coeymans south of Albany.

At Port Jefferson in Suffolk County N.Y. Ørsted and Eversource are creating a regional operations and maintenance hub and will host the ECO Edison the first American-flagged service operation vessel. The port will include warehouse space and a 60000-square-foot facility to house staff from South Fork and Sunrise Wind projects

“These are big developments happening. If you include the New England the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states those states are targeting about 26 gigawatts of energy. It’s a lot of energy that will built over the next decade or so” said Michael Ausere vice president of business development for Eversource.

Ausere joined David Ortiz Ørsted’s head of market affairs for New England for a recent interview with The Day to discuss ongoing projects by the joint venture partners.

Ausere and Ortiz both reiterated that the lack of any obstacles such as bridges gives New London a clear advantage over other deepwater ports.

“State Pier has strategic significance not only to Ørsted and Eversource but to this industry regionally. It doesn’t mean there aren’t other port facilities we will be utilizing in other functions that complement what we’re doing at State Pier” Ortiz said.

Henshaw of the Connecticut Port Authority said he sees the developments as a good thing so long as ports have additional capacity to take on those roles or are positioned to pivot to accommodate a new business.

“Ports are also seeking to build additional capacity. Many states are making significant investments in new or existing port facilities — with some even committing to purpose-built offshore wind port projects” Henshaw said.

“The one caveat is they should keep their eyes on the long game"" he said. ""Investments should be made not only for the wind industry but for what comes after.""

If momentum for offshore wind slows Henshaw said port improvements such as the project at State Pier will have greatly increased capabilities relative to general and heavy-lift cargo resulting in expanded future business opportunities.

“New London will be well positioned for decades to come” he said.

Paul Whitescarver executive director of the Southeastern Connecticut Enterprise Region or seCTer said there are unused commercial waterfront properties along the Thames River that could be utilized for different elements of the offshore wind industry.

SeCTer’s efforts to develop an Offshore Wind Industry Cluster was one of the finalists for the U.S. Economic Development Administration’s $1 billion Build Back Better Regional Challenge. SeCTer received $500000 to fine-tune its proposal to be eligible for the second phase of federal awards of between $20 million and $100 million. Whitescarver said at some point the European offshore wind companies will want to bring their developers and suppliers to the U.S. and the region should be in a position to “roll out the red carpet.”

“Our goal is to bring economic development to the entire region and to diversify industry” he said.

The formidable popularity of tiny houses these past few years which doesn’t show any signs of dimming is confirmed by the fact that young companies specializing in custom tiny homes have become highly successful in a very short time and can hardly keep up with the demand. Founded in 2015 by a couple of young entrepreneurs who had each previously built their own tiny homes the French manufacturer Baluchon has yet to launch an unsuccessful model.A handful of enthusiastic young people together with the Australian Shepherd named Apex represent the Baluchon team. At their atelier near Nantes in the west of France they welcome customers and together they make tiny home dreams come true.As they beautifully put it a tiny home is not just a dwelling but a self-portrait which is why it must be entirely customized. They also believe in living in harmony with the environment so the Baluchon models use natural locally-sourced materials as much as possible.When it comes to mobile homes in general Europeans seem to prefer quality over quantity and not just because of the regulations regarding the size of these traveling houses. You don’t see that many super-size tiny homes here like some in the U.S. but what stands out is the exquisite attention for the design style and functionality of these lovely houses on wheels. And Baluchon’s most recent model the Kalzennig is no exception.Kalzennig is among the tiniest homes  with a total length of not even 20 feet (six meters). This might look discouraging but it’s amazing what the Baluchon team has done with this limited space. A small family could live inside because it doesn’t have just one but two bedrooms and even a sofa bed that comes in handy when guests are visiting.The main bedroom offers a beautiful view thanks to the generous windows. True there’s only enough space for the bed and a small shelf but the beautifully-decorated wall and the spotlights create the perfect ambiance. The other bedroom is smaller meant as a children’s room.One of the most interesting things about the Kalzennig is that the two rooms are connected by a net – an ingenious solution for mobility without taking any extra space. Plus this netted transition area can double as a safe but fun play area for the kids.Downstairs is the living area where a projection screen is the perfect replacement for a TV great for movie nights with friends. In front of the couch two foldable wooden tables are flexible enough for various uses. They can be used as a larger dining table for the whole family or for example one person can have breakfast at one table while somebody else is working on their laptop at the other table.Another distinctive feature of the Kalzennig is the staircase. Instead of the typical tiny home staircase that comes with small integrated storage compartments this is the other way around – it’s a generous storage cabinet with multiple compartments and drawers topped with contrasting steps that lead to the bedrooms. Again this is another ingenious way of making the most of the available space without disrupting the flow inside the home.The cozy kitchen is still big enough to integrate a generous fridge/freezer a sink an oven with a four-burner stove and cabinets for food storage. The bathroom is further down the hallway adjacent to the kitchen. It’s really small but it still manages to integrate the essentials including a shower of just 80x100 cm (31.4x 39 inches).Like all of the Baluchon creations this new tiny home is a head-turner in terms of style as well despite its limited space. Built on a double-axle trailer with a spruce frame and cedar cladding the Kalzennig boasts a light blue aluminum rooftop and the minimalistic contrast between the light blue and the natural wood color is kept throughout the entire house.The wood gives the home a cabin-inspired look while the clever layout and generous flow of natural light increase the feeling of spaciousness. The walls are insulated with a mix of natural fibers including hemp cotton and linen.The Kalzennig was custom-built for a couple living in the Loire-Atlantique area so its price wasn’t disclosed. But the Baluchon tiny homes usually start at around €80000 ($90000). It might be even smaller than the rest but this lovely home on wheels is worth it due to the truly remarkable elegant use of space.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHVsYXJtZWNoYW5pY3MuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvZzM5NDMwMDQ2L2Jlc3QtZXh0ZXJuYWwtaGFyZC1kcml2ZXMtcHM1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Best PS5 External Hard Drives in 2022 - External Hard Drives for PS5,"Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

The PlayStation 5 (PS5) is one of the best game consoles available right now. Capable of playing the latest games at stunning resolutions and frame rates the PS5 shows users what next-gen gaming has to offer.

Unfortunately it also shows how much storage space next-gen games need with popular titles like Red Dead Redemption II and NBA 2K21 taking up at least 100GB of storage space. While the PS5’s 667GB of usable internal storage may sound like a lot a handful of these big new titles can easily take up all of its storage space.

Luckily there are a few options to expand your PS5 storage space. One of the simplest methods is with a great external hard drive.

What to Consider

When picking the best external storage drive for your PS5 it’s best to keep a few things in mind.

First the PS5 cannot play PS5 games that are stored on an external storage drive. While external drives work great for storage any PS5 game you want to actively play needs to be stored on the internal storage drive. The PS5 can however play PS4 games stored on an external drive.

Second there are a ton of different kinds of external storage drives to choose from but we highly recommend using a solid state drive (SSD). Especially if you plan on playing PS4 games stored on your external drive a fast SSD will offer a much better playing experience than older cheaper hard disk drives (HDD).

XOM,ExxonMobil,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGFicm9la25ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMjAvc3VuZGF5L2d1eWFuYS1hbmQtdGhlLXdpZGVyLXdvcmxkL21vcmUtb24tbGlua3MtdG8tdGhlLWV4cGVjdGVkLWV4eG9ubW9iaWwtdHVybmFyb3VuZC1mcm9tLWl0cy16b21iaWZpY2F0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More on links to the expected ExxonMobil turnaround from its Zombification,"Introduction

Today’s column wraps-up my evaluation of whether the assertion can be plausibly sustained that Guyana’s rapidly emergent oil and gas sector has dramatically improved the fortunes of ExxonMobil going forward. An improvement in fortunes is defined by me to include both: 1) a turnaround away from the corporation’s growing indebtedness and zombification as well as 2) other deformations generally associated with this corporation. Indeed the latter mentioned deformations will be directly discussed in next week’s column. There the case is made for classifying ExxonMobil as a Zombie+ corporation.

For the purposes of my wrap-up of last week’s column as indicated above I start with the third stage in last week’s presentation which because of space was not fully completed. To recall I left undone coverage of ExxonMobil’s income opportunity as only Guyana’s income opportunity was covered last week. After that I turn attention to Stage 4 of the analysis which deals with risks facing the model.

Stage 3: ExxonMobil Opportunity

Ever since Guyana’s First Oil in December 2019 ExxonMobil has focused on growing these newly discovered upstream assets. The company’s original plan was for their earnings to grow to about US$30 billion by 2025. Originally the company was assuming US$60 per barrel Brent for Guyana crude. Since then oil prices have risen enormously peaking at US140 per barrel since the Russia/Ukraine war. Immediately preceding the impact of this war Brent price hovered around US$83 per barrel which the stock analyst [The Value Portfolio] has also used. This price was US$23 per barrel higher than the corporation’s target price. Given its 2025 projected production [ barrels per day] this means that if crude oil prices rise by 2025 earnings could be billions of dollars higher. Already earnings for Q1 2022 could annualize substantially higher this year.

ExxonMobil is therefore likely going to generate large increases in cash earnings and therefore to shareholder returns. The company has already for Q1 2022 significantly improved its debt load and has put forward proposals for improving these. Remember a company debt of US 60 billion is costing it about US$2-3 billion in annual interest charges. With that earnings strength the company’s net debt is manageable especially with the potential of further reductions going forward. As the stock analyst The Value Portfolio reminds ExxonMobil with a 5% dividend yield has recently guided share repurchases of $10 billion over the next 12-24 months. At current crude oil prices the company could be both earning roughly 10 percent for shareholders as well as having roughly US$10 billion left over. This highlights the present strength of ExxonMobil’s overall portfolio.

Stage 4: Thesis Risk

One thing above all which this years-long running series of columns on Guyana’s oil and gas sector should have made abundantly clear is that the sector’s performance is fraught with risks and uncertainty [as commonly defined in business] whether internal to the corporation or external to it. Such risks include any factor that can lower its profits or worse lead to firm failure. These factors cover the capability of management economic changes positive and negative (market demand and supply); environmental; geo-political; inter-state conflicts and war; accidents; socio-political confrontations and challenges. All these are going to affect the assessment offered below but three of these I single out for special mention here.

First the Venezuela border dispute stands out because it is a terminal risk (discussed before) Second available information reveals that the corporation is still betting heavily on continued significant growth in exploration finds within Guyana. The expectation is for a doubling in present reserves holdings. Obviously despite a record creaming rate of wells drilled to reserve finds there is no guarantee for expected additional reserves. Third the assumption is that oil prices will stay at the target level. This is patently not assured.

Assessment

The thesis advanced in last week’s column and continued to be explored today is that Guyana’s emergent oil and gas sector has contributed substantially to say the very least to the improved fortunes of ExxonMobil. Formally the thesis has been elaborated in four stages. Briefly Stage 1 relied on ExxonMobil’s announcements and specifically its guidance based on its proven reserves. These are provided in its Investors Presentation. This lays out its longer-term plans for 10 Floating Platforms for Storage and Offloading FPSOs producing around a million barrels per day. Stage 2 evaluates these assets against Guyana’s proven geologic petroleum resources. Stage 3 assesses the income opportunity for Guyana and Exxon Mobil separately. Finally Stage 4 assesses overall risks.

The Value Portfolio arrives at the following assessment:

“Every so often companies arrive at “company maker” discoveries products etc. Guyana has the potential to be a “company maker” for ExxonMobil especially with current prices >$80 / barrel Brent. The Guyana basin reasonably has the potential to earn tens of billions. Margins at current Brent prices are a massive $55 / barrel showing the portfolio’s strength”

Acknowledging the risks as highlighted above. I share this assessment of ExxonMobil’s likely turnaround away from growing indebtedness and zombification as these relate to contributions by Guyana’s emergent oil and gas sector to this outcome.

Conclusion

I had intended in this column to deal at some length with widely reported deformations of Exxon Mobil apart from its heavy indebtedness and zombie status as defined in business finance and economics. Space does not allow me this opportunity so I shall undertake this task starting in next week’s column.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2xpc2FraW0vMjAyMi8wMy8xOS9iYWtlci1odWdoZXMtc3VzcGVuZHMtbmV3LWludmVzdG1lbnQtaW4tcnVzc2lhLWFzLXdvcmxkcy1iaWdnZXN0LW9pbGZpZWxkLXNlcnZpY2VzLWNvbXBhbmllcy1jdXQtdGllcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Baker Hughes Suspends New Investment In Russia As World's Biggest Oilfield Services Companies Cut Ties,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisakim/2022/03/19/baker-hughes-suspends-new-investment-in-russia-as-worlds-biggest-oilfield-services-companies-cut-ties/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2xpc2FraW0vMjAyMi8wMy8xOS9iYWtlci1odWdoZXMtc3VzcGVuZHMtbmV3LWludmVzdG1lbnQtaW4tcnVzc2lhLWFzLXdvcmxkcy1iaWdnZXN0LW9pbGZpZWxkLXNlcnZpY2VzLWNvbXBhbmllcy1jdXQtdGllcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFhLmNvbS50ci9lbi9ldXJvcGUvNC1raWxsZWQtYXMtdXMtbWlsaXRhcnktcGxhbmUtY3Jhc2hlcy1pbi1ub3J0aGVybi1ub3J3YXkvMjUzOTgxONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4 killed as US military plane crashes in northern Norway,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFhLmNvbS50ci9lbi9ldXJvcGUvNC1raWxsZWQtYXMtdXMtbWlsaXRhcnktcGxhbmUtY3Jhc2hlcy1pbi1ub3J0aGVybi1ub3J3YXkvMjUzOTgxONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,

Riot began mining Bitcoin in 2018 from a 12 megawatt (MW) facility

One of the biggest public bitcoin (BTC) excavators Riot Blockchain (RIOT) sees this year as the time of solidification in the bitcoin mining industry and anticipates that the organization should conceivably profit from such a pattern.

The excavator said it is consistently assessing vital open doors which it might choose to attempt as a component of its essential development drives organization said in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) documenting on Tuesday.

The excavator detailed 2021 income of $213.2 million which is up 1665% from 2020 and beat normal investigator appraisals of $211.06 million as per FactSet information.

An ascent in the organization’s hashrate and bitcoin cost helped the organization’s income in 2021 the excavator said.

A rise in the company’s hashrate helped the company’s revenue

The organization detailed a total deficit of $7.9 million out of 2021 versus an overall deficit of $12.7 million out of 2020. The total deficit for the financial year 2021 was fundamentally affected by non-cash stock-based remuneration cost of $68.5 million and a non-cash undiscovered deficiency of $36.5 million on hindrance of digital forms of money as indicated by an assertion.

Revolt additionally expanded the bitcoin hung on the monetary record by 353% in 2021

contrasted with 1078 out of 2020. On March 3 the excavator said it held around 5783 self-mined bitcoins as of the end of February.

Moreover the excavator emphasized its assumptions for coming to a 2022 hashrate of 12.8 exahash each second (EH/s). By correlation its companion Marathon Digital said it hopes to come to a hashrate of 23.3 EH/s by mid 2023.

When casino chain Boyd Gaming Corp. sold the Eldorado in late 2020 it said the small gambling den was a “non-core asset” and “very modest part” of its overall business.

The new owner renovated and renamed the 1960s-era downtown Henderson casino — and now he’s set to build a hotel with it.

Developer Joe DeSimone has filed plans with the city of Henderson to construct a six-story Atwell Suites-branded hotel in the parking lot of The Pass as the casino is now known.

He aims to break ground on the 90-room roughly $20 million project in September or October he told me this week.

The hotel is slated to feature a pool and a wine bar he said noting the casino already has a parking garage.

His proposal marks yet another new venture for Water Street a once-sleepy corridor that city officials have long sought to revitalize and now boasts restaurants breweries an ice rink and increased foot traffic.

DeSimone founder of Henderson real estate firm First Federal Realty DeSimone said that he sees more activity along Water Street every week and that competition for hotel rooms is virtually nonexistent nearby.

The nearest big hotel Station Casinos’ Fiesta Henderson has been closed since the onset of the pandemic with still no word on its future.

DeSimone who acquired the former Eldorado for an undisclosed price also said he regularly sees improvements in business at The Pass 140 S. Water St. and added weekends are “very strong.”

Ground-up real estate projects in the Water Street area have for the most part been relatively small over the years. Moreover plenty of ideas have come and gone TSK Architects owner Windom Kimsey whose firm is on Water Street previously told me.

But some bigger developments have taken shape lately — most notably Lifeguard Arena the practice rink for the Silver Knights minor-league hockey team and a seven-story mixed-use project across the street The Watermark which is slated to open in the third quarter this year.

Both are near The Pass.

Strada Development Group co-founder Tom Wucherer whose firm is behind The Watermark said Friday that more construction at that end of downtown will bring even more people.

“It helps everybody” he said.

A decade ago downtown Henderson was a quiet place. As DeSimone noted it had city government operations and banks but little excitement.

Today he said there’s a “world of difference.”

“Ten years ago I don’t think anyone would consider putting a wine bar on Water Street” DeSimone said.

FedEx Express Americas President Richard Smith announced that the parcel delivery giant is investing nearly $200 million in a new sorting facility at the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport.

It’s the latest public commitment amid a flurry of formal agreements and rumored developments for the growing cargo business at the airport.

“Right now cargo is king and we expect that trend to continue for some time and Alaska and in particular Anchorage are only growing in importance over time” Smith said.

FedEx initially expects to upgrade its main ramp and 12 aircraft gates by this fall in response to increased activity through Anchorage according to Smith with additional work coming after.

The rest of the new facilities are tentatively scheduled to be open by 2024.

He quipped that the investment could “go north” of $200 million if global supply chain issues persist.

Unusually long wait times for transporting goods via cargo ship and snarled logistics at some of the nation’s biggest ports have led to substantial growth in the air cargo trade as a workaround even if it is more expensive .

A record 3.6 million tons of cargo passed through the airport — the fourth busiest cargo hub on Earth — last year up 14% from 2020 the previous record.

“This is the first time they have said ‘We are building the project; we are making the investment’ ” Anchorage Economic Development Corp. CEO Bill Popp said in an interview. “It’s an exciting announcement. They are building a very large facility.”

[Why Anchorage’s international airport is such a big cargo destination — and how it could get even bigger]

Smith revealed the company’s plans at AEDC’s annual economic forecast luncheon.

Representatives for the Memphis-based company previously indicated an expansion to its Anchorage cargo handling facilities was being considered after public notices for a proposed lease agreements at the state-owned airport were published though nothing was final.

A public notice issued in March 2021 regarding lease negotiations with FedEx outlined a $120 million project to add a new domestic operations center warehouse improvements and added aircraft parking over approximately 22 acres. The proposed lease at the time had a 30-year term with options for up to 50 years.

Anchorage Airport spokeswoman Megan Peters wrote via email that the lease negotiations with FedEx are ongoing and referred additional questions about the project to the company.

FedEx has until April 3 to sign a lease at which point a new public notice for negotiations would have to be issued if a lease is not finalized according to Peters.

A statement from a FedEx corporate spokesman in response to questions about the details of the company’s plans in Anchorage reiterated that Alaska has been an important strategic location for FedEx for decades.

“As part of the company’s continued investment in technology and operations FedEx is investing $200 million to expand and upgrade our facilities in Anchorage to handle increases in international and domestic volume and meet growing customer demand” the FedEx statement reads.

Even without a signed and sealed lease agreement the fact that a large company in a highly competitive industry would make public statements about the specific size of a project is quite significant according to Popp.

“It is a clear statement of confidence by FedEx in the value of Anchorage International Airport for their business” he said.

The FedEx announcement is the latest of five major cargo storage and logistics projects at the Anchorage airport that could total upward of $1 billion in development activity if they all move forward.

While FedEx is building near the center of the airport UPS is slowly working on its own large project estimated at $110 million at the north end of the airport.

Some of the cargo projects have been slowed by significant PFAS soil remediation work that must be done at the sites before construction can commence.

The Lakeland-based company is seeking $500000 in local government incentives for the project and a partial exemption on ad valorem taxes related to its improvements on the property.

City of Lakeland officials were mum about the identity of the company on Friday when city commissioners were briefed on the incentives at their agenda study meeting. On Monday commissioners will be asked to approve $250000 in incentives that would not be paid until Publix documents that it has hired 100 new employees for the facility at an average salary of $93526 a year twice the current Polk County average.

MARCH 21 UPDATE: The Lakeland City Commission approved the incentives without discussion. The vote was 6-0; Commissioner Stephanie Madden did not attend the meeting.

The project has been dubbed Project Horizon by Enterprise Florida a public-private partnership that works on business expansion statewide. The organization often uses code names because many of its projects involve confidential negotiations.

The FedEx building at 333 E. Lemon St. occupies the block bounded by Orange Street on the south Massachusetts Avenue on the east Lemon Street on the north and Kentucky Avenue on the west. It is situated between City Hall and Heritage Plaza.

LkldNow reported Saturday that Project Horizon involves an unidentified company looking at an unnamed building in downtown Lakeland where it plans to invest $50 million.

The confidentiality mentioned in the article surprised Polk County Commissioner Bill Braswell because the nature of the deal was discussed openly last Tuesday when the County Commission approved its half of the $500000 in requested Polk County Bonus Incentives.

“Did I miss something?” he asked in a comment he submitted to be published below the article. “This is no secret it was discussed publicly. This is Publix buying the FedEx bldg and building a 40 million dollar data center. Many of the jobs starting at 100k plus.”

Indeed a document presented to the County Commission on Tuesday identifies Project Horizon as Publix’ “IT office expansion.”

The Polk County Bonus Incentive program allows incentives to enterprises that are new to Polk or ones making major expansions. The level of incentives are based on salary levels. Project Horizon qualifies for $5000 for each new job created since the average salary will be double the county’s average wage according to county documents.

The $500000 total would be split evenly between the county and the city. Polk County anticipates dividing the payment into five annual installments starting in 2025. The city of Lakeland anticipates three annual installments.

Publix also requested a 10-year exemption on 75% of the ad valorem taxes that would be paid on assessed value of its improvements to the facility at 333 E. Lemon Street; it also requested exemption of qualifying tangible personal property taxes. The exemption is allowed under a referendum for business-expansion referendum passed by Polk voters in 2012.

The tax exemptions were approved by the County Commission.

The ad valorem tax exemptions are estimated to cost the county $183011 per year in lost revenue for 10 years. In all county government is losing $3.522845 in revenue this year due to business-expansion tax exemptions.

In its application for the tax exemptions Publix said it would invest at least $15 million in property improvements and equipment purchases at the facility which it considers an expansion of its corporate offices to expand its information technology staff.

Publix has increased its footprint downtown as its IT operations have expanded during the last decade. It already houses IT staff in multiple buildings including leased space at the Ledger building on Lime Street the Bank of America Building on Florida Avenue and the former JC Penney building on Kentucky Avenue.

In its application to the county Publix also said it is committed to local procurement the use of local vendors “where practicable” and use of green technologies.

The 142250-square-foot FedEx building was constructed in 1971 to house the Maas Brothers department store. The store was renamed Burdines in 1991 and closed in 1994. The building was purchased by Watkins Motor Lines which was later acquired by FedEx. The building is assessed at $7.248 million by the Polk County Property Appraiser’s Office.

With the current mix of potential stock market headwinds on deck could investing in cyclical stocks make sense now? Well for one thing this section of thestock market todayis closely linked to the state of the economy. The likes of which continue to recover at a notable pace. Sure there is the issue of inflation weighing in on consumer spending now. With the economy running hot the Federal Reserve has finally approved the first interest rate hike in more than three years. Not to mention the latest weekly jobless claims came in below expectations a further testament to the strength of the economy.

As all of these factors come into play some investors could be considering cyclical stocks. For one thing companies in the cyclical space are not sitting idly by amidst all this. Take Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) for instance. As of last week the energy firm is working with European jet-maker Airbus. Through the four-year deal Occidental will be supplying Airbus with emissions-offsetting carbon credits. Furthermore even consumer discretionary firms like Roblox (NYSE: RBLX) are expanding their offerings as well. The company is reportedly looking to hire a PlayStation software engineer which could help in expanding the reach of its platform. With all this in mind here are four cyclical stocks making headlines in the stock market now.

FedEx Corporation

Another cyclical name worth noting in thestock market todaywould be the FedEx Corporation. Overall FedEx is one of if not the most prominent players in the logistics business now. Through its vast portfolio the company primarily offers transportation e-commerce and business services. For a sense of scale FedEx’s operations rake in revenue of roughly $90 billion per year. More importantly FDX stock seems to be gaining attention following its latest quarterly earnings update.

In it FedEx reported earnings of $4.59 per share alongside revenue of $23.6 billion. For comparison consensus forecasts on Wall Street were expecting $4.64 and $23.4 billion respectively. For the most part the focus of investors today seems to be FedEx’s earnings miss. Even so the company continues to go from strength to strength on the operational front. Through solid performances from its team FedEx is now looking at record December operating income figures. The company highlights higher revenue per shipment and a net fuel benefit throughout its transportation divisions as key contributors to this. As such would you consider FDX stock worth investing in amidst the current dips?

Wesley Bryan knew he was going to need a good one.

He entered Sunday’s final round at the Valspar Championship in a share of 53rd position. Typically Tour pros near the bottom of the leaderboard approach final rounds with apathy; there’s neither stress nor fear of consequence. Bryan is no stranger to that approach having once blitzed through his final round at the BMW Championship in less than 90 minutes.

• 1 hour 29 minutes

• 14 pars

• 3 birdies

• 1 bogey

But this was no ordinary round. Bryan was making the final start of his major medical extension an exemption category that allowed him a certain number of starts with which he could regain his card. He needed a sixth-place finish to retain full PGA Tour status while solo 51st or better would allow him to claim partial status alongside pros who finished Nos. 126-150 on the FedEx Cup points list last season.

For Bryan even getting to the weekend was no simple task. With three holes to play on Friday he sat just outside the cut line. He make a 16-footer for birdie at No. 7 (his 16th hole of the day) to get just inside that cut line. At No. 8 he found a bush hacked out of it (below) and got up-and-down for a miraculous bogey that gave himself a chance. And then he striped a drive down the fairway at No. 9 hit a wedge to three feet and rolled it in to make the weekend.

Hit his approach to 3 feet on the final hole for birdie and made the cut on the number.

Bryan played well on Saturday but finished with a bogey to post one-under 70 leaving him just outside the top 50 as he stared down Sunday.

“It’s going to take a special one” Bryan said post-round to the PGA Tour.

But on Sunday as conditions toughened Bryan’s birdie reserves seemed to dry up. He hit just eight of 18 greens and spent most of the day scrambling for par. As he reached the Valpsar’s Snake Pit — the challenging trio of 16 17 and 18 — he needed to play them in at least one under par to have a chance. Instead he bogeyed 16 made two more pars to finish and signed for a two-over 73 and a share of 62nd.

After the round he took to Twitter to express his thanks to those who have followed his chase for status.

“Been a long few years spent most of it rehabbing shoulder and wrist” he wrote. “Thank you to everyone for the support this week….definitely felt the love out there. I tried my hardest….came up short. It stings but I’m not done trying.”

Been a long few years spent most of it rehabbing shoulder and wrist. Thank you to everyone for the support this week….definitely felt the love out there. I tried my hardest….came up short. It stings but I’m not done trying ✌🏽 https://t.co/g3tRcIrar1 — Wesley Bryan (@wesleybryangolf) March 20 2022

What “not done trying” means is that Bryan will continue to hunt for starts on Tour for the rest of the season using his status as a past champion. He’ll hope to tee it up as soon as next week’s Corales Puntacana Resort and Club Championship and is confirmed in the field at the RBC Heritage the week after the Masters.

At the time of his victory at the 2017 RBC Bryan was on a rapid ascent through the world rankings. The trick-shot-artist-turned-pro won three times on the Korn Ferry Tour in 2016 before bursting onto the PGA Tour and winning that following April. He had four other top-seven finishes that year.

But since then Bryan has battled injuries and struggled to find his form. His T12 at the 2020 Sanderson Farms Championship was his best result since 2017. He made zero starts in 2019 and just 23 total in the three years since. Bryan’s 2022 began with a promising T27 at the Sony Open but he missed his next three cuts entering this week’s Valspar.

He finished the week at two under par. Four under would have given him a 10-way tie of 48th place; five under would have guaranteed him partial status for next season. Instead he’ll start on the steepest road in the golf world: the one that leads back to the gates of the PGA Tour.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhdGltZXMuY28ua3Ivd3d3L3RlY2gvMjAyNC8wNC8xMjlfMzI1ODA1Lmh0bWzSAT9odHRwczovL20ua29yZWF0aW1lcy5jby5rci9wYWdlcy9hcnRpY2xlLmFtcC5hc3A_bmV3c0lkeD0zMjU4MDU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LG Electronics suspends shipments to Russia,"LG Electronics' plant in Ruza Russia / Korea Times file



By Kim Hyun-bin



LG Electronics has suspended all shipments of goods to Russia following Samsung Electronics' decision to do so due to the disruption in global maritime logistics that has worsened in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.



""LG Electronics is suspending all shipments to Russia and will continue to keep a close watch on the situation as it unfolds"" LG Electronics said through its global newsroom. ""We are deeply concerned for the health and safety of all people and LG remains committed to supporting humanitarian relief efforts.""



The company says the suspension of shipments to Russia came in response to global maritime logistics disruptions.



Global shipping companies such as Germany's Hapag-Lloyd Denmark's Musk and Switzerland's MSC have suspended shipping to Russia due to their participation in sanctions against Russia.



Earlier this month Samsung Electronics announced that all shipments to Russia had been suspended due to logistics disruptions.



However neither company has declared a total boycott of sales to the Russian market. Nevertheless analysts believe the companies have taken a position that satisfies the international community on sanctions against Russia.



After Russia invaded Ukraine last month global companies such as Starbucks Coca-Cola Nike Apple GM PayPal FedEx Boeing and Tesla have been taking part in the boycott of Russia.



Although public opinion on the international sanctions is strong local companies are hesitant to take part in the boycott prematurely as their large investments and leading sales in the Russian market could make them lose ground to pro-Russian countries such as China. This situation is why the companies have chosen to suspend their shipments to Russia instead of taking part in the boycott directly.



LG Electronics operates a home appliance and TV production plant at a factory outside of Moscow. Products produced at this plant are sold to Russia and the neighboring Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).



Although LG Electronics' Russian plant is currently in operation disruptions are inevitable if the suspension prolongs and their stock of key parts is exhausted.



According to LG Electronics' business report last year's sales in Russia and the neighboring region totaled 2.033 trillion won ($1.68 billion).

But these days she’s one of the women who are paving new trails in the field of architecture which remains just one-quarter female in the United States according to the American Institute of Architecture.

She is also one of the 50 most influential women in West Michigan according to the Grand Rapids Business Journal.

Every two years the GRBJ highlights the leadership of women across different fields. On March 10 Feenstra Wall attended the awards event where she and two other Calvin alumnae were recognized for their work.

As the principal at Mathison Architects Feenstra Wall has come a long way in recognizing her own influence. “I think a few years ago I would have been like ‘I don’t think I belong on that list’” she said. “I didn’t realize my influence until the last few years that I had a voice; not only did I have things to say but people were listening.”

Michelle Van Dyke president and CEO of Heart of West Michigan United Way who’s received the award multiple times experienced the impact of her work in a tangible way when another awardee and former employee approached her after the ceremony. Tracy Hornback is the CEO at Legacy Trust and previously worked for Van Dyke at Fifth Third Bank. “She came up to me after the ceremony yesterday and hugged me and she said ‘I owe it all to you’” Van Dyke said.

Rachel VerWys executive director at Safe Haven Ministries and a social work alum who has taught at Calvin as an adjunct professor — a second-time awardee — recognized the importance of women supporting women. “As a female leader in the community it’s just an honor to know that the work is part of a fabric of people. You know it’s bigger than me” VerWys told Chimes.

“Law of obedience grit and determination”

Van Dyke graduated from Calvin with a business economics degree in 1985 but she had wanted to be a banker since early elementary school.

Her journey to becoming CEO began when she was just seven. In her hometown of Shaker Heights Ohio Van Dyke took the rapid transit to the end line where her bank was. She deposited her birthday money and babysitting earnings full of amazement and with a deep sense of intrigue caused by being in such an establishment. “I would tell my parents at the dinner table ‘I’m going to own a bank one day’ and you know they would laugh” Van Dyke said.

And so it happened.

After graduating Van Dyke joined Fifth Third Bank. She began as a branch manager trainee and was eventually promoted to president of the Fifth Third Mortgage Company.

Thirty years into her career with the bank Van Dyke felt called to change paths. “Something was calling me to the nonprofit world and you know get to give back to the community that had given me so much” Van Dyke said.

That was when the board chair of Heart of West Michigan United Way called her as one of the obligatory CEO calls he was making to promote open positions. “He called me and he said ‘would you ever consider running United Way?’ And I said ‘you know I would’” Van Dyke told Chimes. The positive response took the caller by surprise; things moved quickly from there. Now Van Dyke has been leading Heart of West Michigan United Way an organization that fights poverty in Kent County for six years.

VerWys also felt called to her field from a young age. She graduated from Calvin with a bachelor’s of social work and a tailored minor in urban missions.

“I lived in the southeast side of Grand Rapids in an urban community and the intersections of different vulnerabilities that social work really addresses were part of my own life there in my neighborhood” VerWys told Chimes.

In addition to what she described as “the understanding of life” she gained through that VerWys saw her uncle who was a social worker finalize an adoption while she was in middle school. Those influences shaped her view of the field and inspired her to pursue it.

But her path to executive director of Safe Haven Ministries wasn’t linear.

“That summer after I graduated I worked in a factory and stacked cubicle pieces all summer long” VerWys said. After that she and her husband who’s also a social worker took a two-year “Service and Training” position at World Renew in Southern California to learn about community development. She then attended graduate school and helped found Kingdom Causes Bellflower to fight homelessness.

VerWys also works to fight human trafficking: “To be a startup in a grassroots organization doing advocacy and justice work is this law of obedience grit and determination” she said.

This sense of determination was also present in Feenstra Walls’ life. After graduating from Calvin with a degree in art and engineering and an art history minor she worked towards getting her architecture license. Her career started during the great recession.

“ “It’s not easy to look around and be the only woman in the row

“One of the first things that people do when the money is gone is stop their building projects; so there were very few jobs in the profession” she said. At the time Feenstra Wall knew of one firm in Grand Rapids that was hiring and through a connection to a principal who worked there –– and was coincidentally teaching business at Calvin –– she began her career.

‘Where were you?’

“As I grew older I started to realize that I think I really was pushing myself into leadership positions because I wasn’t happy with the status quo” Van Dyke told Chimes.

About half of architecture graduates are female. Yet as of 2019 women made up only about 25% of licensed architects.

“So somewhere between graduation and licensure which takes 10 years women just drop out” Feenstra Wall said. This percentage is even lower when considering people of color: “We’re at like 2% of licensed architects are Black and that’s embarrassing” Feenstra Wall told Chimes.

“ ”I suddenly realized that people were listening to me

Feenstra Wall felt the gender disparity in the profession in her personal life.

Feenstra Wall has three children: a nine year old son and two six-year old daughters. When her twins were about one year old she felt lonely in her profession. She knew more and more women were entering the field but knew few of them who were from her generation.

“So I actually started seeking them out; I went on to the website of the state licensing board and I found all the female-sounding names and I ‘Google-stalked’ them” Feenstra Wall said.

“I got a lunch sponsored by a builder and these women showed up and I was just like ‘Where were you?’ And I made some really good friendships through that process” she said.

‘People were listening to me’

For each of these women being in leadership entailed different challenges in their careers: both as they asserted their space in their positions and came to terms with their own leadership styles.

Van Dyke is the first female bank president in Grand Rapids. “So that was a trail to blaze so to speak. While it did not deter me and I was excited about it you know it’s not easy to look around and be the only woman in the row” Van Dyke said.

“We tend to look towards this traditional leader as sort of this male loud forceful pushing type and I don’t think that’s what real leadership is” Feenstra Wall told Chimes.

Feenstra Wall remembers a meeting she led a couple of years ago that opened her eyes. As she noticed people’s receptiveness to the resources she recommended she knew her authority was being valued.”I suddenly realized that people were listening to me” she said.

“It took me forever to understand that I didn’t have to change myself to fit someone else’s mold of who a leader is. If I had figured that out sooner I think I could have started working on my own strengths and weaknesses” Feenstra Wall said.

Family also played a role in these women’s leadership. “I have been working full time all of my career so my husband actually is a stay-at-home dad and stayed home from the time when our oldest turned a year and a half” Van Dyke said. She said his support is critical.

“I have had people look at my resume and be like ‘Oh it’s kind of flexible’; And that wasn’t necessarily a compliment that they intended to give me” VerWys said thinking of the choices she made through her career to best manage her work life and family development.

“Now my resume says I am an amazing carpool facilitator because I work with eight families to figure out how my four kids are going to get to and from school every day. And that organization happens before I even get to the office every day” VerWys said.

“It’s 2022 and I still struggle with the fact that people always ask me if I stay home with my kids or what does my husband do; it drives me crazy” Feenstra Wall said. Her mother who taught at Calvin played an important role in the way she viewed women leadership. Seeing her mother complete her PhD while she was in middle school impacted her more than she realized at the time.

“I think it’s a gift to know that there are so many women who have gone before us” VerWys said. “You’ll along your journey have opportunity to do things that feel out of the box; and those are sometimes the best experiences.”

Reflecting on her own experience Van Dyke said: “I tell women if you’re able to take the risk because it will pay off.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlc3B1bi5jb20vbW9yZS9uYXNjYXIvbmFzY2FyLXdvcmxkLXJlYWN0cy10by1yaWNreS1zdGVuaG91c2VzLWNyYXNoLXRvZGF50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NASCAR World Reacts To Ricky Stenhouse's Crash Today,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://thespun.com/more/nascar/nascar-world-reacts-to-ricky-stenhouses-crash-today on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlc3B1bi5jb20vbW9yZS9uYXNjYXIvbmFzY2FyLXdvcmxkLXJlYWN0cy10by1yaWNreS1zdGVuaG91c2VzLWNyYXNoLXRvZGF50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,
FSLR,First Solar,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9zb2xhci1nYXJkZW4tYmVhdXR5LWluLWV5ZS1vZi1iZWhvbGRlci82MDAxNTc2MTkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Solar vs. scenery: Scandia solar panels show a tense debate,"SCANDIA — The roads that lead to this town in northern Washington County do most of the convincing ferrying visitors past timeless wooden barns the Scandia Creamery Banquet Hall and on to the brick steeple of Elim Lutheran Church set on a hillside at the town's center.

If there's a romantic country scene that comes to mind when people say the words ""scenic Minnesota"" it's here.

And then there are the solar panels. After a 2013 state law called for the creation of community solar gardens — a typical garden amounts to a five-acre spread — Scandia became home to one and then two and now six solar arrays. While some fans of renewable energy cheered their arrival the panels have made other locals wary of what's happening to their prized open land and bucolic charm.

""We call them solar farms which a lot of people feel that's a misnomer"" said Scandia Mayor Christine Maefsky. ""They're industrial devices.""

Tensions flared anew when a local man suggested he could build the town's seventh community solar garden if Scandia would tweak its rules governing where the arrays can be built. Instead of a tweak the City Council may soon implement a one-year moratorium on solar gardens as they consider a balance between solar and preserving the town's rural feel.

It's not just in Scandia. Driven by ever-lower costs and the push for renewable energy solar gardens are on track to more than double across the state. The mushrooming expansion is forcing cities and towns to weigh the rights of property owners and the perceived rights of a community that doesn't want the view to change. Some residents also worry that they're shouldering the burden for urbanites who want solar but don't have the space to install it.

Mike Lubke pulled his son Julian across snow-covered fields on his 80-acre property in Scandia Minn. Mike Lubke wants to build a solar array on his property but the Scandia City Council may decide to pass a moratorium on all solar instead of approve his project.

""It's actually a national issue"" said Brian Ross vice president at the Great Plains Institute and a consultant for communities facing solar's surging growth. ""It's not just Minnesota.""

Searching for solutions

It wasn't uncommon in the early days of solar gardens for the projects to find at least some local opposition but six years after the first one opened near Kasota in September 2015 town boards and local officials still struggle to find an approach that works.

A year ago the Wright County Board of Commissioners enacted a one-year moratorium on solar gardens fearing that the rush of applications was among other issues forever altering prime farmland and filling in a vital economic development corridor along Interstate 94 from Albertville to Clearwater. The moratorium gave the county time to figure out ""fact from fiction about what is actually taking place"" said County Commissioner Darek Vetsch. ""These solar farms kind of came at us fast and furious around 2015 and ordinances were enacted quickly and they didn't necessarily have the language and the research done enough.""

Vetsch said he's not opposed to solar but he's not yet convinced by it either. The moratorium ended with tighter rules for solar garden developers. A new one-mile separation requirement between gardens will help close a tax loophole and has the secondary benefit of preserving open space said Vetsch.

In other places local control has been tough to enforce as the McLeod County Board of Commissioners found last summer when they saw their rejection of a proposed solar garden overturned in court. The Minnesota Court of Appeals said the board's concerns about neighboring property values and the solar garden's use of prime farmland were arbitrary or capricious and ordered the board to approve the 3.5-acre project in Hale Township about 55 miles west of Minneapolis.

The wrangling over setbacks land use and sight lines looks only to continue as Xcel Energy says plans are underway to more than double the state's 426 solar gardens while larger utility-scale solar projects will grow from today's 268 megawatts to 2500 megawatts by 2032. A Metropolitan Council survey last summer found that solar installations were 7 % or 1335 acres of the metro-area farmland or vacant land that got developed from 2016 to 2020.

'Done our share'

The first community solar garden landed in Scandia to much fanfare. Then-mayor Randall Simonson crowed that the site at the busy Minnesota Hwy. 97 and Manning Avenue intersection would showcase the town's commitment to renewable energy. But complaints quickly piled up and the town's solar ordinance was paused amended and then repealed by 2017. A new ordinance in 2019 set height limits and required deeper setbacks and vegetation to obscure the panels.

Today six solar arrays dot the roadsides and intersections here pumping out nearly 20 megawatts. Ten more solar gardens sit scattered throughout Washington County.

""We've got a number of people saying we've got more than enough generating capacity in the city of Scandia"" said Steve Kronmiller who sits on the Scandia City Council. ""We've done our share let somebody else do their share. We want to benefit from our open spaces too.""

Kronmiller said the Scandia viewsheds are an amenity worth protecting: the town bills itself as a tourist destination and has fought for years to have a bike trail extended from nearby William O'Brien State Park to draw more people looking for scenic recreation.

There's also the sense that Scandia is making room for the solar panels that people in Ramsey County are asking for said Kronmiller. The state's solar garden law allows the owner of a solar garden to sell that electricity in the same county or an adjacent one.

These feelings were already in place when local resident Mike Lubke told Scandia officials last summer that he wanted to build the city's seventh solar garden near a pond on his land a five-acre array with room for sheep to graze under the raised panels. His proposal requires an amendment to the city's ordinance to allow solar installations on shore land but rather than change the ordinance city councilors said they would prefer to take a break pass the moratorium and look at all aspects of solar development.

""I understand their viewpoint"" said Lubke. ""Yes [the moratorium] sets us back but I also want to make sure the ordinance is set for the long term and not just my property.""

The city's screening requirements for solar gardens could be more effective if they were more flexible said Lubke so he's proposing some alternate ideas along with a bigger setback from certain roads in town.

He'd even be willing to install a plastic screen like one being used at a solar garden in River Falls Wis.; the light brown screen has prairie grass images printed on it and hangs from the panels disguising the array.

The end result of Lubke's pitch is that if the city changed its ordinance in the ways he's proposed two new Scandia parcels including his would be eligible for solar gardens two other parcels that are already eligible could be expanded and approximately 17 parcels would be eliminated due to the tightened setback rules.

Lines filling up

Some Scandia residents point just down the road to Chisago County for what they consider a disquieting vision of what the future could bring.

Solar gardens started blooming there soon after the 2013 law passed some with little-to-no screening from nearby roads. Spurred on by Xcel Energy's Solar Rewards program the largest solar gardens initiative in the nation the county developed solar so quickly that today there are 38 installations in place or in planning stages.

""We support solar energy in Scandia"" said Maefsky the mayor who has said she's in favor of a moratorium. ""But we also recognize that they have an impact on neighbors and we need to protect neighbors and protect the city as a whole as well as we can so that they don't become intrusive.""

It might be that the electric grid will soon force a pause in Scandia's solar economy. A spokeswoman for Xcel Energy said so many solar gardens were installed in Chisago and Washington counties that the feeder lines and substations in that part of the metro are essentially full.

""We are reaching the point where upgrades are needed in order to interconnect"" said spokeswoman Lacey Nygard. The installation of a new solar garden might require the developer to pay for grid upgrades with the potential for big costs if new infrastructure is required she added.

This is the second time Solar makes an appearance on the show as she was actually the very first person to film for Showterview!

Two years later Jessi couldn’t help pointing out how much Solar has changed. Little did she know the reason why is because having gotten to know Jessi better Solar no longer thinks she’s intimidating! During the interview Solar she wrote down was a smiley face as one of the keywords to describe herself the reason being that she sees herself as someone who smiles a lot.

But then Jessi hilariously pointed out that Solar used to not smile much when they had their first interview at the beginning of the show saying “You look happier now!”

Except Solar feels like she’s always been a smiling person. In a hilarious revelation Solar claimed that the reason why she smiled less the first time she came on Showterview was because she found Jessi a little intimidating…and Jessi’s reaction was priceless.

Solar explained that she felt nervous at that time but since then she’d come to get to know Jessi’s sweet side…

Parker a pioneering astrophysicist whose contributions to solar physics were so enormous that NASA named its Parker Solar Probe mission after him died March 15. He was 94.

Parker was internationally known for proposing the concept of the solar wind—an idea that was first met with skepticism to outright ridicule. The theory was later proven to be correct reshaping our picture of space and the solar system. Parker went on to revolutionize the field of astrophysics unraveling the complex physics behind magnetic fields in space and the dynamics of plasma.

In August 2018 at the age of 91 he became the first person to witness the launch of their namesake spacecraft.

That same year Parker was asked about the advice he would give to early-career scientists.

“I have never made a significant proposal but what there was a crowd who said ‘Ain’t so can’t possibly be’” Parker responded. “If you do something new or innovative expect trouble. But think critically about it because if you’re wrong you want to be the first one to know that.”

“I don’t think it is in any way an overstatement to say that the field of heliophysics exists today largely because of the work of Dr. Eugene Parker” said Nicky Fox director of NASA’s Heliophysics Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington and a friend of Parker’s. “Even though Dr. Parker is no longer with us his discoveries and legacy will live forever.”

‘Utter nonsense’

Born in 1927 in Houghton Michigan Parker completed his undergraduate degree in physics from Michigan State University in 1948 and his Ph.D. from Caltech in 1951. He spent time as an instructor and assistant professor at the University of Utah before accepting a position in 1955 at the University of Chicago where he remained for the rest of his career.

In 1957 Parker was a young assistant professor when he turned his attention to the temperature of the corona of the sun. Running through the math he determined the conditions should produce a supersonic flow of particles off the sun’s surface.

The idea was roundly criticized. “The first reviewer on the paper said ‘Well I would suggest that Parker go to the library and read up on the subject before he tries to write a paper about it because this is utter nonsense’” Parker told UChicago News in 2018.

The paper might not have been published but for Parker’s colleague at the University Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. The editor of the journal and a future Nobel laureate Chandrasekhar didn’t like the idea either—but he couldn’t find a flaw with Parker’s math so he overrode the reviewers and published the paper.

Shortly afterward in 1962 NASA’s Mariner II spacecraft flew to Venus and encountered a constant stream of particles. This flow called the solar wind turned out to be incredibly influential on the workings of the solar system including our lives on Earth. It blankets the planets protecting us from harmful radiation—but also occasionally disrupting our communications in the case of solar flares.

“Gene Parker was a legendary figure in our field—his vision of the sun and the solar system was way ahead of his time” said Angela Olinto the Albert A. Michelson Distinguished Service Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics and dean of the Physical Sciences Division at the University of Chicago. “It is only fitting that Gene’s name is quite literally written in our star the sun and in the physics that describe stars.”

Over his career Parker also went on to study cosmic rays and the magnetic fields of galaxies among many other related topics. His seminal ideas include the origin of magnetic fields known as dynamo theory; rapid dissipation of magnetic fields; the structure of magnetized shock waves; and the diffusion of high-energy cosmic rays.

“It is only fitting that Gene’s name is quite literally written in our star.” — Angela Olinto dean of the Physical Sciences Division

His name is littered across astrophysics: the Parker instability which describes magnetic fields in galaxies; the Parker equation which describes particles moving through plasmas; the Sweet-Parker model of magnetic fields in plasmas; and the Parker limit on the flux of magnetic monopoles.

“The University and the department has lost one of its giants” said Michael Turner the Bruce V. and Diana M. Rauner Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of Astronomy and Astrophysics at UChicago and a colleague of Parker’s for decades. “Gene changed the course of science with his work on magnetic fields literally everywhere in the cosmos but he remained humble and approachable with a wry sense of humor.

“He ranked up there with Stephen Hawking in his ability to express the gist of an issue scientific or otherwise in a few clear sentences.”

Parker twice served as chair of the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics and also served as chair of the astronomy section of the National Academy of Sciences.

“Gene represented to me the ideal physicist—brilliant and accomplished personable articulate but also humble” said Robert Rosner the William E. Wrather Distinguished Service Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics and a longtime colleague. “I will never forget the pleasure he took in exploring a science problem and his terrific physical insights which were then buttressed by his analytical skills. And one can never forget the encouragement he gave to everyone he interacted with—his own students and postdocs and his colleagues. His passing indeed marks a great loss for us all.”

He retired from the University in 1995 but remained active in the field publishing articles and books.

In 2017 NASA announced that it was naming its landmark solar mission after Parker as a recognition of his contributions to the field of heliophysics.

“It was so exciting to have the honor of taking Gene into the cleanroom at the Applied Physics Lab to introduce him to “his” spacecraft—and of course I said “Parker meet Parker” said Fox.

“The way his eyes lit up at every new image or data plot—that was the true Gene always striving to learn more about our universe.” — Nicky Fox director of NASA’s Heliophysics Division

On the morning of August 12 2018 Parker was at Cape Canaveral with three generations of his family to witness the launch of his namesake Parker Solar Probe which has since completed multiple revolutions around the sun and collected extraordinary data.

“The continued joy that Gene showed every time I shared new results from the mission with him—the way his eyes lit up at every new image or data plot—that was the true Gene always striving to learn more about our universe” Fox said.

Among Parker’s many awards are the U.S. National Medal of Science the Kyoto Prize the Crafoord Prize the American Physical Society Medal for Exceptional Achievement in Research and its James Clerk Maxwell Prize. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences and was a fellow of the American Physical Society and a Legacy Fellow of the American Astronomical Society.

He authored four books: Interplanetary Dynamical Processes (1963) Cosmical Magnetic Fields: Their Origin and Their Activity (1979) Spontaneous Current Sheets in Magnetic Fields with Applications to Stellar X-rays (1994) and Conversations on Electric and Magnetic Fields in the Cosmos (2007).

“We are devastated by the loss of my father but we know his legacy spans not only our family and friends but the international community of scientists around the globe” said his son Eric Parker. “We extend our gratitude to everyone who has reached out with memories for his colleagues over the years who worked with him to explore a subject which gave him much joy and for the many people at NASA and the Applied Physics Laboratory who welcomed my father and gave him a profound gift—the chance to see the launch of the Parker Solar Probe which moved him deeply.”

Parker was invited to attend a ceremony in Sweden next month to celebrate the Crafoord Prize which he won in 2020. His family plans to attend the ceremony on Parker’s behalf.

Parker is survived by his wife Niesje to whom he was married for 67 years as well as brother Phillip; son Eric Glenn Parker (married to Susan) and daughter Joyce Marie Parker (married to Ed); grandchildren Owen Loh (married to Allison) Miles Loh (married to Michelle) and Nolan Loh (fiancée Hillary Wang); and great-grandchildren Lena and Elliott.

This week: the Beta 21 quartz movement.

A disaster — this is how the watch industry tends to look back on the emergence of quartz technology in the 1970s-1980s. It caused particular havoc in Switzerland where the existing economy based around mechanical watches was decimated. While this was a crisis (the “Quartz Crisis”) for Switzerland it was a revolution (the “Quartz Revolution”) for Japanese companies pumping out affordable watches and for the public who could now easily afford them. Were the Swiss simply blindsided by a new technology out of Japan?

That’s how this period in the history of watches is often characterized. Indeed Japanese watchmaker Seiko did announce the first quartz watch to market and many Swiss watchmakers failed to compete with the later mass production of ultra-affordable watches from the region. Swiss quartz watches of the time are often thought of as a reaction to Japanese products — but the Swiss-made Beta 21 quartz movement developed concurrently with Seiko’s tells a different story.

The first quartz wristwatch to market the 1969 Seiko Astron is often cited as marking the beginning of the Quartz Crisis. Quartz timekeeping however goes back to the early 20th century at Bell Labs in the United States while subsequent innovations like early electric watches from the likes of Hamilton and Bulova also furthered the tech that would eventually make quartz wristwatches possible. There were different approaches to the electronic future of timekeeping but quartz was recognized as a promising solution by the early 1960s.

In 1962 no fewer than 20 Swiss watch companies banded together to form the Centre Electronique Horloger for the purpose of creating a quartz wristwatch movement. In 1967 the first prototypes called Beta 1 were shown — and Seiko announced prototypes the same year. The race was neck-in-neck. Finally Seiko crossed the finish line on December 25 1969 to be followed by the Swiss only four short months later."

While owner Michael Bidwill suggested this year that a changeup could be on the horizon there is apparently another group of NFL fans who dig Arizona’s current jerseys.

According to an Offers.Bet survey of more than 1000 NFL fans the Cardinals currently have the sixth-best uniforms in the league.

In order of first- to fifth-best they rank behind the Carolina Panthers Cincinnati Bengals Pittsburgh Steelers Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers.

The 1110 Americans surveyed were 48% female 52% male and had an average age of 38.

Arizona’s NFC West peers in the Seattle Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams rank 28th and 29th in the survey respectively.

The Cleveland Browns come in with the worst-rated uniforms just ahead of the newly rebranded Washington Commanders in 31st and Jacksonville Jaguars in 30th.

As for the Cardinals their jerseys have not been altered much in recent memory.

While the team has worn color-rush alternatives in recent years the red and white primary jerseys received their last major redesign in 2005. They were altered slightly when the NFL changed outfitters going away from Reebok and to Nike in 2012.

Of what could be changed looking ahead Bidwill told Arizona Sports’ Bickley & Marotta in February that the franchise was looking into a redesign.

“We look at all these things. You probably know these things there’s a timeline for them. It takes time” Bidwill said. “Among the array of things we look at around the team it’s on the radar.

“We’re going to honor tradition at the same time. It’s part of the array of things we look at. It’s on the radar screen.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vbmZsc3BpbnpvbmUuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMjAvbmZsLXJ1bW9ycy1iZXN0LWxhbmRpbmctc3BvdHMtcWJzLzIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NFL rumors: Best landing spots for remaining QBs via trade free agency,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlc3B1bi5jb20vbmZsL2FmYy1ub3J0aC9waXR0c2J1cmdoLXN0ZWVsZXJzL3N0ZWVsZXJzLXdpZGUtcmVjZWl2ZXItamFtZXMtd2FzaGluZ3Rvbi1zaWducy13aXRoLWRhbGxhcy1jb3dib3lz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Steelers WR James Washington Reportedly Signs With Cowboys,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://thespun.com/nfl/afc-north/pittsburgh-steelers/steelers-wide-receiver-james-washington-signs-with-dallas-cowboys on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlc3B1bi5jb20vbmZsL2FmYy1ub3J0aC9waXR0c2J1cmdoLXN0ZWVsZXJzL3N0ZWVsZXJzLXdpZGUtcmVjZWl2ZXItamFtZXMtd2FzaGluZ3Rvbi1zaWducy13aXRoLWRhbGxhcy1jb3dib3lz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vaGVhdnkuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9uZmwvY2xldmVsYW5kLWJyb3ducy9vZGVsbC1iZWNraGFtLWphcnZpcy1sYW5kcnktcm9kZ2Vycy1wYWNrZXJzL9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vaGVhdnkuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9uZmwvY2xldmVsYW5kLWJyb3ducy9vZGVsbC1iZWNraGFtLWphcnZpcy1sYW5kcnktcm9kZ2Vycy1wYWNrZXJzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Beckham Landry Reunion Floated With Green Bay Packers,"When Odell Beckham Jr. orchestrated his release from the Cleveland Browns in November it appeared as though the wide receiver’s days of playing alongside his former LSU teammate Jarvis Landry were over. But appearances can be deceiving.

Beckham went on to win a Super Bowl with the Los Angeles Rams but tore his ACL in the process while Landry gutted out an injury-laden season in Cleveland only to see the team order his release on March 14. The two good friends are now both free agents at the same time and while it may be a long shot there is a chance they could end up reunited just one half season after their Browns partnership ended. This time possibly with a quarterback who gives them a chance to achieve more together than they ever could with Baker Mayfield in Cleveland.

Former Green Bay Packers wide receiver Davante Adams left that team for the Las Vegas Raiders Thursday and one of his ex-teammates wasted little time before initiating the recruitment of Beckham and Landry. Packers safety Adrian Amos took to Twitter March 17 and proposed a reunion between the two pass catchers in Green Bay.

“@OBJ 👀 @God_Son80 👀 yaw tryna play together again? 😂 😂 😂 ” Amos tweeted.

NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo reported March 14 that the Packers are in the mix for Landry. News on Beckham’s future has been sparser as he recovers from the ACL injury.

Packers Pursuit of Beckham Landry More Likely as Free Agent WR Options Dwindle

Just few days ago the prospect of bringing Beckham and Landry back together in Green Bay would have seemed more far-fetched as the Packers would have had a deeper pool of wide receivers to pursue in free agency.

But the available talent at the position thinned considerably after Mike Williams re-signed with the Los Angeles Chargers Chris Godwin returned to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on the franchise tag and then inked a multiyear deal and former Chicago Bears wideout Allen Robinson jumped to the Rams — presumably stealing the injured Beckham’s spot.

Matt Schneidman of The Athletic on Thursday tweeted out his colleague Sheil Kapadia’s list of the top six wideouts left in free agency. Both Beckham and Landry were slotted at the top of that list.

“Here are @SheilKapadia’s top available free-agent WRs: Odell Beckham Jr. (coming off torn ACL) Jarvis Landry JuJu Smith-Schuster Marquez Valdes-Scantling Will Fuller and Julio Jones” Schneidman wrote.

Since that time Smith-Schuster has signed a one-year deal with the Kansas City Chiefs and is off the board.

Valdes-Scantling was in talks with the Packers Saturday as well as a few other teams per Tom Silverstein of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The wide receiver’s market value for the 2022 season is $8.7 million according to Spotrac though ESPN’s Rob Demovsky has reported Valdes-Scantling is likely to sign for somewhere in the $5 million range annually.

Cost of Signing Beckham Landry Could be Biggest Impediment For Packers

Two-time reigning MVP quarterback Aaron Rodgers told the Packers he did not want to be part of a rebuild after the team’s disappointing Divisional Round Playoff loss to the San Francisco 49ers.

Considering that Adams’ sudden departure came as a shock to most. However NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport subsequently reported that Rodgers had previously known Adams was on his way out no matter what.

While Aaron Rodgers was negotating his contract he knew Davante Adams would never play for the #Packers again. The situation was too far gone. Something had to give. And when Adams informed GB he wasn’t playing on the tag talks got fired up. Now Adams will be on the #Raiders. https://t.co/YTAxHov0Rj — Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) March 17 2022

“While Aaron Rodgers was negotiating his contract he knew Davante Adams would never play for the #Packers again” Rapoport tweeted Thursday. “The situation was too far gone. Something had to give. And when Adams informed GB he wasn’t playing on the tag talks got fired up. Now Adams will be on the #Raiders.”

Green Bay used the franchise tag in early March to retain Adams for the upcoming season at the price of $20.14 million. That money will now presumably go to replacing him on the roster. The Packers were cash-strapped as it was and while Adams’ departure frees up some much needed funds it may be difficult to bring in both Beckham and Landry if $20 million is all Green Bay has to split between them.

Landry was scheduled to make $16.3 million on the fifth and final year of his deal with the Browns before he was cut while Beckham possesses a market value of $13.1 million for the 2022 season per Spotrac.

The Packers could feasibly move some money around and clear up a few million more to land the duo. On the other hand the opportunity to play together again for a contender in Green Bay with arguably the NFL’s best quarterback might be worth a pay cut to Beckham Landry or both.",,,

A team’s season can end before anyone expects it for myriad reasons.

Wisconsin coach Greg Gard and his players saw their season come to a stunning and bitter end Sunday at Fiserv Forum in the second round of the NCAA men’s basketball tournament.

As the final seconds of Iowa State’s 54-49 victory ticked off the clock freshman point guard Chucky Hepburn watched helplessly from the bench with crutches by his side and his injured left foot in a walking boot.

Sophomore Johnny Davis who likely played his final college game walked away slowly after hitting just 4 of 16 shots and scoring 17 points.

Box score:Iowa State 54 Wisconsin 49

Davis looked crestfallen as he untucked his jersey top.

""I didn't want the season to end this way"" Davis said ""and you know for right now I just want to cherish these past two years I've had at Wisconsin and finish school this semester...

""I just want to stay in the moment for right now.""

Davis who is projected as a lottery pick in the 2022 NBA draft finished 0 of 7 from three-point range but he had plenty of company in missing from beyond the arc.

UW entered the day 31.3% from three-point range but finished at a season-low 9.1% (2 of 22).

Brad Davison (12 points) looked off into the distance as the final buzzer sounded knowing his 161st college game would be his last.

""Just a lot of emotions"" he said when asked to describe his thoughts in seeing his college run over. ""I just get overwhelmed with gratitude for the career I've got to experience here but also just for the relationships and the people that I've got to do it with.""

The Badgers (25-8) last reached the Sweet 16 in 2017. Iowa State (22-12) which won just two games last season rebounded under first-year coach T.J. Otzelberger to reach the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2016.

""Our guys have done a great job embracing the work habits that we've set in front of them"" said Otzelberger a Milwaukee native who graduated from St. Thomas More and played at UW-Whitewater. ""They started it in June carried it on in September. We kept talking about it in our huddles over and over let's trust our habits and trust each other and tonight our guys certainly did that.""

The Badgers already without backup point guard Lorne Bowman (illness) lost Hepburn with 4 minutes 37 left in the first half when the freshman suffered an ugly left-ankle injury.

That forced Gard to have Davison move to point guard and Jahcobi Neath and Jordan Davis try to shadow Iowa State point guard Tyrese Hunter.

""We played 30-some games with him at the helm"" Gard said ""and at this point in time in the season... injuries happen I understand that... We needed to have him on the court.""

Tyler Wahl who dominated Colgate in the opening round with 15 points nine rebounds and four assists picked up two quick fouls Sunday and played just 6:32 in the opening half. He finished with eight points and eight rebounds.

Steven Crowl picked up two fouls in the opening half and was scoreless in 10 minutes of action. He finished with two points and just one rebound.

""It just got us out of rhythm"" Gard said of the foul trouble. ""When you're trying to find a rhythm being in foul trouble is not a way.""

In addition to shooting 9.1% from three-point range UW finished at a season-low 29.8% overall (14 of 47) and had a season-high 17 turnovers. The Badgers came in No. 1 in the nation in fewest turnovers per game at 8.4.

""When you have open shots you’ve got to take them"" Gard said. ""But this is an intense moment. Is the pressure there with it? Yeah. Pressure is real.

""Defensively that might be the best we have done all year. But offensively we couldn’t hit water from the boat...

""You can’t go 2 for 22 and turn it over 17 times. That is a petty lethal combination.""

Iowa State also struggled to score but Minnesota transfer Gabe Kalscheur who came in averaging 9.1 points and shooting 35.2% crushed UW's hopes and momentum all day.

The senior guard hit 5 of 9 shots in the opening half and scored 10 points to help the Cyclones take a 27-26 lead. He finished 10 of 19 shots and finished with 22 points four rebounds and two steals.

""I was just locked in"" he said. ""I never liked Wisconsin to be honest. I have family from there but I'm a Minnesota-raised man so I mean it gives me a little more edge to play.

""It fueled my fire for sure.""

Izaiah Brockington the Cyclones' leading scorer at 17.1 points per game hit only 4 of 15 shots and finished with 10 points.

Hunter who hit 7 of 11 three-pointers and finished with 23 points in the first round against LSU hit just 1 of 10 shots against UW. However he contributed six rebounds five assists and three steals.

""Even though his shooting numbers weren't what we would love for them to be tonight"" Otzelbeger said ""he impacted winning in so many ways.""

While Iowa State's players and coaches began planning a trip to Chicago for the Sweet 16 Gard and his players to try to accept how a remarkable season that produced a Big Ten regular-season title ended in stunning fashion.

""The first thing that comes to my mind is obviously the last time I'll have that group in the locker room"" Gard said. ""It's not the actual game itself. It's the finality of the season and finality of a journey that's been a long time in the making...

""The finality of that last time and not being able to go to practice tomorrow next week those type of things. It's going to end at some point in time. You just try to hope that you can keep stringing it out for another day.""

That day came Sunday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vb25taWx3YXVrZWUuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL21hcmNoLW1hZG5lc3MtZGF5LW9uZS1waG90b3MtYmFkZ2Vyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 awesome images from the first day of March Madness at Fiserv Forum,"Madness was in the air at Fiserv Forum on Friday night.

Thanks to the 16000-plus fans that filled the area let’s hope that Milwaukee becomes a staple for March Madness for years to come – and perhaps even host a regional or the Final Four. The NCAA’s list of locations is set through 2026 with Milwaukee scheduled to host the first and second rounds again in 2025.

2. Chucky Hepburn’s 'do

The only thing more red than Fiserv Forum last night was Chucky Hepburn’s hair. The point guard’s signature hairstyle was extra red in celebration of March Madness – and what will hopefully be a long tournament run for the Wisconsin Badgers.

3. Texas escapes

Timmy Allen had a big impact in Texas’ 81-73 win over Virginia Tech. Not only did he tally 14 points six rebounds and two steals but when he fouled out of the game late in the second half the Longhorns nearly saw their big lead get erased. With about a minute left to play – and thanks to an untimely technical foul – Texas’ 14-point lead was sliced in half in a matter of seconds. Fortunately the team was able to regroup and eventually ran out the clock in the final moments but Texas fans were certainly worried they were about to blow another big second-half lead.

4. Who said badgers can’t Griddy?

Bucky had all his moves ready to go for the Big Dance. Warming up the home crowd at a neutral site Bucky showed off his dance skills and even busted out the Griddy dance which might land him some new TikTok followers.

5. Purdue moves on

Sasha Stefanovic only had six points during the Boilermakers’ 78-56 win over the Yale Bulldogs but he provided all the energy as he made a big shot in the second half that helped seal the win for his team. Only a few hours from West Lafayette Purdue fans traveled well to provide a home court advantage for their team and Stefanovic got them loud with his big play.

6. Crowd coordinator Brad Davison

Wisconsin’s Brad Davison had an off game on Friday night with only four points in 37 minutes played – but his value can’t be tracked by just the box score. All throughout the night Davison got the blood pumping throughout the sold out arena and made sure that Colgate players couldn’t hear their coach’s words amongst the noise from the Wisconsin crowd.

7. Mascots brought their A-game

If you are a casual March Madness fan then you might fill out your bracket based on who has the better mascot – and some of the best mascots were on display throughout the entire day at Fiserv Forum. At the top of our list was Yale’s Bulldog Texas’ “Hook ‘Em” and of course the best mascot in college sports Bucky Badger. At the bottom of the list? Purdue Pete perhaps the creepiest looking mascot in sports.

Image By TheCarColony

Since it was founded in 1903 Ford Motor Company has become one of the most recognised car brands in the world. There have been many iconic Ford models down the generations including the Model ‘T’ Mustang Fiesta Escort and Focus to name just a few.

While Ford has had its fair share of challenges over the years the marque is still one of the first that many people consider when they are in the market for a reliable car. So how did Ford cars become so noted for their reliability?

The early days of Ford

When Henry Ford began making motor cars he had a goal of manufacturing affordable cars that were durable. This meant that more people could now afford to own a car than had previously been possible.

Cars before this time were seen as an elite luxury that only wealthy people could afford. However with the launch of the Model ‘A’ and Model ‘T’ Ford was able to change that perception.

With its assembly line manufacturing practices and improved worker safety Ford developed a reputation of being a modern and innovative company.

A large used car market

The reputation that Ford vehicles have of being reliable and easy to maintain has made them a popular choice in the used car market.

You can find reliable used cars for sale in Southend-on-Sea and many other places around the UK with many of them being Fords.

Prices in the used car market rose during 2020 but Ford cars have remained affordable despite the price rise.

With so many Ford cars in the used car sector you are likely to find the one you want without any problem.

Repairability and parts

One of the key factors for those who have bought Ford cars in the past is their repairability. Generally they have always been fairly easy to work on unlike the offerings of some other manufacturers.

This means that people can repair their Ford and keep them running longer. It also means Ford cars can be customised easily by using parts from other versions of the same model.

The availability of parts is one of the key respects in which Fords have a reputation for being a sounder choice than some rival brands. Generally speaking replacement parts for Ford vehicles are easier to find and more affordable than those for other manufacturers.

There are also various third-party parts manufacturers that make parts for Ford cars which will further help put your mind at rest if you are in need of certain components for your vehicle bearing the Blue Oval badge.

How is reliability determined?

When looking at the reliability of cars there are many factors that should be taken into consideration.

The reputation of the company within the automotive industry

Warranties are now becoming an ever-more popular feature for car buyers. This means that the better the coverage in terms of the warranty length and benefits the higher the reliability of the car likely is

Cost-effectiveness is an element that manufacturers such as Ford have optimised for many years. This doesn’t only relate to car prices but also the cost of warranties and other additional benefits

The opinions of professional car critics play a part in a manufacturer’s reliability score. This can vary from model to model and variations within them

Customer impressions are also key to reliability. It is often the customers that highlight reliability issues and spark recalls for certain faults

Ford commercial vehicles

One of Ford’s most successful areas has been in commercial vehicles. The company has won several awards over the years and continues to innovate in this area.

For commercial vehicle owners it hasn’t only been about the reliability of Ford’s trucks and vans but also the practicality of the vehicles.

Ford has always offered a range of options for its commercial vehicles and this enables customers to customise their van to suit their needs.

The same ease of repair and parts that Ford cars have extends to the brand’s commercial vehicles as well. This has made Ford a favourite among van drivers who can easily replace and repair parts without losing too much time.

Prices for Ford commercial vehicles are also competitive which can be a deciding factor for many people looking to buy a new vehicle.

Conclusion

With Ford models like the Puma and Focus continuing to rank among the strongest-selling cars in the UK you can be confident that when you buy a Ford you will be well-supported in terms of factors like customer service and parts availability.

While Ford has had some issues in the past just like any other manufacturer the Blue Oval is still considered a manufacturer of highly reliable vehicles especially as far as commercial vehicles are concerned.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRlc21hbi5jb20vc3RvcnkvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMi8wMy8xOS9lbnRodXNpYXNtLXJldnMtdXAtZWxlY3RyaWMtdmVoaWNsZS1pbmR1c3RyeS83MDQ3NTU5MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Enthusiasm revs up for electric vehicle industry,"When it comes to transportation are we entering the age of electrification?

If South by Southwest was any indication it’s already here.

From high-end electric cars to e-bikes to the infrastructure needed to power those vehicles the topic was front and center during this year's convention in Austin.

The electric vehicle industry has become such a national focus that SXSW's leaders devoted an entire festival track to the sector this year. Austin's growing importance as a center for the industry likely played a role as well.

Experts from electric car startup Lucid Motors traditional automakers like Ford and Volkswagen and supporting companies including tire maker Michelin were on hand to weigh in on a range of topics.

Noticibly absent was Tesla the Elon Musk-led company that is world's biggest maker of electric vehicles and also happens to be headquartered in Austion.

While Tesla's emergence has helped take the electric automobile industry to new heights the vision for electric cars is far from a new one. Frank Brown senior design leader of Ford Motor Company pointed out that auto industry pioneer Henry Ford initially looked into creating a car powered by batteries.

The idea didn't take really hold until the past decade however.

“Really if you think about it we’ve been on this journey of innovation since the beginning of Ford” Brown said. “All of our mobility in our future I believe is going to move towards electrification. The future is very clearly electrification full stop.”

Ford debuted an all-electric Mustang in 2020 and the next year the company began offering the Ford F150 lightning its first all-electric pickup. Brown said the company immediately saw a landslide of demand. Ford has since broken off its EV business into a separate segment now dubbed its “Model E division.”

“We’re approaching the end of the ICE age” Brown said referring to the acronym for internal combustion engine vehicles. “This is the path we’re on at Ford. I think a lot of companies are on this path.”

Brown said as part of becoming an electric vehicle company Ford is reimaging and innovating the way it does things.

""To be a (battery electric vehicle) company is a complete remaking of what’s possible"" Brown said. ""We’re already finding lots of opportunities to do things differently. The technology is already here. This is the digital transformation of mobility.”

'This is a tech race'

Peter Rawlinson who is best known for his work as chief vehicle engineer for the Tesla Model S and is now CEO and Chief Technology Officer of California-based Lucid Motors said as companies increasingly turn to electric vehicles it’s creating a technology race.

“This is a tech race and one of the key litmus for that technology is efficiency. How far can you go per kilowatt-hour? That's what will define the winners” Rawlinson said.

Lucid Motors's vehicles currently sell for $77000 to $170000. The company’s highest-end vehicle the Lucid Air also has the longest battery range on the market at about 500 miles. Lucid started off making battery technology not dissimilarly to Tesla.

Mark Gillies an executive with Volkswagen said his company is excited about its new bright yellow electric mini-bus dubbed the ID Buzz which is available in Europe and is expected to be available in the United States next year.

“It’s simply the coolest new product that the Volkswagen brand has” he said. “It’s an electric vehicle for one thing and it’s a re-imaging of the classic Microbus for another.”

SXSW attendees were able to take a peek at the company’s European model vehicle which will begin deliveries in the fall and is available as a five-seater multi-purpose vehicle and a cargo van. The vehicle will be available in the U.S in 2024.

Gillies said events like SXSW are increasingly important to reach target groups as the company expands into electrification.

“SXSW is a magnet for many opinion leaders who produce their own content at the various events to address their individual target groups. We would like to enter into an exchange with these opinion leaders in order to address those target groups directly and more efficiently than would be possible with conventional communication measures” Gillies said.

Lucid Motors also brought its Lucid Air to Austin and while it held no official events the car could be spotted parked around downtown turning heads of in-the-know EV fans.

“I’m really really passionate about using the technology that we've developed to help the proliferation of more affordable electric cars for the mass market in the future and efficiency is going to be wider because it's going to drive the need for such a big battery"" Rawlinson said.

He said he was open to partnering on the company’s technology with other automakers.

“I would love us to have the greatest impact on the environment as possible. The more cars that we can make multiplied by how efficient they are” Rawlinson said.

Challenges remain

While the EV industry is on the rise a number of challenges remain as automakers look to electrify America’s roads

For one electric vehicles are much harder on tires than traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. Kate Kaufman vice president of service and solutions operations for Michelin North America said the different weight and torque of electric vehicles affects the life of tires for those vehicles.

""Electric is actually a key component of a Michelin strategy. So when it comes to electric Michelin is trying to get ahead of the things that are important there"" she said.

Kaufman said Michelin is looking at how to develop tires and standards specifically for electric vehicles. Companies will also need to train technicians on how to work on a whole new type of vehicle as more and more people buy electric cars she said.

""There's a lot of challenges with this and it's most mostly it's the organization system of technician education"" she said.

Charging station infrastructure will also become increasingly important especially the ability to charge on the go.

Stefan Tongur vice president of business development at Electreon the leading provider of wireless charging solutions for electric vehicles said charging largely remains a missing piece of the puzzle.

He said advanced infrastructure could help pave the way for electric fleets to spend less time charging. For example on-road charging technology built into our roads could charge any type of vehicle which would have a receiver built-in whether its moving or standing.

""We can bring the charger to the vehicle when it needs it"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZ2RpZ2l0YWwuY29tL2xlYW4tbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy9hY2hpZXZpbmctaGVucnktZm9yZHMtc3VjY2Vzcy13aXRoLWxlYW4tbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Achieving Henry Ford's success with lean manufacturing,"1. Elimination of waste

Reducing waste is critical to lessening the environmental impact of the manufacturing process and enable cost savings. Gaining the visibility of where this can be achieved is made possible by the use of 3D simulation software. By simulating a planned component machining system for example manufacturers can identify where equipment can be removed from the real device without impacting on its performance.

2. Valuing the human element

Lean manufacturing places as much focus on employees as it does machinery. It’s critical for leaders to ensure that staff aren’t overworked made accountable for successes and failures and have clear visibility of what their tasks achieve. The most optimised technology doesn’t count for anything if employees are undervalued and appreciated. Manufacturers can again deploy 3D simulation software in such settings to keep staff safe such as accounting for social distancing during the Covid-19 pandemic.

3. Seeking perfection

Continually looking to improve the manufacturing process also means a continuous desire for perfection and places improvement at the heart of the organisation’s culture. Lean manufacturing revolves around constant evolution and always avoiding complacency. Organisations can use 3D simulation software to continually refine improvements before applying them in the real world.

4. Mapping the value stream

The value stream details how a product is created in the facility or in other words the map that tracks raw material on its journey to becoming the final product. By laying this map out with arrows that show each process manufacturers are likely to identify where improvements can be made. 3D simulation software can enable this stream to be visualised.

5. Reducing and preventing mistakes

Mistakes result in wasted material time and money so they work directly against the idea of lean manufacturing. While it’s the case that not every mistake can be avoided reducing them as much as possible is key to ensuring efficiency. One of the ways that this can be done is by installing robotics into the production line and by using a robot simulation to refine the process possible mistakes can be detected before they happen in the real world.

6. Identifying loss of value

The elements that make up value in the manufacturing process are lead times price points colour material properties and material used functional and geometric requirements of the product and repeatability accuracy and precision of parts. Simulation software can enable manufacturers to see if there are any extra process steps or unnecessary features that will hurt that value.

7. Automatically finding defects

In the case where mistakes can’t be prevented there should be processes in place to achieve automatic detection. This could involve the identification and removal of any defective material. For example if ferrous metal contamination is ruining the product then the installation of strong magnets along the line will automatically find defects while smart sensors or cameras could be installed to also achieve the same effect.

Sending manufacturing into new directions

Following these seven principles will not only allow manufacturers to achieve higher levels of efficiency and optimisation but will also open up new opportunities in the manufacturing process. One of these is just-in-time manufacturing. With a culture around lean processes manufacturers are better placed to produce goods based solely on demand helping to reduce capital and money involved in the production. While this means that longer lead times await customers as production only happens after an order is made the potential for wasted products can be eradicated.

Ultimately lean manufacturing enables a highly efficient environmentally-friendly and competitive manufacturing process via the assistance of emerging technologies such as automation and simulation. With this manufacturers are better able to design a factory of the future that’s aligned with the digitised ideals of Industry 4.0 and also leaves them in a much stronger position to adapt to a rapidly changing sector.

Back in 2020 we saw Ford deploy Boston Dynamics’ Spot to scan its manufacturing facility. Now the automaker has a robot to operate a 3D printer all by itself. Here are the details.

Ford Develops “Javier” Robot to Operate 3D Printers

Ford has developed a special interface that allows machines from different suppliers to interact with each other and help in the production process.

The company has deployed a KUKA-built wheeled robot dubbed “Javier” in its Advanced Manufacturing Center that can operate a 3D printer to produce small custom car components all by itself. This is the first time that a robot is able to interact with a Carbon 3D printer. It can both operate and use the 3D printer for printing car components without the need for human interference.

So far Ford has used Javier’s ability to produce low-volume custom car components like the brake line bracket for the Mustang Shelby GT500. However it is worth mentioning that human operators still need to upload the print designs onto the 3D printer for the robot to print and maintain them.

Once the print designs are uploaded Javier communicates with the 3D printer and runs the necessary operations to print the uploaded designs. The robot and the printer can run all through the night even when human employees leave the manufacturing facility. Once the designs are printed Javier keeps them aside for Ford employees to collect them later.

Ford in a statement said “At Ford’s Advanced Manufacturing Center Javier is tasked with operating the 3D printers completely on his own” Ford mentioned in a statement. “He is always on time very precise in his movements and he works most of the day – taking only a short break to charge up.”

The company reveals that Javier can also learn from the printer data and improve its performance over time to deliver more accurate results and reduce the margin of errors.

Up until now machines from different suppliers could not communicate with each other due to the presence of different communication interfaces. However with Ford’s new patent-pending communication system machines from different manufacturers can communicate in real-time and also operate in collaboration. This could open up several new possibilities in the production process of companies. What do you think about the Ford Javier?

The model year 1932 was a big one for Ford Motor Co. It was the year they brought out their first flathead V8 engine which was a hot one but not the first V8 or even the first American V8. The first V8 was invented by the French engineer Leon Levavasseur in 1902. Cadillac used a V8 engine as early as 1915 but it was Henry Ford who used his assembly line production to mass-produce the V8 that changed to auto business forever. In addition to the assembly line Ford used a single engine block instead of combining pieces to manufacture the engine making it more economical to build.

Criminals Bonnie and Clyde stole a 1934 Ford V8 and reportedly wrote a complimentary letter to Henry Ford about the car and how good it was for their business. Moonshiners also found the Ford V8 to be a great car for their business too hauling booze and outrunning the cops. Those moonshiner pursuits are said to have been the forerunner of NASCAR races.

Ford Motor Co. didn’t build the 1932 V8 forever though yet the desire for speed performance and that style didn’t disappear. The hot rod was born and many who wanted a good hot rod long after Ford quit building the 1932 V8 built their own known as kit cars. It’s sort of like buying your car at Ikea where “some assembly is required.” Today’s feature car is one of them.

Kit cars have been around a long time but became more popular after World War II and the development of fiberglass. A kit car usually starts out as just a body with the buyer/builder providing almost everything else including the frame motor transmission suspension wiring etc.

It’s very unlikely to find two kit cars exactly alike as some buyer/builders would find parts they need in junk yards and from damaged or wrecked vehicles. Others would acquire new parts from all different sources. The buyers of kit cars seem to fall into two categories: “I love working on old cars” or “I’ve been there and done that” as in the case of this issue’s car owner Russ Nelson of Danville.

“I’ve always been into hot rodding” he said “since I was 15 years old. I’ve always had high-performance Fords. We built some hot rods when I was very young and sold them.”

Nelson was looking for a really nice one but didn’t want to build another one.

“I had certain requirements. It had to be a ’32 Ford with a Ford engine and a Ford transmission. This one came up and it just checked all the boxes I was looking for so I bought it. It was in Marietta Georgia.”

According to the California DMV the car is a 1932 Ford Highboy V8 but it’s really a kit car. About the only things from a 1932 Ford are the radiator grill and hood. The rest of the body is fiberglass. It has a Ford V8 engine but it’s a modern 350-horsepower 302-cubic-inch engine with a Ford C4 three-speed automatic transmission. Even though it’s registered as a 1932 Ford it doesn’t ride or drive like one.

The car has four-wheel independent suspension with adjustable chrome coil springs and disc brakes. Other modern creature comforts include a black leather heated seat tilting steering column with a banjo steering wheel and a SiriusXM radio. It also has rack-and-pinion steering and a Jaguar XKE rear suspension. It’s a very cool car painted Ford Fleet Green with American Racing Torque Trust wheels and leather straps to hold down the hood that covers the much-chromed engine.

Nelson paid $40000 for this car about a year ago. He’s happy with the price and said it would have cost him more than that just for parts plus having to assemble it himself.

Companies were prohibited from manufacturing turnkey kit cars until about two years ago. New laws were passed that allow a company to manufacturer replica vehicles that are at least 25 years old but with certain restrictions. They don’t have to include all the safety equipment that modern cars have but they still have to comply with environmental rules. There are also limits on the number of vehicles they can produce. Reportedly there are multiple kit car manufacturers in the United States and that market is growing.

FortiClient is a security solution designed to reduce your computer’s vulnerability. The manufacturer advertises that the tool comes with virus protection two-factor authentication and WAN optimization among other things.

However the FortiClient user interface itself only contains the vulnerability scan and a tab in which you can set up a VPN connection for remote access.

The vulnerability scan indicates when for example an application is outdated so there is potential for an attack and an update is urgently needed.

The abbreviation VPN stands for “Virtual Private Network” a self-contained network that you can access from anywhere with the right access data. For example do you log into the company network from your home office to use printers hard drives and your work e-mail inbox or do you dial into your home network while on the go and conveniently control your smart home from afar? Universities also allow their students secure access to the university network via VPN.

FortiClientEdition

Zero Trust Security (ZTNA) – This allows remote workers to use ZTNA and VPN encrypted tunnels with URL filtering and USB device control. Central management via FortiClient EMS is included with the cloud editions.

Republicans too rapidly shed past views on Russia and some called for no-fly zones and supplying Ukraine with Polish MiG fighter jets as Vladimir Putin’s brutal invasion ground on.

But the far-right Fox News host Tucker Carlson the alternately flabbergasted and outraged primetime host and Trumpist standard-bearer carried on presenting his conspiratorial show with such a seeming lack of regard that the Kremlin itself reportedly considers his equivocations over the causes of the conflict vital to its propaganda apparatus.

Even Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov – no doubt largely thanks to Carlson – had praise for Fox’s coverage of the conflict. “If you take the United States only Fox News is trying to present some alternative points of view” he said on Friday.

But no action has apparently yet been taken by Fox News executives to rein Carlson in. The 52-year-old host has taken on the mantle of “Tucker the Untouchable” even taking huge public offense when a senior Republican lawmaker called his show “an organ of disinformation”.

The criticism came from the Texas congressman Michael McCaul one of two Republicans who have expressed concern in recent weeks that Carlson’s nightly show – clips of which have in turn been relayed on Russian state media in recent weeks – has veered too close to defending the Russian president Vladimir Putin.

Outrage is of course Carlson’s specialization. On Thursday he amped it up after McCaul’s comments. “In other words not only are we wrong – which is fine – we’re disloyal Americans doing the bidding of a foreign power. It’s not fine. It’s slander” he fumed. Carlson went on to accuse McCaul and other Republicans of “talking like Joe Biden” who “calls anything he doesn’t like ‘Russian disinformation’”.

And that typically enough returned him to the subject of Hunter Biden who is reportedly being investigated by the Department of Justice over payments he received from a number of foreign companies including the Ukrainian energy company Burisma.

Carlson has long questioned Putin as a villain. At the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict he went on air to tell his viewers: “Has Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him?”

Last weekend the US website Mother Jones reported that the Kremlin told Russian media it was “essential” that Carlson’s pro-Putin rhetoric was aired though the outlet did not publish the documents it cited.

It comes as his employer lost two members of its newsgathering operation – the Ukrainian producer and fixer Oleksandra “Sasha” Kuvshynova 24 and Fox News cameraperson Pierre Zakrzewski 55 to shelling in Gorenka outside Kyiv on Monday. Another Fox journalist was badly injured and evacuated.

Yet amid a huge outpouring of sympathy for Fox’s staff and anger at the Russian army Carlson on successive nights last week devoted segments to promoting Moscow’s unfounded propaganda claims of secret American biological warfare labs in Ukraine.

US officials have said the labs are Ukrainian and part of an initiative called the Biological Threat Reduction Program that has received US financial assistance. The White House has warned that the Kremlin’s conspiracy theory used to justify its invasion of Ukraine could itself be a prelude to a Russian chemical or biological attack.

“This is a classic move by the Russians” warned the US director of national intelligence Avril Haines this week. The Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen told the Senate foreign relations committee that Carlson and others were behind the spread of the bioweapons rumors which are gaining credence in the US far right.

Other Republicans including the Illinois representative Adam Kinzinger have refused to go on Tucker Carlson Tonight because of his alleged pro-Putin agenda. Kinzinger has accused Carlson of pushing the narrative that the US is to blame for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“There’s no way I’ll go on his show for a number of reasons” Kinzinger a US air force veteran said in a Twitter video. “His insistence that the west was provoking war with Putin his spreading lies about biolabs and his continued spewing of conspiracy theories are nothing but complete evil. His show is full of Russian propaganda and not news.”

Carlson’s power comes amid the rise of far-right groups individuals and opinions across the US. Whether from militia supporters seeking power in California local government or in the Idaho state office or on new social media platforms the far right in America is undergoing something of a boom.

Carlson experts say is part of that. And so too is a fondness – or at least a respect – for Putin. According to Scott McLemee who reviewed a newly published study on the right in Inside Higher Ed last week: “There is no question about Carlson being at very least a white nationalist which might not be fascist but close enough.

“The appeal of Russian authoritarianism for the American far right is considerable and not just because of Trump’s fealty to Putin. A common skin color and shared hostility to feminism and gay rights counts for a lot.”

But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the daily images of suffering it has produced for US media have complicated Carlson’s platform at least in terms of the broader US media landscape even if not within Fox itself.

“This balancing act he’s been playing on so many different levels is getting a lot more precarious” said Bob Thompson a former professor of media studies at Syracuse University and current director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture.

Carlson’s equivocation on Russian aggression is complicating the ideological real estate he occupies. “It’s not only confused it’s almost dada” Thompson says. “You see it playing out on the show when someone makes a rational argument and it’s deflected not with an alternative but the abandonment of rationality.”

But that may also be what Carlson’s avid supporters and equally avid detractors come to see.

It’s the nature of cable news that relatively few viewers are required to establish a commercial footing so the power of advertisers to speak for the body politic by pulling advertising when a host says something egregious has diminished – and with it the chances of getting fired. And Carlson remains a hugely popular figure with Fox viewers and through them the Trump base and the Republican politicians that it powers.

Which leaves Carlson and others on the right and left to indulge whatever particular train of thought or lack thereof they choose to follow.

“The whole point of these shows is to outrage viewers across the country which will in turn strengthen the very small audience you need for it to be a hit” Thompson said. “Carlson is in a sense untouchable because outrage is a genre of entertainment all of its own.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDEwcGhvZW5peC5jb20vbmV3cy9yZXZpZXctdGhlLW91dGZpdC1tYXJrLXJ5bGFuY2Utem9leS1kZXV0Y2jSAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxMHBob2VuaXguY29tL25ld3MvcmV2aWV3LXRoZS1vdXRmaXQtbWFyay1yeWxhbmNlLXpvZXktZGV1dGNoLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: Mark Rylance is well-suited to the gangland tension of 'The Outfit',"article

In an entertainment industry that rewards big showy performances from glitzy actors it’s nice to remember that actors like Mark Rylance still exist. The unassuming soft-spoken performer who first won an Academy Award for his movie-star-making turn in Steven Spielberg’s ""Bridge of Spies"" is often most compelling when he weaponizes that apparent gentility making it a tool his characters use to mask their motives and capabilities. And it’s that kind of subterfuge that debut director Graham Moore leverages to chilling effect in his claustrophobic Chicago thriller ""The Outfit.""

About ""The Outfit"": Cutting away from established patterns

Zoey Deutch and Mark Rylance in ""The Outfit"" (Focus Features)

Moore who won an Oscar himself for his screenplay for ""The Imitation Game"" sets the entirety of ""The Outfit"" inside a moody bespoke clothing shop in the 1950s. Its owner English ex-pat Leonard (Rylance) fled to Chicago after the Great War chased by the memory of a personal tragedy that cost him everything except his shears.

Now he makes a decent living as a tailor — or ""cutter"" as he modestly clarifies — meticulously creating custom suits for his clientele which include members of the Boyle mafia (who also use a lockbox in the back for clandestine communications amongst the ""family""). Leonard prefers a life of quiet dedication to his work; his only companion is his assistant Mabel (Zoey Deutch) who longs to travel the world and has started a risky fling with Richie Boyle (Dylan O’Brien) son of mob patriarch Rob (Simon Russell Beale).

Things go south late one night when hotheaded Boyle goon Francis (Johnny Flynn of 2020’s ""Emma."") carries a wounded Richie into the shop and demands that Leonard ""sew him up."" (After all what’s really the difference between stitching fabric and flesh?) But this circumstance is merely the opening salvo in a turf war that involves a rat a mysterious tape and an even more mercurial organization called — you guessed it — The Outfit whose boss wants in on the Boyle family’s territory. Leonard now reluctantly promoted from bystander to participant must use his wits to survive the night. Luckily for him (and the audience) there’s more to the nebbish wallflower than meets the eye.

See ""The Outfit"" for: The intricate stitching of its script and performances

Moore a Chicagoan himself has a natural fluency in the wise-guy aesthetics of the city’s mafioso history and ""The Outfit"" is chock-a-block with tossed-off vernacular that evokes that world without over-explaining or rendering the finely-constructed screenplay any less taut. You don’t have to own a mobster thesaurus to figure out what Francis means when he says Richie has ""a marble in his gut"" and Leonard’s matter-of-fact narration over certain stretches of the film feels driven by character more than convenience — offering up thematically-fitting parables whose true nature are deliciously revealed later on.

Mirroring Leonard’s own penchant for precision Moore’s script is marvelously intricate. ""The Outfit"" unfurls at a pleasing pace Moore layering one revelation on top of another and spacing out Hitchcockian twists at pitch-perfect moments. Who’s the rat? Will Boyle find out what’s happened to Richie and who will he blame when he does? Who will even survive the night? And who is Leonard really underneath all that downcast deference? While Moore hardly changes the thriller game with the results he still knows how to build a pleasing mechanism with the pieces he’s given himself.

The supporting cast is more than game for the guns-and-glory intrigue; the ensemble mostly consists of established British character actors chewing their way through nasal Chi-caah-go accents with devilish glee. That goes double for Flynn parlaying his unconventional good looks and reedy timbre into a bad-boy capo who proves the film’s true wild card. For his part Beale puts his pugnaciously interesting visage to good use as a mob boss who employs quiet menace and Nikki Amuka-Bird steals the spotlight however briefly as a rival mobster who’s more than ready to fill the gap Boyle’s weakness presents.

But the movie is Rylance’s show through and through Moore’s camera holding long on close-ups of his weathered face the actor’s sad eyes masking the character’s unpredictable wit (and possibly more). From moment to moment Leonard has to be many things to many people — friend ally informant protector — playing each side against the other just to stay alive often with a single line of dialogue. It’s a tremendous showcase for one of the world’s most skilled performers who doesn’t often get to carry a major motion picture so squarely on his back.

Zoey Deutch and Johnny Flynn (Focus Features)

While ""The Outfit"" can feel a little unambitious at times chiefly due to the innate staginess of a one-location potboiler like this it benefits from impressive talent behind the camera as well. There are layers of menace and calculation in every piece of Sophie O’Neill and Zac Posen’s period-appropriate costumes lit with even-handed detail by cinematographer Dick Pope so we can catch every stitch and fold of Leonard’s process. And Alexandre Desplat’s winking piano-heavy score twirls with unexpected whimsy (not unlike his underrated score for the Mossad spy thriller ""Operation: Finale"").

Like Leonard’s precisely-cut suits (the one he wears in the film having been constructed by Rylance himself who dove into the world of tailoring for the role) ""The Outfit"" feels like something made with care patience and attention. Moore wisely stays in his comfort zone in his first outing as a director sticking to what he knows which is intricate period detail and an ear for dialogue. And the same theatricality that might hamper other filmmakers allows him to stay focused on the scraps of fabric in front of him assembling the components into a pleasing whole. Frankly we should have more films that play like theater and ""The Outfit"" is a refreshing reminder that that tradition is alive and well.

B.A.P.S. (1997): This cult classic comedy from screenwriter and actress Troy Byer stars Halle Berry and Natalie Desselle as two friends who dream of opening the world’s first hair salon/soul food restaurant combo. The leads’ lively charming performances are perfectly complemented in memorability by the film’s iconic costuming hairstyling makeup and production design. One-of-a-kind. Rated PG-13. 92 minutes. Dir: Robert Townsend. Also featuring Martin Landau Ian Richardson Troy Byer Bernie Mac.

Beauty and the Beast (2014): French movie star Léa Seydoux (""No Time to Die"") glows in this lush adaptation of a familiar fairy tale. Rated PG-13. 112 minutes. Dir: Christophe Gans. Language: French. Featuring: Léa Seydoux Vincent Cassel André Dussollier Eduardo Noriega.

Carol (2015): This achingly romantic period drama from director Todd Haynes stars Cate Blanchett as the titular Carol a glamorous woman who catches the eye of Therese (Rooney Mara) a young aspiring photographer working in a department store. Carol forgets her gloves (or does she?) and the sparks that fly across the counter catch fire when introduced to the oxygen of the outside world. Haynes’ unapologetically queer film heavily inspired by photography of the 1950s is swoon-worthy and stylish. Mara and Blanchett are almost as good at wearing incredible costumes as they are at acting and they’re very very good at acting. One of the most celebrated and moving dramas of the century so far.

Rated R. 118 minutes. Dir: Todd Haynes. Also featuring Sarah Paulson Jake Lacy Kyle Chandler.

Marie Antoinette (2006): 2022 Oscar nominee Kirsten Dunst stars in this exuberantly colorful interpretation of the life of the infamous Queen of France. The film divided critics at the time but it’s since become something of a classic thanks to Dunst’s winning performance the sumptuous and absurd design (it picked up an Oscar for its costumes) and its addictive pop score. An accurate historical document this is not but it isn’t meant to be. Instead ""Marie Antoinette"" lets us see a towering figure of history through her own teenage eyes. Rated PG-13. 122 minutes. Dir: Sofia Coppola. Also featuring Jason Schwartzman Judy Davis Rip Torn Rose Byrne Molly Shannon Shirley Henderson Danny Huston Steve Coogan.

In February the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) agreed with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board’s (PTAB’s) decision that the original claims of Zaxcom’s U.S. Patent No. 9336307 for Engineering Emmy® and technical OSCAR award-winning wireless microphone technology were unpatentable as obvious but upheld the substitute claims Zaxcom had proposed. Now Zaxcom has petitioned the court for rehearing en banc arguing that the CAFC’s precedent in Fox Factory Inc. v. SRAM LLC 944 F.3d 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2019) “confused the law” regarding a rebuttable presumption of nexus.

Zaxcom first appealed the PTAB’s decision on the original claims of the ‘307 patent in May of 2020 arguing that the PTAB misconstrued the claims and failed to properly consider evidence of industry praise. The ‘307 patent disclosed several embodiments including a “Dropout Embodiment” and a “Multi-track Embodiment”. In the Dropout Embodiment the loss of audio data during a wireless transmission was remedied by replacing data with locally recorded audio data. In the Multitrack Embodiment local audio data from a plurality of local audio devices was combined to create a single local multi-track file or a single remote multitrack file.

Zaxcom said the PTAB erred in its claim construction by determining that the claims encompass both the Dropout Embodiment and the Multitrack Embodiment and that the PTAB improperly construed the claims such that the local audio data and the remotely recorded audio data may be from different sources rather than both originating from the same source. But the CAFC agreed with the PTAB’s approach saying that “[u]nder the claims’ broadest reasonable interpretation (BRI) local and remote audio data may be ‘combined’ either to repair corrupted audio data received by the remote recorder or to create a multitrack audio file. In adopting that construction under the BRI standard the Board correctly rejected Zaxcom’s argument for a requirement that the claimed ‘local audio data’ and ‘remote audio data’ derive from the same source (i.e. the same local audio event).”

The court agreed that given the PTAB’s construction the Board had “ample evidence” to support its finding that claims 1-11 were obvious over the primary reference “Strub” when combined with two other prior art references or that claims 12-14 were anticipated by Strub.

The PTAB’s Final Written Decision in the case was designated precedential in April 2020 for its holding that a nexus between the evidence and the merits of the claimed invention must be established in order for objective indicia of nonobviousness to be given substantial weight. Citing Fox Factory the PTAB noted that a patentee is entitled to a presumption of nexus “when the patentee shows that the asserted objective evidence is tied to a specific product and that product ‘embodies the claimed features and is coextensive with them.’”

The CAFC agreed with the PTAB’s determination that Zaxcom’s evidence of objective indicia like industry praise and long-felt need “lacked the nexus to the claimed invention required to alter a conclusion of obviousness that would be justified based on the prior-art analysis.” Specifically Zaxcom’s reliance on the industry awards it received and declarations from sound mixers failed because such praise was “primarily directed to the systems’ critical feature of dropout repair while the claims of the ’307 patent under the BRI construction properly adopted are broadly directed to wirelessly transmitting audio data and combining local and remote audio data from a plurality of devices—a technique already known in the prior art.”

Zaxcom’s petition for en banc rehearing argues that this addition of a third prerequisite for a finding of rebuttable presumption of nexus—i.e. proof that the product has no “critical” unclaimed features that materially impact its functionality—is what confused the law and is “far removed from the underlying purpose of a having a nexus presumption in the first place.”

The pre-Fox Factory case law “is clear that a product that practices a patent is entitled to a presumption of nexus unless ‘the patented invention is only a small component of the product’” says the petition citing Henny Penny Corp. v. Frymaster LLC  938 F.3d 1324 7 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2019). “Outside this ‘limited exception’ unclaimed features merely serve as potential rebuttal evidence” the petition adds citing WBIP LLC v. Kohler Co. 829 F.3d 1317 1329 & n.3 (Fed. Cir. 2016).

The petition also says that the Fox Factory is “intractably high” and “demoralizes” inventors. “If not brought back in line with this Court’s longstanding authority [it will] signal to inventors that no amount of praise will protect them from an obviousness attack. Nowhere is this clearer than in the case-at-bar.”

Ultimately Zaxcom is asking the CAFC to “reaffirm the longstanding rule that unclaimed features do not preclude a presumption of nexus unless “the patented invention is only a small component of the product tied to the objective evidence” under Henny Penny and to reverse the Board’s decision of obviousness with respect to the original challenged claims “or at least remand with instructions to apply the presumption of nexus between those inventions and the industry praise.”

The February panel decision did affirm the PTAB’s approval of Zaxcom’s narrowed substitute claims explaining that “the substitute claims narrow the ‘combined’ claim limitation to a limitation that requires ‘replacing’ the remotely recorded data with local audio data from a device’s memory.”

Since the asserted prior art basis for obviousness of the narrowed claims was weak the PTAB concluded and the CAFC agreed that the objective indicia evidence was strong with respect to the new claims and entitled to a presumption of nexus. Furthermore the evidence indicated a positive nexus as the “claims are undisputedly directed to dropout repair in systems with wearable recording devices and this feature was discussed in at least the Emmy Award.”

The petitioners may have a hard road to en banc review considering several CAFC judges recently expressed frustration with the number of rehearing requests they have been receiving according to an IPLaw360 report.

The expansion will bring almost 200 new jobs to Clinton County and is almost doubling Bombardier’s workforce in the state of Michigan.

“BRP is a global company with footprints across the world in many regions” said Dillon Rush the director of business attraction of the Lansing Economic Area Partnership. “This BRP expansion builds communities.”

Rush said that 200 jobs have a profound impact on the local main street of St. John’s in the local shops in Watertown Township and the housing market of those communities.

They are expanding by adding a 55000 square-foot manufacturing facility and warehouse in St. Johns and adding 15000 square-feet to its location north of Lansing.

“This expansion is part of our long-term strategy to expand our product offerings in the marine space” said Cory Highfield the general manager at Manitou Pontoon Boats.

Through the Michigan Economic Development Corporation the company is getting a performance-based grant of $689500.

“The money can be used flexibly for training for expanding the footprint of the building really a tool to utilize as they see fit when it comes to the expansion project” Rush said.

They have received support from LEAP Capital Area Michigan Works! the Michigan Economic Development Corporation and Lansing Community College.

“All those organizations work very well in concert with one another to pro manufacturing in this area” Highfield said. That's why we have such a rich workforce of highly skilled and you know people to draw from.”

According to Highfeld they have not only been recruiting from LCC but also sending workers to the classes to learn additional skills.

“LCC has been an incredible partner for us over the course of the last year as we've been starting the second shift training individuals really trying to upskill our workforce” Highfield said.

According to a press release from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer the project is expected to generate a total investment of $11.9 million. The company is also looking to fill open positions.

Republicans too rapidly shed past views on Russia and some called for no-fly zones and supplying Ukraine with Polish MiG fighter jets as Vladimir Putin’s brutal invasion ground on.

But the far-right Fox News host Tucker Carlson the alternately flabbergasted and outraged primetime host and Trumpist standard-bearer carried on presenting his conspiratorial show with such a seeming lack of regard that the Kremlin itself reportedly considers his equivocations over the causes of the conflict vital to its propaganda apparatus.

Even Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov – no doubt largely thanks to Carlson – had praise for Fox’s coverage of the conflict. “If you take the United States only Fox News is trying to present some alternative points of view” he said on Friday.

But no action has apparently yet been taken by Fox News executives to rein Carlson in. The 52-year-old host has taken on the mantle of “Tucker the Untouchable” even taking huge public offense when a senior Republican lawmaker called his show “an organ of disinformation”.

The criticism came from the Texas congressman Michael McCaul one of two Republicans who have expressed concern in recent weeks that Carlson’s nightly show – clips of which have in turn been relayed on Russian state media in recent weeks – has veered too close to defending the Russian president Vladimir Putin.

Outrage is of course Carlson’s specialization. On Thursday he amped it up after McCaul’s comments. “In other words not only are we wrong – which is fine – we’re disloyal Americans doing the bidding of a foreign power. It’s not fine. It’s slander” he fumed. Carlson went on to accuse McCaul and other Republicans of “talking like Joe Biden” who “calls anything he doesn’t like ‘Russian disinformation’”.

And that typically enough returned him to the subject of Hunter Biden who is reportedly being investigated by the Department of Justice over payments he received from a number of foreign companies including the Ukrainian energy company Burisma.

Carlson has long questioned Putin as a villain. At the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict he went on air to tell his viewers: “Has Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him?”

Last weekend the US website Mother Jones reported that the Kremlin told Russian media it was “essential” that Carlson’s pro-Putin rhetoric was aired though the outlet did not publish the documents it cited.

It comes as his employer lost two members of its newsgathering operation – the Ukrainian producer and fixer Oleksandra “Sasha” Kuvshynova 24 and Fox News cameraperson Pierre Zakrzewski 55 to shelling in Gorenka outside Kyiv on Monday. Another Fox journalist was badly injured and evacuated.

Yet amid a huge outpouring of sympathy for Fox’s staff and anger at the Russian army Carlson on successive nights last week devoted segments to promoting Moscow’s unfounded propaganda claims of secret American biological warfare labs in Ukraine.

US officials have said the labs are Ukrainian and part of an initiative called the Biological Threat Reduction Program that has received US financial assistance. The White House has warned that the Kremlin’s conspiracy theory used to justify its invasion of Ukraine could itself be a prelude to a Russian chemical or biological attack.

“This is a classic move by the Russians” warned the US director of national intelligence Avril Haines this week. The Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen told the Senate foreign relations committee that Carlson and others were behind the spread of the bioweapons rumors which are gaining credence in the US far right.

Other Republicans including the Illinois representative Adam Kinzinger have refused to go on Tucker Carlson Tonight because of his alleged pro-Putin agenda. Kinzinger has accused Carlson of pushing the narrative that the US is to blame for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“There’s no way I’ll go on his show for a number of reasons” Kinzinger a US air force veteran said in a Twitter video. “His insistence that the west was provoking war with Putin his spreading lies about biolabs and his continued spewing of conspiracy theories are nothing but complete evil. His show is full of Russian propaganda and not news.”

Carlson’s power comes amid the rise of far-right groups individuals and opinions across the US. Whether from militia supporters seeking power in California local government or in the Idaho state office or on new social media platforms the far right in America is undergoing something of a boom.

Carlson experts say is part of that. And so too is a fondness – or at least a respect – for Putin. According to Scott McLemee who reviewed a newly published study on the right in Inside Higher Ed last week: “There is no question about Carlson being at very least a white nationalist which might not be fascist but close enough.

“The appeal of Russian authoritarianism for the American far right is considerable and not just because of Trump’s fealty to Putin. A common skin color and shared hostility to feminism and gay rights counts for a lot.”

But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the daily images of suffering it has produced for US media have complicated Carlson’s platform at least in terms of the broader US media landscape even if not within Fox itself.

“This balancing act he’s been playing on so many different levels is getting a lot more precarious” said Bob Thompson a former professor of media studies at Syracuse University and current director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture.

Carlson’s equivocation on Russian aggression is complicating the ideological real estate he occupies. “It’s not only confused it’s almost dada” Thompson says. “You see it playing out on the show when someone makes a rational argument and it’s deflected not with an alternative but the abandonment of rationality.”

But that may also be what Carlson’s avid supporters and equally avid detractors come to see.

It’s the nature of cable news that relatively few viewers are required to establish a commercial footing so the power of advertisers to speak for the body politic by pulling advertising when a host says something egregious has diminished – and with it the chances of getting fired. And Carlson remains a hugely popular figure with Fox viewers and through them the Trump base and the Republican politicians that it powers.

Which leaves Carlson and others on the right and left to indulge whatever particular train of thought or lack thereof they choose to follow.

“The whole point of these shows is to outrage viewers across the country which will in turn strengthen the very small audience you need for it to be a hit” Thompson said. “Carlson is in a sense untouchable because outrage is a genre of entertainment all of its own.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDEwcGhvZW5peC5jb20vbmV3cy9yZXZpZXctdGhlLW91dGZpdC1tYXJrLXJ5bGFuY2Utem9leS1kZXV0Y2jSAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxMHBob2VuaXguY29tL25ld3MvcmV2aWV3LXRoZS1vdXRmaXQtbWFyay1yeWxhbmNlLXpvZXktZGV1dGNoLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: Mark Rylance is well-suited to the gangland tension of 'The Outfit',"article

In an entertainment industry that rewards big showy performances from glitzy actors it’s nice to remember that actors like Mark Rylance still exist. The unassuming soft-spoken performer who first won an Academy Award for his movie-star-making turn in Steven Spielberg’s ""Bridge of Spies"" is often most compelling when he weaponizes that apparent gentility making it a tool his characters use to mask their motives and capabilities. And it’s that kind of subterfuge that debut director Graham Moore leverages to chilling effect in his claustrophobic Chicago thriller ""The Outfit.""

About ""The Outfit"": Cutting away from established patterns

Zoey Deutch and Mark Rylance in ""The Outfit"" (Focus Features)

Moore who won an Oscar himself for his screenplay for ""The Imitation Game"" sets the entirety of ""The Outfit"" inside a moody bespoke clothing shop in the 1950s. Its owner English ex-pat Leonard (Rylance) fled to Chicago after the Great War chased by the memory of a personal tragedy that cost him everything except his shears.

Now he makes a decent living as a tailor — or ""cutter"" as he modestly clarifies — meticulously creating custom suits for his clientele which include members of the Boyle mafia (who also use a lockbox in the back for clandestine communications amongst the ""family""). Leonard prefers a life of quiet dedication to his work; his only companion is his assistant Mabel (Zoey Deutch) who longs to travel the world and has started a risky fling with Richie Boyle (Dylan O’Brien) son of mob patriarch Rob (Simon Russell Beale).

Things go south late one night when hotheaded Boyle goon Francis (Johnny Flynn of 2020’s ""Emma."") carries a wounded Richie into the shop and demands that Leonard ""sew him up."" (After all what’s really the difference between stitching fabric and flesh?) But this circumstance is merely the opening salvo in a turf war that involves a rat a mysterious tape and an even more mercurial organization called — you guessed it — The Outfit whose boss wants in on the Boyle family’s territory. Leonard now reluctantly promoted from bystander to participant must use his wits to survive the night. Luckily for him (and the audience) there’s more to the nebbish wallflower than meets the eye.

Moore a Chicagoan himself has a natural fluency in the wise-guy aesthetics of the city’s mafioso history and ""The Outfit"" is chock-a-block with tossed-off vernacular that evokes that world without over-explaining or rendering the finely-constructed screenplay any less taut. You don’t have to own a mobster thesaurus to figure out what Francis means when he says Richie has ""a marble in his gut"" and Leonard’s matter-of-fact narration over certain stretches of the film feels driven by character more than convenience — offering up thematically-fitting parables whose true nature are deliciously revealed later on.

Mirroring Leonard’s own penchant for precision Moore’s script is marvelously intricate. ""The Outfit"" unfurls at a pleasing pace Moore layering one revelation on top of another and spacing out Hitchcockian twists at pitch-perfect moments. Who’s the rat? Will Boyle find out what’s happened to Richie and who will he blame when he does? Who will even survive the night? And who is Leonard really underneath all that downcast deference? While Moore hardly changes the thriller game with the results he still knows how to build a pleasing mechanism with the pieces he’s given himself.

The supporting cast is more than game for the guns-and-glory intrigue; the ensemble mostly consists of established British character actors chewing their way through nasal Chi-caah-go accents with devilish glee. That goes double for Flynn parlaying his unconventional good looks and reedy timbre into a bad-boy capo who proves the film’s true wild card. For his part Beale puts his pugnaciously interesting visage to good use as a mob boss who employs quiet menace and Nikki Amuka-Bird steals the spotlight however briefly as a rival mobster who’s more than ready to fill the gap Boyle’s weakness presents.

But the movie is Rylance’s show through and through Moore’s camera holding long on close-ups of his weathered face the actor’s sad eyes masking the character’s unpredictable wit (and possibly more). From moment to moment Leonard has to be many things to many people — friend ally informant protector — playing each side against the other just to stay alive often with a single line of dialogue. It’s a tremendous showcase for one of the world’s most skilled performers who doesn’t often get to carry a major motion picture so squarely on his back.

Zoey Deutch and Johnny Flynn (Focus Features)

While ""The Outfit"" can feel a little unambitious at times chiefly due to the innate staginess of a one-location potboiler like this it benefits from impressive talent behind the camera as well. There are layers of menace and calculation in every piece of Sophie O’Neill and Zac Posen’s period-appropriate costumes lit with even-handed detail by cinematographer Dick Pope so we can catch every stitch and fold of Leonard’s process. And Alexandre Desplat’s winking piano-heavy score twirls with unexpected whimsy (not unlike his underrated score for the Mossad spy thriller ""Operation: Finale"").

Like Leonard’s precisely-cut suits (the one he wears in the film having been constructed by Rylance himself who dove into the world of tailoring for the role) ""The Outfit"" feels like something made with care patience and attention. Moore wisely stays in his comfort zone in his first outing as a director sticking to what he knows which is intricate period detail and an ear for dialogue. And the same theatricality that might hamper other filmmakers allows him to stay focused on the scraps of fabric in front of him assembling the components into a pleasing whole. Frankly we should have more films that play like theater and ""The Outfit"" is a refreshing reminder that that tradition is alive and well.

B.A.P.S. (1997): This cult classic comedy from screenwriter and actress Troy Byer stars Halle Berry and Natalie Desselle as two friends who dream of opening the world’s first hair salon/soul food restaurant combo. The leads’ lively charming performances are perfectly complemented in memorability by the film’s iconic costuming hairstyling makeup and production design. One-of-a-kind. Rated PG-13. 92 minutes. Dir: Robert Townsend. Also featuring Martin Landau Ian Richardson Troy Byer Bernie Mac.

Beauty and the Beast (2014): French movie star Léa Seydoux (""No Time to Die"") glows in this lush adaptation of a familiar fairy tale. Rated PG-13. 112 minutes. Dir: Christophe Gans. Language: French. Featuring: Léa Seydoux Vincent Cassel André Dussollier Eduardo Noriega.

Carol (2015): This achingly romantic period drama from director Todd Haynes stars Cate Blanchett as the titular Carol a glamorous woman who catches the eye of Therese (Rooney Mara) a young aspiring photographer working in a department store. Carol forgets her gloves (or does she?) and the sparks that fly across the counter catch fire when introduced to the oxygen of the outside world. Haynes’ unapologetically queer film heavily inspired by photography of the 1950s is swoon-worthy and stylish. Mara and Blanchett are almost as good at wearing incredible costumes as they are at acting and they’re very very good at acting. One of the most celebrated and moving dramas of the century so far.

Rated R. 118 minutes. Dir: Todd Haynes. Also featuring Sarah Paulson Jake Lacy Kyle Chandler.

Marie Antoinette (2006): 2022 Oscar nominee Kirsten Dunst stars in this exuberantly colorful interpretation of the life of the infamous Queen of France. The film divided critics at the time but it’s since become something of a classic thanks to Dunst’s winning performance the sumptuous and absurd design (it picked up an Oscar for its costumes) and its addictive pop score. An accurate historical document this is not but it isn’t meant to be. Instead ""Marie Antoinette"" lets us see a towering figure of history through her own teenage eyes. Rated PG-13. 122 minutes. Dir: Sofia Coppola. Also featuring Jason Schwartzman Judy Davis Rip Torn Rose Byrne Molly Shannon Shirley Henderson Danny Huston Steve Coogan.

In February the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) agreed with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board’s (PTAB’s) decision that the original claims of Zaxcom’s U.S. Patent No. 9336307 for Engineering Emmy® and technical OSCAR award-winning wireless microphone technology were unpatentable as obvious but upheld the substitute claims Zaxcom had proposed. Now Zaxcom has petitioned the court for rehearing en banc arguing that the CAFC’s precedent in Fox Factory Inc. v. SRAM LLC 944 F.3d 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2019) “confused the law” regarding a rebuttable presumption of nexus.

Zaxcom first appealed the PTAB’s decision on the original claims of the ‘307 patent in May of 2020 arguing that the PTAB misconstrued the claims and failed to properly consider evidence of industry praise. The ‘307 patent disclosed several embodiments including a “Dropout Embodiment” and a “Multi-track Embodiment”. In the Dropout Embodiment the loss of audio data during a wireless transmission was remedied by replacing data with locally recorded audio data. In the Multitrack Embodiment local audio data from a plurality of local audio devices was combined to create a single local multi-track file or a single remote multitrack file.

Zaxcom said the PTAB erred in its claim construction by determining that the claims encompass both the Dropout Embodiment and the Multitrack Embodiment and that the PTAB improperly construed the claims such that the local audio data and the remotely recorded audio data may be from different sources rather than both originating from the same source. But the CAFC agreed with the PTAB’s approach saying that “[u]nder the claims’ broadest reasonable interpretation (BRI) local and remote audio data may be ‘combined’ either to repair corrupted audio data received by the remote recorder or to create a multitrack audio file. In adopting that construction under the BRI standard the Board correctly rejected Zaxcom’s argument for a requirement that the claimed ‘local audio data’ and ‘remote audio data’ derive from the same source (i.e. the same local audio event).”

The court agreed that given the PTAB’s construction the Board had “ample evidence” to support its finding that claims 1-11 were obvious over the primary reference “Strub” when combined with two other prior art references or that claims 12-14 were anticipated by Strub.

The PTAB’s Final Written Decision in the case was designated precedential in April 2020 for its holding that a nexus between the evidence and the merits of the claimed invention must be established in order for objective indicia of nonobviousness to be given substantial weight. Citing Fox Factory the PTAB noted that a patentee is entitled to a presumption of nexus “when the patentee shows that the asserted objective evidence is tied to a specific product and that product ‘embodies the claimed features and is coextensive with them.’”

The CAFC agreed with the PTAB’s determination that Zaxcom’s evidence of objective indicia like industry praise and long-felt need “lacked the nexus to the claimed invention required to alter a conclusion of obviousness that would be justified based on the prior-art analysis.” Specifically Zaxcom’s reliance on the industry awards it received and declarations from sound mixers failed because such praise was “primarily directed to the systems’ critical feature of dropout repair while the claims of the ’307 patent under the BRI construction properly adopted are broadly directed to wirelessly transmitting audio data and combining local and remote audio data from a plurality of devices—a technique already known in the prior art.”

Zaxcom’s petition for en banc rehearing argues that this addition of a third prerequisite for a finding of rebuttable presumption of nexus—i.e. proof that the product has no “critical” unclaimed features that materially impact its functionality—is what confused the law and is “far removed from the underlying purpose of a having a nexus presumption in the first place.”

The pre-Fox Factory case law “is clear that a product that practices a patent is entitled to a presumption of nexus unless ‘the patented invention is only a small component of the product’” says the petition citing Henny Penny Corp. v. Frymaster LLC  938 F.3d 1324 7 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2019). “Outside this ‘limited exception’ unclaimed features merely serve as potential rebuttal evidence” the petition adds citing WBIP LLC v. Kohler Co. 829 F.3d 1317 1329 & n.3 (Fed. Cir. 2016).

The petition also says that the Fox Factory is “intractably high” and “demoralizes” inventors. “If not brought back in line with this Court’s longstanding authority [it will] signal to inventors that no amount of praise will protect them from an obviousness attack. Nowhere is this clearer than in the case-at-bar.”

Ultimately Zaxcom is asking the CAFC to “reaffirm the longstanding rule that unclaimed features do not preclude a presumption of nexus unless “the patented invention is only a small component of the product tied to the objective evidence” under Henny Penny and to reverse the Board’s decision of obviousness with respect to the original challenged claims “or at least remand with instructions to apply the presumption of nexus between those inventions and the industry praise.”

The February panel decision did affirm the PTAB’s approval of Zaxcom’s narrowed substitute claims explaining that “the substitute claims narrow the ‘combined’ claim limitation to a limitation that requires ‘replacing’ the remotely recorded data with local audio data from a device’s memory.”

Since the asserted prior art basis for obviousness of the narrowed claims was weak the PTAB concluded and the CAFC agreed that the objective indicia evidence was strong with respect to the new claims and entitled to a presumption of nexus. Furthermore the evidence indicated a positive nexus as the “claims are undisputedly directed to dropout repair in systems with wearable recording devices and this feature was discussed in at least the Emmy Award.”

The petitioners may have a hard road to en banc review considering several CAFC judges recently expressed frustration with the number of rehearing requests they have been receiving according to an IPLaw360 report.

The expansion will bring almost 200 new jobs to Clinton County and is almost doubling Bombardier’s workforce in the state of Michigan.

“BRP is a global company with footprints across the world in many regions” said Dillon Rush the director of business attraction of the Lansing Economic Area Partnership. “This BRP expansion builds communities.”

Rush said that 200 jobs have a profound impact on the local main street of St. John’s in the local shops in Watertown Township and the housing market of those communities.

They are expanding by adding a 55000 square-foot manufacturing facility and warehouse in St. Johns and adding 15000 square-feet to its location north of Lansing.

“This expansion is part of our long-term strategy to expand our product offerings in the marine space” said Cory Highfield the general manager at Manitou Pontoon Boats.

Through the Michigan Economic Development Corporation the company is getting a performance-based grant of $689500.

“The money can be used flexibly for training for expanding the footprint of the building really a tool to utilize as they see fit when it comes to the expansion project” Rush said.

They have received support from LEAP Capital Area Michigan Works! the Michigan Economic Development Corporation and Lansing Community College.

“All those organizations work very well in concert with one another to pro manufacturing in this area” Highfield said. That's why we have such a rich workforce of highly skilled and you know people to draw from.”

According to Highfeld they have not only been recruiting from LCC but also sending workers to the classes to learn additional skills.

“LCC has been an incredible partner for us over the course of the last year as we've been starting the second shift training individuals really trying to upskill our workforce” Highfield said.

According to a press release from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer the project is expected to generate a total investment of $11.9 million. The company is also looking to fill open positions.

Accuracy is good it's light and it's comfortable to wear for long periods – however the price is similar to some full smartwatches.

At £139.50 the MZ-Switch is up there with some well-equipped smart watches such as the Garmin Forerunner 45 at £129.99. That comes with full GPS for exercise tracking and recording as well as the watch function and many more features besides. The MZ-Switch is purely a heart rate (HR) monitor though and requires a smartphone or bike computer to show its data either live or post-exercise. That makes it look pricey.

> Buy this online here

If you aren't interested in GPS you can pick up a fitness tracker that shows heart rates on its own screen – such as the Fitbit Inspire 2 – for far less. The Inspire 2 £89.99 though at the time of writing Fitbit was selling it for £59.99.

From a purely cycling point of view where you are likely to already be using your phone or bike computer to record your rides the MZ-Switch makes more sense if you want to add HR data... but then you could get a Wahoo TICKR HR Monitor with chest strap for £39.99 instead. Alternatively if you want optical HR at the wrist the TICKR FIT strap is £64.99.

Obviously the main selling point of the MZ-Switch is its versatility in switching between wrist and chest but it's still cheaper to buy both Wahoos (around £105) than the Myzone.

Also Polar's H10 HR sensor has similar capabilities to the MZ-Switch – such as memory for training without a phone app connection and Bluetooth plus ANT+ connectivity – and that's significantly less at £76.50.

Performance

Price aside though the Myzone monitor works well is easy to set up and you do get an app to run alongside. The MZ-Switch also feels well-made and I had no issues with durability or reliability throughout the test period.

In the box you get the HR monitor itself a wrist strap an arm strap a chest strap a USB charger cable and a storage pouch. The monitor snaps into the holder on each strap and sits there securely. The straps are all good quality and fit comfortably and offer a decent amount of adjustability to suit various sizes.

The setup is just like any other Bluetooth or ANT+ device; turn it on and then from the device you'll be sending the data too search for it and connect. For most people that device will be your phone after you've downloaded the Myzone app. It will also work with things like Strava.

The app itself doesn't bring a whole lot to the party. It's basic but you can bring up data on past workouts such as average/peak HR and calories burned with the latter being calculated from the details you give the app: age weight and height.

As for HR range like resting and maximum figures they cannot be set manually. The app uses data from workouts and fills these in itself and from that it works out your HR ranges.

Personally I carry out max heart rate tests reasonably regularly and would like to be able to set my zones and fill in my maximum numbers myself. The more you wear the MZ-Switch though the better the overall data will be.

The five zones (50-59% 60-69% 70-79% 80-89% and 90-100%) are represented by different colours shown by the LED so you can see how hard (or not) you are working without having to look at the app.

Connectivity

Connection to other devices is simple enough too. It linked straight away to a Bryton computer and a Mio plus a Garmin Edge 530 after a little bit of faffing. I find the Garmin a bit picky when it comes to pairing though.

When using the wrist or arm positions the MZ-Switch uses optical measurement which Myzone says gives 95% accuracy. I found it in line with the figures I was getting using my Garmin Fenix 6 Pro. When switching to the chest strap the EGR sensor improves on that with 99.4% accuracy.

> 15 best heart rate monitors for cycling – get useful fitness data

Wearing my Garmin on my wrist alongside the MZ-Switch on the chest strap I found they tracked virtually identically up to about 170bpm. Above that the chest mount data was more stable while the optical sensor sometimes read a few beats higher or lower. It's not enough to massively affect averages over a decent-length workout though.

Battery life is decent too. I got 15-16 hours out of a full charge and you can keep an eye on battery level on the app. It only takes a couple of hours or so to charge as well. The MZ-Swift is also waterproof down to 10m.

Overall

The MZ-Switch performs well and is easy to use. When you consider the app though it doesn't really bring a whole lot more than other heart rate monitors on the market especially from a cycling point of view.

Verdict

Precise and comfortable HR monitor with optical and EGR sensors but pricier than two separate devices",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9vdGhlci1zcG9ydHMvMjAyMi8wMy8xOS9uZXctc29uYXItZ2l2ZXMtYW5nbGVycy1jbGVhci1waWN0dXJlL9IBb2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9vdGhlci1zcG9ydHMvMjAyMi8wMy8xOS9uZXctc29uYXItZ2l2ZXMtYW5nbGVycy1jbGVhci1waWN0dXJlLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New sonar gives anglers clear picture,"Forward-facing sonar is all the rage these days in the fishing world.

Pros and recreational anglers alike are relying on real-time technology like Garmin Panoptix LiveScope Lowrance ActiveTarget and Humminbird MEGA Live Imaging to sniff out fish and catch them like never before.

Alton Jones Jr. of Waco relied heavily on LiveScope to win the $100000 top prize in the Major League Fishing event in late February at Lake Fork.

Anyone who has found success with the technology will agree the forward-facing concept is a significant improvement over conventional down scan and side-scan sonar introduced more than a decade ago.

Though still effective traditional sonar requires boat movement using the outboard engine to function properly. Spooking fish is an inherent risk.

Forward-facing sonar is different. It works using a special transducer that mounts to the trolling motor shaft or an independent pole. Anglers can slip quietly along as the transducer scans the water column all around the boat. High resolution imagery relays to the electronics screen in real time.

One of the main benefits is it boosts the chances of seeing fish without blowing your cover. Another is it helps anglers make precise bait presentations to fish and more important see how they react to baits. You can even pinpoint grass lines channels brush piles and other key structure from a considerable distance.

If a fish or a school of shad swims by you see them without delay. Violent strikes on moving baits are frequently witnessed in real time. Other times fish will charge the bait but won’t eat it. It’s not uncommon to see fish tuck tail and run for no apparent reason — really cool stuff that can be addictive in a sense.

Used correctly the technology can be deadly on individual fish that are suspended in the water column and even deadlier on large schools of sport fish like crappie.

The technology has steered anglers toward dozens to double-digit bass and two lake records at Lake O.H. Ivie in the last 13 months. The biggest belongs to Brodey Davis of Tuttle Okla.

Davis was fishing at Ivie on Feb. 24 when he spotted a big fish on his forward sonar. His second cast with an Alabama-rigged cluster of swim baits was a charm. He saw the fish eat the bait on his electronics screen.

Davis’ 9-year-old son Stetson netted the fish. It weighed 17.06 pounds on certified scales. The bass is a new lake record the No. 7 heaviest Texas bass of all-time and the largest reported statewide since 1992.

Since Feb. 2021 Oklahoma angler Josh Jones says he has used forward sonar to catch 40 double-digit bass out of O.H. Ivie including five between 13.20 and 15.40 pounds. On Feb. 23 Jones turned his fourth Legacy class Toyota ShareLunker a program record for multiple entries by the same angler.

Simply put the fish can run but they can’t hide from persistent anglers willing to put in the time to learn the ropes. Think of it like video game fishing only this is the real deal. No wonder the young guys who grew up playing Donkey Kong on their cell phones are so quick to catch on.

Glen Webb of Bethel Okla. has played a few video games. He likes fooling around with forward-facing sonar even more.

Apparently the 32-year-old angler is pretty handy with it too. In 2021 he claims he used the technology to win 11 of the 12 tournaments he entered on his home lake Broken Bow Reservoir.

Webb brought his Garmin LiveScope to Sam Rayburn in eastern Texas on Feb. 10-12. He used it to catch 14 pre-spawn bass weighing 63-12 in the Toyota Series Southwestern Division bass tournament. Webb topped a field of heavy hitting locals in his first pro level event and banked $54000.

Webb claims the intel provided by his forward-facing sonar guided him to every fish he brought to the scales. “I saw them all eat the bait” he said. “It’s a really valuable tool. You are definitely at a disadvantage if you don’t have it.”

Todd Driscoll of Brookeland is well-versed on the ins and outs of using forward-facing technology. Driscoll is a TPWD fisheries biologist and hardcore angler who does some technical work for Garmin on the side. He has been a student of LiveScope technology since it was introduced in 2018.

Leaning to interpret what you are looking at is a major key to success Driscoll says.

“It makes you much more efficient on the water — no more hedging bets and guessing where the sweet spots are. Learn to use it and you won’t waste a single cast all day long.”

The biologist cautions that using LiveScope to fish for bass can be a double-edged sword.

“It gets my heart rate up every time I see a fish tracking my bait and racing to eat it” Driscoll said. “But it’s equally frustrating to see a group of fish track a lure for 15 feet and never eat it.”

As effective as forward-facing sonar can be in bass fishing arenas Lake Fork fishing guide Gary Paris believes it is even better for targeting crappie.

“There’s no doubt about it” Paris said.

Crappie typically run in large schools. They are prone to hang out around brush piles timber bridges and other structure often at suspended depths. Paris says forward-facing sonar is a great tool for exploiting these fish for two reasons.

“First off it helps eliminate a lot of unproductive water very quickly” he said. “If LiveScope isn’t showing you any fish there is no sense in fishing there. You just keep looking until you find them.”

Second Paris pointed out that crappie fishing is all about bait presentation at the proper depth. LiveScope makes it possible to tune in quickly and make adjustments on the fly.

“If you know what depth the fish are it helps keep the bait right in their faces 100 percent of the time because you can see it” he said. “That isn’t possible with traditional sonar. If the fish move you just stay with them.”

Some are worn around your wrist some can hang from your neck some are a completely independent entity while others require a smartphone app.

Then there are budgets to consider. Pricier fitness trackers offer all kinds of sensors that might be overkill for a casual user while more affordable models tend to be simpler and easier to use.

The good news is that there really is something for everyone. So if you’re looking for something to track your steps detect a fall or simply to receive your phone notifications when you’re in the garden there’s a fitness tracker for you. Here are our picks for the easiest fitness tracker to use.

Fitbit Inspire 2

(Image credit: Fitbit)

Let’s kick things off with a brand that’s become something of a household name thanks to its solid wearable lineup that offers a variety of options.

The Fitbit Inspire 2 is an easy-to-use wrist-based fitness tracker that can monitor your steps heart rate and stress levels throughout the day. It needs to be connected to your smartphone via Bluetooth but doing so will allow you to track plenty of metrics in the Fitbit app and enable GPS tracking.

You can also remove the straps and enable Pocket mode if you’d rather connect the device to a belt or another item of clothing.

Bellabeat Leaf

Whether worn as a clipped-on brooch a necklace or around your wrist the Bellabeat Leaf will track your steps sleep meditation sessions and stress levels while the app supports menstrual cycle and fertility tracking.

It also has a really unique design that feels much less like a gadget and more like a fashion accessory.

Oura (Generation 3)

The Oura (Generation 3) is a little on the expensive side but it’s a really great and simple-to-operate fitness tracker that’s built into a small ring. That means it’s easy to forget you’re wearing it making it fit seamlessly into your day.

The joy of the Oura is that it has no buttons or screen at all; just connect it to the mobile app on your phone slip it into your finger and it will track your heart rate step count workouts and more automatically.

There are also special features like guided meditations available for Oura subscribers with new features being added all the time.

Garmin Vivoactive 4

Garmin is best known for its feature-packed running watches but the Vivoactive 4 is much less complicated than high-end wearables like the Garmin Fenix 7.

Like a Fitbit it can track your step count throughout the day and record your calorie burn during workouts but it can do a lot more besides. For example unlike many fitness trackers it has its own GPS receiver which allows it to track your route and speed on walks runs and bike rides even if you choose to leave your phone at home. Once you get home all that data will sync with the Google Connect app on your phone automatically.

The app is surprisingly easy to use and presents all your daily workout and health data clearly complete with explanations to help you understand what it all means. Once you get stuck in you'll be surprised how straightforward it all is.

Amazon Halo Band

(Image credit: Amazon)

The Amazon Halo Band has some really interesting features alongside the usual activity tracker including a way to analyze your tone of voice.

It does lack a display which means you’re heavily reliant on a phone. However if that’s not a problem your step and exercise data will be tracked clearly and simply in the accompanying app.

You can take the Amazon Halo Band swimming too and if you’re not keen on the fabric design there’s a series of colored sports bands that offer a more breathable option.

Display

Ease of use is a subjective term but the options included on our list will display clear metrics on their own built-in screen or on your smartphone. If a fitness tracker has a screen it should be large enough for text to be clearly legible and any mobile apps should be free to download.

Visuals and design

Fitness trackers are very personal devices and they should be able to reflect your personality. Where possible we’ve highlighted options that have customizable interfaces or can be worn in multiple locations on your person without any changes to their function. Most can be worn on your wrist while others can be attached to a belt or shoe.

Features

All of the selected fitness trackers vary in terms of the data they collect but each is accurate in its metrics. Whether tracking heart rate stress levels or menstrual cycles each has a reputation for accuracy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53dGhyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbnMvMTMtaW52ZXN0aWdhdGVzL2hvb3NpZXItbG90dGVyeS1pc3N1ZS1nb2xkZW4tamFja3BvdC1mYXN0LXBsYXktZ2FtZS1pbmRpYW5hLzUzMS1mZmQ5ZDRhZi0xMGMxLTRiNmYtOWY2Mi1lNGZkZmU2MTViNjPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hoosier Lottery experiencing 'issue' with some tickets,"The lottery said it’s working to find the source of the issue that involved more than 600 tickets.

INDIANAPOLIS — The Hoosier Lottery is investigating why more than 600 lottery tickets were sold and appeared to be winners. The lottery said it’s now working to find the source of the issue.

The issue was first reported Sunday morning involving the new $20 Golden Jackpot Fast Play game. The lottery said the issue was that tickets showed winning numbers but then “could not be validated as a winning ticket through the mobile app or at retail.”

Sunday was the debut of the $20 Golden Jackpot Fast Play game. Retailers were told to stop selling the game by noon Sunday but still 632 tickets with the issue were sold.

Justin Mucker said he bought two $20 Golden Jackpot Fast Play tickets in Monticello.

“I thought ‘Wow we won $5000’” said Mucker.

However when he scanned the tickets they did not show as winners.

John Garmin said he too bought two tickets in Tipton. Both showed he won $5000. When he tried to buy a third at a different location he said “They shut the game down and they're not paying out right now.""

We met Garmin at the Hoosier Lottery’s Indianapolis office filling out paperwork.

Over the phone a lottery employee said people with $20 Golden Jackpot Fast Play game tickets should take a picture and send it to info@hoosierlottery.com.

Hoosier Lottery said it sent an alert to all retailers on Sunday for them to notify players to keep their tickets reporting it will also post information on its website and respond to people on social media.

The plan is to also send a push notification to myLottery members and people who scan their ticket on the mobile app between March 20-22.

We are experiencing an issue with the $20 Golden Jackpot Fast Play game. If you have purchased this ticket please hold on to your ticket. We will share more information on https://t.co/q0j5IgN6QQ when available. — Hoosier Lottery (@hoosierlottery) March 20 2022

No word if people will get their winnings. The Indiana Administrative Code states if ""a lottery ticket contains a production defect which makes validation of the ticket impossible the ticket is void and the commission shall not be liable or responsible for the award of any prize...""

But people aren’t getting the same ticket with the same numbers. Garmin and Mucker showed 13News four different tickets with four different sets of winning numbers.

""It is crazy” Mucker said.

They don't want a refund.

""I want them to honor the ticket” Mucker said.

Both men said they would likely still play lottery if they just received a $20 refund. However Mucker doubts he’ll play a Fast Play game in the future.

Unlike a scratch-off which is printed ahead of time Fast Play tickets are computer generated and printed when you buy. There’s not a drawing to wait for.

Tesla designs develops manufactures sells and leases electric vehicles (EVs). The company is also in energy generation storage systems and offers services related to its sustainable energy products. Some of its automotive products include four-door sedans – Model 3 and Model S – as well as sport utility vehicles (SUVs) Model Y and Model X.1

In its 2021 full year (FY21) financial results Tesla reported an 87% increase in deliveries of EVs which it believes speaks to the viability and profitability of these products. The company achieved the highest quarterly operating margin among all volume of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) which it said demonstrated that EVs can be more profitable than combustion engine vehicles.2

In the same financial year the group generated $5.5 billion in net income and $5 billion of free cash flow. This was after spending $6.5 billion to build out new factories and other capital projects. It’s ramped up production by increasing manufacturing capacity at its new factories in Austin in the US and Berlin in Germany. This is while also maximizing output of existing factories in Fremont in the US and Shanghai in China.2",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYnVuZW9ubGluZW5nLmNvbS9xdWFsaXR5LWVkdWNhdGlvbi1uZXctc2tpbGwta2V5LXRvLXNvbHZpbmcteW91dGhzLXVuZW1wbG95bWVudC1pbi1uaWdlcmlhLXNheXMtdXNtYW4tYWJkdWxyYXphcS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Quality education new skill key to solving youths unemployment in Nigeria says Usman AbdulRazaq,"Founder and Executive Director of Dudden Hill Foundation Usman Muhammed AbdulRazaq on Saturday said the key to defeating youths’ unemployment and socio-political instability remains to prioritise quality education and skills acquisition in the national education curriculum to maximise the nation’s human capital resources for its development.

Speaking at Kwara State University (KWASU) during the seminar organised on career development and mentorship Usman said young people “must be well-equipped and positioned to enjoy the opportunities in the new economy.”

The event was attended by top players in the public and private sectors including the General Manager Kwara State Social Investment Programmes (KWASSIP) Mohammed Brimah; Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on NGO Affair Mrs Olohuntoyosi Thomas; Senior Vice President GE Healthcare Financial Services SSA Mr Tunji AbdulSalam; Partner and Creative Director The Hook Creative Agency Toheeb Balogun; members of the students’ union; and other youths-led groups in the state.

Usman AbdulRazaq who is also Vice President Financial Advisory Unit at Africa Finance Corporation explained that Dudden Hill is embarking on a nationwide campus tour to sensitise the students on career and grant them access to learning relevant skills on their website through its Next Program.

The organisation inaugurated 10 outstanding students in KWASU as ambassadors providing them with starter packs for the project.

“Today is important to all of us and our future. I congratulate all the ambassadors. Let me tell you that this position is that of responsibility. You will help carry the message of growth to the thousands of your friends in KWASU and Kwara State to lead the nation to develop” Usman said amid wild cheers from the students while inaugurating the ambassadors.

“You are joining a moving train of progress. KWASU is our first point of call in Kwara but it is not the last. The NeXt Project continues to other schools and states. We are on course to producing young people who are equipped with relevant skills exposed and employable in the new market.”

He said the root causes of unemployment and social instability is the lack of access to quality education and critical skills among students and young graduates urging millennials to take advantage of the internet to acquire knowledge.

“Our vision is clear. Our strategy is even more simple. We have a platform to register and enjoy FREE access to basic learning on in-demand skills such as Online business Investment banking Data Science CV Writing/Interview preparation Digital marketing among others. This is designed to bridge the gap between the school and the labour market. It is crucial to reversing youths’ unemployment and social unrest.

“These are things I experienced in the course of my career. So I am taking it upon myself to mobilise the young people to benefit from my wealth of experience and exposure in education investment and banking to groom a new generation of quality leaders.”

During the panel session General Manager KWASSIP Muhammed Brimah urged the students to cultivate good habits and friendships noting that it is vital to success in career and leadership.

SSA NGO Affairs to the Kwara Governor Mrs Olohuntoyosi Thomas who commended the enthusiasm and massive turnout for the event further provided a list of the 20 top skills for the future recommended by development bodies and market leaders encouraging them to obtain most ahead of their graduation.

Tunji AbdulSalam and Toheeb Balogun while sharing their personal stories stated that personal investment is a continuous process respectively. They corroborated that opportunities exist for the skilled in private sectors for the competent hands.

KWASU Students Union President Yusuf Umar Danshitta while delivering the vote of thanks admonished the students to make the best of the opportunities provided by the Dudden Hill NeXt project and ensure that they work for the growth of the University and the state.

He also tasked Dudden Hill Foundation to spread its Next Program to other universities to benefit many students across the nation.

“I commend Dudden Hill Foundation for this wonderful project. It is timely and impactful. I also thank the guests for sharing their experiences. I have taken a particular interest in one of the courses on offer Data Science to enrich my final year project. This shows the quality of what is on offer on their platform. I will keep encouraging our students to take advantage of these courses to skill up themselves.

“We sincerely appreciate the organisers for choosing KWASU as a pilot in the state” President Danshitta who was part of the newly-inaugurated Next Project ambassadors said after the seminar on Saturday.

It’s a feature I suppose rather than a bug: when you believe that desires can be made real by concentration alone as those in the manifesting game do and when that desire is for a journalist to cover the manifesting company you recently set up then well who I am to say that they didn’t?

The practice of manifesting is hardly new – it dates back to both the New Thought movement of the 19th century and more recently a resurgence in the noughties thanks to the 2006 self-help book The Secret which sold 30m copies and Oprah Winfrey who is a fan.

Yet the latest surge was down to millennials and Gen Z: in 2020 as lockdowns began Google searches of “manifesting” went up 600%. On Instagram the hashtags #manifest and #manifestation now total 15m posts. On TikTok views of manifestation content are currently surging past 9bn. Teen vloggers suddenly became online celebrities by giving manifestation advice. Cara Delevingne said she was manifesting a baby. “Shut up I’m manifesting” became a meme.

But manifesting it turned out was far from just a teen or online phenomenon. As lockdowns eased real-life courses and retreats started to spring up offering to teach it and promising in return well everything. There were courses for “Manifesting Creativity” and “Manifesting Happiness”. You could “Manifest Your Financial Freedom” and “Manifest Your Dream Partner”. There were events for those having issues with manifesting (“Why does the Law of Attraction not work for me?”) and events for those who required a manifesting leg-up (“Manifesting with the Moon”).

Eventually I settled on an event called Manifest 2022 which seemed both unthreatening and all-encompassing. I met its founder Moon Onyx Starr 38 for coffee in Mayfair central London around the corner from where she lived. Starr wore close-cropped bleached hair and spoke with the unblinking sincerity of someone who always carries crystals that promote success.

Before the pandemic Starr worked for a jewellery brand but was furloughed in March 2020. Like so many others she felt “displaced lost and confused”; deep-rooted issues she’d been ignoring came to the surface. At one point she says she was on the verge of a breakdown. She threw herself into self-help books and podcasts and it wasn’t long before she started reading about manifesting.

View image in fullscreen ‘I totally manifested the retreat… the facilitators were manifested… you were manifested…’: Moon Onyx Starr

The concept roughly is this: manifesting takes the idea of a positive mental attitude and runs with it. So while negative thoughts create “limiting beliefs” and in turn prevent positive things from happening positive thoughts – when focused on specific goals and outcomes – can make those things happen. “You are co-creating with the universe” explains Starr who says she avoids reading the news in order to minimise limiting vibes.

One key caveat: “You can only manifest in line with your higher purpose.” (Essentially the universe can say no which is often the explanation when things don’t happen.)

Starr set up her wellness retreat company Over The Moon Retreats last spring and soon discovered events that focused solely on manifesting sold out almost instantly. “I totally manifested the retreat” she says of the Hammersmith venue she settled upon. “The facilitators were manifested… you were manifested…”

I start to laugh.

“No” Starr says “I’m not joking.”

A few days later on a crisp Saturday I found myself origamied on a yoga mat in Hammersmith surrounded by 20 or so other Manifest 2022 attendees. These weren’t the Gen Zers making manifesting go viral on TikTok. Rather they were mostly millennials and nearly all women. Starr welcomed us all to the day saying “Whatever you wish to manifest be it love money success prosperity spiritual development it’s coming your way it’s your time you’re ready to level up your life.”

It’s coming your way it’s your time you’re ready to level up your life

We were invited to each tell the rest of the group why we were there and what we wanted to manifest. Some spoke for 15 minutes or so detailing life stories defined by trauma; others barely spoke a sentence (“I want to manifest being more confident” said one simply). They talked of abortions abusive childhoods addictions depression panic attacks cancer.

But what came up again and again was the pandemic. Many felt stuck in one way or another. People had moved country changed jobs had quarter-life crises. Many of those in attendance it turned out had split up with partners since the pandemic began. Nearly everyone wanted to manifest either self-love or “abundance” a catch-all manifesting term that can mean more of anything but often money. Nearly everyone felt lost.

It’s hardly the first time people have sought answers in faith following trauma. After the First World War for instance there was a sharp rise in spiritualism: after so much death people found comfort in the thought that death itself wasn’t the end. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was a noted proponent. Mediums became such a menace that the authorities were forced to use antiquated Witchcraft and Vagrancy Acts in order to target them. Recent studies have suggested positive thinking can in fact lead to improved mental and physical health. Naturally commercialisation followed.

Now Silicon Valley tapped into millennial ennui – or depending on your amount of cynicism self-obsession – by taking astrology into the app age. Subscriptions services such as Sanctuary boomed by billing themselves as an “Uber for astrological readings” and offering regular personal consultations. “Big Zodiac” is said to currently be worth upwards of $2bn. All promise a future far brighter than the present. But it’s only manifesting that also requires you to put on happy face.

Big Zodiac is said to currently be worth upwards of $2bn

“I think that’s something that’s really been pushed on us and celebrated throughout history” says Dr Whitney Goodman a psychotherapist and author of the bestselling book Toxic Positivity which looks at the dangers inherent in banishing rather than embracing our negative thoughts when I later speak to her on the phone. “And I saw a lot of it early on in the pandemic. But while there’s value in identifying our goals the next step or just using our thoughts to put something out into the world… It can cause people to think there’s something wrong with them like they’re not doing the right thing.”

At its heart manifesting is religion without the altruism. Traditional prayer is all well and good when you’re wishing for the wellbeing of others but it’s slightly frowned upon to get God on the case when you simply want a new partner or a Porsche. Most manifesting sessions I noted end with our palms pressed together in a prayer-like pose though it’s “the universe” we’re told to give thanks to.

Before lunch we did an exercise involving imaginary chairs. The idea was to look both at the thing we want to manifest and at ourselves from an outsider’s perspective in case we had any “limiting beliefs” we weren’t aware of. Most intriguing though was the teacher who is a part-time manifesting guru and also a doctor. I caught up with her over vegan salads.

Before the pandemic she was always working or travelling. When it struck she was single “and I had nothing but time on my hands… I started to get curious who am I really?” She found her way to the works of manifesting expert Gabby Bernstein and was sure the techniques were working she tells me after she completed a six-day audiobook course and found herself the very next day bumping into the man who would become her boyfriend.

“And I thought I’m healed! There he is I found him! He was my gift from the universe!”

Are they still together?

“We’re not no. But we’re very good friends.”

Part of manifestation I was learning essentially involved looking on the extreme bright side of everything. After all once you believe events are the direct result of your manifestations then the logic follows that even negative consequences must be the result of them too – and therefore must actually be positive. You give yourself over to fate but a kindly one of your own making. For the doctor the boyfriend “gave me what I needed to learn next”.

And I thought I’m healed! There he is I found him! He was my gift from the universe!

At her day-job she says she often combines manifestation advice with traditional medical treatment even if she admits it’s somewhat frowned upon. Just the other day she had a cancer patient who wasn’t responding to the various treatments they had been trying.

“I said: ‘I know I can be sued afterwards for asking this as it is a very unorthodox question you may want to get a different doctor afterwards but I’m going to invite you to close your eyes and…’”

She discovered the woman’s mother had died of the same disease and so uncovered a “limiting belief” she felt was holding her back. “And when she opened her eyes her energy was completely different.”

Has the patient responded better to treatment? “I hope so” she says “we’re going to scan her and see.”

The business of manifesting is tough to quantify. But it’s clearly the growth subsection of a wellness market now said to be worth a staggering $1.5tr. On sale at Manifest 2022 were a variety of manifestation crystals a variety of manifestation crystals set in jewellery and some plain old manifestation jewellery.

I was intrigued by the latter and got talking to Natalie Benmayor founder of wellness jewellery label Capsule Eleven. Benmayor launched her brand in the pandemic. She’d started seeing the numbers 11-11 everywhere (“Like every time I’d look at my phone”) and realised they had special significance for manifesting. She had the idea for a company selling high-end “spiritual” jewellery items which she says she subsequently manifested.

Capsule Eleven’s website boasts a range of items that either ward off or attract something but it’s the manifesting 11:11 Pendant (£120) that remains by far her bestseller.

And I swear to God it works as I got the brand off the ground so quickly

“And I swear to God it works as I got the brand off the ground so quickly” she says. “The amount of people I’ve connected to through this necklace is crazy.” She counts the musician Grimes as her most high-profile customer. Yet Benmayor was attending in a personal rather than professional capacity. Like many she had been furloughed. She’d been through every type of therapy – hypnotherapy life alignment reiki crystal healing you name it – but still felt stuck. “I’m here to manifest abundance in business” she says. “And also love.”

We ended the day with the main event a manifestation session led by Roxy Marrone a 23-year-old from west London whose mother is a shaman and who spoke in gently lilting questions.

Marrone also set up her manifestation company in the pandemic. It began when she started hosting manifestation rituals for friends at her family home in lockdown and she quickly realised it was giving them all something they desperately needed. Perhaps more than any other age group Gen Z suddenly felt their fate was not their own. Manifesting became a way to take back control.

“People did need it they felt hopeless” she says of the sessions she hosted noting that many people started crying. “It was amazing how vulnerable they could be.” Last May her company House of Roxy started selling do-it-yourself manifestation kits and Marrone began hosting professional sessions once lockdown ended.

“For me my business is not about making money; everything I do is to benefit someone in some way” she says. “I’m not here to sell you shit. I’m here to sell you something that will change your life.” I later check on the website: a Full Moon Manifestation kit costs £85 while a Manifestation Ring (“The power of this ring will help you manifest love and self-love”) will set you back £2300.

Like most things that go viral however Gen Z manifesting has taken on some curious quirks. On YouTube teen manifesters teach things like the “3-6-9” and “7-7-7” method (this nearly always involves writing a boy’s name down many times a day in order to make him text you). On Instagram they’ve taken to crowdsourcing – remarkably specific posts circulate saying things like “A huge check of $118811 is about to land in your hand tomorrow! Type YES to Affirm” under which hundreds of people write “YES” followed by their choice of emojis (I contact a few users to check in: nothing yet). On TikTok teens have started sharing particular sounds – they promise that listening to them every day helps manifestation (“I used this sound for one week and just got the cat I’ve been asking for”) while others warn skipping the sound can drastically hinder it (“I skipped the sound and my dad died”).

I used this sound for one week straight and just got the cat I’ve been asking for

The latter may sound silly but it’s indicative of where a belief in manifesting can easily end up: that everything bad that happens is also your fault. You just didn’t manifest your life well enough. It’s something Dr Goodman sees more and more with her patients.

“I think particularly for people who have been abused who have lived in poverty who have dealt with real traumatic hardship it can feed into and deepen this belief of like I am the reason that bad things happen to me” she says. “They really believe these things in their life were caused by their beliefs.”

Marrone meanwhile says she is forever getting Instagram DMs from young people asking how they can manifest their goals: “It’s crazy like 13-year-olds DM me asking like how do I manifest? How do I use crystals?”

Doesn’t Marrone worry that especially among young people this can also be unhealthy?

“On any social media there’s always an unhealthy side” she allows “but this is not an unhealthy thing to promote.”

As we start our session we begin with one part of manifesting that doesn’t get the headlines but which I can’t help but feel would have been healthy in the pandemic regardless of your beliefs. Before we began we were told we needed to “raise our vibrations” which sounds complicated but the reality was sweetly humble.

We were asked to think of the small things we were grateful for and to think about those things every day. We closed our eyes we concentrated. Marrone asked us to make sure our feet were touching the floor; she told us she often gives thanks to her breakfast: “It honestly makes me so happy.”

She mentioned that things can’t be achieved with manifesting alone – we had to meet the universe halfway (“You have to put the work in”). She told us to write down three things we wanted to manifest by the end of the year and she told us to close our eyes again and think about each in as much detail as possible. (“I don’t want any ‘happiness’” she said “If you want your dream house I want to know what the carpet is like.”)

The key thing she said was to focus on the emotion it would bring: how would having that house make us feel? I concentrated. I felt. We breathed in through our noses out through our mouths. I have to admit: it felt good. It didn’t last. But briefly it felt good.

I have to admit: it felt good. It didn’t last. But briefly it felt good

I wondered if Marrone ever sets limits: what if a teen wanted to manifest a mansion by the end of the year?

“Basically everyone is capable of everything” she said matter-of-factly “but if you don’t believe what you’re saying you’re blocking it with negative thoughts. It starts with self-worth.”

What if they wanted to be the first astronaut on Mars?

“I would say think of a manifestation that is realistic for you to achieve by the end of the year but not something that you’re afraid that you won’t achieve.”

Finally I ask what some of her own recent manifestations have been. Setting up her company she said for one. Growing her Instagram followers. “And I’ve manifested an article written about me in Harper’s Bazaar” she said.

I was more than welcome she said “to do a solo piece” on her if I wanted to. I can almost feel her manifesting it now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9hY2VyLXN3aWZ0LXgtMTYtaGFuZHMtb24tcmV2aWV3L9IBTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9hY2VyLXN3aWZ0LXgtMTYtaGFuZHMtb24tcmV2aWV3Lz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Acer Swift X 16 hands-on review: A tantalizing preview,"I received a preproduction Acer Swift X 16 to look at and it’s driving me crazy. Why you ask? Because Acer put a lid on benchmarking meaning I can’t run the Intel 12th-gen Core i7-1260P CPU and the Intel Arc graphics through our usual tests. I’m dying to see how they perform and they’re right there in front of me and yet entirely out of reach. That’s OK though. I can still give some impressions of the laptop’s design in anticipation of its release in June 2022.

As a preproduction machine all specifications are subject to change. I received a configuration with the Core i7 Intel Arc graphics and a WQXGA (2560 x 1600) 16:10 IPS display that should cost $1250 when released (with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage). That’s a fair price for a beefy 16-inch laptop and there’s plenty to talk about even if I can’t dig in the way I’d like.

Design

The Swift X 16 enjoys an all-metal chassis that resists bending and flexing except for a tiny bit in the keyboard deck. It’s a solid 16-inch laptop that’s more rigid than the slightly less expensive Acer Swift 3 16 but doesn’t quite live up to the standards of the class leader the Dell XPS 15. The MSI Creator Z16 is another 16-inch laptop that’s about equally robust. Acer has spent some time optimizing the thermal design using a stereo ring with an inclined plane on the fan top to pull in more air and air inlets on the keyboard to assist. Acer promises up to 20% more heat dissipation over the previous generation.

Aesthetically the Swift X 16 is a solid dark gray with a lid adorned only by a small Acer logo and with zero bling elsewhere on the chassis. A grill along the top of the keyboard adds a slight variation and there’s an aggressive vent on the right-hand side under the display. Otherwise the Swift X 16 has simple lines and is minimalistic in its design.

The Creator Z16 is much more extravagant the XPS 15 is more elegant and streamlined and the Acer Swift 3 16 is also simply designed but extra-wide thanks to its 16:9 display. Speaking of that the Swift X 16 has tiny bezels with a 92% screen-to-body ratio and they look modern — although I wish they weren’t constructed of plastic.

In terms of its size the Swift X 16 benefits from those small bezels and is impacted by the 16:10 display making it narrower than many 16-inch laptops and taller than those with 16:9 displays (I’m talking about you here Swift 3 16). It’s 0.70 inches thick compared to the Creator Z16 at 0.64 inches and the Swift 3 16 at 0.63 inches. The Swift X 16 weighs a very light 3.86 pounds where the Creator Z16 comes in at a hefty 5.07 pounds and the Swift 3 16 is slightly lighter at 3.75 pounds.

Connectivity is solid with two USB-A 3.2 ports two USB-C 3.2 ports with Thunderbolt 4 a full-size HDMI port and a 3.5mm audio jack. Wireless connectivity includes the latest Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2.

Performance

We’re in an interesting place with CPU performance given that Intel’s 12th-gen processors slowly making their way to market and there re very few official benchmarks to rely on. The Swift X 16 has a Core i7-1260P a 12-core CPU with four performance cores and eight efficient cores. Total threads are 16. It’s a 28-watt part with a max Turbo power of 64 watts. All of that adds up to what should be solid performance but without benchmarking the machine we can’t be certain.

The Swift X 16 also equips Intel’s Arc graphics a discrete GPU meant to compete with Nvidia’s lower-end discrete mobile GPUs. This will be among the very first laptops to debut the long-anticipated Arc graphics and we’ll be eager to see how they perform.

Arc should provide about twice the performance of Intel’s integrated graphics while using technologies like Deep Link XeSS and others to balance performance and battery life. Again we couldn’t benchmark the GPU so we can’t report on its performance but we’re hopeful that the Swift X 16 will prove a serviceable entry-level gaming laptop.

Display and audio

The Swift X 16 features a 16:10 WQXGA (2560 x 1600) IPS display that promises up to 400 nits of brightness and 100% coverage of the sRGB color gamut. I couldn’t apply my colorimeter but I found the display to be plenty bright in my usual working environments (all indoors — it’s not bright enough for use in sunlight). Contrast seemed good with true blacks and colors were dynamic enough for productivity use and seemed accurate. The display was not touch-enabled which is always a disappointment.

The audio is provided by two downward-firing speakers at the front bottom of the chassis. Volume was sufficient and mids and highs were clear without distortion. Bass was lacking as usual so if you’re watching action flicks or listening to music you’ll want a pair of headphones.

Keyboard and touchpad

The keyboard is the usual island style with black keycaps and a numeric keypad on the right-hand side. The keys are spacious and there’s plenty of key spacing with a switch that’s a little light but still provides a satisfying click and comfortable bottoming action. I found myself getting up to full speed on this keyboard in no time. It’s not quite up to par with HP’s Spectre or Dell’s XPS keyboards and it can’t match Apple’s excellent Magic Keyboard on its latest MacBooks but it’s not too far behind.

The off-center touchpad is spacious and has a smooth surface that I found made for precise support of Windows 11’s multitouch gestures. It’s a Windows Precision touchpad of course and the buttons were firm but not too much so and they were relatively quiet.

As mentioned above I missed a touch display but the touchpad is good enough to make for a productive machine.

Webcam and security

There’s a Full HD webcam onboard a welcome trend among laptops lately. With hybrid work being such an emphasis videoconferencing has taken on a new importance and anything that improves the video quality is welcome. In my informal testing I found the video quality to be very good with a bright and sharp image.

Windows 10 Hello support is provided by a fingerprint scanner embedded in the power button. It worked reliably allowing for waking up the laptop and logging in with one action.

Battery life

I wasn’t able to test battery life of course and that remains an open question. The Swift X 16 has a 56 watt-hour battery which is small for a laptop with a high-res 16-inch display and robust components. Compare that to laptops like the MSI Creator Z16 with 90 watt-hours and the Dell XPS 15 with 86 watt-hours. I’m guessing that battery life won’t be much of a strength unless the Intel 12th-gen CPU is incredibly efficient.

Price and availability

Everything remains in flux as Acer preps the Swift X 16 for release. Right now a configuration with the Core i7-1260P 16GB of RAM  a 1TB solid-state drive (SSD) and the Intel Arc graphics is projected to cost $1250.

That’s a reasonable price for the configuration and if the pricing holds it should make for a strong value. We’ll have to wait for benchmark results to see how it competes with other similarly equipped 16-inch laptops .

So how does the PlayStation 5 version compare to the PS4 and why does it annoy PC gamers?

IN A NUTSHELL: Next-gen version of GTA V could improve more things; The best of what we got is available in the PS5 edition... ... and it annoys a lot of PC gamers in the process.

Original release of Grand Theft Auto V took place nearly a decade or two console generations ago. Even so Rockstar Games has lined up the game for yet another debut - this time the affairs of Michael Trevor and Franklin will be made available to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S users.

How does the new version of the fifth GTA on PS5 fare against Sony's previous platform and modern PCs? We're checking it together with Digital Foundry and Eurogamer.

PlayStation 5 better than PCs

Many of the options available on the PS5 are simply not available on PC which causes frustration for gamers around the world. They express it for example on Reddit where they list such missing (or impossible to activate) improvements on PC as: 1440p60 mode with RT shadows that look better than on PC; uneven frame rate in cinematic cutscenes fixed on PS5 but not on PC; simple ""primitive"" camera motion blur (still used on PC) replaced with a modern one applied to every object; The combination of MSAA and proto-TXAA anti-aliasing replaced with modern TAA which works better and uses less resources; Native HDR implementation. I expand on some of the above details below.

The advantage of the new console is revealed already at the stage of installation and further - in the main menu. After downloading the game on the PS4 it requires additional time (which can be up to an hour) to install the components while on the PS5 the game is immediately ready for use. The menu itself runs at 60 frames per second on PS5 compared to 30 FPS on both old consoles and PCs. It seems like nothing but this simple difference shows the advantage of Sony's device.

PlayStation 5's power is awe-inspiring. Digital Foundry also tested Sony's console itself and you can read about the results below: New PS5 as Seen by Digital Foundry; Cooling Passes the Test

Character animations at 60 FPS have been improved on the new consoles also in comparison to PCs which still have problems with them. Avatar movements are smoother and more pleasing to the eye. These improvements impact motion blur in first person mode which previously applied to (most but not all) individual objects. In the PS5 version this effect is applied universally throughout the game.

The overall improvement in image quality is due to the use of edge smoothing technology known from Red Dead Redemption 2. Flicker noise and unwanted blending of color patches have been reduced to the point that GTA V will look better in 1440p on PS5 than it does in native 4K on PC..

There's also a significant improvement in shadows although they can still blur in a way that's unpleasant on the eye. Anisotropic filtering (which isn't really improved on the last-gen version) and object draw distances which have been ported as they were on PS4 still leave much to be desired. In these respects PCs are certainly superior.

The best version of GTA V

In summary the current GTA V is the best edition of this game ever which should come as no surprise. On PlayStation 5 the game runs smoother in most cases and in many respects is prettier than the new version on PC. The only major downside on the Japanese device is the lack of an increase in detail range - the rest of the visual bells and whistles that are available on PC do not make the game look better.

As highlighted by Eurogamer ultimately it seems that Rockstar could have done more to make GTA's nth release more in line with today's standards. If you're expecting improvements equal to say those of Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition you may be disappointed. 60 FPS ray tracing and a few minor improvements - that's how you can close the evaluation of the new-old Grand Theft Auto.",,,,,,

General Dynamics Information Technology on Dec. 8 was selected for a 10-year deal to modernize NGA’s cloud platform and data centers. The award was challenged by another competitor Leidos which filed a protest Dec. 28 with the Government Accountability Office.

General Dynamics on March 18 announced it won the contract. According to GAO the protest filed by Leidos was withdrawn March 16 allowing NGA and General Dynamics to move forward with the work. Bid protests are common on government contracts this size especially in the highly competitive cloud market.

A component of the U.S. intelligence community NGA analyzes satellite imagery and other geospatial data for the U.S. military allies and homeland security agencies.

NGA first solicited bids for the cloud services contract in 2019. The work covers a wide range of services in support of geospatial intelligence users including the integration of commercial clouds data center design and operations mobile secure wireless across multiple networks and agency locations worldwide. Much of the new technology will support NGA’s new campus in St. Louis known as NGA West. The agency’s headquarters is in Northern Virginia in the Washington D.C. metro area.

The $1.7 billion facility in north St. Louis has been under construction since November 2019 and NGA expects it will be open for business in 2025.

General Dynamics on Dec. 13 announced it is opening a new facility and geospatial innovation center at the Cortex in St. Louis.

NGA officials said upgrading its cloud computing and data infrastructure is a top priority for the agency as it tries to improve the quality and speed of services. A modern cloud enterprise for example will facilitate interoperability between the agency and commercial geospatial data providers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vY3RleGFtaW5lci5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy8xOS9lYXN0ZXJuLWNvbm5lY3RpY3V0LWlzLWEtY2hpbGQtY2FyZS1kZXNlcnQtY2FuLWZhbWlseS1jaGlsZC1jYXJlLWhvbWVzLWZpbGwtdGhlLW5lZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eastern Connecticut is a 'Child Care Desert' — Can Family Child Care Homes Fill the Need?,"Pam Lusk started running a family child care home in Norwich 26 years ago after her son was born.

Here's an explanation of what a hypersonic weapon is.

Example video title will go here for this video

Example video title will go here for this video

PORTLAND Maine — Lagging behind Russia in developing hypersonic weapons the U.S. Navy is rushing to field its first with installation on a warship starting as soon as late next year.

The United States is in a race with Russia and China to develop these weapons which travel at speeds akin to ballistic missiles but are difficult to shoot down because of their maneuverability.

The Russian military says it already deployed hypersonic missiles claiming on both Saturday and Sunday to have deployed them against targets in Ukraine marking the weapon's first use in combat. The Pentagon couldn’t confirm a hypersonic weapon was used in the attacks.

The American military is accelerating development to catch up.

The U.S. weapon would launch like a ballistic missile and would release a hypersonic glide vehicle that would reach speeds seven to eight times faster than the speed of sound before hitting the target.

In Maine General Dynamics subsidiary Bath Iron Works has begun engineering and design work on changes necessary to install the weapon system on three Zumwalt-class destroyers.

The work would begin at a yet-to-be-named shipyard sometime in fiscal year that begins in October 2023 the Navy said.

What is a hypersonic weapon?

Hypersonic weapons are defined as anything traveling beyond Mach 5 or five times faster than the speed of sound. That's about 3800 mph (6100 kph). Intercontinental ballistic missiles far exceed that threshold but travel in a predictable path making it possible to intercept them.

The new weapons are maneuverable.

Existing missile defense systems including the Navy’s Aegis system would have trouble intercepting such objects because maneuverability makes their movement unpredictable and speed leaves little time to react.

Russia says it has ballistic missiles that can deploy hypersonic glide vehicles as well as a hypersonic cruise missile.

The U.S. is “straining just to catch up” because it failed to invest in the new technology with only a fraction of the 10000 people who were working on the program in the 1980s said U.S. Rep. Jim Cooper a Tennessee Democrat who's chair of a subcommittee that monitors the program.

“If we want to pursue parity we will need to back this effort with more money time and talent than we are now” he said.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine serves as a backdrop as the Pentagon releases its budget proposal that lays out its goals for hypersonics and other weapon systems later this month.

The three stealthy Zumwalt-class destroyers to be equipped with the new weapons have plenty of space to accommodate them — thanks to a design failure that works to the Navy’s advantage in this instance.

The ships were built around a gun system that was supposed to use GPS-guided rocket-boosted projectiles to pound targets 90 miles (145 kilometers) away. But those projectiles proved to be too expensive and the Navy canceled the system leaving each of the ships with a useless loading system and a pair of 155-mm guns hidden in angular turrets.

The retrofit of all three ships will likely cost more than $1 billion but will give a new capability to the tech-laden electric-drive ships that already cost the Navy $23.5 billion to design and build said Bryan Clark a defense analyst at the Hudson Institute.

“The engineering is not that hard. It’ll just take time and money to make it happen” Clark said.

The Navy intends to field the weapons on the destroyers in the 2025 fiscal year and on Virginia-class nuclear-powered attack submarines in the 2028 fiscal year the Navy said.

The destroyers would be based in the Pacific Ocean where they would be a deterrent to China should it become emboldened by Russia's attack on Ukraine and consider attacking Taiwan Clark said.

The U.S. focus on hypersonic weapons represents a pivot after hesitating in the past because of technological hurdles. Adversaries meanwhile continued research and development.

Russia fired off a salvo of Zircon hypersonic cruise missiles in late December heralding the completion of weapon testing.

But Russia may be exaggerating the capability of such super weapons to compensate for weakness in other areas said Loren Thompson a defense analyst at the Lexington Institute.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZ2ZGFpbHlwcmVzcy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzAzLzE5L25ldy1kb2xsYXItZ2VuZXJhbC1oZXNwZXJpYS1iYXJnYWlucy1hbmQtbWl4ZWQtZmVlbGluZ3MvNzA3MjY5NjAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Dollar General in Hesperia: Bargains and mixed feelings,"No commitment required.

Lawmakers want them to pay us back – KION546,"By Chris Isidore CNN Business

As crude prices surge oil companies are raking in money — enormous profits gained from practically no extra investment.

ExxonMobil made a $23 billion profit in 2021 its largest in seven years. And as oil prices rise it’s expected to make nearly $33 billion this year. BP meanwhile earned $12.8 billion in 2021 and is forecast to earn $15.6 billion in 2022.

This level of enormous earnings growth has driven talk on both sides of the Atlantic about the need for a windfall profit tax on Big Oil. Those taxes could provide direct financial assistance to consumers struggling with high energy costs.

Both the United States and United Kingdom have imposed windfall profit taxes in the past in with broad political support. But this time around support has been mostly limited to liberal parties in both nations.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has opposed the idea. His finance minister Rishi Sunak is expected to lay out the British government’s plans to help citizens deal with rising energy costs Wednesday.

In Washington Democratic supporters of a windfall profit tax argue it’s the only fair way to help people who can’t afford to drive or heat their homes.

“We need to curb profiteering by Big Oil and provide relief to Americans at the gas pump — that starts with ensuring these corporations pay a price when they price gouge” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren one of the 12 co-sponsors of the measure in the Senate.

The UK opposition Labour Party is calling for taxes on profits made by North Sea oil and gas companies to be raised for a year to help pay for a variety of financial relief measures. The US bill would tax the profits Big Oil companies make on crude prices above recent historical levels. It would pay hundreds of dollars annually to low- and middle-income taxpayers.

But that assumes average oil prices of $120 a barrel — and prices surged past that level two weeks ago. Though prices have since fallen back it highlights the challenge of writing legislation around a volatile commodities market. Brent oil closed Friday at just under $108. Retail gasoline prices have ticked down slightly though at a much slower pace than oil prices have fallen.

The US bill taxes the profits big oil companies get on crude prices above recent historical levels. But that assumes average oil prices of $120 a barrel. Prices surged past that level two weeks ago but have since fallen back.

But the Biden administration has yet to voice any support for the windfall profit tax proposal and the Senate lacks sufficient votes to pass it argued Greg Valliere chief US policy strategist for AGF Investments.

Trade groups for both the American and British oil industries argue the windfall profit tax proposals would work against calls to increase domestic production in those countries as a way of making up for the loss of Russian crude oil.

“Lawmakers should focus on policies that increase US supply to help mitigate the situation rather than political grandstanding that does nothing but discourage investment at a time when it’s needed the most” said Frank Macchiarola senior vice president of policy economics and regulatory affairs for the American Petroleum Institute.

Deirdre Michie CEO of Offshore Energies UK argues that a windfall profit would result in oil companies further cutting their investment in oil production “just when we most need our own oil and gas supplies” Michie said.

But oil companies haven’t been particularly eager to invest in more US or UK production.

“Oil and gas companies do not want to drill more” Pavel Molchanov an analyst at Raymond James said recently. “They are under pressure from the financial community to pay more dividends to do more share buybacks instead of the proverbial ‘drill baby drill’ which is the way they would have done things 10 years ago. Corporate strategy has fundamentally changed.”

Still Molchanov said proposals for a windfall profit tax are “political posturing plain and simple at a time when consumers are unhappy about high fuel prices” adding that “micromanaging tax rates based on short-term price swings whether up or down is counterproductive.” he argued.

Putin’s money

The sprawling billion-dollar palace that sits on a hilltop overlooking the Black Sea is seen by some Kremlin critics as the ultimate emblem of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s legacy of corruption.

Dubbed “Putin’s Palace” the 190000 square-foot mega-mansion was purportedly built for his personal use with funds from billionaire oligarchs whom he allegedly allowed to flourish in Russia’s notoriously corrupt economy so long as they shared the wealth — with him.

The property has its own amphitheater underground hockey rink and private seaport according to a documentary produced by jailed Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny’s anti-corruption group. There is a no-fly zone in the skies above and a no-boating zone in the surrounding waters.

The magnificent fortress stands in stark contrast to the tiny 800-square-foot apartment Putin claims in his official 2020 financial disclosure.

Yet despite the opulence of the hilltop retreat “I would be very surprised if Putin ever sets foot in there again” Nate Sibley an expert on Russian corruption who advises members of Congress told CNN.

Sibley said the palace symbolizes what he sees as a bygone era of Putin pursuing through the wealth of oligarchs a luxurious lifestyle that he could never afford on his government salary.

While Putin is believed to have amassed a hidden fortune by such means earlier in his career Sibley said he has since become less reliant on his wealthy benefactors over the years and has surrounded himself instead with government and military loyalists who share his hardline nationalist views.

That shift some Russia experts told CNN may make it more difficult to make Putin personally feel the sting of economic sanctions the US and its European allies have imposed to punish him for invading Ukraine.

Putin has positioned himself as Sibley put it “above the fray.”

That may not be true according to some sources but the GTO is now a legendary classic that has quite a few stories to tell.

I could talk about how it wears the same badge as the iconic Ferrari 250 GTO  or about how it introduced functional air scoops in the 1960s. But no this story is about ""The Humbler"" a name used for a marketing campaign in the early 1970s. One that advertised the company's then-new vacuum-operated exhaust system and angered General Motors' management.It all happened at the peak of the muscle car era when customers had at least a dozen of high-performance cars to choose from. In 1969 the Pontiac GTO was in its second generation and it was faster and more powerful than ever. It looked far more aggressive too thanks to its 1968 redesign.With a facelifted model on the way for the 1970 model year Pontiac 's marketing department agreed to advertise the muscle car as ""The Humbler.""The company's printed ads suggested that the GTO's performance and looks would simply humiliate the competition. Here's one example: ""about now a lot of pseudo performers are wishing they could slither off to a nice quiet garage.""These threats were backed by an even more aggressive-looking GTO as well as a newly introduced 455-cubic-inch HO V8 engine. At 360 horsepower it was slightly less powerful than the existing 400-cubic-inch Ram Air IV mill (370 horses) but the 455 delivered more torque at 500 pound-feet (678 Nm).Based on numbers alone the GTO was nowhere near as powerful as Mopars powered by the 426-cubic-inch (7.0-liter) HEMI or Chevrolets fitted with the mighty 454-cubic-inch (7.4-liter) LS6.So why was Pontiac so vocal about the 1970 GTO ? Well it was all about a dash-mounted button that had the words ""exhaust mode"" printed behind it.It was there to activate the company's new and innovative Vacuum Operated Exhaust (VOE). The system activated flaps on both mufflers that bypassed the stock exhaust routing to improve airflow and when combined with the Ram Air induction system deliver additional power. At the same time the exhaust note became increasingly louder. Supposedly noisier than any other muscle car available at the time.The concept was far from new as hot-rodders and drag racers had been using it for quite a few years. But Pontiac was the first automaker to put it in a production model.And while drag racers used a similar device to be able to drive their race cars on public roads Pontiac just wanted to enable GTO customers to drive the loudest production car out there.Needless to say the VOE was illegal in several states at the time but Pontiac had to cancel it for a different reason. Introduced as an option in November 1969 the device was showcased in a TV commercial that aired during Super Bowl IV on CBS on January 11 1970.In the ad a young man drives a GTO in a restaurant's parking lot. He's shown pulling the VOE knob on the dash while revving the engine hoping to find an opponent to race him. As all the other drivers stare at him in amazement the GTO driver pulls away and a voice says ""The Humbler is here. This is the way it's going to be baby.""The ad reportedly enraged GM's top executives who called Pontiac the next morning and asked for the commercial to be pulled from further use. They also ordered the division to discontinue the Vacuum Operated Exhaust option. Needless to say GM wasn't thrilled about the ad also being aimed at Chevrolet Buick and Oldsmobile muscle cars.Pontiac followed the orders and put an end to the Humbler ad campaign and retired the VOE option claiming legal exhaust noise requirements in several U.S. states. However it's believed that about 233 GTOs were fitted with the device before it was canceled in January 1970. That's a very small fraction of the almost 40000 GTOs built that year.How many VOE-equipped Pontiacs are still around today you ask? That's a question no one can answer but a few of them are still known to exist. A GTO Convertible fitted with this exhaust (one of only 21 built) popped up on Bring a Trailer in 2021 and changed hands for a whopping $177500.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlc2xhcmF0aS5jb20vcml2aWFuLW91dHNvdXJjZWQtZWxlY3RyaWMtbW90b3JzLWlocy1tYXJraXQv0gFLaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGVzbGFyYXRpLmNvbS9yaXZpYW4tb3V0c291cmNlZC1lbGVjdHJpYy1tb3RvcnMtaWhzLW1hcmtpdC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rivian is one of few pure EV makers that outsourced its electric motors,"By

Pure electric vehicle companies have adopted numerous strategies to stand apart from the competition. Tesla makes a lot of its components in-house including its vehicles’ electric motors. Even Lucid Motors which is still ramping the Air’s production ramp has been proudly highlighting that its electric motors which were also developed in-house are amazingly compact and efficient. Rivian on the other hand appears to have adopted a different strategy.

Information service provider IHS Markit took a look at several automakers’ motor sourcing strategies especially amidst the emergence of the electric vehicle sector. As per the firm’s analysis it appears that established electric vehicle makers such as Tesla seem to see electric drive units as vital to their efficiency and a potential source of competitive advantage. An example of this could be found in the Tesla Model S and Model X Plaid’s new electric motors which feature carbon-sleeved rotors.

It was a technology that was developed and eventually produced in-house and it does provide the Model S and Model X Plaid with notable advantages over their equally-priced rivals. Lucid is the same way with the company taking special care in ensuring that its motors are as compact and efficient as possible. This is a strategy that is not shared by some veteran carmakers like General Motors some of whom have opted to source their electric motors from Tier 1 suppliers like Bosch.

Rivian could be seen as an outlier of sorts in IHS Markit’s analysis. This was because the electric truck maker initially fully outsourced its electric drive units allowing the company to accelerate its product launches. However it should be noted that even Rivian is also developing its own electric motors which means that the company will likely adopt an insourced strategy in the future as well similar to rivals like Tesla and Lucid. IHS Markit for its part noted that insourcing would likely be more prevalent in the coming decade.

“We forecast a steady shift toward electric drive insourcing in the coming decade driven in part by the US OEMs. However there will be many situations where outsourcing continues to make sense. For example Rivian has initially fully outsourced its electric drive which helped accelerate its first product launch while subsequently developing its own. BorgWarner’s recently announced acquisition of motor supplier Santroll shows Tier 1s still see significant volume growth in this space. Carmakers may never insource electric drives completely. As mature as the internal combustion engine is that industry is 90% insourced while 10% of engines are externally sourced” IHS Markit noted.

Rivian may still be in the process of ramping its vehicle deliveries but the company has already shown signs that it would be willing to adapt to the market. Just recently and as nickel prices soared amidst the ongoing war in Ukraine CEO RJ Scaringe stated during the company’s Q4 and Full Year 2021 earnings call that Rivian would be using nickel-free lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) cells for its Amazon delivery vans. This is quite impressive on the company’s part seeing as its Amazon delivery vans will likely account for a substantial portion of Rivian’s production output in the near future.

Dervan pioneered treating DNA as an organic molecule,"In 1975 Peter B. Dervan then an assistant professor of chemistry at the California Institute of Technology switched his research focus from physical organic chemistry to DNA. That doesn’t sound remarkable unless you realize what tools weren’t available at the time. There was no easy way to synthesize DNA and no easy way to sequence it. There wasn’t even a high resolution crystal structure of the right-handed helix. Those all came later.

At the time DNA was the domain of biologists and biochemists. It wasn’t something that organic chemists studied.

Coverstory 2022 Priestley Medalist Peter B. Dervan pioneered treating DNA as an organic molecule Priestley Medal address 2022: Skydiving into the interface of chemistry and biology

“Biology to many people was a forbidden zone because the philosophy is you go after problems you can solve” says Tadhg Begley who did his PhD with Dervan between 1977 and 1982 and is now a professor of chemistry at Texas A&M University. “So much of biology seemed intractable to chemistry in terms of its complexity.”

Dervan changed that perspective. He treated DNA as an organic molecule that was fair game for organic chemists. In doing so he laid the groundwork for the field that has come to be known as chemical biology.

“He was the first person to think about nucleic acids as a substrate for chemistry and how to design molecules that recognize DNA in a sequence-specific fashion” says Alanna Schepartz who did a postdoc with Dervan in the 1980s and is now a chemistry professor at the University of California Berkeley.

“Peter made the case that a biological macromolecule—DNA—is really just a molecule and we’re chemists and we should be able to do chemistry on that molecule” says Dennis A. Dougherty a longtime colleague at Caltech. “Nowadays it’s difficult to imagine that that would be a novel idea.”

In brief Peter B. Dervan started studying DNA through the lens of organic chemistry before the tools for sequencing and synthesizing it existed. He embraced risk and laid the groundwork for what became the field of chemical biology. Dervan’s team twice discovered ways to recognize specific DNA sequences—first in the minor groove and then in the major groove. In addition to his research he helped found Gilead Sciences served on the Scientific Advisory Board of the Welch Foundation for 33 years and was a trustee of Yale University.

Dervan’s “research into the chemistry of sequence-specific DNA recognition and cleavage established the utility of site-specific gene manipulation that paved the way for later genome-editing technologies including CRISPR” says Jennifer Doudna a biochemist at UC Berkeley who received half of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for helping develop CRISPR. “As a graduate student I read and loved Dervan’s elegant work on DNA binding and cutting not suspecting that years later it would have direct relevance to my own research.”

In recognition of his pioneering contributions designing molecules that bind to specific DNA sequences Dervan the Bren Professor of Chemistry Emeritus at Caltech is receiving the 2022 Priestley Medal the highest honor bestowed by the American Chemical Society.

Early days

It wasn’t inevitable that Dervan would become an eminent scientist. The son of Irish immigrants he had to avoid bullies in Boston’s Dorchester neighborhood the tough blue-collar community where his family lived. He managed to stay out of trouble and never got beaten up.

“I was a good kid and I owed it to my parents to stay out of trouble” he says. “I didn’t hide out in the house. I wasn’t a wussy but I was just a quiet serious kid. And they left me alone.”

He attended Boston College High School a Catholic all-boys’ school. His 4 h of homework each night kept him busy. By participating in the science club he discovered he had a knack for science and a love of chemistry. He won the first-year-student prize in the science fair for a project on the effects of radiation on yeast.

Dervan’s fellow students recognized his aptitude in chemistry. In his senior yearbook he was described as “always a gentleman” and “a whiz in chemistry.”

“A lot of young people need to search around to find what their passion is going to be” Dervan says. “I went to Boston College knowing that chemistry was what I wanted to do.”

While at Boston College he participated in a summer research experience. It convinced him that he didn’t know enough yet to be an independent researcher. “It made great sense to me that I should go to grad school and I needed to keep learning.”

Dervan also wanted to see more of the US. So after graduating from Boston College in 1967 he chose to go to graduate school at the University of Wisconsin–Madison where he worked with Jerome Berson a physical organic chemist.

At the time the specter of the Vietnam War loomed. After so many years of being the good boy Dervan responded to what he calls the “existential threat” of the war by embracing risk. Feeling that the draft could render all those years of working hard and keeping out of trouble pointless he took up skydiving on the weekends as a form of physical risk that he could control. He jumped more than 40 times.

When his draft status was reclassified he returned to Dorchester to petition for a 12-month occupational deferment from the draft. After an impromptu organic chemistry lecture punctuated by Dervan waving his arms to illustrate how broken bonds move the draft board granted his deferment.

At that point he felt he needed to give research his all. Rather than continuing to take physical risks he instead took intellectual risks. Berson moved to Yale and Dervan went with him. A golf player Dervan now views the transition as a “mulligan” that allowed him to “tee it up again.” He asked himself “Are you willing to take the risk of finding out that you’re not all that good?”

He threw himself into his research spending 6–7 days a week in the lab. For his thesis he did a four-pathway analysis of sigmatropic rearrangements of dipropenylcyclobutanes.

With a Yale PhD in hand Dervan accepted a postdoctoral position with Eugene E. van Tamelen a synthetic organic chemist at Stanford University. Soon after Dervan arrived at Stanford universities started inviting him to give talks. He thought he was just practicing for when he would seriously go on the market in a year or two but he received multiple offers. He accepted the offer from Caltech.

“I thought for sure I’ll go down there for 5 years they’ll find out I’m not a genius like the rest of them and I’ll get fired” Dervan says. “I went to Caltech not worrying about whether I was going to get tenure.” That attitude gave him the freedom to go in a new direction.

Changing course

Dervan was hired at Caltech as a physical organic chemist. For the first few years he studied the mechanisms of reactive intermediates such as 14-biradicals. Through his teaching he came to realize that he wanted to change his focus.

He taught an advanced organic chemistry class using original papers and the Socratic method. In the class he asked students to use the data from the papers to propose reaction mechanisms. As he taught the class Dervan realized how much groundbreaking work in physical organic chemistry had been done decades before.

“I can’t do this for 40 years” Dervan told himself. He decided he needed to do something radically different.

He chose to focus on molecular recognition. People such as Jean-Marie Lehn at the University of Strasbourg and Donald J. Cram at the University of California Los Angeles were already doing molecular recognition with host-guest systems but they were working in organic solvents.

“If I study molecular recognition and I just do the next host-guest thing I’m not going to distinguish my program” Dervan remembers thinking. He decided that he needed to work with biological polymers in water the solvent of life.

When he first started studying DNA the tools for working with DNA at a molecular level didn’t yet exist. The field was completely open. “My idea was that I would go into this dark area and try to turn on the lights” he says.

“I took this risky decision that was potentially career ending” Dervan says. If the tools for studying DNA hadn’t materialized soon enough he would have been unproductive and gotten fired he says.

“I was pretty sure that he was going to do really well because he was such a brilliant exciting colleague” says Harry B. Gray who was already on the faculty when Dervan joined Caltech. “His enthusiasm was so great that you just had to believe that he was going to do it.”

For his first foray into DNA research Dervan and his group set out to make a bifunctional molecule that could recognize a DNA sequence and then cut it. Such a molecule would essentially function like a synthetic restriction enzyme.

They made (methidiumpropyl-EDTA)Fe(II) (MPE) which comprises the DNA intercalator methidium connected to the metal chelator ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) by a short linker. MPE nonspecifically binds and cleaves DNA at multiple locations. The construct became a useful tool to reveal the binding of other small molecules by seeing where MPE’s intercalation and cleavage were blocked.

But Dervan also wanted something that could bind to specific sequences. Peter G. Schultz a graduate student with Dervan from 1979 to 1984 and now the CEO of Scripps Research synthesized another bifunctional molecule this time linking EDTA with the antibiotic distamycin which consists of multiple methylpyrrole amino acids. The distamycin would bind to DNA rich in adenine and thymine and the EDTA would cleave the DNA. John-Stephen Taylor a Dervan postdoc in the early 1980s and now a chemistry professor at Washington University in St. Louis did the polyacrylamide gel separation of the resulting DNA cleavage products.

They saw the pattern they expected for one DNA strand with the cleavage next to the binding site. But when they sequenced the cleavage sites on the other DNA strand they saw something unexpected. The cleavage pattern for the second strand was offset from the pattern on the first strand.

Taylor was puzzled but Dervan immediately grasped the implication that the distamycin was binding in the minor groove of DNA Taylor recalls. Dervan had a large model of DNA in his office and his careful study of it was paying off. “Clearly his mind was already prepared for the result” Taylor says.

Dervan’s lab continued to study polyamides to bind to DNA in the minor groove. Using various combinations of pyrrole hydroxypyrrole and imidazole his team could distinguish all four base pairs.

For recognizing the major groove of DNA Dervan and his colleagues focused on oligonucleotides that bind to DNA to form a triple helix. Heinz Moser a postdoc with Dervan in the mid-1980s and now executive director for global discovery chemistry at Novartis did the early work on the triple-helix approach.

“When I joined his group he only spent about 10 min with me to explain what I should do” Moser says. In those 10 min Dervan told Moser that they should be able to specifically recognize double-stranded DNA sequences by using a short oligonucleotide that binds to the DNA and forms a triple helix. Moser didn’t even know triple helices existed. “I matured as a scientist tremendously because I was thrown in the cold water and had to learn how to swim” Moser says. Six months later after many failures and with support from Dervan and his group Moser got the triple-helix approach to work.

As Dervan and his mentees continued to develop DNA recognition they increasingly moved toward using their bifunctional molecules for biological applications. Anna K. Mapp a postdoc with Dervan from 1997 to 2000 and Aseem Z. Ansari a postdoc with Mark Ptashne at Harvard University developed artificial transcription factors molecules that regulate gene expression. Ansari now at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital continued to collaborate with Dervan after starting his independent career at UW–Madison. Mapp’s time in Dervan’s lab “changed entirely the trajectory of what I was interested in” she says.

When Amanda Hargrove now a chemistry professor at Duke University was a postdoc with Dervan in the early 2010s the group was working toward applying DNA-binding polyamide molecules to mouse models of disease. The team focused on blocking the transcription of the androgen receptor as a way to slow the growth of prostate cancer. “It was a really exciting time to be there” she says.

Even in the face of other methods of DNA recognition and gene modulation and editing such as RNA interference and CRISPR a place remains for the polyamides that Dervan’s lab pioneered Ansari says. “Small molecules that can target the genome and can be delivered systemically will still be incredibly valuable in ways that CRISPR will not” Ansari says.

Popular destination

Dervan paved the way for what became chemical biology but he doesn’t consider himself a founder of the field. His lab was instead the “incubator” lab he says. In those early days it was “Chemical biology” with a capital C and a lowercase b he says.

“I was learning the biology as I went along and the methods weren’t big enough to do the big B” Dervan says. “When I was starting out you couldn’t sequence 10 letters of an oligonucleotide.”

The early successes made Dervan’s lab a popular destination for organic chemists looking to pivot to biological applications. Multiple group alumni say that they were inspired to join his lab after hearing him give a talk about the DNA work.

“If you were interested in what we now call chemical biology and you were coming from a really strong place and wanted to go to a really strong place Peter was like a beacon” says Samuel Gellman who did a postdoc with Dervan in the mid-1980s and is now a chemistry professor at UW–Madison.

“Being able to expand the ideas of organic chemistry into this biologically important molecule was super exciting” says Eric T. Kool who did a postdoc with Dervan in the late 1980s and is now a chemistry professor at Stanford University. “Peter’s enthusiasm about and communication skills about it really are what won me over.” In Dervan’s lab Kool designed new molecules that expanded the sequences that could be recognized by triple helices.

Dervan was “a pioneer in modular design; his compounds combined recognition with chemical reactivity” says Laura L. Kiessling who was a postdoc with Dervan from 1989 to 1991 and is now a chemistry professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The field has evolved since then. “I would no longer be a card-carrying chemical biologist today” Dervan says. “Today’s modern successful chemical biologist is a biologist. They are steeply taught both experimentally and intellectually how to do biology. I never had that training.”

Dervan fostered a collegial environment in his lab. He had a hands-off approach to mentoring that gave his students and postdocs a sense of ownership over their projects. It also encouraged them to help one another.

“There wasn’t a culture in the lab of shooting down ideas. There was a culture of making things better” says Martha Oakley a chemistry professor at Indiana University Bloomington who was a graduate student with Dervan in the early 1990s. “There was a lot of back and forth and people would give you good ideas” she says. “You were never made to feel like an idiot.”

Schultz started working with Dervan as an undergraduate at Caltech and continued through graduate school. He started out studying the biradical reactive intermediates and switched to DNA. “I was very fortunate to work for Peter because he gave me a real problem. He didn’t fool around with ‘Here’s a starter problem’ ” Schultz says. “Peter was pretty hands off in the lab. If you didn’t need guidance Peter really didn’t micromanage you.”

Group alumni recall Dervan’s push for unimpeachable data. “There were a lot of conversations in the lab about the requirement that Peter had to get the perfect gel” says Scott Strobel a Dervan graduate student from 1987 to 1992 and now the provost at Yale University. “You look at the data in those papers and there is nothing ambiguous about interpreting what’s in those data.”

“We would never cut and slice a gel. If there was a lane that didn’t run perfectly in my group you had to rerun that” Dervan says. “I’m sure the students thought I was the biggest jerk in the whole world that I made people run gels three or four times. Then I knew the data was reproducible.”

“There were definitely complaints about it at the time” Schepartz says. In retrospect as a principal investigator herself now “I know how important that exercise was because it ensured that nothing published was wrong or simply an artifact. It also taught everyone in the lab about the importance of data quality.”

Beyond the lab

In addition to his research Dervan has served the science community beyond Caltech. Shortly after Dervan’s election to the National Academy of Sciences in 1986 Michael Riordan recruited him to become one of the founders of what became Gilead Sciences. The company was going to focus on antisense oligonucleotides. “I wasn’t working on antisense at the time although the triple-helix stuff probably had that element to it” Dervan says. “He picked me reputationally.”

Dervan turned Riordan down the first time he asked. “People don’t remember that in 1987 if you were a serious scholar particularly at Caltech you would never get involved in a start-up” Dervan says. When Riordan tried again Dervan agreed to join the company as a founder. His main role was as a member of the scientific advisory board. “I took a chance that people would look at me a little funny for having gotten involved with a biotech start-up” he says. He remained a member of Gilead’s scientific advisory board until 2013.

Dervan also served on the Scientific Advisory Board of the Welch Foundation from 1988 to 2021 including 7 years as chair. When he was chair Dervan increased the representation of women on the SAB by appointing four women. They were not the first women to serve on the SAB but it was the first time there had been that many women on the SAB simultaneously.

Catherine Murphy a chemistry professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is one of those women. She served as vice-chair with Dervan and became chair when he retired. Dervan is “a great role model because he always seems like he’s having fun” Murphy says. “When you’re with a person who has a positive attitude it just makes you think ‘Let’s do this thing.’ ”

And Dervan’s service didn’t stop there. From 2008 to 2017 he was a member of the Board of Trustees at Yale University. During Dervan’s term on the board of trustees Strobel was Yale’s vice president for west campus planning and program development. Strobel would bounce ideas off Dervan in Dervan’s capacity as a scientist on the board.

“Peter’s a positive visionary person who calls it straight but at the same time does it in a way that is mentoring and nurturing as opposed to devastating and destroying” Strobel says. “He very much encouraged all aspects of the management of the university along this path of getting us to a major investment in the sciences with a plan for what we’re going to do.”

In his late 60s Dervan started planning for his retirement. “I decided that it’s hard for a human being to know when they’ve lost their fastball” he says. “I think I knew already at age 65 that I would give my laboratory space back to the institute around age 72 73 74 cognizant that I had this extraordinary spouse who was younger than me and still very active in her career.” His extraordinary spouse is Jacqueline K. Barton also a Caltech chemistry professor and recipient of the 2015 Priestley Medal (see box).

A teaching experience underscored for Dervan that the time for retirement was approaching. He has always prided himself on his board work. “I love a piece of white chalk and real slate and I could do beautiful board work” he says. “For years when I would lecture both in sophomore organic chemistry and in my advanced organic courses the board work was to be immodest really really good. And I think to be honest that’s the speed at which students can actually grasp the material.”

In the last 5 years he was teaching students still gave him good teaching evaluations for his lectures but they also noted that the quality of his board work was deteriorating. Structures still looked good but words were becoming less legible. Dervan says “That’s an example just in terms of my own personal standards of excellence that I made the right decision.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL2Nlbi5hY3Mub3JnL2Jpb2xvZ2ljYWwtY2hlbWlzdHJ5L2RuYS9Qcmllc3RsZXktTWVkYWwtYWRkcmVzcy0yMDIyLVNreWRpdmluZy1pbnRvLXRoZS1pbnRlcmZhY2Utb2YtY2hlbWlzdHJ5LWFuZC1iaW9sb2d5LzEwMC9pMTDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Priestley Medal address 2022: Skydiving into the interface of chemistry and biology,"A version of this essay will be presented at the American Chemical Society Spring 2022 meeting by 2022 Priestley Medal winner Peter B.

COVER STORY Priestley Medal address 2022: Skydiving into the interface of chemistry and biology 2022 Priestley Medalist Peter B. Dervan pioneered treating DNA as an organic molecule

Tonight I will take you on my journey from Boston to Pasadena. I will discuss the importance of luck my early education graduate school at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and Yale University becoming a California Institute of Technology assistant professor at age 28 the impact of teaching on my research direction embracing risk and crossing the divide between chemistry and biology venturing outside the academic ivory tower and national service.

My parents emigrated from Ireland. They came over in the early 1920s before the Great Depression. Life must have been hard. Our family of six lived in Dorchester a working-class suburb of Boston. One important value at our home was to focus on education. In the 1950s science was admired in America. Jonas Salk had developed a safe and effective vaccine for polio saving thousands of children from being disabled or confined to an iron lung.

In 1957 when I was 12 years old the Soviet Union launched Sputnik a satellite the size of a basketball that weighed about 184 lb (84 kg). The US government calculated that the Russian rockets were bigger than ours! There could be a science and engineering gap between the US and the Soviet Union. I believe this crisis was one of the best things that ever happened to America. It certainly impacted my generation. Young people were encouraged to pursue careers in science and engineering and fellowships to do so were plentiful.

My high school experience was formative. Boston College High School was a college-preparatory school. We took 4 years of Latin and 2 years of Greek along with German math chemistry and physics—the whole deal. I carried out my first science project as a freshman and I loved it. With 4 h of homework every evening I learned how to study and how to learn. I was prepared to succeed in college and I feel I have been coasting downhill ever since.

I then attended Boston College as a chemistry major and have great memories doing undergraduate research in the summer before my senior year. I discovered the fun of not knowing the result of an experiment. It was like going to the racetrack! Thank you to the National Science Foundation for those undergraduate summer research fellowships.

From Boston to Wisconsin Yale and Stanford

For graduate school I wanted a break from New England and to see the country starting with the Midwest. I chose the University of Wisconsin–Madison. I was very happy there. But there were clouds on the horizon. The year was 1967 and the Vietnam War was escalating; the draft was ramping up.

I was one of five students to join Jerry Berson’s group that year at Wisconsin. All of us had graduate fellowships from the National Institutes of Health or NSF. In those days the federal agencies awarded the funds to the students not the professors and we voted with our feet to join the best labs. There were exciting mechanistic puzzles to sort out. I chose a project testing the limits of the Woodward-Hoffmann rules: an analysis of the four pathways for the 13-sigmatropic rearrangement.

A big unknown when I started graduate school was whether my fellow students and I would be drafted for the Vietnam War. Our class was told that we could go to graduate school for 1 year and then we would likely be called up. The attrition in our first-year class was staggering a 50% dropout in 1 year.

Near the end of my first year I received a letter to report to my local Selective Service board for a physical exam a first step to military assignment. I traveled to Dorchester and appealed in person. They wanted to know why I thought I should continue my deferment. So I told them what I was working on. I think my exuberance with my hands rotating antarafacial versus suprafacial to explain sigmatropic rearrangements astonished them. I got a 1-year deferment!

Subsequently in an effort to make the draft appear more fair the government then introduced the draft lottery to rank who to draft. My random number corresponding to my birthday came above the cutoff meaning I could complete graduate school. Talk about good luck.

In those first 2 years in Madison I was distracted by the existential threat of Vietnam. I took up skydiving on the weekends jumping with an old Korean War surplus parachute. My skydiving ended in 1969 when Berson decided to accept an offer to move to Yale. We packed our bags and drove to New Haven Connecticut for a new start.

I guess when there is major change in life it is an opportunity to take stock and pivot. At Yale I became very serious about my research and doubled my hours in the lab. I loved talking with Berson at the blackboard about new results. When the experimental data were confounding Berson taught me the joy of the unexpected finding! He became my first mentor and role model.

Equipped with my PhD from Yale and an NIH postdoctoral fellowship I resumed my westward migration in late 1972 and drove from Connecticut to California to join Eugene van Tamelen’s synthetic group at Stanford University. Shortly after I arrived the phone in the lab began to ring and I was asked to give talks at the University of California Berkeley; the University of California Los Angeles; and Caltech. Without asking I was on the academic job market. I never wrote a letter applying for an academic position. I had no research proposals. But I received offers to join Caltech and UCLA as an assistant professor that fall. I was 28 years old. Sorry graduate students and postdocs on the academic job market today; 1973 was a very different time.

On to Caltech and DNA

When I arrived in Pasadena California the organic professors were Jack Roberts Bob Ireland and Bob Bergman. They were all incredibly supportive. I was replacing George Hammond a renowned pioneer in photochemistry.

My first teaching assignment at Caltech was an advanced organic chemistry course for the first-year graduate students. This was an opportunity to learn my field physical organic chemistry by teaching the material. There was no advanced textbook in 1973 so I had my students read the original Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS) papers of pioneers Roberts Saul Winstein and Bill Doering. Intuitively I taught in Socratic style presenting data from the research papers on the board first and then soliciting and debating with the class all possible mechanistic interpretations of the data. It was exhilarating. I loved teaching and my knowledge of my field was becoming deeper and broader.

My research group embarked on measuring the relative rates of rotation cleavage and closure of tetramethylene the parent 14 biradical. Our papers in JACS settled a long-standing debate between experiment and theory. That said teaching advanced organic chemistry at Caltech made me realize that many of the breakthrough papers in physical organic chemistry had been written over the preceding 20 years. With 40 years of research in front of me I needed to move in a new direction. It seemed that the field of molecular recognition had promise. We thought we might distinguish our program by studying specific ensembles of noncovalent bonds in water.

Believing that an important goal of synthetic chemistry is the discovery or invention of new properties we turned our attention to the interface of chemistry and biology. In the design of molecules with function we wanted to emphasize simplicity in both structures and syntheses. And when designing molecules for purposes never achieved before the chance of failure was high. We might need multiple shots on goal.

There were early role models that set the stage for this new direction. Ronald Breslow was interested in understanding the principles of enzyme catalysis. His approach was to build artificial systems to mimic nature’s catalysts. Jean-Marie Lehn and Don Cram were demonstrating structure-specific selective interactions of host-guest chemistry in organic solvents.

My research group at Caltech decided to focus on the molecular recognition of double-helical DNA. There was a risk that we were too early. Neither DNA sequencing nor reliable methods to synthesize DNA were available in 1975. An X-ray crystal structure of right-handed double-helical DNA would not be published until 6 years later.

In addition in 1975 there was a chasm between chemistry and biology. Chemists with precise knowledge of all the atoms in natural product architectures looked with dismay at the imprecise world of biology. Some of my colleagues worried that my new career path might take me off a cliff.

Our first effort at molecular recognition was the design of a bis(intercalator) bismethidiumspermine by graduate student Michael Becker. From labor-intensive Scatchard plots and viscometric titrations we determined that the dimer had a DNA binding site size of four base pairs and an affinity for calf thymus DNA that was 10000 times as much as that of the monomer. For this bis(intercalator) the spacer would lie in the minor groove of the DNA. We imagined that modifying the linker could play a role in controlling the specificity of next-generation molecules bound to specific sequences of DNA. This work was presented in my tenure talk at Harvard University. R. B. Woodward was in the front row and seemed to enjoy it.

There was an outstanding group of biophysical chemists in the nucleic acid field and I found inspiration from the pioneering work in ligand-DNA interactions by Don Crothers and Claude Hélène. Our research group at Caltech brought synthetic chemistry to the field and I felt warmly accepted by this international community. I recall vividly one meeting held at the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in Vatican City in 1986. We gave lectures in a small room with beautiful and well-preserved frescoes on the ceiling. Afterward we had an audience with Pope John Paul II. My dear departed Irish mother would have been so proud.

Back in my lab we became inspired by the natural product bleomycin which cuts DNA in a reaction dependent on iron(II) and oxygen. Graduate student Bob Hertzberg attached ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid–FeII (EDTA∙Fe) to the DNA intercalator methidium and created a DNA-cleaving molecule (methidiumpropyl-EDTA)FeII (MPE∙Fe). Since methidium had no sequence preferences MPE∙Fe could cut DNA everywhere. From a design point of view we had constructed a bifunctional molecule with two separate structural domains one for recognition and one for cleavage. This would turn out to be a useful tool for footprinting small molecules on DNA and analyzing chromatin structure.

Proximity-induced cleavage

The next step in the lab was to create molecules that would bind and cleave DNA at specific sequences. The crescent-shaped natural product distamycin known to bind DNA regions rich in adenine (A) and thymine (T) incorporates three N-methylpyrrolecarboxamide (Py) aromatic amino acids. Graduate student Peter Schultz and postdoc John Taylor attached EDTA∙Fe to distamycin. Thus they created a sequence-specific DNA-cleaving molecule distamycin-EDTA∙Fe (DE∙Fe). By analyzing the cleavage sites on an end-labeled DNA fragment they found that DE∙Fe bound multiple sites each four to five base-pair stretches rich in A-T sequence composition. The three to four DNA strand scissions flanking each site were consistent with a cleavage mechanism involving a short-lived diffusible oxidizing species most likely hydroxyl radical.

The DNA used for these experiments was a homogeneous restriction fragment typically 150 base pairs in size. It is essentially a linear library of DNA sites addressed by a specific phosphorus-32 label on one end. The affinity cleavage method based on proximity-induced cleavage allows rank ordering of DNA binding sites by synthetic ligands in an unbiased experiment. In addition the cleavage pattern on opposite DNA strands reveals the orientation of the molecule at each site in the minor groove asymmetric on the 3′ side and major groove on the 5′ side. Taken together specific binding site sequences groove location and orientation for multiple sites on DNA are all revealed in a single screening experiment.

Minor-groove recognition of DNA and the pairing rules

At the floor of the minor groove of the DNA double helix a G∙C base pair has an –NH 2 steric bump at the edge while a T∙A base pair presents a cleft between the thymine O2 and adenine C2. Guided by this simple bump-and-hole model graduate students Sarah White Jason Szewczyk and Eldon Baird reasoned that 3-hydroxypyrrole (Hp) when paired with Py should specifically bind a T∙A base pair. And so we demonstrated that four unsymmetrical ring pairs (Im/Py Py/Im Hp/Py and Py/Hp) in the minor groove distinguish the four DNA base pairs completing a programmable chemical language to read different sequences of the double helix. We referred to this modular code for minor-groove recognition of DNA as the “pairing rules.”

Major-groove recognition of DNA by triple-helix formation

In 1987 postdoc Heinz Moser demonstrated that a pyrimidine oligodeoxyribonucleotide-EDTA∙Fe could bind in the major groove of DNA by triple-helix formation with exquisite sensitivity to single-base mismatches. In a formal sense this was a second chemical language utilizing Hoogsteen pairing in the major groove by the third strand for recognition of the double helix by isomorphous base triplets T∙A∙T and C∙G∙C. For oligonucleotides targeting 15-base-pair sites one could imagine that pyrimidine probes equipped with DNA-cleaving moieties could be useful tools for cutting chromosomes. Graduate student Scott Strobel demonstrated that this chemical approach could cut single sites in megabase-size DNA including human chromosomes.

Then graduate student Tom Povsic and Strobel demonstrated that attachment of the electrophile N-bromoacetyl at the 5′ end of pyrimidine oligodeoxyribonucleotide affords alkylation of a single guanine (at N7) located two base pairs to the 5′ side of a local triple-helical complex. N-Bromoacetyldeoxyribonucleotides could bind adjacent inverted purine tracks on double-helical DNA by triple-helix formation and alkylate single guanine positions on opposite strands in megabase-size yeast DNA in 85% yield. In 1992 we wrote that “it is not unthinkable that quantitative reactions targeted to single atoms in the human genome . . . should be possible by strictly chemical methods” (J. Am. Chem. Soc. DOI: 10.1021/ja00041a005). We could not have anticipated that the genetically encoded CRISPR-Cas system characterized some 20 years later would revolutionize genome editing and human medicine.

The Dervan group

The graduate students at Caltech who worked in my lab were outstanding. Young people in their 20s are always hopeful and anything seems possible. I gave the students independence in their projects coupled with abundant support and encouragement. We published most of our work as full papers in JACS. We included primary data such as sequencing gels in the JACS papers to inform readers how we interpreted the results. Certainly creativity is important in research. That said execution in closing the problem was highly valued. “Put the puck in the net” I would say. We learned to embrace failure. Setbacks made us smarter over time.

As our early papers were rpublished some of the best graduate students in the world from top organic groups wrote letters to join the group at Caltech for postdoctoral research. All the postdocs arrived with fellowships and many were aiming for an academic research position. Our group became an “incubator lab” for training the next generation of organic chemists who would go on to be pioneers at the interface of chemistry biology and medicine. As I look at the careers of the Dervan group alumni in addition to seeing over 65 academic research leaders I find among them CEOs provosts biotech company founders and editors in chief of major American Chemical Society journals. A significant number of the graduate students went on to obtain medical degrees or law degrees for distinguished careers in medicine law and venture capital investment.

My colleagues in the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at Caltech were fabulous! Since 1976 six have received the Priestley Medal: Linus Pauling Jack Roberts George Hammond Harry Gray Ahmed Zewail and Jacqueline Barton. In early days Norm Davidson’s group taught us how to run sequencing gels. Doug Rees and his student Clara Kielkopf taught us how to crystallize ImHpPyPy:DNA for high-resolution X-ray crystal structures.

Roberts always supported me on a scientific and personal level. He was an early pioneer in physical organic chemistry including teaching the field the power of NMR. But I was influenced by Roberts in other ways. It was clear he valued institutions like Caltech the American Chemical Society DuPont the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society. He invested his personal time for their benefit.

In 1987 I received a visit to my office from Michael Riordan of Menlo Ventures to help found Gilead Sciences. In 1988 Norm Hackerman asked me to join the Scientific Advisory Board of the Robert A. Welch Foundation. I decided that my research would not suffer if I took the time as Roberts did to serve something bigger than myself. I combined research and teaching with service for more than 3 decades including serving as a trustee of Yale University from 2008 to 2017.

Another Caltech mentor was Arnold O. Beckman inventor of the pH meter and founder of Beckman Instruments. As a longtime trustee at Caltech and philanthropist he taught me the importance of giving back. I must say in the early 1980s the laboratory space for organic chemistry was decades old and worn. In 1985 Beckman provided renovated laboratories for all the organic chemists. The Crellin and Church buildings became the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Laboratory of Chemical Synthesis. I was taken by Beckman’s modesty and simplicity of life despite his wealth and business success. He embraced a code of conduct of “Don’t take yourself too seriously” which may be the most important piece of advice ever.

I learned much through my experiences on the Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) of the Robert A. Welch Foundation for the past 33 years. I looked forward to annual meetings in Houston with chemistry heavy hitters Norm Hackerman E. J. Corey Bill Lipscomb Glenn Seaborg Yuan Lee Joe Goldstein Marye Anne Fox Ahmed Zewail Peter Schultz and Roger Kornberg while advising the foundation on the distribution of more than $20 million per year to basic research in chemistry biochemistry and chemical engineering in Texas. During the past 7 years I was also chair of the SAB. I recruited chemistry stars Jim Skinner W. E. Moerner Xiaowei Zhuang Jennifer Doudna Melanie Sanford Cathy Murphy Geoff Coates and Kevan Shokat. Murphy succeeded me as chair this year upon my retirement. I wish every state in America would have its own Welch Foundation funding basic research in chemistry for the benefit of humankind.

In summary I have talked about the importance of serendipity in a scientific journey. For me it was Sputnik the draft lottery and Caltech. There is no playbook. My past will not predict your future.

I have talked about the importance of mentors. Here is the secret: you may not get to choose them! More likely they will choose you and you need to be ready to recognize the gift.

I have talked about the importance of embracing risk and failure. I skydived into the chemistry-biology divide. It could have been career ending. New methods necessary for experimental success arrived just in time. I would emphasize that our program was basic research—fundamental discovery with no urgency for a timeline regarding translational impact. Throughout 45 years of research the National Institute of General Medical Sciences supported our program at Caltech for which I am profoundly grateful.

I have talked about the value of service. In 1987 Caltech was an ivory tower and serious scientists committed to fundamental contributions did not get involved with biotech start-ups. That changed a decade later and university technology transfer became a positive good. Most in this room this evening cannot believe that it was not always this way in universities.

Finally the most important thing I will tell you tonight is the importance of family. I am grateful to my academic family the Dervan group alumni and my Caltech colleagues. But a life journey must be shared. My love Jackie has been my friend adviser and partner. My children Andrew and Elizabeth inspire and teach me every day. I became a better teacher in the classroom due to being a father. I became more patient and empathetic to the needs of the undergraduates and the stresses they experience daily in academics as I imagined my own kids in the classroom.",,,,,,,,,

Here's how it will affect our lives,"Editor’s Note: This interview has been edited from its original version. It was originally published in its entirety in the International Monetary Fund’s Spring 2022 issue of Finance & Development magazine. Eswar Prasad is the Tolani Senior Professor of Trade Policy at Cornell University. He is also a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

In his latest book “The Future of Money: How the Digital Revolution Is Transforming Currencies and Finance” Cornell University professor Eswar S. Prasad describes how digital currencies and other financial technologies are reshaping everything from consumer banking to monetary policy and international payments. In a conversation with the International Monetary Fund Prasad lays out the advantages and perils of the new forms of money.

IMF: Is cash destined to wither away?

Prasad: The convenience of digital payments to both consumers and businesses makes it highly unlikely that cash will survive much longer.

In China there are two private payment providers Alipay and WeChat Pay that have blanketed the entire Chinese economy with very low-cost digital payments. You can use those for something as simple as buying say a piece of fruit or a couple of dumplings from a street vendor. In advanced economies like Sweden the private sector is doing an equally good job of providing very low-cost digital payments.

IMF: Is it likely that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will be used to buy a cup of coffee or pay the rent?

Prasad: Bitcoin has not worked very well as a medium of exchange that can be used for day-to-day transactions. One main reason is that Bitcoin has very unstable value. It’s as though you took a bitcoin in with you to a coffee shop and one day you could buy a whole meal with it and on another day just get a small cup of coffee. In addition Bitcoin is somewhat slow and cumbersome to use.

IMF: Some countries are considering the adoption of a so-called central bank digital currency (CBDC). What is the rationale?

Prasad: For some developing countries the objective is that of broadening financial inclusion. There are many people in those countries who don’t have access to digital payments. They don’t have access to basic banking products and services. In countries like Sweden where most people do have access to bank accounts the imperative is a little different. The Swedish central bank the Riksbank envisions the e-krona or the digital krona as essentially a backstop to the private payment infrastructure.

IMF: How about China?

Prasad: The Chinese government is very concerned about two payment providers that have come to dominate the payment system and are blocking effectively the entry of new competitors who could provide innovations. The Chinese central bank views a digital yuan as essentially a complement to the existing payment systems but one that could in principle increase the amount of competition.

IMF: How does a digital currency affect the ability of a central bank to control inflation and ensure full employment?

Prasad: Let’s say all American citizens had in effect an account with the Federal Reserve then it would be a lot easier for the Fed to undertake certain operations such as stimulus payments.

When the pandemic hit the initial coronavirus stimulus bill involved a large amount of money being transferred to American households. Many households that had direct deposit information on file with the Internal Revenue Service were able to get direct deposits to their bank accounts but households that did not have that information on file with the IRS ended up getting prepaid debit cards or checks many of which were lost in the mail and some of which were misappropriated or mutilated.

IMF: Could central bank digital currencies be used to fight tax evasion and other crimes?

Prasad: If you cannot use cash to pay your gardener or babysitter it’s much more likely that those payments will get reported to the government. And especially for large-value transactions that will certainly make a difference in terms of tax revenues. Having digital money also reduces the use of cash for illicit transactions say for drug trafficking or money laundering.

IMF: Are there risks for private sector banks and payment providers?

Prasad: If the government is in effect providing a very low-cost digital payment system that might make it very difficult for private payment providers to continue their services because after all what private corporation can compete with the deep pockets of the government?

There is another risk which is that commercial banks which are very important in modern economies in terms of providing credit that fuels economic activity might find that their deposits are being swept away into central bank accounts. In troubled times depositors might feel that ultimately their deposits are going to be safer with the central bank or other government institution compared to a commercial bank even if the commercial bank deposits are insured.

IMF: Is there a solution to that problem?

Prasad: The experiments with CBDCs that are underway in China and Sweden are suggesting that what might work more efficiently is a dual-tier system of CBDCs. The central bank would provide the underlying payment infrastructure and provide the CBDC essentially in the form of digital tokens but the actual digital wallets in which those CBDCs are maintained would be held by the commercial banks.

IMF: Do you see a digital yuan threatening the dollar’s dominant position as a global currency by virtue of China’s status as a fast-growing world economy?

Prasad: It’s not just the economic size or the size of the financial markets of a country issuing a particular currency but also the institutional framework in that country that maintains the trust of foreign investors. And these elements of trust include the rule of law an independent central bank and an institutionalized system of checks and balances. In all these dimensions I think the US still retains a dominance relative to much of the rest of the world.

IMF: The US Federal Reserve has a cautious attitude toward CBDCs. Why?

Prasad: One needs to think about what the user case really is for the CBDC in each country and in the US certainly we have certain issues with our payment systems. A lot of payments are intermediated through credit cards which are actually quite expensive for merchants to use because of the very high interchange fees. And many of those costs are passed on to consumers.

About 5% percent of households in the US are still unbanked or underbanked. So you and I can use Apple Pay but to use Apple Pay we need to have that linked to a bank account or a credit card and many households simply don’t have access to that.

So a CBDC might at the margin increase financial inclusion but the Fed already has a major project underway called “FedNow” to increase the efficiency of both retail payments as well as wholesale payments; that is payments among businesses and financial institutions.

IMF: Do official digital currencies pose broader dangers for society?

Prasad: You could see an authoritarian government using a digital version of its central bank money essentially to surveil its population. And even a benevolent government might decide that it wants to make sure that the money its central bank issues not only is not used for illicit purposes but is also not used for purposes it might regard as not necessarily socially beneficial.

You might well start seeing money being used as an instrument not just of economic policy but potentially even social policy. That would be dangerous for the credibility of central bank money and for central banks themselves.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTAzLTIwL3VzdXJwaW5nLWRvbGxhci1zLWRvbWluYW5jZS1hbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLXRhc2stZnVuZC1naWFudHMtc2F50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Usurping Dollar's Dominance Over World Is a Near Impossible Task,"Why did this happen?

The emerging crypto-asset industry is diverse and offers different potential opportunities and risks across different types of assets. While thousands of crypto assets exist bitcoin ether and a small set of stablecoins represent the large majority of crypto volumes with a relatively minor but growing role for Decentralised Finance (DeFi) – an experimental financial services ecosystem that relies on a distributed ledger or similar technology.

In light of its growing scale diversity complexity and interconnectedness with the regulated financial system which may amplify risks understanding the main drivers behind crypto-assets usage is relevant for policymakers users and industry alike.

While bitcoin the original crypto asset was conceived as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system without the need for an intermediary crypto assets including stablecoins are currently not widely used as a medium of exchange although recent research finds evidence that bitcoin has been used as a vehicle for domestic transactions and international payments (e.g. Graf von Luckner et al. 2021). Additional relevant factors for crypto-asset adoption may also include high expected returns from speculative investment (Auer and Tercero-Lucas 2021) their role as a perceived macro hedge protecting against macro-financial instability and excessive inflation despite their high volatility (Blau et al. 2021 Conlon et al. 2021) and regulatory arbitrage particularly related to illicit activity. Given their ease of storage and portability crypto assets may also support people “living under the threat of harm by their families people in their communities or repressive governments” (Peirce 2021). Regarding DeFi Harvey et al. (2021) conclude that it has potential to overcome the inherent challenges of the traditional financial sector of centralised control limited access inefficiency opacity and lack of inter-operability.

In a new paper (Feyen et al. 2022) we document the rise in on-chain crypto-asset activity around the world at the country level – transactions that are directly recorded on the distributed ledger that underpins a crypto-asset – and empirically investigate the association of crypto-asset volumes across countries with key global and domestic macroeconomic drivers.

Rapid rise of crypto activity around the world

Although data gaps are significant (e.g. IMF 2021) it appears that crypto-asset activity is a global phenomenon. Some industry estimates claim that 100-200 million people around the world owned or use crypto assets in 2021 including in many emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs).

We use a large global monthly country panel of on-chain crypto-asset transaction volumes of value sent in US dollars provided by Chainalysis a global blockchain analysis company to investigate the potential drivers of crypto-asset activity in various ways. The sample spans the period April 2019 to June 2021 and covers 174 countries and 114 different crypto assets. We mapped all crypto assets into four groups: (1) Bitcoin (2) Ethereum (3) stablecoins2 and (4) DeFi and others.3

Total crypto-asset on-chain volume over the past two years surged to a total of $2.8 trillion in the first half of 2021 alone. Figure 1 illustrates that the volumes in ether (40%) and stablecoins (24%) has gained more share over time compared to bitcoin (24%); DeFi and other crypto assets represent 12%. When looking at crypto activity by transaction size we find that large value transfers ($2.68 trillion) dwarf smaller transaction size transfers ($128 billion) suggesting a disproportionately large role of institutional activity.

Figure 1 Total crypto-asset volume by asset type (in US dollars)

Sources: Chainalysis World Bank staff calculations.

Figure 2 shows that the geographical distribution of crypto-asset activity is global. Annualised total volumes of crypto-asset activity for 2021 relative to GDP have become noticeable particularly in regions like Latin America and the Caribbean (median: 0.07% of GDP) sub-Saharan Africa (median: 0.06% of GDP) and Europe and Central Asia (median: 0.10% of GDP). Activity is relatively limited in lower- and middle-income countries and is dominated by bitcoin and ether. Smaller transactions still represent a minor fraction (10%) of total volumes across countries. The share of stablecoins also remains relatively low with 16% of the overall volume.

Note: A map of crypto-assets activity scaled by a country’s GDP – larger bubbles indicate higher activity relative to the size of the economy. The bubble sizes representing the relative values sent (% of GDP).

The data also suggest that the majority of the volume is concentrated in North America (the US in particular) and Europe and Central Asia with these two regions combined representing 56% of overall activity aggregated over our full sample period. While developed and high-income economies continue to represent a larger share of the overall crypto activity in absolute value of transfers across all transaction sizes the share of activity in regions like East Asia Pacific Latin America and the Caribbean South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa is gaining momentum.

Macro-financial drivers of crypto-asset activity

The empirical findings suggest that crypto-asset volumes are strongly associated with a set of forward-looking global macro-financial factors – which may ultimately shape domestic macro-financial conditions – rather than recent domestic macroeconomic developments. For example controlling for a range of global and domestic factors a ten basis-point increase in monthly US inflation expectations (on a five-year five-year forward basis as embedded in US Treasury yields) increases monthly crypto volumes by about 28 basis points. In contrast country-level macroeconomic indicators (e.g. inflation and the exchange rate) do not appear to be strongly related with country-level volumes.

Country-level volumes also move in the opposite direction to gold prices suggesting that crypto assets are seen to some extent as a substitute for gold – a traditional global inflation hedge. The results further imply that crypto assets are perceived as a speculative ‘risk-on’ asset class with higher volumes when real US Treasury yields – a proxy for global financial conditions – are lower. Crypto volumes also appear to be supported by a momentum effect in crypto-asset prices further suggesting that speculative motives play a role.

We also find some tentative evidence that crypto activity is higher in countries with higher information and communications technology (ICT) penetration and broadband subscriptions per capita. This offers some support for the idea that crypto assets may address some of the challenges associated with cross-border payments which can be slow and costly but further research is necessary to substantiate this. Nascent implementations of new technologies (e.g. the Lightning Network; see Poon and Dryja 2016) that could address current transaction throughput challenges of crypto assets may help accelerate adoption for (cross-border) payment transactions but these technologies are largely untested at scale and may also pose new risks.

Conclusion

Crypto assets are increasingly regarded as an emerging and diverse asset class as economic functions and risks differ across crypto assets (e.g. unbacked crypto assets stablecoins and Decentralised Finance).

While not a panacea to overcome financial sector challenges crypto assets and the underlying technology hold promise for financial innovation inclusion efficiency transparency and capital formation. However in view of their decentralised and cross-border nature which poses international regulatory arbitrage challenges crypto-assets also present several serious risks including to financial integrity consumer and investor protection fair competition monetary sovereignty capital control enforcement and taxation (e.g. FATF 2021 BCBS 2020 G7 2019). Further while crypto assets still constitute a small portion of the global financial system they could ultimately pose risks to global financial stability (e.g. FSB 2022).

Our findings shine new light on the rapid growth and diverse drivers behind crypto-asset activity and offer support to the notions that crypto assets are perceived as a risk asset a potential longer-term macro hedge and a potential tool to support cross-border payments. However our results should be interpreted with caution: a significant portion of the sample period includes extraordinary loose global financial conditions; the crypto volume data have a short history rely on important limiting assumptions and do not represent all crypto activity; and crypto-assets represent a fast-evolving increasingly diverse asset class and industry.

1 Not all crypto-assets transactions are ‘on chain’. ‘Off-chain’ transactions are only recorded on centralised ledgers and private order books of intermediaries such as crypto-assets exchanges custodial wallets and financial institutions. These ‘off-chain’ transactions may involve buying or selling of crypto-assets in exchange for fiat currency or exchanging one crypto-asset for another.

2 The stablecoin category in our analysis include some of the major US dollar-linked stablecoins: USD Coin (USDC) Tether (USDT) DAI (crypto-assets backed) TrueUSD (TUSD) Paxos USD (Dollar (PAX) Binance USD (BUSD) and Gemini Dollar (GUSD). In November 2021 the top three stablecoins accounted for about 85% of the total stablecoin market capitalisation.

3 The ‘DeFi and Others’ category includes 103 different crypto assets. The top ten with the largest volume are: Wrapped Ether (WETH) XRP Litecoin (LTC) Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) Chainlink (LINK) Bitcoin Cash (BCH) EOS Uniswap (UNI) Yearn Finance (YFI) and Sushiswap (SUSHI).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb29sLmNvbS90aGUtYXNjZW50L2NyeXB0b2N1cnJlbmN5L2FydGljbGVzL2lmLXlvdWQtYm91Z2h0LTEwMDAtd29ydGgtb2Ytc3RlbGxhci14bG0tNS15ZWFycy1hZ28taGVyZXMtaG93LW11Y2gteW91ZC1oYXZlLW5vdy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,If You'd Bought $1000 Worth of Stellar (XLM) 5 Years Ago Here's How Much You'd Have Now,"Launched in 2014 Stellar (XLM) is an ambitious project designed to make it fast and cheap to transfer any kind of currency. Even though its price isn't anywhere close to its previous highs it has still paid off for anyone who got in early.

If you had invested $1000 five years ago when the price was just $0.001966 you would have gotten about 509000 XLM. At today's price of nearly $0.19 that investment would be worth $94403.87.

Stellar was clearly a great investment five years ago. But we don't have a time machine so is it still worth buying today? To see if it could increase in value let's go over what it does and its current uses.

How Stellar works

Stellar is a payment network that's built for speed and efficiency at low costs. Transactions typically take about four to five seconds and cost just 0.00001 XLM. That's less than one-thousandth of a cent at today's prices.

What makes Stellar special is that it lets you send a digital version of any form of money. You could use it to send U.S. dollars Japanese yen Colombian pesos Bitcoin (BTC) or whatever other type of currency you want. The goal behind Stellar is to provide a single network for all the world's financial systems.

Because Stellar is intended as a universal payment system the team behind it didn't want to show preference to any national currencies. The solution was the lumen which is the native token on Stellar and what's used to pay transaction fees on the network.

Our top crypto play isn't a token - Here’s why We’ve found one company that’s positioned itself perfectly as a long-term picks-and-shovels solution for the broader crypto market — Bitcoin Dogecoin and all the others. In fact you've probably used this company's technology in the past few days even if you've never had an account or even heard of the company before. That's how prevalent it's become.

Individuals aren't the only ones who can use Stellar. It also has business applications because of the efficiency it offers. Companies large and small can use it to develop global payment solutions and some big players already have. For example IBM partnered with Stellar in 2018 to launch its IBM World Wire a blockchain-based global payments network.

Stellar's growth in 2021

One of the reasons to like Stellar as an investment is that it grew significantly last year. Here were a few of the most notable year-over-year examples from the Stellar Development Foundation's fourth quarter 2021 report:

Total accounts increased by 35.57% (4.8 million to 6.5 million).

(4.8 million to 6.5 million). The number of payments increased by 378.19% (15.2 million to 72.6 million).

(15.2 million to 72.6 million). Average daily volume on Stellar's decentralized exchange increased by 962.94% (11.9 million XLM to 126.2 million).

Another big step forward for Stellar in 2021 was forming a partnership with MoneyGram one of the largest money transfer companies in the world. The partnership involves integrating the Stellar blockchain into Moneygram's network. It will allow consumers to easily convert USD Coin (USDC) one of the biggest stablecoins to cash and vice versa.

In terms of value Stellar was up and down last year like most of the crypto market. It had returned over 500% on the year in May but that was followed by a steep drop. Overall the price of Stellar increased by 108% in 2021.

Is Stellar a good investment?

Stellar certainly has potential as a cryptocurrency investment. It's in use it's growing and it has secured some impressive partnerships including with IBM and Moneygram. It's also one of the older cryptocurrencies so it has shown staying power so far. It's available for purchase on many of the best cryptocurrency apps making it easy to invest in.

Crypto as a whole has been in a freefall this year and Stellar has dropped about 30% in value. Although crypto bear markets like these make investors nervous they can be a good time to buy. If you believe in the value of Stellar now may be an opportunity to get it at a discount.

Keep in mind that Stellar and other cryptocurrencies are highly volatile. It's important to be aware of the risks which include the possibility of losing your entire investment. If you're comfortable investing in the crypto market Stellar is worth considering for your portfolio."

The Longhorns had played 10 of their last 11 games away from home. On March 10 they lost starting pitcher Tanner Witt for the rest of the season and this week they slipped out of the No. 1 spot in the national polls.

""We had really tough travel tough game schedule tough travel"" coach David Pierce said. ""I think more than anything we learned how to deal with the adversity and don't take winning for granted.""

On Friday night the Longhorns revived a version of themselves from earlier this season. No. 2 Texas put up its highest score of the season bashing three home runs in a 19-2 series-opening victory over Incarnate Word.

The bottom half of the lineup provided most of the power. Right fielder Murphy Stehle was 4-for-5 with six RBIs and three runs; third baseman Skyler Messinger was 3-for-5 with three RBIs and a pair of runs; and second baseman Mitchell Daly was 2-for-4 with three RBIs and two runs. Stehle Douglas Hodo III and Eric Kennedy all hit homers.

The first inning provided the only shaky moments for Texas (15-5) as the Cardinals went up 1-0 and then took out the first two Longhorns in the bottom of the inning. But Texas found its opportunity when Ivan Melendez and Silas Ardoin reached on two-out walks.

With Melendez on second and Ardoin on first Stehly whopped the ball over the left-field fence to put the Longhorns up 3-1.

""I've been playing slow and easy"" Stehly said. ""I had runners on base and I needed to get something started because they had scored in the first.""

It was the first of a night full of highlights for the senior right fielder. Stehly stretched to make a catch to end the second inning and in the third he singled stole second and scored on Messinger's double.

Stehly ""looked very comfortable out there"" Pierce said. ""Right field here is really tough and he handled it really well.""

By the bottom of the fourth the Longhorns were up 8-1 forcing the Cardinals to change pitchers. Michael Garza who had struck out at least seven batters in each of his previous starts had only one strikeout Friday. By the end of the fifth it was 17-2.

Key Play: Hodo faced off against Drew Minter — Incarnate Word's third pitcher of the night — in the bottom of the fifth with runners on first and second. Minter making his season debut had already allowed four runs. Hodo hit a three-run home run; the Longhorns scored nine in the fifth.

Notable number: 5. Messinger accounted for five runs ending his night with three RBIs two runs scored and two doubles. The Kansas transfer has 12 RBIs this season and a .371 slugging percentage.

Up next: Texas and Incarnate Word will play the second game of their three-game series at 2:30 p.m. Saturday (Longhorn Network 104.9). The probable pitching matchup is UT right-hander Tristan Stevens (3-1 0.76) vs. Incarnate Word right-hander Aaron Celestino (3-0 4.09).

The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (Gedi) mission – pronounced like Jedi in Star Wars – was launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to the International Space Station (ISS) in December 2018 and has provided the first 3D map of the world’s forests.

Data from the Nasa mission which has used billions of laser beam signals to measure the height shape and health of the Earth’s trees since April 2019 has been helping scientists answer questions about land-use change a key driver of the climate crisis and biodiversity loss including how much carbon trees store and the effect of forest fires on the atmosphere.

The $150m project is scheduled to be “de-orbited” from the ISS early next year and the sensor – roughly the size of a fridge – will be incinerated in the Earth’s atmosphere.

Researchers overseeing the project based at the University of Maryland have asked for an extension to allow Gedi to finish its work and calibrate the results with other satellites due to launch this decade that will monitor the planet’s ecosystems. Early results from the project indicate there could be much more carbon stored on land than previously thought.

While they acknowledge Gedi’s lifetime has already been extended once in March 2021 the researchers say extensions on the ISS are common and the tool is providing crucial data including helping to monitor the Cop26 commitment from 142 countries to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030.

“The biggest uncertainty we have in terms of atmospheric CO2 concentrations driving climate change is the balance between deforestation and subsequent regrowth. Gedi is helping us address that” said Prof Ralph Dubayah principal investigator on the mission. “If you want to plant a trillion trees go ahead. But you have to know what you’re starting with to know what kind of impact that’s going to have.”

Leading forest experts have backed calls for a stay of execution. They called the sensor a “key tool” for understanding global heating and described its pending destruction as a waste of money.

When contacted by the Guardian Nasa said Gedi has already been extended beyond its prime mission to allow for additional data collection and is scheduled to be replaced by another sensor early next year.

Although scientists know the planet’s trees are an enormous carbon store holding the equivalent of nearly a century’s worth of annual fossil fuel emissions at the current rate basic questions about the size and structure of forests remain unanswered.

The uncertainty poses difficulties for researchers tracking emissions from land-use change.

“Considering that we have to accelerate climate action and forests are something we can use for mitigation it is critical that Gedi meets its scientific goals” said Laura Duncanson a research scientist on the Gedi team.

Inge Jonckheere an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC) author and head of remote sensing and climate change at the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization said: “Every country can come up with its own definition of a forest. Countries can just fill in numbers and then everybody has to take them as the truth. But with satellites we can check them” said Jonckheere.

Fred Stolle deputy director of the forest programme at the World Resource Institute said his organisation was adding Gedi data to its Global Forest Watch platform one of the primary free sources of reliable information about the world’s forests.

“Currently our main tool is tree cover from the Landsat programme. But now we are shifting to tree height because it is a better indicator of forest health using Gedi” he said. “The data allows us to find important areas of forest and say: do not touch this.”

Diego Saez Gil head of Pachama a carbon offsetting firm that uses AI and remote sensing to verify and monitor carbon capture by forests said Gedi provided “the best available data to estimate the carbon stored in forests”.

“The longer Gedi stays in orbit the more spatial coverage we can get improving the quality of biomass estimates. If Gedi were to remain in orbit we could have long-term continuous records of biomass.”

Matthew Hansen a remote sensing scientist whose data is used as the scientific standard in deforestation research said the combination of GEDI and other Nasa land monitoring enabled researchers to “assess deforestation and associated emissions as well as restoration efforts”.

At that stage patients remain hooked to machines that deliver life-saving medicine food and hydration as doctors regularly check their ability to respond to a voice command. If there isn’t a response in the first few days families can start to lose hope.

Now a new study by Boston and New York researchers offers hope and some guideposts.

Doctors and nurses say one of the toughest parts of their job is counseling anguished families about a loved one’s chances of waking up from a coma.

In the study researchers found that most patients with severe COVID-19 regained consciousness even after spending weeks in a coma.

The study’s findings will be a “huge anxiety reducer” for families said Daiwai Olson a professor of neurology and director of the neuroscience nursing research center at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.

“It gives nurses and physicians the confidence to tell families ‘look this can take several weeks” he said. “We have had moms want to stay at the bed side and we can tell them go home and take a shower it may take three weeks” for the patient to regain consciousness.

The findings add to a growing body of evidence that suggests families and physicians should wait longer before withdrawing life support from people in a coma.

“Many families say their loved one would not want to continue living if they were unconsciousness or in a vegetative state” said Dr. Brian Edlow a co-senior author of the study and an associate director of the Center for Neurotechnology and Neurorecovery at Massachusetts General Hospital.

“The underlying message [from this study] is simple: If you give people enough time most but not all people who have severe COVID will ultimately recover consciousness” Edlow said.

The study published in the Annals of Neurology analyzed outcomes from 795 COVID patients who were on a ventilator for at least seven days during the first wave of the pandemic in spring 2020.

The researchers found that 72 percent of the patients survived and ultimately recovered consciousness. For those who survived 25 percent recovered consciousness 10 or more days after coming off the breathing machine and 10 percent took more than three weeks. The researchers studied a separate smaller group of patients from the second surge through April 2021 and found similar results.

The patients were treated at Mass General and two other facilities within the New York-Presbyterian Hospital system: Columbia University Irving Medical Center and Weill Cornell Medical College.

Dr. Jose Suarez professor and chief of neurosciences critical care at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine said such delayed awakenings match what he has witnessed caring for patients in a coma after traumatic brain injuries or cardiac arrest.

“We found that in the past if the patients came in with post cardiac arrest people thought the prognosis was universally poor but we have learned that waiting longer [for them to wake up] is the way to go” said Suarez who was not involved with the COVID study.

The study found that the more episodes of low blood oxygen a patient experienced while in a medication-induced coma as a ventilator pushed air into their weakened lungs the longer it took them to wake up and be able to follow a simple voice command such as giving doctors a thumbs up or squeezing their hands.

The researchers did not track patients’ progress after they left the hospital. And research about life after a prolonged time on a ventilator is still relatively new. But the experience experts say can have lasting effects on a patient’s mind and body for weeks and months afterward. It can include severe physical weakness and brain fog as well as depression.

One of the Mass General COVID patients who took nearly three weeks to wake up after 40 days on a breathing machine is Hung a 49-year-old Greater Boston resident who was hospitalized with COVID in April 2020. On that momentous day doctors asked him to blink his eyes and open his mouth and finally Hung was able to do that.

(Hung and his wife Doris asked that their last name not be used to protect their privacy.)

Before COVID Hung was a strapping 5-foot 11-inch 240 pound high-octane leader of a group home for people with disabilities. Today after nine months of hospitalization and rehabilitation followed by more than a year of physical therapy at home Hung is 150 pounds and has trouble rising from a wheelchair. He has regained much of his cognitive skills but is quiet and reserved.

“I had to make so many decisions I never thought I would have to make” said Doris an intensive care nurse who was taking care of COVID patients at another hospital during the tense long weeks her husband lay in a coma. She was making life-and-death decisions about his care even as doctors were unable to say whether Hung would survive and have a decent quality of life if he did.

There were dozens of setbacks as his liver and other organs failed. And then five months of grueling rehabilitation in another facility. Today Doris works nights and cares for Hung and their 9-year-old son by day with the help of her parents.

Despite their grueling odyssey Doris says families with a loved one in a coma should not give up.

“I have patients that have been intubated more or less than my husband has been and they will pull through but it will be a long journey” she said.

Recent research using sophisticated machines not typically used in clinical care has revealed electrical signals in the brains of some coma patients who hadn’t yet regained consciousness indicating the brain was responding to a voice command or other stimulus even if the patient outwardly was not.

“Just because someone is not responsive clinically they might be responsive in some sort of brain function but we don’t have those tools to use that routinely” said Dr. Claude Hemphill professor of neurology at the University of California San Francisco and chief of neurology at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital.

Hemphill said these patients are the ones who are more likely to regain consciousness.

“We are at the early stages of this but when I see studies like this [Mass General COVID study] I go back to every neuro ICU doctor or nurse where we say we had a case and said ‘Gosh I didn’t think that patient was going to wake up and they did” Hemphill said.

“It doesn’t mean the person did something they weren’t supposed to” he said. “We just weren’t smart enough to know it at that time.”

The costumed kids posed as persons they researched for the 2022 Fourth Grade Wax Museum. With the aid of notecards they honed their public speaking skills and presented short speeches. It was the culmination of students' class biography projects at the local elementary school.

Having prepared for weeks in advance 36 students of teachers Renita Kahlstorf and Mary Hildman participated in classrooms throughout the school. The elaborately costumed students recited two- to five-minute speeches.

""Dressed up in character the students came out of their 'wax' state and became their historical person"" Kahlstorf said. ""It was a night to remember.""

Kahlstorf described the event is a hands-on means of teaching not just public speaking but history language and many life skills. She said it is a highlight of the school year for her students. They learned how to create a bibliography cite sources write reports and speak publicly.

""They had to research and write a report on their person of choice who made a significant contribution to mankind"" Kahlstorf said. ""Students were introduced to a bibliography by our media specialist Linda Christophers resulting in every fourth grader adding a bibliography to their report. Finally using the practical public speaking tips from Robin Kudej the fourth-grade students took on the role of their character.""

Sky News has learnt that Goldman has been signed up to advise the consortium being led by Todd Boehly one of the owners of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team.

The addition of Goldman to Mr Boehly's bid is understood to have been disclosed in an offer letter sent to Raine the merchant bank overseeing Chelsea's sale on Friday.

While Goldman's involvement is limited at this stage to an advisory rather than financing role its decision to work with Mr Boehly underlines its apparent status as one of the frontrunners to succeed Roman Abramovich as the Blues' owner.

Spokesmen for Goldman and Mr Boehly both declined to comment on Saturday.

News of the Wall Street bank's role comes less than 24 hours after Sky News revealed that Clearlake Capital a California-based investment firm had joined the consortium which also includes Hansjorg Wyss a Swiss businessman and Jonathan Goldstein a London-based property investor.

Raine is expected to whittle down dozens of preliminary offers to fewer than a handful in the next few days leading to more serious and detailed negotiations with the remaining contenders.

Sources said the bid led by Mr Boehly was now ""overfunded"" meaning that it like a number of Chelsea's other prospective buyers have secured more capital than they are likely to require to buy the club.

This is largely because of the truncated timetable on which the sale process is being conducted following the sanctioning of Roman Abramovich the Blues' owner since 2003.

Lord Finkelstein a Times journalist and Barbara Charone a celebrity publicist would join Chelsea's board as non-executive directors if the Boehly bid is successful it emerged this week.

A source close to the group said its offer could be implemented rapidly and that the required capital was ready to be deployed immediately paving the way for a rapid change of ownership at Stamford Bridge.

Mr Boehly's consortium would provide long-term funding for Chelsea including the redevelopment of its Stamford Bridge home its academy and its women's team the source added.

Other bidders seen as viable contenders include: a group - also revealed by Sky News - comprising the Ricketts family which owns the Chicago Cubs baseball team and Ken Griffin the American hedge fund billionaire; Nick Candy the property entrepreneur; and Sir Martin Broughton whose involvement in the auction was first reported by Sky News last weekend.

On Friday Mr Candy's bid - through a vehicle called the Blue Football Consortium - confirmed that it had secured financial backing from two South Korean companies among a consortium of global investors.

""Chelsea is one of the most iconic and successful professional football clubs in the world with a rich heritage global following and a highly valuable brand"" Mr Candy said.

""Football clubs are vitally important community and cultural assets and this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to give football back to the fans and put them at the heart of the operations and strategy of a leading global football club.""

The bid led by Sir Martin which includes the support of Lord Coe the former British Olympian is being backed by the American hedge fund billionaire and sports investor Josh Harris.

Sky News reported last weekend that Sir Martin was in talks with Mr Harris about a joint offer for Chelsea.

""I have a track record of success in boardrooms throughout my career and I have done this before"" Sir Martin the former British Airways chairman said.

""I remain the only person to have effected a change of ownership at a major football club in a similar situation which I did at Liverpool 12 years ago.

""But most importantly as a lifelong fan I am committed to ensuring Chelsea maintains its preeminent position at the top of European football and making sure we put fans first.""

Chelsea is operating under a government-issued licence which imposes strict spending limits on the club and which prevents it from selling new match tickets or merchandise.

Last week Chelsea's corporate credit cards were frozen by Barclays as the British bank sought to clarify the implications of the sanctions against Mr Abramovich deepening the sense of anxiety surrounding the club's finances.

Chelsea face Middlesbrough in the FA Cup quarter-final on Saturday evening following a row this week over the London club's hastily withdrawn request that the match be played behind closed doors for reasons of ""sporting integrity"".

A quickfire sale of Chelsea is seen as essential if it is to remain solvent and therefore retain the nucleus of a playing squad which has become established as one of Europe's most successful under Mr Abramovich's ownership during the last two decades.

The government has been clear that none of the proceeds from a takeover could flow to the Russian-born billionaire.

The cluster of American investors circling Chelsea underlines the extent to which the English Premier League has become a magnet for financiers from across the Atlantic during the last 20 years.

Arsenal Liverpool and Manchester United have all been acquired by US-based businessmen during that period and a significant number of other top-flight clubs also have American backing.

Last season's Champions League-winners have been thrown into disarray by Russia's war on Ukraine with Mr Abramovich initially proposing to place the club in the care of its foundation and then formally putting it up for sale.

Mr Abramovich had initially slapped a £3bn price tag on the Stamford Bridge outfit with the net proceeds being donated to a charitable foundation set up to benefit the victims of the war in Ukraine.

The value of the bids tabled on Friday remains unclear however.

Last week Chelsea sponsors such as Three UK the mobile telecoms network and Hyundai the Korean car-maker announced that they were suspending their association with the club.

Whoever buys the club will require the government's consent in the form of a special licence as well as the approval of the Premier League under its fit and proper ownership test.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5za3lzcG9ydHMuY29tL2Zvb3RiYWxsL25ld3MvMTE2NjgvMTI1NzAzODIvY2hlbHNlYS1zYWxlLWdvbGRtYW4tc2FjaHMtYWR2aXNpbmctY29uc29ydGl1bS1sZWQtYnktdG9kZC1ib2VobHktZm91ci1iaWRzLWZvci1jbHViLWNvbmZpcm1lZC1hZnRlci1kZWFkbGluZdIBqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5za3lzcG9ydHMuY29tL2FtcC9mb290YmFsbC9uZXdzLzExNjY4LzEyNTcwMzgyL2NoZWxzZWEtc2FsZS1nb2xkbWFuLXNhY2hzLWFkdmlzaW5nLWNvbnNvcnRpdW0tbGVkLWJ5LXRvZGQtYm9laGx5LWZvdXItYmlkcy1mb3ItY2x1Yi1jb25maXJtZWQtYWZ0ZXItZGVhZGxpbmU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chelsea sale: Goldman Sachs advising consortium led by Todd Boehly; four bids for club confirmed after deadline,"Goldman Sachs are advising a consortium led by LA Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly as four bids are confirmed to have been submitted for the purchase of Chelsea.

Times columnist and former Conservative government adviser Daniel Finkelstein and American PR legend Barbara Charone are also part of the consortium.

Sky Sports News has been told by sources close to the Boehly consortium they are hopeful they have the complete plan - and the speed - to win government approval and that of bankers Raine who have already stressed the importance of a quick sale.

They also said ""all cash proceeds from the sale are delivered without delay to the victims of the ongoing humanitarian crisis created by Russia's invasion of Ukraine"" and promised that fans would be ""at the heart of decision making"".

Twelve years ago Sir Broughton brokered the sale of Liverpool in similar circumstances - as state-controlled Royal Bank of Scotland were the club's major shareholder it meant he had to work with the UK government to approve the sale to Fenway Sports Group. He told Sky News: ""I've been a Chelsea fan since 1955. I've been down there for 67 years. I am a fan. I think it's important that we have a great deal of fan involvement in this.

""We can bring stability. That's an important part of having a consortium. When you have a single party you run geopolitical risks and financial risks even health risks where an incident can create confusion and chaos at the club.

""Where you have a consortium if something like that happens it affects the consortium - it doesn't affect the club. A consortium brings long-term stability of like-minded highly-capitalised people who are in it for the long haul with no exit timeline at all.""

Vivek Ranadive is also part of the consortium Sir Broughton has put together. Ranadive is a computer software billionaire who owns the NBA's Sacramento Kings.

British luxury property developer Nick Candy - who has also pledged to have fan representation on the club's board - confirmed he is leading a global consortium that has submitted a bid of £2 billion.

The group say they are committed to delivering financial support for all men's women's and academy teams and want to build a new stadium at Stamford Bridge to create a major new London landmark.

The Ricketts family owners of the Chicago Cubs are joined in their bid by billionaire hedge fund owner Ken Griffin who is the richest individual involved in the process and worth nearly three times as much as Abramovich.

There have been other confirmations of bids for Chelsea with Aethel Partners putting in a bid worth more than £2 billion for Chelsea on Thursday. An investment company based in Berkeley Square in London it is willing to provide Chelsea with an immediate £50m to deal with any short-term financing the club may need.

Meanwhile former Chelsea captain John Terry has announced he is joining the True Blues Consortium aimed at giving supporters a 10 per cent ownership in the club.

Chelsea fans would be able to buy into the set-up from as little as £100 with the consortium aiming to work with the club's eventual new owners on buying a share in the club.

Chelsea Pitch Owners who own the Stamford Bridge freehold and the Chelsea Supporters' Trust have backed the plan in principle. If successful the True Blues Consortium would elect one representative to sit on Chelsea's board.

However Turkish businessman Muhsin Bayrak says he did not bid for Chelsea despite claiming earlier this month there was a ""90 per cent chance"" he would buy the club.

Bayrak said he was very upset at missing Friday's 9pm deadline and blamed a misunderstanding with his lawyers.

Bayrak's claims about his interest in buying Chelsea had always been viewed with scepticism by those close to the sale process.

Chelsea Supporters Trust confirmed they have held talks with several of the bidders and have called for fan involvement ""through the creation of a legally-binding golden share"". They also urged the government to show its support for football fans by ""implementing the recommendations of the Fan-led review for the benefit of all supporters"".

The sale of Chelsea has come amid UK and EU sanctions on Abramovich following Russia's invasion of Ukraine with the Premier League club also under a number of restrictions.

The club - including women and youth teams - cannot sell tickets to games or sell merchandise and are restricted on how much they can spend on any given game day.

Thomas Tuchel's side beat Middlesbrough 2-0 in the FA Cup quarter-finals on Saturday and only had 670 fans at the Riverside Stadium - the number of fans who had purchased tickets before Abramovich was sanctioned last Thursday and the new restrictions came in to force.

The government had lifted the £20000 away travel cap for the game however to allow Chelsea to fly to the game as they normally would.

The club and the government remain in talks about amending some of the restrictions Chelsea are operating under with the government considering allowing a third party to handle the sale and distribution of tickets.

Speaking after the win Thomas Tuchel emphasised the need for the club's ownership to be resolved as soon as possible.

""I hope the process goes through as soon as possible to clear the situation and calm the situation down so we can have an outlook on the near future"" the Blues boss said.

""As far as I know things will be pushed as fast as possible so we can see ourselves in a calmer situation.""

The corporate card and spending management startup collected $550 million in debt financing including a $300 million credit facility from Citibank and a $150 million increase in a credit line from Goldman Sachs. Last year Ramp secured a $150 million debt facility also from Goldman Sachs.



Return investor Founders Fund led the $200 million equity investment joined by prior investors including D1 Capital Partners Thrive Capital Redpoint Ventures and Stripe as well as new investors such as General Catalyst Avenir Growth Capital 137 Ventures and Declaration Partners.

While venture debt is often used as a means for startups to extend their runway and limit founders’ dilution fintech companies—especially those offering credit products—have been raising large debt rounds to finance their business models. Among the startups that have raised nine-figure debt financings are SecFi which helps startup employees exercise options and Empower a mobile banking app provider.

New York-based Ramp founded in 2019 competes in a growing market of business lending companies that includes Brex which is Ramp’s main rival and American Express. Ramp provides corporate credit cards paired with free software that helps businesses automate expense management.

The new round values Ramp at $8.1 billion up from the $3.95 billion valuation it reached in September with its Series C according to PitchBook data. The company said in an email to PitchBook that it boosted its revenue nearly tenfold in 2021 driven by the growth in interchange fees which Ramp earns from merchants when customers shop with the credit cards it issues.



The global venture debt market has swelled in recent years rising from just over 2000 deals at a value of $12.5 billion in 2013 to more than 5000 transactions worth over $58 billion last year according to PitchBook data.

As venture debt grows in popularity a variety of investors and companies are seeking to cash in on the hot market.

Brex announced last August that it has itself begun offering venture loans to its customers. To finance its venture debt business the company has raised a $150 million fund backed by outside inventors and its own capital according to The Information.

Other fintech companies with similar offerings include payments processing giant Stripe and Mercury a San Francisco-based neobank for small businesses which this month unveiled a venture debt product. These companies are competing against well-established small business and startup lenders like Silicon Valley Bank and Orix.

Ramp didn’t respond to a request for comment about potential plans to start its own venture debt business.

They want the jury to hear statements that Ng's wife Lim Hwee Bin made to bankers about an account and shell company they say she opened in 2012 - even as Ng's lawyers plan to call her as a witness on his behalf.

The defence says Ms Lim will testify that US$35.1 million (S$47.6 million) transferred into an account she controlled was not tainted 1MDB money but was for an unrelated business transaction.

Ng the only Goldman banker to go to trial in the scandal is accused of conspiring with his former boss Tim Leissner to help financier Jho Low siphon billions of dollars from a trio of bond deals the bank did for the sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad or 1MDB.

Leissner has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with the government against Ng. Low who was also charged is a fugitive.

Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn New York have asked the court to allow statements Ms Lim made to UBS Group bankers to be admitted as part of their case calling her an uncharged ""co-conspirator"". They allege that 1MDB funds were transferred by a Low associate to the shell entity.

Leissner has told the jury he then directed that US$35.1 million of those funds be sent to the account under Ms Lim's control as kickbacks to Ng. The entity was originally called Silken Waters and renamed Victoria Square.

'Powerful evidence'

""Lim participated at a minimum in a conspiracy to launder criminal proceeds"" prosecutors said in a March 16 letter to the court. Her statements about the transactions ""are powerful evidence of both the fact that the defendant and his wife controlled the Silken Waters/Victoria Square bank account and that they sought to conceal their control - an essential element of the charged money laundering conspiracy"".

While Ms Lim was not charged in the case prosecutors said she helped her husband by opening the UBS account and the shell company on May 21 2012 the same day the first 1MDB bond transaction closed.

Ms Lim arrived in the United States from Malaysia this week according to the defence. Her lawyer Joshua Kirshner declined to comment on the government's allegations. Ms Lim concealed her role partly by opening the account in the name of her mother Tan Kim Chin and giving a ""fake"" e-mail address for her according to the US. The government says the phone number given for the account was Ms Lim's own.

She also created a second false e-mail address she used to communicate with bankers that she later deleted the US alleges. On Thursday (March 17) prosecutors showed jurors evidence about the creation and deletion of the accounts."

Oilfield services companies Halliburton and Schlumberger are suspending operations in Russia.

The two companies announced the decision on Friday saying it would take immediate effect.

Several other energy companies previously announced plans to exit their operations in Russia.

Two of the world's largest oilfield service companies have suspended their operations in Russia in response to US sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine.

Reuters and other outlets first reported the story.

Schlumberger and Halliburton respectively announced their decision in news releases on Friday saying it would take immediate effect.

According to Oil Industry Insight Schlumberger is the world's largest oilfield company service and Halliburton ranks third after Baker Hughes.

Olivier Le Peuch the chief executive officer for Schlumberger said in the news release it was suspending new investment and technology deployment to the company's operations in Russia. The company plans to fulfil any existing activity in full compliance with international laws and sanctions.

""Safety and security are at the core of who we are as a company and we urge a cessation of the conflict and a restoration of safety and security in the region"" Le Peuch added.

In its news release Halliburton said while the company had halted all shipments of specific sanctioned parts and products to Russia several weeks ago it has immediately suspended future business in compliance with sanctions that prohibit transactions and work.

Its chairman president and CEO Jeff Miller said: ""The war in Ukraine deeply saddens us.""

He added: ""We have employees in both Ukraine and Russia and the conflict greatly impacts our people their families and loved ones throughout the region. Since the start of this conflict we prioritized employee safety and compliance with all relevant sanctions.""

Baker Hughes did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment made outside of normal working hours.

Major companies such as ExxonMobil BP and Shell have pulled out of Russia while McDonald's which said it would close all stores have been unable to do so.

Halliburton said on Friday it had suspended future business in Russia in compliance with sanctions that prohibit transactions and work including for certain state-owned Russian customers.

Halliburton said it would prioritize safety and reliability as it wound down its remaining operations in Russia.

Halliburton said it halted all shipments of specific sanctioned parts and products to Russia several weeks ago and had no active joint ventures there.

Schlumberger like Halliburton based in Houston Texas said it immediately suspended investment and technology deployment to its Russia operations and would actively monitor a “dynamic” situation.

“Safety and security are at the core of who we are as a company and we urge a cessation of the conflict and a restoration of safety and security in the region” the Schlumberger chief executive Olivier Le Peuch said in a statement.

Companies that remain in Russia are under increasing pressure to leave.

More than 400 US and other multinational firms have pulled out of Russia either permanently or temporarily according to Jeffrey Sonnenfeld senior associate dean for executive programs at the Yale School of Management who has publicized a list of corporate actions in Russia.

Oil companies ExxonMobil Shell and BP along with major tech companies like Dell and Facebook were among the first to announce withdrawals or the suspension of operations. Many others including McDonald’s Starbucks and Estée Lauder have followed. Around 30 companies remain.

The Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Wednesday asked Congress to press US businesses still operating in Russia to leave saying the Russian market is “flooded with our blood”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9ob3VzdG9uL25ld3MvMjAyMi8wMy8xOS9oYWxsaWJ1cnRvbi1zY2hsdW1iZXJnZXItYmFrZXItaHVnaGVzLXJ1c3NpYS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Halliburton Schlumberger Baker Hughes suspend new investments in Russia - Houston Business Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/houston/news/2022/03/19/halliburton-schlumberger-baker-hughes-russia.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9ob3VzdG9uL25ld3MvMjAyMi8wMy8xOS9oYWxsaWJ1cnRvbi1zY2hsdW1iZXJnZXItYmFrZXItaHVnaGVzLXJ1c3NpYS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF6ZXJuZXdzLmF6L3JlZ2lvbi8xOTA5OTAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Halliburton suspends future business in Russia,"19 March 2022 22:00 (UTC+04:00)

What started out as a track meet quickly turned into a game where both teams had to fight to score the ball. The teams came out firing scoring 10 apiece just about three minutes into the game but from there the defenses locked in. After one the Spartans trailed 16-14.

“I think we started off a little slow; could have come out a little faster” Will Trela who led New Hartford with 11 points in the first quarter said. “All the shots weren’t falling and just wasn't going our way the whole way so it is what it is.”

In the second quarter New Hartford continued to struggle offensively only managing to score five points. At the break the Spartans trailed 25-19.

“To hold them to 25 we did a good job” New Hartford Head Coach John Randall said. “Trela kept us in it early on and in the fourth quarter Zach (Philipkoski) started finding the basket.”

Through three quarters New Hartford trailed 39-26. At that time Trela led the team with 14 points. Philipkoski had been held to just three points heading into the fourth but from there he found his shooting stroke.

Philipkoski erupted for 18 points in the fourth quarter to help the Spartans fight their way back to into the game.

The last of Philipkoski’s six three-pointers managed to cut the deficit to 57-49 but with only 48 seconds remaining New Hartford’s comeback effort would come up just short as Manhasset buried four of their five free throws down the stretch to ice the game.

Key plays

Will Trela hit a 3-pointer with less than three seconds remaining in the first quarter to cut New Hartford's deficit to two points.

Manhasset's Mike Notias hit a pair of three pointers at the end of the third quarter that extended the team's lead to 13 points heading into the fourth quarter.

By the numbers

""A lot of teams don't get to make it this far. A great team great seniors – they've been awesome this whole year. It's an experience for a lifetime."" – Zach Philipkoski

""Next year we're just going to have to keep going at it. We're going to have to come a lot harder next year because we're going to have a target on our back the whole year because we're coming from the state finals to back home. We're just going to have to come at it every day."" – Zach Philipkoski

""Obviously if you're a New Hartford student and you just saw what happened for the last three or four weeks you're going to want to hop on board and make sure that if you ever get this opportunity that you're going to be ready just like these guys were ready."" – John Randall

""Yes we didn't expect to be here and that's why it stings more now because the closer you get to the top of the mountain the rougher it's going to be if you fall. So I'm glad that you know we got to this point but it obviously stings more now because you were right there."" – John Randall

What’s Next

There are no Federation championships for NYSPHSAA winners this year so the state championship marks the end of the season for both teams.

By Ronni Newton

Hartford’s 50th St. Patrick’s Day parade returned Saturday after several cancellations and a large contingent from West Hartford joined in the festivities.

The parade was canceled in March 2020 as the impact of COVID-19 was just beginning its impact on the area and was not held in 2021 amid the lingering pandemic. And in 2022 the event was postponed for a week due to severe weather forecast on March 12 which was the original date.

Under cloudy and occasionally misty skies former marshals and honorees from West Hartford representatives from the West Hartford Police and West Hartford Fire departments and a Friends of Feeney float were among the town’s participants in the parade.

The West Hartford Police Department created a video of their experience which was shared on their Facebook page.

Another year another batch of classic Optimus Prime action figures from Hasbro. The latest line is called the Power of the Primes a welcome departure from some of the recent Cybertron-related toys.

This Prime is based on the G1 version of Optimus. While many of us Transformers fans usually have several Primes this one should be a “must buy” because not only does he transform into a truck but hidden in the design is Orion Pax!

Pax is the Autobot who would eventually become Optimus Prime. This figure pulls triple duty which explains the $69.99 price tag at the Big Bad Toy Store. The Leader Class figure stands at 9″ tall and will be out this May. From the pictures it looks like Orion Pax fits entirely into the chest area of the Optimus figure. We even get a Matrix of Leadership too.



The Autobots and Decepticons use Prime Masters to wield the incredible powers of the most legendary bots in the universe: the Primes. Prime Masters carry the spark of a Prime allowing them to share a Prime’s godlike ability with other bots. Anything is possible and everything is at stake when the Power of the Primes is unleashed!

With the Matrix of Leadership Orion Pax becomes leader of the Autobots: Optimus Prime.

Orion Pax has shown up from time to time in toy form but rarely looks like his original G1 form. The Power of the Primes finally solves that issue by giving us a design of Pax that is pretty close to how he appears in the story War Dawn. Check out the entire episode below.

Paulus and his advisor Philip D. Green according to a 2018 internal document obtained by Asheville Watchdog.

“[W]ith no outside advice other than Phil Green” whom the investigators wrote had an undisclosed “prior business relationship with HCA” Mission Health’s board of directors decided not to issue requests for competitive bids or to hold an auction before agreeing to sell Asheville’s flagship hospital system to HCA Healthcare for $1.5 billion according to the document prepared in advance of a meeting between Department of Justice lawyers and HCA representatives on Oct. 30 2018.

Instead as Paulus “coached HCA behind the scenes on how to best present its case to the Mission Board” the board invited only one other healthcare company — identified in other documents as Novant Health of Winston-Salem — to present a formal offer.

“In the end” the document stated “an outside observer could conclude that HCA rose to the top among a limited number of bidders because the deck had been stacked in its favor from the beginning by Dr. Paulus and Mr. Green.”

The attorney general’s office was so concerned about potential conflicts of interest by Paulus and Green that it requested the Mission board revote on the transaction the attorney general’s deputy chief of staff Laura Brewer wrote to Asheville Watchdog this week. After considering the information the Mission board voted again unanimously to approve it.

Paulus did not respond to Asheville Watchdog’s requests for comment. Green declined an interview request but noted that the attorney general after an extensive review did not object to the sale.

Only HCA Novant and Atrium Considered

The Oct. 30 document written by Special Deputy Attorney General Jennifer T. Harrod who led the North Carolina Department of Justice investigation was among more than 6000 records released Feb. 25 by the office of Attorney General Josh Stein in partial response to public records requests filed by Asheville Watchdog over the past two years.

The documents contain details not previously made public about the sale of the 133-year-old nonprofit hospital system including that other than HCA and Novant Carolinas HealthCare System (now Atrium Health) was the only other healthcare company that the Mission board seriously considered. But Carolinas was rejected quickly and not even invited to make a presentation to the board the records show.

The documents confirm and expand on Asheville Watchdog’s previous reporting on the role played by Paulus and Green. They show Green negotiated proposed term sheets — nonbinding proposals — for both a $1.5 billion sale of substantially all of Mission’s assets to HCA and for a $650 million joint venture with HCA that would have preserved some local control. HCA provided Paulus with a written affiliation proposal on Aug. 12 2017 six weeks before the Mission board authorized Paulus to engage in calls and meetings with potential affiliation partners.

Overall the newly released documents raise serious questions about the role of Paulus Mission’s president and CEO; his longtime personal friend and advisor Green; and the 18-member Mission board of directors which investigators said seems to have accepted HCA’s arguments about cost-savings and improved quality of care “uncritically.”

Paulus’s emails examined

Under state law the attorney general has the right to review any transaction in which a nonprofit corporation sells substantially all of its assets. The investigation of the proposed Mission deal began in May 2018.

By October 2018 Harrod and other lawyers in the attorney general’s office had examined thousands of documents related to Mission’s decision to sell including Paulus’s and Green’s email exchanges with HCA and other potential partners and minutes of Mission board meetings.

On the afternoon of Oct. 30 2018 Harrod at least two other lawyers with the North Carolina Department of Justice and four representatives of HCA met at the attorney general’s office in Raleigh. No one from Mission attended the records show.

“We see that HCA’s purchase of Mission brings something new and dynamic to the region” Harrod wrote in an opening statement. She said the Department of Justice investigators had met the previous week with the chairman and vice-chairman of Mission’s board who talked “about how much HCA’s efficiency commitment to patient care and sophisticated data analytics impressed them.”

“At the same time” she continued “we have great concerns about how HCA was selected to be the entity that purchased Mission.”

“Here are the facts as we currently understand them” Harrod wrote:

Paulus and Green “steered the process by which other bidders were identified. Mission decided with no outside advice other than Phil Green not to put out a request for bids or hold an auction.”

Green had “a prior business relationship with HCA” that “was never disclosed to the Mission board.”

When Mission’s board members visited HCA headquarters “Dr. Paulus and Mr. Green both thought it was critically important for Mr. Green to attend that meeting to ensure its success.”

“Dr. Paulus coached HCA behind the scenes on how to best present its case to the Mission Board. On two occasions he pointedly told HCA that Mission’s peers were and would favorably consider being acquired by HCA.”

Paulus discussed his continued role with potential buyers. One wanted him to be chief information officer. “Later that partner was dropped from consideration on grounds that appear pretextual to us … Reading his email exchanges with HCA an outside observer could conclude that he was working hard to demonstrate his value to HCA” the memo states. (Just days after the Mission sale closed Paulus announced he was joining HCA as a strategic advisor. Tax records show Paulus received more than $4 million for his final four months at Mission. The terms of his employment agreement with Mission and hisconsulting job with HCA remain unknown. A spokeswoman for HCA’s North Carolina Division said Paulus is no longer a strategic advisor to HCA.)

“Neither the board nor its advisors seems to have given any thought to the fact that certain transaction partners offered Dr. Paulus greater scope for advancement versus others or versus no transaction at all” Harrod wrote.

“In our opinion Dr. Paulus’s conduct violated the Mission conflict of interest policy which requires an officer or board member with even a potential conflict to not merely recuse himself from voting on the matter but also from advocating for an outcome. Dr. Paulus offered to recuse himself but was advised that it was unnecessary. The rationale was that since all of the potential partners wanted Dr. Paulus to continue in some capacity therefore he had no conflict of interest.”

“Just have to trust HCA”

Harrod had already expressed concerns to Mission that the terms outlined in the Letter of Intent (LOI) negotiated by Paulus and Green did not go far enough in protecting the public’s interests.

“Given Mission Health’s strong operating and financial position we believe Mission should be well positioned to negotiate for strong terms to protect public health interests as has been done in other similar transactions” she wrote to Mission officials on Aug. 8 2018.

Philip D. Green Mission’s strategic advisor

Instead on Aug. 30 2018 HCA and Mission signed an official contract called the asset purchase agreement (APA) on terms the attorney general’s office believed favored HCA.

“Dr. Paulus and Mr. Green were principal negotiators of the APA” Harrod wrote in her memo in advance of the Oct. 30 2018 meeting. “It appears to us comparing the terms of the LOI to the terms of the APA HCA improved its position considerably.”

“One of the major inducements for Mission to enter the LOI with HCA was thepromise that hospitals and services would be maintained” Harrod wrote. “We and others advised Mission prior to signing the APA that such commitments needed to be specific and measurable in order to be enforceable.”

“The emails we have seen demonstrate that Dr. Paulus ultimately buckled in the face of resistance from HCA and decided that Mission would just have to trust HCA” she wrote.

Harrod wrote “Even now the board believes that HCA has committed to maintaining the current level of services … even though the APA says no such thing.” For example the agreement allowed HCA to eliminate some services and close facilities if they became “commercially unreasonable” documents show.

Harrod also wrote that “Mission agreed to let HCA use its existing charity care policy even though it appears to us that for most patients they would be much better off under Mission’s policy.” Weeks earlier lawyers for both HCA and Mission had written to Harrod that HCA’s charity care policies were “more generous in most respects” than Mission’s policies.

HCA’s $188 Million Settlement

In January 2017 six months before beginning discussions with Paulus and Green HCA agreed to pay $188 million to settle litigation over its failure to abide by the terms of its purchase of nonprofit Health Midwest hospitals in the Kansas City area a transaction similar to its later deal with Mission Health.

In a letter Sept. 10 2018 Harrod asked Mission senior vice president Donald R. Esposito to “[d]etail the assurances Mission has received that HCA will honor its contractual obligations in light of its failures to do so in connection with its acquisition of Health Midwest.”

In her document for the Oct. 30 2018 meeting Harrod stated: “Despite the experiences of the health care foundation in Missouri Mission agreed to dispute resolution terms that overwhelmingly favor HCA.”

“These are examples not an exclusive list” Harrod concluded.

“The best possible deal”

The attorney general’s investigation intensified over the next two months and included ensuring that Mission’s board knew about Green’s prior business relationship with HCA.

“We requested that the board be fully informed of this relationship and then take another vote on the deal” Brewer the deputy chief of staff told Asheville Watchdog this week. “We also ensured that Mr. Green would not receive any compensation dependent on closing of the transaction including any ‘bonus’ or ‘success fee’ and that neither he nor his company would otherwise benefit from the transaction.”

The Mission board held special sessions Dec. 13 and Dec. 20 2018 and Jan. 8 2019 to discuss final details of the pending deal including the findings of Harrod’s investigation.

In the end Mission Board chairman John R. Ball wrote in a letter to Stein after the Jan. 8 meeting that the board considered the attorney general’s concerns and “concluded that Mission’s management team and its outside advisors were committed at all times to securing for Mission the best possible transaction with potential merger partners ultimately leading to the transaction with HCA.”

“No member of Mission’s management or its advisors took any action or failed to take any action that was detrimental to Mission’s interests” Ball wrote.

The Mission board Ball wrote “believes it has been and remains fully informed with respect to all these issues” and was “steadfast” in its goal to close the sale to HCA. The board’s re-votewas once again unanimous.

Ball could not be reached for comment.

Letter of Non-Objection

In an August 2021 interview with Asheville Watchdog Stein said state law limited his authority to halt the sale despite the information uncovered by his investigation. Because of the law’s restrictions Stein said he sought specific enforceable agreements a number of concessions from HCA and 15 additional conditions to be added to a revised asset purchase agreement.

NC Attorney General Josh Stein

Stein’s conditions included the hiring of an independent monitor to oversee HCA’s compliance with the agreement; enforceable commitments to maintain current levels of service at all six hospitals in the Mission system not for the five years Paulus and Green negotiated in some cases but for 10 years; and requiring HCA to adopt what he viewed as Mission’s more generous charity care obligations.

Stein also got HCA and Mission to agree that the attorney general could enforce the terms of the contract.

On Jan. 16 2019 Mission and HCA agreed to the attorney general’s changes and signed an“amended and restated”asset purchase agreement. Harrod then informed them that the attorney general would not object to the sale.

Green: “Concerns were baseless”

Green declined to speak with Asheville Watchdog but emailed a statement. “The Attorney General after reviewing thousands of pages of documents and conducting an inquiry into ensuring a fair process and the absence of any conflict of interest concluded that any concerns were baseless and wrote a Non-Objection letter” he wrote.

The letter of non-objection written by Harrod actually said the Attorney General’s investigation had identified “potential concerns.” But it said “Mission Health has represented to the Attorney General that … no one on Mission’s board and no one responsible for advising Mission’s board will receive any direct or indirect benefit as a result of the sale of the operating assets of the Mission Nonprofit Entities to HCA.”

Green is still listed as an independent advisor for large healthcare mergers and acquisitions and has a consulting company based in Arlington Virginia. Paulus is still a principal of RAPMD Strategic Advisors based in Asheville.

Harrod who led the investigation into the Mission-HCA sale is no longer with the Attorney General’s office. She declined to comment for this story.

In a statement to Asheville Watchdog last week Brewer Stein’s deputy chief of staff wrote “Under North Carolina law (unlike in many other states) the Attorney General’s authority in these kinds of deals is quite limited” to ensuring a fair purchase price and “that the charitable mission of the non-profit is being carried forward.”

“North Carolina law does not give our Office the general authority to police health care transactions based on how they would impact patients quality of care rural access and other issues” Brewer wrote. “Even though the Attorney General’s legal authority over this type of transaction is quite limited we succeeded in negotiating a number of significant improvements to the agreement.”

“Paying More and Getting Less Care”

HCA officially took control of the Mission system on Feb. 1 2019.

Novantthe lone other bidder that Mission’s board rejected in favor of HCA’s $1.5 billion offer went on to sign a $5 billion deal including $2 billion in cash to acquire a smaller and less profitable hospital in Wilmington.

The Attorney General’s office denied Asheville Watchdog’s request for a comparison of Novant’s and HCA’s offers for Mission citing state statutes that exempt confidential business information from public records requests.

Ashton W. Miller Novant’s manager of public relations declined to comment.

In the statement she prepared for the Oct. 30 2018 meeting with HCA representatives Harrod wrote: “We understand that HCA plans to do further acquisitions in North Carolina. This may not be the last time we are across the table from each other.”

Last week when Asheville Watchdog asked what lessons were learned from the Mission sale Attorney General Stein responded:

“Too often when one hospital swallows up another patients end up paying more and getting worse care. North Carolinians need better safeguards to review transactions to put the patients’ interest first. I’m working with partners in the legislature now to determine how our laws can better protect patients in these health care transactions.”

It’s hard to imagine that our new Memorial Health Dwaine & Cynthia Willett Children’s Hospital of Savannah celebrated its first birthday last week. It seems like only yesterday our pediatric patients were transported from the previous location inside the hospital into the new freestanding facility.

The Children’s Hospital of Savannah has many services you would expect in a major children’s hospital -- an 18-room emergency department four operating rooms a pediatric imaging unit with MRI and CT and more. We have a Level III neonatal intensive care unit located in the main hospital near the labor and delivery unit. Our new facility also has features to help make a family’s stay more comfortable. Last year we provided care for tens of thousands of children in our region.

More about the hospital:Savannah's first free-standing children's hospital opens next week

While the facility still feels very new our commitment to providing exceptional care for kids is not. This month also marks our 30th anniversary. Under the direction of the late Dr. Martin Greenberg The Children’s Hospital at Memorial Medical Center opened on March 20 1992. It was a “hospital within a hospital” on the third floor of the main hospital.

Many of the pediatric specialties available in our region today are here because of the early work of the Children’s Hospital. It offered specialty clinics for kids who needed to see a gastroenterologist endocrinologist or neurologist. In 1993 the Children’s Hospital launched a pediatric hematology/oncology program in Savannah and began offering clinical trials a few years later. Over the years we have added pediatric subspecialists to care for kids here so that families don’t have to travel far from home. Today we have more than 100 pediatric providers including 40 pediatric subspecialists who provide care at the Children’s Hospital of Savannah.

I would like to thank all the physicians and caregivers who have served the Children’s Hospital of Savannah during our 30-year history. I would also like to thank our hospital leaders as well as our parent company HCA Healthcare for their investment in our Children’s Hospital of Savannah.

Finally I would like to thank our patients and families for trusting us with your health care needs. We show up every day to provide the very best care for the children we serve.

There’s a bittersweet battle taking place in Stuarts Draft Virginia.

Workers at the Hershey Company’s second-largest factory are seeking to unionize. In response the candy manufacturing giant is throwing the full force of the corporate union-busting playbook at them.

The Virginia plant employs about 1300 people none of whom are sharing in the record profits reaped during a pandemic when Americans ate their weight in candy.

Hershey now stands accused of mistreating the workers who made that possible. Employees are speaking out about grueling hours company surveillance and harsh retaliation. Some even refer to the factory as the “Hershey Prison.”

One woman named Janice Taylor told the labor outlet More Perfect Union that she had to work for 72 consecutive days. “I was exhausted both physically and mentally” she said.

Other Stuarts Draft workers are leaving reviews of their workplace on Indeed.com reporting that exhausted employees “walk around like zombies.” One says they had to miss their daughter’s graduation because they couldn’t get two hours off. “Most weeks you work seven days and it’s hard to get a day off” another explains. “Really hard if you have a family.”

“You don’t get to have a life” warns another. You just “work until you drop.”

Another common complaint is that Hershey has created a two-tier system at the factory where newer workers are paid less and have significantly fewer benefits.

It’s no wonder the Hershey workers in Stuarts Draft voted to hold union elections to join the Bakery Confectionery Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union (BCTGM). Hershey has vocally opposed the effort holding “captive audience” meetings telling workers to vote against the union and even saying in job listings that Stuarts Draft is a “Non-Union plant.”

The company’s opposition to the union drive is puzzling. Since 1938 workers at Hershey’s original Pennsylvania factory have been unionized under the same union BCTGM Local 464. But Hershey opposes its Virginia workers having similar rights.

The company even created a website WeAreHersheySD.com that tells Stuarts Draft employees that the BCTGM — the same union their Pennsylvania colleagues are members of — is not their “friend.” The website also warns about the possibility of strikes costing employees wages.

The site fails to mention that striking BCTGM workers at Kellogg’s just won a new five-year contract ending the same two-tiered pay system the Stuarts Draft workers want to end.

This Hershey union effort is part of a growing trend among workers at big-name companies like Starbucks and Amazon. A successful unionization vote at one Starbucks location in Buffalo New York has now sparked similar efforts at more than 70 Starbucks stores in 20 states.

Workers in Bessemer Alabama are redoing a union vote that Amazon had illegally interfered in. Even museums like the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Guggenheim are seeing union activity.

And in early February the Biden administration issued a set of recommendations “to promote worker organizing and collective bargaining” — a far cry from the blatantly anti-union posture of Biden’s predecessor.

Hershey enjoys a reputation for being a just company. It runs a private school for low-income children in Pennsylvania. Its CEO Michele Buck has boasted about its commitment to sustainability social responsibility and human rights.

In an online talk last year Buck even said that her company was focused on “the well-being of our employees” including “their emotional well-being and their economic well-being.”

The company’s union-busting shows that talk is just sugarcoating. But if Hershey’s won’t guarantee dignity safety and fairness maybe its workers will do it for them.

The current group of Quips might be its most special yet.

Just three months after making a run to the PIAA Class 4A state football championship the Quips boys' basketball team achieved school history Saturday. Aliquippa defeated South Allegheny 57-55 at Highlands High School to punch its ticket to the PIAA Class 3A state championship game becoming the first group in Aliquippa history to achieve such a feat.

A late driving layup from sophomore point guard Quentin ""Cheese"" Goode proved to be the difference sending the Quips' crowd into a frenzy as time expired filling the air with Hershey kisses and Hershey bars while Aliquippa head coach Nick Lackovich took a moment to soak it all in on the bench.

""It's just been a long hard year for a number of reasons"" Lackovich said reflecting on the moment. ""People doubting my capabilities my credentials or whatever. Maybe I wasn't the right guy for this job ... I don't know. It was just a long hard year a lot of emotions. I'm just so happy for these guys.

""Every kid should be able to experience something like this.""

The current group of Aliquippa athletes is beginning to make it look like a yearly tradition.

Early on it looked as though South Allegheny which knocked Aliquippa out of the WPIAL Class 3A semifinals last season was going to be too much to handle from beyond the arc Saturday. However a takeover from junior Donovan ""DJ"" Walker and some timely buckets in the paint from sophomore Cam Lindsey and Jayace Williams set up Goode's heroics and set off the celebration and the Quips' chant.

""That last play wasn't drawn up for me; it was drawn up for the bigs [Williams and Lindsey]"" Goode said after making the dramatic shot while teammate Brandon Banks Demarkus Walker and Randall Anderson shouted his praise to all who could hear. ""But I saw the shot so I took advantage and made it.""

""Cheese is one of the best point guards around"" Walker said while celebrating a midcourt. ""He's not selfish he takes the right shots and that showed when he drove into the paint to hit that layup.""

Goode's layup prolonged an impressive seven-month stretch for the Quips whose football team rolled through WPIAL Class 4A winning the WPIAL championship and capturing the PIAA championship in December. Those same Quips then went through a battle with the PIAA to remain in Class 4A in football next season all while dominating on the court under Lackovich. The emotion-packed stretch will culminate in a trip to the state finals next Saturday at the Giant Center in Hershey at 2:30 p.m. against the winner of Holy Redeemer-Devon Prep.

""This feels great man. There's a lot of people that we saw that couldn't do this that came before us"" Walker said following the win.

""This group is different; we're athletes"" Goode said. ""This is what we do. We could go and do this in baseball if we wanted to.""

Though the Quips controlled the game throughout thanks to some timely buckets from Walker and some displays of dominance in the paint from Lindsey and Williams South Allegheny stormed back as sophomore Mike Michalski and junior Bryce Epps started hitting tough shots in the paint.

Senior Ethan Kirkwood and senior Dillion Hynes drained some clutch 3-pointers as well to pull the Gladiators even midway through the fourth quarter but it was Walker and Lindsey again coming through in a big spot. Walker hit a pull-up three from well beyond the arc and then turned in a highlight-reel coast-to-coast driving layup while shaking a pair of defenders for the bucket.

Lindsey went to work in the post using his size and strength to his advantage to hit some big shots while Williams came up with a timely putback as well following the gameplan Lackovich put into place at the half causing the Quips to take advantage in the paint.

""We knew we had their bigs in some precarious foul trouble so we knew we were going to go right at them"" Lackovich said. ""I'm super proud of Cam. The way he posted up got the ball went to the rim and finished was just unreal.""

""I had a few buckets in the first half that I was able to create some good shots so we were just trying to create some mismatches and attack from there"" Lindsey said.

Lindsey came through in the clutch late with Aliquippa trying to get one more defensive stop. The sophomore who already has football scholarship offers to Pitt Penn State and West Virginia leaped high in the far corner to block a 3-point attempt from Epps sending the ball out of bounds with 2.2 seconds left.

From there the Quips got one more stop as Williams played tight defense on Michalski cutting to the hoop deflecting the pass to Walker who threw the ball to the other end as time expired setting off a frenzied celebration.

At the state championship game Aliquippa will look to join General McLane (2006-07) Jeannette (2007-08) with two-sport star Terrelle Pryor Steelton-Highspire (2007-08) and Archbishop Wood (2016-17) as the only schools to win football and boys basketball state championships in the same school year.

""These guys are very aware of the history throughout the program here at Aliquippa"" Lackovich said. ""They want to be great man. They want to be the same team that won a state championship in football and basketball in the same year. We've had plenty that would win one or the other but they're aware of that.

""Not that day in day out we think about that but they're aware of that. They want to be great; that's what drives these guys. They want to be great.""

Greatness is now just one step away for this Aliquippa group of athletes.

Proceeds from the benefit luncheon go to help the nonprofit organization fulfill its mission of inspiring ""girls to be joyful healthy and confident using a fun experience-based curriculum that creatively integrates running.""

The after-school development program for girls in third through fifth grades has been in Northwest Arkansas since 2004. Heart & Sole is offered for sixth- to eighth-grade girls.

The 10-week curriculum consists of three parts -- understanding themselves valuing relationships and teamwork and how they connect and shape the world. Each team develops and carries out a community service project.

Amenda Lacy marketing director tells me: ""In the past calendar year we have delivered the program to 300 girls on 23 teams at 19 sites. Over 70% of girls receive scholarship assistance.

""This year in honor of Women's History Month Hershey's and Girls on the Run partnered to celebrate the inspiring women and girls in our lives. We are grateful for the ongoing local support that we receive from Hershey's and are thrilled to #celebrateSHE"" Lacy adds.

The nonprofit organization recognized its founding executive director Suzanne Clinard for her leadership of the group. Clinard retired this past year. Andrew Winkler volunteer coach told guests: ""As a leader Suzanne has been a shining model -- leading joyfully helpfully and with confidence. She was front-line and hands-on in every facet of the program.""

EvaMarie Duncan former ""GOTR Girl"" and current coach shared with those gathered the impact the program she started in third grade had on her. ""I learned the values of perseverance teamwork and positive self-talk -- especially as a girl with big dreams."" She added that participating in Girls on the Run ""laid the foundation to live a healthy and positive lifestyle and played a major role in me realizing my limitless potential.""

The day's program also included a fireside chat with Andrea Albright Walmart executive vice president for global sourcing led by Jaclyn House master of ceremonies. Topics covered included inclusion potential barriers to female leadership and the importance of mentors and sponsors.

Those gathering with GOTR included Katelyn Ishee Jessica DuQuesne Jon Davis Katie Duncan Jill Fenton Beth Brown Katrina Hostetler Bianca Femia Emi Cardarelli Jessica Willis Ryan Longo Justin Robertson Cathy Chen Matt Richie Mariana Carvajal Jill Fenton and Lauren Chamberlain.

And that understanding and planning around consumer motivations or desires gives a better sense of the true competition. Does this hypothesis resonate with you and how do you address it from a brand standpoint?

The market is constantly shifting and we are shifting to lead the market. This all boils down to understanding and addressing a customer’s needs and problems which is something we obsess over. You can’t let traditional definitions define your business. You must understand not just what challenges customers have today but what they will have tomorrow.

This is also why traditional categories often can become dated. The market is changing too fast for the naming conventions to keep up. We’ve been working with analysts and others to help them understand the category we pioneered – edge-to-cloud.

If you follow the customer it often leads you to undefined places. And that leads to new solutions and new categories. That’s what’s happening today. We’re hearing from customers who can’t easily move everything to public cloud and that are tied to a data center or edge. They are looking for a new solution a cloud that comes to where the majority of their apps and data are today. But there is not a defined category for this segment. So when you innovate to solve these kinds of new problems you are creating new markets and categories because we continue to evolve to bring a new kind of experience to them.

We are a long way from when we used to view our competitors based on scale. That just no longer works and we have to entirely reset our thinking. We are always looking at smaller players the disruptive players who have built powerful services often based on a cloud model. Disruptors can emerge seemingly out of nowhere so it’s critical that we don’t have a myopic view of the landscape.

Customer expectations are driving a huge shift in our engagement model. We’re shifting from a classic transactional selling motion to an outcome-based consultative approach. Customer business models are changing at incredible speed we need to understand those challenges so we can deliver the right solutions with a simple experience. Additionally we’re building out the enablement curriculum to support our sellers and bringing together the solution stacks to get that outcome-based dialogue kickstarted.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vbG9zYWxhbW9zcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMTkvbGFubC1jaGljb21hLXN1cGVyY29tcHV0ZXItYWlkcy1jb3ZpZC0xOS1yZXNlYXJjaC1hbmQtb3Blbi1zY2llbmNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LANL: Chicoma Supercomputer Aids COVID-19 Research And Open Science,"Carolyn Connor LANL’s interim IC program manager and Alden Stradling at the terminal with Cory Leuinghoener looking on.

LANL NEWS RELEASE

For the past year scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory have used the Laboratory’s newest and highest performing institutional supercomputer Chicoma to grapple with critical questions delivering high-impact research results in support of the nation’s response to COVID-19. Initially funded by the DOE Office of Science Chicoma has recently been upgraded with next-generation general-purpose graphics processing units making it even more capable for expanded workloads in both data and computational science.

“Through the efforts of our High Performance Computing group and our research scientists Chicoma has already contributed to understanding and combating COVID at the local national and international level” said Irene Qualters associate Laboratory director for Simulation and Computing. “Now as new research teams get underway we look forward to stimulating additional technology innovation while enabling new scientific understanding through advances in computational modeling simulation and machine learning.”

Beginning in December 2021 Laboratory scientists and engineers launched an impressive portfolio of 75 projects for 2022. Chosen through the Laboratory’s Institutional Computing (IC) Program’s annual competitive peer-reviewed process the research projects encompass applied machine learning artificial intelligence astrophysics climate modeling fluid dynamics HIV nanotechnology wildfire simulation and national security science to list but a few.

For example one project will consider computational structure-based strategies to vaccine design led by Gnana Gnanakaran a biophysicist in the Laboratory’s Theoretical division. The approaches to vaccine design explored by the project could point the way to protection again the known range of diversity found in the coronaviruses including SARS- CoV-1 SARS-CoV-2 and MERS.

“Ultimately the research we’re able to carry out on Chicoma will help us prepare for future pandemics of coronavirus zoonotic infections” said Gnanakaran.

The crown jewel of Institutional Computing

Chicoma is one of five high performance computing systems available to Los Alamos scientists and engineers (students included) through the Lab’s IC program for unclassified work. Each system is tailored to a specific class of workloads. However Chicoma is unique both in the capabilities that it offers and its forward technical look.

“Chicoma is the first system specifically designed to offer multiple architectures within a single large platform” Carolyn Connor interim IC program manager said. “Chicoma’s flexible compute environment including large-scale platform architectural diversity and node capability make it valuable for a wide range of scientific problems of interest to the Laboratory.”

Chicoma is among the earliest deployments anywhere of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s new HPE Cray EX supercomputer architecture for solving complex scientific problems. The HPE Cray EX offers a large-scale system architecture employing AMD processors with a next-generation system software stack direct-to-chip liquid cooling capabilities and a newly designed high-speed HPE Slingshot interconnect. In total Chicoma offers more than 79000 cores 300 terabytes of system memory and access to A100 Tensor Core graphics processing units (GPUs) making it by far the Lab’s highest performing institutional supercomputer.

Smoother upgrade experience fewer workload disruptions

Chicoma also features innovative system administration and management software.

Chicoma is among the earliest large-scale production deployments using HPE Cray System Management (CSM) a more efficient and radically different system management model that enables transparent software updates fixes and system refinements which translates to higher system availability for IC’s open science user community.

“While the user environment will retain a familiar look and feel administrators will be able to use continuous integration techniques to safely upgrade patch and refine the system while user jobs are running and roll out updates and fixes transparently” said Sam Sanchez Chicoma transition lead. “We plan to incorporate CSM in all future systems. The software and hardware environments the configuration management and how we provision the system make CSM a major advancement in systems management.”

Stepping stone to future computing capability: Venado

Chicoma positions the Laboratory’s users system designers and infrastructure for the next more capable IC system Venado.

To be deployed to early users in 2023 and generally available in early 2024 Venado is a codesign technology partnership between the Laboratory Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Nvidia. It will employ the same HPE Cray EX technology platform with Slingshot interconnect and Cray Programming Environment as Chicoma but the processing power will increase significantly with Nvidia’s next-generation (ARM-based) Grace CPU and Nvidia ANext GPUs.

“Chicoma is a powerful resource and a stepping stone to future technologies aligned with our longer-term computing strategy” said Qualters. “Chicoma provides Los Alamos scientists with state-of-the-art supercomputing capability and positions our researchers and applications to easily adopt the next generation of leading-edge computers.”

Real COVID-19 research performed on Chicoma out of the box

When the Lab completed the installation of Chicoma in 2020 the early user period was unlike the typical testing period for a new supercomputer.

“Typically Los Alamos HPC early platform users who include researchers domain scientists programmers and support staff push the boundary of newly deployed cutting-edge hardware and software” said Ben Santos team leader for High Performance Computing Consultants HPC Workload Management and HPC Account Processing teams. “We work closely with vendors to stabilize the platform by running real applications and using real user workflows to verify the system stability and reliability.”

But with Chicoma it went beyond those typical exercises. In addition to the usual expectations for early users and HPC staff when standing up a new computing system Chicoma’s early users were laser-focused on producing impactful COVID-19 research immediately to help in the fight against the global pandemic.

“Our early users were thrilled with their experience their access to fast computational resources with large amounts of memory and the research results that Chicoma enabled” said Lena Lopatina staff scientist.

Some of the early user team leads and projects included COVID-19 epidemiological modeling and forecasting analyzing the impacts of COVID-19 on human 4D chromosome structures and functions and exploring bioinformatics for COVID-19. Tim Germann a researcher in the Laboratory’s Theoretical Division ran large-scale computer simulations on Chicoma resulting in a presentation at the American Physical Society’s March 2021 meeting. His modeling predicted the effects of social distancing relaxation and reinfection probability on the progression of the pandemic measured by the number of newly symptomatic cases per day for 2021.

Using Chicoma Germann’s team also studied the effects of varying vaccination rates and vaccine efficacy against novel variants on the progression of the pandemic as measured by the number of newly symptomatic cases per day for 2021. In April 2021 he presented the findings at the White House COVID Data Strategy and Execution Workgroup. This presentation offered various models of the COVID-19 pandemic progression including social distancing relaxation dates vaccine efficacy against novel variants increased vaccine availability and decreased vaccine hesitancy both at national and state levels.

Funding: The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) supported infrastructure and personnel and the Department of Energy’s Office of Science Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) program under a line item of the 2020 Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act provided for the initial installment of advanced computing hardware.

Location

Other than being a hotel owned directly by Universal Studios it’s hard to get much closer than this to the eponymous theme park. Close to the interstate the DoubleTree by Hilton at the Entrance of Universal Studios (“Double Tree Orlando” going forward) is exactly that. In fact guests staying at the property can actually walk to parks using an elevated walkway over the street. All three Universal Orlando Resort parks are easily accessible by the pathway: Universal’s Islands of Adventure Universal Studios Florida and Universal’s Volcano Bay though the last (a water park) is farthest away.

This property offers ample parking; self-parking costs $23/nightly valet is $29/nightly.

Property

This mega property spans two towers and ancillary buildings that include dining a convention center and a large amount of meeting space. Between the towers and these other facilities is a courtyard with a water feature outdoor fires and several seating options for solo travelers and groups alike.

The standard features of a property this size include a fitness center several on-site restaurants Universal Studios and car rental reservation desks a convenience and gift store an ice cream parlor an on-site Starbucks a massive swimming pool hot tubs and a water play area for children.

As this property is not an official Universal hotel some benefits like those at owned properties (Loews Royal Pacific Resort Hard Rock Hotel Loews Sapphire Falls Resort Surfside Inn and Suites etc.) are unavailable. Early Park Admission is only permitted by guests holding an annual pass or staying with a Universal Orlando property. Universal Express Unlimited passes (skip the rides) are available for some but not all of the aforementioned properties each of which costs more than double this property; readers are recommended to just buy the pass independently if it’s of interest.

Diamond Suite Upgrade and Benefits

As with most Hilton Orlando properties we have encountered my Diamond Honors benefits were granted and the staff – from the bellhop to management – was incredibly gracious. Due to changes in the Honors program stays in the United States now receive a food and beverage credit rather than included breakfast. We used our credit for evening snacks and Starbucks coffee but I was able to photograph the breakfast buffet in the restaurant which I will show below.

Suite

We were also upgraded to an unbelievable corner suite complete with dining room living room wet bar and guest bathroom all of which more than tripled the space of a standard guest room. This room was far and away one of the largest Orlando hotel suites we have received and will be one of the main reasons we will return to the property even in the event we don’t get upgraded on future visits.

Living Room

The suite has two entrances one opens to the living room which felt large enough to play a regulation hockey game (sans ice.)

In addition to the living room the suite featured a wet bar an entrance sitting area a living room with a couch and chairs across from a TV as well as a full six-seat dining room.

This suite was ideal for those hosting a group or business function. For our purposes we were traveling with family members staying in another suite (had we known we would have received a Diamond upgrade this good they could have easily stayed on the pull-out couch in the living room.)

Bottles of water were stocked and an empty mini-fridge was great for our snacks.

The dining room table at the far corner of the room provided plenty of space for in-room dining using our daily food and beverage credit as well as evening games of cards.

The floor-to-ceiling windows huge L-shaped couch and ottoman let my family stretch out away from our bedroom. The veiw outside the windows was of the parking lot and then the entrance road to Universal Studios. An elevated walkway makes the parks walkable though the distance is considerable especially given the amount of walking most do in the park during a given day.

Bedroom

The bedroom appeared to be in line with what most guests should expect for a standard bedroom. It was clean and modern recently renovated and had good access to power ports near the bed. Opposite our pair of queen beds was a desk sufficient for two laptops a dresser for longer stays and a large flatscreen TV.

Bathroom(s)

The suite had a guest bathroom (with shower) in the living room suite. This is an optimal situation families staying with guests or those who are hosting meetings with co-workers.

The separation between personal and guest space is priceless. Other than being separate the bathroom was equipped the same as the master suite bathroom allowing two separate showers for families getting to the parks late – I’m not pointing any fingers.

The master bath is identical and en suite.

Value

During our stay we were fortunate to be able to travel mid-week and achieve a nightly room rate of about $120-140 on average. Stays during peak travel periods like Spring Break (March to mid-April) around major holidays and most of the summer (late May to early September) will likely incur higher nightly charges.

Point redemption costs during our stay ranged from 30000/night to 40000 Hilton Honors points. With Hilton each fifth night is free which can lower the overall average if paying with points. The value for our specific stay was 0.45¢/point slightly higher than the average Hilton Honors redemption rate of 0.4¢/point.

While the rate was better in this case when utilizing points it’s not such an outsized value that I’d insist using points. If you have a mountain of points or are staying five nights it’s a reasonable redemption. However other Hilton properties might warrant a better use of points than this particular hotel.

At a $120-140/night the hotel is an excellent value – especially if you’re able to score an upgrade due to status like we did.

Guests visiting other parks in Orlando Florida can still make the Double Tree Orlando their home during their stay without creating a substantial imposition. For example SeaWorld Orlando parks (both a water park and the theme park) is just a nine-minute drive down I-4 (though at high traffic periods this could be longer.) Disney is a farther distance for some parks.

After winning her fifth Hologic WTA Tour singles title of her career and her second consecutive title Swiatek will rise to a new career-high position of World No.2 in Monday’s upcoming singles rankings.

Swiatek is the first Polish woman to claim the title at Indian Wells surpassing the result by 2014 BNP Paribas Open runner-up Agnieszka Radwanska. Swiatek will also tie former World No.2 Radwanska as the highest-ranked Polish player in history.

Spotless Swiatek: With the win Swiatek becomes the first woman to reach 20 match-wins this season. Swiatek’s victory also marks her career-best 11th straight win on the Hologic WTA Tour with that streak coming at the first two 1000-level events of the season. Swiatek won the title last month at the WTA 1000 Qatar TotalEnergies Open in Doha.

With her 80-minute win over Sakkari Swiatek continues to steamroll through championship matches. In her past five finals all of which she won Swiatek has dropped only a combined 16 games. Sunday's 6-4 6-1 score line is the same as it was in her 2020 Roland Garros final where she won her first career title.

Swiatek had gone 0-3 in her first three meetings against Sakkari all coming in 2021. But since then the Pole has won their last two encounters during her title runs in Doha and Indian Wells this season.

Words from the champion: ""At the beginning of the tournament I wouldn't even think about winning honestly"" Swiatek said in her post-match press conference. ""Of course you have to believe in yourself but I'm a realistic person.

""Winning after playing so well in Doha is giving me a lot of confidence and kind of belief that I can do it. ... I wouldn't think of myself as someone who's ready to play two tournaments in a row and win it. For sure hard work is paying off.

""[Sakkari and I are] stepping a similar path looking at rankings and looking at what we've been playing for the last couple of years. Paula Badosa Anett [Kontaveit] and Ons Jabeur I don't want to forget anybody but I think we kind of started playing Top 10 tennis at the same time.

""[The World No.2 ranking is] pretty surreal for now. I have to look at it and I have to check the rankings by myself and just see it. Right now it's too surreal to describe it honestly. ... But for sure I want to go higher because I feel like getting No. 1 is closer and closer.""

Sakkari surging: Sakkari reached her first 1000-level final and will improve to a new career-high ranking Monday as well rising to World No.3. She will match current ATP pro Stefanos Tsitsipas’s career-high ranking of No.3 tying him for the highest-ranked Greek player in history female or male.

""I can't believe there's only two girls above me right now"" Sakkari said after the final. ""Whoever followed my steps the last couple of years they know what that means to me.

""I'm very proud that myself and Stefanos have actually grown tennis in Greece. Having two players in that ranking position is something huge for us. I'm going to say it again but I'm very proud of myself this week.""

More from Sakkari: ""I took a step forward this week""

Tale of the match: Returners had the advantage on a gusty day in Indian Wells with six of the first seven games going against serve. However Swiatek got a handle on returning the Sakkari second serve where she won 14 of 16 points in that set. Swiatek used that to her advantage in the final game breaking for the one-set lead.

Sakkari fended off two break points in the second game of the second set and the Greek used strong forehand returns in the following game to push Swiatek to three deuces. But Swiatek battled her way to a hold for 2-1 and from there the Pole began to race through the rest of the match.

Combining outstanding deep groundstrokes with excellent defending Swiatek survived the blustery conditions winning the final five games of the match to take the champion’s trophy. Swiatek notched six service breaks on the day to triumph in the Top 10 showdown.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Why aren't more of them doing it?,"CNN —

As the US attempts to wean itself off its heavy reliance on fossil fuels and shift to cleaner energy sources many experts are eyeing a promising solution: your neighborhood big-box stores and shopping malls.

The rooftops and parking lot space available at retail giants like Walmart Target and Costco is massive. And these largely empty spaces are being touted as untapped potential for solar power that could help the US reduce its dependency on foreign energy slash planet-warming emissions and save companies millions of dollars in the process.

At the IKEA store in Baltimore installing solar panels on the roof and over the store’s parking lot cut the amount of energy it needed to purchase by 84% slashing its costs by 57% from September to December of 2020 according to the company. (The panels also provide some beneficial shade to keep customers’ cars cool on hot sunny days.)

As of February 2021 IKEA had 54 solar arrays installed across 90% of its US locations.

Big-box stores and shopping centers have enough roof space to produce half of their annual electricity needs from solar according to a report from nonprofit Environment America and research firm Frontier Group.

Leveraging the full rooftop solar potential of these superstores would generate enough electricity to power nearly 8 million average homes the report concluded and would cut the same amount of planet-warming emissions as pulling 11.3 million gas-powered cars off the road.

The average Walmart store for example has 180000 square feet of rooftop according to the report. That’s roughly the size of three football fields and enough space to support solar energy that could power the equivalent of 200 homes the report said.

“Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them” Johanna Neumann senior director for Environment America’s campaign for 100% Renewable told CNN. “Now is the time to lean into local renewable energy production and there’s no better place than the roofs of America’s big-box superstores.”

Judson Jones CNN

Advocates involved in clean energy worker-training programs tell CNN that a solar revolution in big-box retail would also be a significant windfall for local communities spurring economic growth while tackling the climate crisis which has inflicted disproportionate harm on marginalized communities.

Yet only a fraction of big-box stores in the US have solar on their rooftops or solar canopies in parking lots the report’s authors told CNN.

CNN reached out to five of the top US retailers — Walmart Kroger Home Depot Costco and Target — to ask: Why not invest in more rooftop solar?

Many renewable energy experts point to solar as a relatively simple solution to cut down on costs and help rein in fossil fuel emissions but the companies point to several roadblocks — regulations labor costs and structural integrity of the rooftops themselves — that are preventing more widespread adoption.

The need for these kinds of clean energy initiatives is becoming “unquestionably urgent” as the climate crisis accelerates said Edwin Cowen professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University.

“We are behind the eight ball to put it mildly” Cowen told CNN. “I would have loved to see policy help incentivize rooftop solar 15 years ago instead of five years ago in the commercial space. There’s still a tremendous amount of work to do.”

What’s the holdup?

Neumann said Walmart the nation’s largest retailer possesses by far the largest solar potential. Walmart has around 5000 stores in the US and more than 783 million square feet of rooftop space — an area larger than Manhattan — and more than 8974 gigawatt hours of annual rooftop solar potential according to the report.

It’s enough electricity to power more than 842000 homes the report said.

“Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them.” Johanna Neumann Environment America

Walmart spokesperson Mariel Messier told CNN the company is involved in renewable energy projects around the world but many of them are not rooftop solar installations. The company has reported having completed on- and off-site wind and solar projects or had others under development with a capacity to produce more than 2.3 gigawatts of renewable energy.

Neumann said Environment America has met with Walmart a few times urging the retailer to commit to installing solar panels on roofs and in parking lots. The company has said it’s aiming to source 100% of its energy through renewable projects by 2035.

“Of all the retailers in America Walmart stands to make the biggest impact if they put rooftop solar on all of their stores” Neumann told CNN. “And for us this report just underscores just how much of an impact they could make if they make that decision.”

According to Environment America Walmart had installed almost 194 megawatts of solar capacity on its US facilities as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year and additional capacity in off-site solar farms. The company’s installations in California were expected to provide between 20% to 30% of each location’s electricity needs.

Target ranked No. 1 for on-site solar capacity in 2019 according to industry trade group Solar Energy Industries Association’s most recent report. It currently has 542 locations with rooftop solar — around a quarter of the company’s stores — a Target spokesperson told CNN. Rooftop solar generates enough energy to meet 15% to 40% of Target properties’ energy needs the spokesperson said.

Richard Galanti the chief financial officer at Costco said the company has 121 stores with rooftop solar around the world 95 of which are in the US.

Walmart Target and Costco did not share with CNN what their biggest barriers are to adding rooftop or parking lot solar panels to more stores.

“My suspicion is that they want an even stronger business case for deviating from business-as-usual” Neumann said. “Historically all those roofs have done is cover their stores and rethinking how [they] use their buildings and thinking of them as energy generators not just protection from rain requires a small change in their business model.”

Home Depot which has around 2300 stores currently has 75 completed rooftop solar projects 12 in construction and more than 30 planned for future development said Craig D’Arcy the company’s director of energy management. Solar power generates around half of these stores’ energy needs on average he said.

Aging rooftops at stores are a “huge impediment” to solar installation D’Arcy added. If a roof needs to be replaced in the next 15 to 20 years or sooner it doesn’t make financial sense for Home Depot to add solar systems today he said.

“We have a goal of implementing solar rooftop where the economics are attractive” D’Arcy told CNN.

CNN also reached out to Kroger which owns about 2800 stores across the US. Kristal Howard a Kroger spokesperson said the company currently has 15 properties — stores distribution centers and manufacturing plants — with solar installations. One of the “multiple factors affecting the viability of a solar installation” was the stores’ ability to support a solar installation on the roofs Howard said.

Cowen the engineering professor at Cornell said solar is already attractive but that labor costs incentives and the different layers of regulation likely pose some financial challenges in solar installations.

“For them this means usually hiring a local site firm that can do that installation that also knows local policy” Cowen said. “It’s just another layer of complexity that I think is beginning to make sense because the costs have come down enough but it needs kind of reopening that door of getting into an existing building.”

Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois who co-chairs the power sector task force in the House said the US has “failed to provide the incentives to people who have the expertise to go in and build these things.” The reason both retail companies and the power sector have not made much progress on solar is because “our system is so disjointed” and has a complex regulation structure Casten said.

“Why aren’t we doing something that makes economic sense? The answer is this horribly disjointed federal policy where we massively subsidize fossil energy extraction and we penalize clean energy production” Casten told CNN. “For a long long time if you wanted to build a solar panel on the rooftop of Walmart your biggest enemy was going to be your local utility because they didn’t want to lose the load.

“We could have done this decades ago” Casten added. “And had we done it we would not be in this dire position with the climate but we’d also have a lot more money in our pocket.”

Acting on climate equitably

For Charles Callaway director of organizing at the nonprofit group WE ACT for Environmental Justice strengthening the rooftop solar capacity in big box retail stores is a no-brainer especially if companies allow the local community to reap benefits either through installation jobs or sharing the electricity produced later.

Either way it would put a massive dent in curbing the climate crisis and help usher in an equitable transition away from fossil fuels — and it’s doable Callaway told CNN.

The New York City resident led a worker training program that helped train more than 100 local community members mostly people of color to become solar installers. He also formed a solar workers cooperative to ensure many of the participants of the training program get jobs in a tough market.

In the last two years Callaway said his group has not only installed solar panels on roofs of affordable housing units but also equipment capable of producing 2 megawatts of solar energy on shopping malls up in upstate New York. He emphasized that hiring locally would be most beneficial since local installers know the community and local regulations best.

“One of my huge concerns is social equity” Cowen said. “Access to renewable energy is a fairly privileged position these days and we’ve got to figure out ways to make that not true.”

Jasmine Graham WE ACT’s energy justice policy manager said the potential of building rooftop solar on big box superstores is encouraging only “if these projects use local labor if they are paying prevailing wages and if this solar is being used in a manner such as community solar which would allow [utility] bill discounts for folks that live in the same utility zone.”

Pressure is mounting for global leaders to act urgently on the climate crisis after a UN report in late February warned the window for action is rapidly closing.

Neumann believes the US can meet its energy demand with renewables. All it takes she said is the political will to make that switch and the inclusion of the local community so no one gets left behind in the transition.

“The sooner we make that transition the sooner we’ll have cleaner air the sooner we’ll have a more protected environment and better health and the sooner we’ll have a more livable future for our kids” Neumann said. “And even if that requires investment it is an investment worth making.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbGVtbmV3cy5uZXQvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDMvaG9taWNpZGUtZm91bmQtYXQtZGVwb3Qtcm9hZC1ob21lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Homicide found at Depot Road home | News Sports Jobs,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.salemnews.net/news/local-news/2022/03/homicide-found-at-depot-road-home/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbGVtbmV3cy5uZXQvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDMvaG9taWNpZGUtZm91bmQtYXQtZGVwb3Qtcm9hZC1ob21lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2pvaG4tZm9zdGVyLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMzNzAwNDI00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Foster Obituary - Griffin - Hillcrest Funeral Home - 2022,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/john-foster-obituary?id=33700424 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2pvaG4tZm9zdGVyLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMzNzAwNDI00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53c2JyYWRpby5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9wb2xpY2UtYXJyZXN0LXRlZW5hZ2VyLW11cmRlci0xNy15ZWFyLW9sZC1ib3ktY2l0eS1zd2ltbWluZy1wb29sL0ZaQ0JTSTJSTkpFUFRKV1BaQ0dHTFRCS1pJL9IBjwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53c2JyYWRpby5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9wb2xpY2UtYXJyZXN0LXRlZW5hZ2VyLW11cmRlci0xNy15ZWFyLW9sZC1ib3ktY2l0eS1zd2ltbWluZy1wb29sL0ZaQ0JTSTJSTkpFUFRKV1BaQ0dHTFRCS1pJLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Police arrest teenager for murder of 17-year-old boy at city swimming pool,"We’re Sorry!

Saturday would’ve been your chance.

Mitchell Main Street & Beyond took over the Corn Palace on Saturday afternoon for their annual Wingapalooza event bringing a variety of traditional and unusual flavors of chicken wings to the plates of event-goers.

Before the doors opened at 1 p.m. a panel of judges got the first crack at wings from six different vendors that entered the contest. Each vendor prepared about 1000 wings and each prepared them with between one and three different flavors.

For $20 patrons received 12 tickets good for one wing each plus a voting ticket that served as a vote for their favorite.

Booths representing Alvine Law/Pirogues Coborn’s The Depot Moose Lodge Scoreboard and Team Brock/Poet offered 17 flavors of wings ranging from Parmesan garlic to Asian inferno.

Ashley Endres director of Mitchell Main Street & Beyond the organization behind the event said she’s glad so many people came to Saturday’s event.

“It was the first time for me hosting the event and coming off of two years of not having had the event (at the Corn Palace) I didn’t know what to expect” Endres said. “I was hoping for a decent crowd and those who did come seemed to enjoy it. I felt like it was a good event with all the other events in the community going on.”

Though official attendance numbers weren’t immediately available Endres estimated about 500 people showed up — but not all came to eat.

In addition to the wings Porter Distributors set up a beer trailer featuring specially brewed beer from Yankton’s Ben’s Brewing. Their Cash Flow IPA and Dakota Thirst honey lager which were a hit with the crowd were brewed in celebration of First Dakota National Bank’s 150th year of business.

In addition to the extra consumables Connect Mitchell set up a ‘wingo’ game offering Mitchell swag and cash prizes to participants. At two cards for one dollar the bingo games raised $325 that went back into the pockets of winners. The final game’s winner who managed to black out their bingo card won $200.

On the stage was also a round of Chicken Poop Roulette which raised $1140 in squares purchased. With a chicken in a cage event-goers would purchase a square to place a bet on where the chicken would poop.

The winner of Chicken Poop Roulette won $400 while $370 was donated to Mitchell Area Youth Shooters and the same amount funneled back to Mitchell Main Street & Beyond.

“The crowd was all throughout the Corn Palace. (Wingo and Chicken Poop Roulette) was a great thing to bring in” Endres said. “I don’t know if we’ve ever done bingo games before but I think that both games were a huge addition.”

Endres said Wingapalooza will return next year likely in March 2023. For now Mitchell Main Street & Beyond are gearing up for their Ladies’ Day Out on April 30 and their first First Fridays on Main coming up on May 6."

Despite a slight dip in net income the company maintains a strong balance sheet with increased EBITDAre.

Strategic divestitures and a focus on luxury and upper-upscale hotels position Host for competitive advantage.

Recent acquisitions signal a forward-looking growth strategy amidst a challenging economic landscape.

On May 3 2024 Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) a premier owner of luxury and upper-upscale hotels reported its first-quarter financial results through the 10-Q filing. The company's portfolio predominantly located in the United States consists of 77 properties with a strong presence under the Marriott and Starwood brands.

Operating profit surged by 17.3% and the operating profit margin under GAAP improved by 180 basis points to 19.8%. Adjusted EBITDAre also saw an 8.8% increase indicating a solid operational performance. The company's strategic divestitures of its interests in European and Asian joint ventures along with other U.S. properties reflect a focused approach to optimizing its portfolio.

Decoding Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (HST): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power and Portfolio Quality: Host Hotels & Resorts Inc's strength lies in its high-quality portfolio of luxury and upper-upscale hotels primarily operating under the prestigious Marriott and Starwood brands. This association with renowned brands enhances the company's market presence and customer loyalty. The strategic focus on urban and resort properties in key markets positions Host to capitalize on high-demand segments driving revenue per available room (RevPAR) and maintaining a competitive edge.

Financial Robustness: The company's financial health is underscored by its strong balance sheet and revenue growth. The 6.5% increase in total revenues and the expansion of the operating profit margin reflect efficient cost management and an ability to drive top-line growth. The 13.5% increase in EBITDAre further demonstrates Host's operational efficiency and its capacity to generate cash flow which is crucial for reinvestment and shareholder returns.

Strategic Asset Management: Host's recent divestitures and acquisitions indicate a proactive asset management strategy. By selling off non-core assets and investing in strategic properties such as the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown Host is refining its portfolio to focus on high-potential markets and properties that align with its growth objectives.

Weaknesses

Net Income Decline: Despite revenue growth Host Hotels & Resorts Inc experienced a 6.5% decrease in net income in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decline may raise concerns among investors regarding the company's ability to translate revenue increases into net profit consistently. It is essential for Host to analyze the underlying causes such as potential increases in operating expenses or one-time charges and address them to ensure sustained profitability.

Dependence on Brand Partners: The company's significant reliance on Marriott and Starwood brands while a strength also poses a risk. Changes in the relationship with these brand partners or shifts in their strategic direction could impact Host's operations and market positioning. Diversifying its brand portfolio could mitigate this dependence and spread operational risk.

Impact of Strategic Shifts: The recent sale of international joint venture interests and other U.S. properties may lead to short-term disruptions and a potential loss of revenue from those assets. Host must manage these transitions effectively to ensure that the long-term benefits of these strategic moves outweigh the immediate impacts.

Opportunities

Market Recovery and Demand Growth: As the economy recovers from the pandemic and travel demand rebounds Host Hotels & Resorts Inc is well-positioned to benefit from increased occupancy and average daily rates. The company's focus on luxury and upper-upscale hotels which are expected to see a faster recovery presents an opportunity to capture a larger market share and drive revenue growth.

Strategic Acquisitions: Host's recent acquisitions demonstrate its ability to identify and capitalize on strategic growth opportunities. The company's strong balance sheet and access to capital allow it to pursue further acquisitions enhancing its portfolio and geographic diversity and positioning it for long-term growth.

Operational Excellence: Host's operational efficiency as evidenced by its improved EBITDAre provides an opportunity to further optimize costs and enhance profitability. Continued focus on operational excellence can lead to sustained improvements in margins and cash flow generation.

Threats

Economic Uncertainty: The potential for an economic recession coupled with high inflation and rising interest rates poses a threat to the hospitality industry. Host Hotels & Resorts Inc must navigate these macroeconomic challenges which could impact travel demand and the company's financial performance.

Geopolitical Risks: Geopolitical tensions and international conflicts can affect global travel patterns and have a direct impact on Host's operations. The company must remain vigilant and adaptable to mitigate the effects of such external risks on its business.

Competition and Market Saturation: The luxury and upper-upscale hotel segments are highly competitive with new entrants and existing players vying for market share. Host must continue to innovate and differentiate its offerings to maintain its competitive position in a potentially saturated market.

In conclusion Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) presents a strong financial and strategic profile with robust revenue growth a high-quality portfolio and a proactive approach to asset management. However the company must address the decline in net income manage its brand partner dependencies and

Additional detail on the Company’s results including data for 22 domestic markets is available in the First Quarter 2024 Supplemental Financial Information on the Company’s website at www.hosthotels.com.



James F. Risoleo President and Chief Executive Officer said “Host delivered comparable hotel Total RevPAR growth of 0.5% over the first quarter of 2023 which is impressive given the challenging comparison of the prior year. Banquet revenues led our performance driven by improvements in group business and continued strong demand in food and beverage. In addition we delivered net income of $272 million a decline of 6.5% compared to the first quarter of 2023 and Adjusted EBITDAre of $483 million an 8.8% improvement over the first quarter of 2023. At the same time comparable hotel RevPAR declined 1.2% as a result of tough comparisons the impact of Maui and unseasonable weather in many markets that impacted short term leisure demand.”

Risoleo continued “Subsequent to quarter end we acquired the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown underscoring the strength of our balance sheet and our strategic approach to capital allocation. This two-hotel complex further improves the quality of our portfolio and establishes a meaningful presence for Host in a top performing market. As a result of the acquisition additional business interruption insurance gains and improving out-of-room spend we kept our net income guidance flat to our previous forecast while increasing the mid-point of our Adjusted EBITDAre guidance by 2%. We tightened our full year Total RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.7% to 4.6% and our RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.0% to 4.0% based on our performance in the first quarter the evolving nature of demand in Maui and our expectations for growth in the second half of the year. Given our fortress balance sheet and successful capital allocation execution we believe Host is well positioned to continue delivering EBITDA growth.”

(1) NAREIT Funds From Operations (“FFO”) per diluted share Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel revenues are non-GAAP (U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). See the Notes to Financial Information on why the Company believes these supplemental measures are useful reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and the limitations on the use of these supplemental measures. Additionally comparable hotel results and statistics include adjustments for dispositions acquisitions and non-comparable hotels. See Hotel Operating Data for RevPAR results of the portfolio based on the Company's ownership period without these adjustments.

HIGHLIGHTS:

Comparable hotel Total RevPAR was $369.58 representing an increase of 0.5% compared to first quarter of 2023 as strong contributions from group business led to an increase in food and beverage revenues with banquet and catering revenues per group room night in excess of the prior peak reached in first quarter of 2023.

Comparable hotel RevPAR was $215.37 for the first quarter of 2024 representing a decrease of 1.2% compared to first quarter of 2023 driven by the impacts of the Maui wildfires unseasonable weather conditions in several markets and unanticipated delays in renovation. In addition there were difficult comparisons to first quarter of 2023 which had experienced elevated levels of leisure demand leading to significant RevPAR growth.

GAAP net income was $272 million for first quarter of 2024 reflecting a 6.5% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 primarily due to a decline in gain on asset sales partially offset by gains on insurance settlements recognized in the first quarter. GAAP operating profit margin was 19.8% an improvement of 180 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2023 due to the insurance gains.

Comparable hotel EBITDA was $435 million for first quarter of 2024 a 2.9% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 leading to a comparable hotel EBITDA margin decline of 140 basis points to 31.2%. The decline for the quarter was driven by increased wages and higher insurance expenses in comparison to first quarter 2023.

Adjusted EBITDAre was $483 million for first quarter of 2024 exceeding 2023 by 8.8% driven by strong operating performance at The Ritz-Carlton Naples which was closed in the first half of 2023 due to Hurricane Ian and including the benefit of the business interruption gain.

To date the Company has received insurance proceeds of $263 million out of the expected potential insurance recovery of approximately $310 million for covered costs related to damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Ian. The Company received $31 million in the first quarter and $10 million of these proceeds were recognized as a gain on business interruption.

Subsequent Acquisition

On April 15 2024 the Company acquired the fee simple interest in the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown for a total purchase price of $530 million. The LEED Silver® hotels comprise a two-hotel complex located in Nashville's famed Lower Broadway entertainment district across the street from Music City Convention Center and near other key points of interest and feature seven food and beverage outlets a spa two fitness centers a yoga studio and 33000 square feet of shared meeting space.



Maui Update

Impacts from the August 2023 wildfires in Maui Hawaii continued into 2024. In the first quarter the Company's Maui hotels and golf courses impacted RevPAR by 170 basis points. Operating profit margin and comparable hotel EBITDA margin were impacted by approximately 50 basis points and 30 basis points respectively for the first quarter. The first quarter impact is understated as the Company would have expected Maui to contribute 140 basis points to portfolio RevPAR growth in the first quarter given the renovation disruption at Fairmont Kea Lani in 2023. As a result the total estimated impact of the wildfires on first quarter RevPAR is 310 basis points.

BALANCE SHEET

The Company maintains a robust balance sheet and completed several transactions in March and April of 2024. These transactions include:

Net draws of $215 million on the revolving credit facility (including a $300 million draw in March as well as a $65 million draw and $150 million repayment subsequent to quarter end).

In addition the range incorporates continued improvement in group business a gradual recovery in business transient demand softer short term leisure transient demand and the evolution of demand on Maui as the island recovers from the recent wildfires. Growth in the first half of 2024 is expected to be flat to low single-digits while the second half of the year is expected to have stronger year-over-year improvements due to better group booking pace less renovation disruption compared to the second half of 2023 and diminishing impacts from the wildfire event in Maui which occurred in early August of 2023.

Operating profit margin in 2024 is expected to increase slightly compared to 2023 while comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to decline compared to 2023 due to the impacts from the Maui wildfires and continued growth in wages real estate taxes and insurance. At the midpoint of guidance the impact from the Maui wildfires is expected to be an approximate decline of 130 basis points in RevPAR 90 basis points in Total RevPAR and 20 basis points in margins. At the midpoint in comparison to 2019 operating profit margin is expected to increase 110 basis points and comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to increase 10 basis points as portfolio-wide cost reductions continue to curb inflation and benefiting from business interruption gains.

The guidance range for net income and Adjusted EBITDAre includes an additional $28 million of gains from business interruption proceeds compared to prior forecast comprised of $8 million related to Hurricane Ian and based on an estimated range of $18 million to $22 million related to the Maui wildfires which is expected to be received during the remainder of 2024. The guidance also includes an estimated $17 million and $29 million of net income and Adjusted EBITDAre respectively which is expected from the recent acquisition of the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown. Due to the timing of the acquisition the results for these two hotels will be included in the comparable hotel guidance starting in the second quarter. Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California in March 2024 Alila Ventana Big Sur temporarily closed on March 30 2024 and will be removed from the forecast comparable hotel set for full year 2024.

The Company anticipates its 2024 operating results as compared to 2023 will be in the following range:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Comparable hotel Total RevPAR $352 to $359 2.7% to 4.6% 2.9% to 5.8% (60) bps Comparable hotel RevPAR $214 to $218 2.0% to 4.0% 2.5% to 5.5% (100) bps Total revenues under GAAP (in millions) $5650 to $5753 6.4% to 8.3% 5.2% to 8.1% 80 bps Operating profit margin under GAAP 15.4% to 16.1% (20) bps to 50 bps (40) bps to 70 bps (10) bps Comparable hotel EBITDA margin 29.3% to 29.8% (80) bps to (30) bps (120) bps to (40) bps 30 bps

Based upon the above parameters the Company estimates its 2024 guidance as follows:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Net income (in millions) $719 to $775 $708 to $794 $(4) Adjusted EBITDAre (in millions) $1640 to $1700 $1590 to $1680 $35 Diluted earnings per common share $1.00 to $1.08 $.99 to $1.11 $(0.01) NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share $1.97 to $2.05 $1.92 to $2.04 $0.03

(1) The Forecasts are based on the below assumptions:

Comparable hotel RevPAR will increase 2.0% to 4.0% compared to 2023 for the low and high end of the forecast range. Comparable hotel metrics do not yet include the results of 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown which were acquired in April 2024. We expect to include the comparable hotel results for these two hotels beginning in the second quarter.

Comparable hotel EBITDA margins will decrease 80 basis points to 30 basis points compared to 2023 for the low and high ends of the forecasted comparable hotel RevPAR range respectively.

We expect to spend approximately $500 million to $605 million on capital expenditures.

Includes $17 million of net income and $29 million of EBITDA from the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown acquired in April 2024. Assumes no additional acquisitions and no dispositions during the year.

Assumes a total of $38 million of gains from business interruption proceeds expected to be received in 2024 related to Hurricane Ian and related to the Maui wildfire disruption. No further business interruption gains are expected. Also includes $32 million of insurance proceeds from Hurricane Ian received through May 1 2024 that result in a gain on property insurance settlement. No further property insurance gains have been included related to Hurricane Ian. We have collected $263 million out of a potential $310 million insurance recovery related to Hurricane Ian under our policy and we continue to work with our insurers to recover the remaining amount although there can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve this result.

For a discussion of items that may affect forecast results see the Notes to Financial Information.

Notes to Financial Information

FORECASTS

Our forecast of net income earnings per diluted share NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel results are forward-looking statements and are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results and performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forecasts. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forecasts are based upon reasonable assumptions we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained or that the results will not be materially different. Risks that may affect these assumptions and forecasts include the following: potential changes in overall economic outlook make it inherently difficult to forecast the level of RevPAR; the amount and timing of debt payments may change significantly based on market conditions which will directly affect the level of interest expense and net income; the amount and timing of transactions involving shares of our common stock may change based on market conditions; and other risks and uncertainties associated with our business described herein and in our annual report on Form 10-K quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC.

COMPARABLE HOTEL OPERATING STATISTICS AND RESULTS

To facilitate a year-to-year comparison of our operations we present certain operating statistics (i.e. Total RevPAR RevPAR average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues expenses hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in our reports on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance. We define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) are owned or leased by us as of the reporting date and are not classified as held-for-sale; and (ii) have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption or undergone large-scale capital projects in each case requiring closures lasting one month or longer (as further defined below) during the reporting periods being compared.

We make adjustments to include recent acquisitions to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. Additionally operating results of hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed or the hotel is classified as held-for-sale.

The hotel business is capital-intensive and renovations are a regular part of the business. Generally hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels. A large-scale capital project would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set if it requires the entire property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer.

Similarly hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption if it requires the property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer. In each case these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after the hotel has reopened. Often related to events that cause property damage and the closure of a hotel we will collect business interruption insurance proceeds for the near-term loss of business. These proceeds are included in gain on insurance settlements on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Business interruption insurance gains related to a hotel that was excluded from our comparable hotel set also will be excluded from the comparable hotel results.

Of the 77 hotels that we owned as of March 31 2024 76 have been classified as comparable hotels. The operating results of the following properties that we owned as of March 31 2024 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods:

The Ritz-Carlton Naples (business disruption due to Hurricane Ian beginning in September 2022 reopened in July 2023); and

Sales and marketing expenses related to the development and sale of condominium units on a development parcel adjacent to Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World® Resort.

Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California Alila Ventana Big Sur closed on March 30 2024 and has yet to reopen to guests. As a result the property will be removed from the comparable hotel set starting in the second quarter.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Operating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. Therefore hotel statistics and results for non-U.S. properties include the effect of currency fluctuations consistent with our financial statement presentation.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Included in this press release are certain “non-GAAP financial measures” which are measures of our historical or future financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. They are as follows: (i) FFO and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted) (ii) EBITDA (iii) EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre and (iv) Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results. The following discussion defines these measures and presents why we believe they are useful supplemental measures of our performance.

NAREIT FFO AND NAREIT FFO PER DILUTED SHARE

We present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. As noted in NAREIT’s Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to certain real estate assets gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets gains and losses from change in control impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis.

We believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation amortization impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance we believe that such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement the primary purpose for including FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a REIT is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by GAAP. For these reasons NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance.

Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share

We also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share:

Gains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt – We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt including the acceleration of the write-off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense –In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. For example in 2017 as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and to increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance and therefore we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO.

EBITDA

Earnings before Interest Expense Income Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs hotel owners that are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for our compensation programs.

EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We present EBITDAre in accordance with NAREIT guidelines as defined in its September 2017 white paper “Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate” to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of the Company’s results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDAre as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense income tax depreciation and amortization gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control) impairment expense for depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate and adjustments to reflect the entity’s pro rata share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates.

We make additional adjustments to EBITDAre when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDAre also is similar to the measure used to calculate certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDAre for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDAre:

Property Insurance Gains – We exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDAre is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense – In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust EBITDAre for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. The last adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim.

Limitations on the Use of NAREIT FFO per Diluted Share Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We calculate EBITDAre and NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of EBITDAre and FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition although EBITDAre and FFO per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other REITs they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDAre which measures are not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs or by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating profit cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures) interest expense (for EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre purposes only) severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration and other items have been and will be made and are not reflected in the EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q include interest expense capital expenditures and other excluded items all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally NAREIT FFO per diluted share Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure and should not be used as measures of amounts that accrue directly to stockholders’ benefit.

Similarly EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. Our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in eight domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 35 properties and a vacation ownership development. Due to the voting rights of the outside owners we do not control and therefore do not consolidate these entities. The non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in Host LP held by unaffiliated limited partners and a 15% interest held by an unaffiliated limited partner in a partnership owning one hotel for which we do control the entity and therefore consolidate its operations. These pro rata results for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre were calculated as set forth in the definitions above. Readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our investments in these entities.

Comparable Hotel Property Level Operating Results

We present certain operating results for our hotels such as hotel revenues expenses food and beverage profit and EBITDA (and the related margins) on a comparable hotel or ""same store"" basis as supplemental information for our investors. Our comparable hotel results present operating results for our hotels without giving effect to dispositions or properties that experienced closures due to renovations or property damage as discussed in “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” above. We present comparable hotel EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels. Comparable hotel results are presented both by location and for the Company’s properties in the aggregate. We eliminate from our comparable hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses these non-cash expenses which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient.

Because of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses gains or losses on disposition certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues expenses operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our condensed consolidated statements of operations include such amounts all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.

We present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors. While management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable hotel results in the aggregate. For these reasons we believe comparable hotel operating results when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit revenues and expenses provide useful information to investors and management.

The acquisition price represents a 12.6x EBITDA multiple or a cap rate of approximately 7.4 percent on the property’s 2024 estimated results. Other terms were not disclosed.

The property is expected to be among Host’s top-25 assets based on estimated full year 2024 results with expected combined RevPAR of $275 total RevPAR of $435 and EBITDA per key of $585502 further improving the quality of the company’s portfolio.

“We are excited to add the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown to our portfolio and establish a presence in one of the country’s most exciting cities"" Host Hotels & Resorts President and CEO James Risoleo said in a statement. ""The newly built property has a prime location in Nashville a top-performing market which had an impressive RevPAR CAGR of 7.7 percent from 2000 to 2023 even while absorbing new supply. A major leisure destination and the #2 ranked convention destination in the United States Nashville also has a recently expanded airport and a new stadium that is expected to attract more entertainment and sporting events. With meaningful in-place cash flow multiple demand generators and no expected near-term capital expenditure requirements we expect the Property will generate outsized growth as it stabilizes enhancing the quality of our portfolio and driving additional value creation for our stockholders.”

The newly built LEED Silver property opened in 2022 and is located two blocks from numerous live music and entertainment venues in Nashville’s famed Lower Broadway entertainment district. The Property stands directly across from the Music City Convention Center adjacent to the Bridgestone arena home of the NHL Nashville Predators and within a 10-minute drive of Nissan Stadium the Country Music Hall of Fame Museum Vanderbilt University Tennessee State University and Centennial Park. The MCCC has continued to set record attendance numbers by attracting larger events and it has promising definite bookings in future years. The new Nissan Stadium home of the NFL Tennessee Titans is also expected to generate increased demand as the stadium’s dome will allow for year-round activation beginning with the 2027 season. In addition the Nashville International Airport is the fastest growing airport in the United States with current passenger traffic 33 percent above 2019. The recent $1.5 billion airport expansion added six international gates and eight satellite gates and another $1.5 billion expansion is already underway with completion expected in 2028.

The Property has a combined 721 oversized rooms that average approximately 500 square feet with a 75 percent suite mix. It offers seven separate food and beverage outlets including Harriet’s Rooftop which provides guests with exclusive views of Music City’s skyline in an elevated nightlife setting. Among other amenities the property has a Bamford Wellness spa with six treatment rooms two fitness centers a yoga studio and 33000 square feet of shared meeting space including a 9400 square foot ballroom and 9300 square feet of pre-function space.

Supply growth is expected to continue in Nashville with most projects in the planning stages and in the select service chain scale. Host believes the Property is differentiated from the future supply as a result of its central location and diversified product offerings that provide distinct value propositions to customers. The company expects the Property to stabilize between approximately 10-12x EBITDA3 in the 2026-2028 time frame.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc3Rhci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8yMTE1Mzc0NTIwL2hvc3QtaG90ZWxzLWJ1eXMtMS1ob3RlbC1uYXNodmlsbGUtZW1iYXNzeS1zdWl0ZXMtZm9yLTUzMC1taWxsaW9uLWNhc2jSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Host Hotels Buys 1 Hotel Nashville Embassy Suites for $530 Million Cash,"Host Hotels & Resorts bought the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown for $530 million in an all-cash deal.

And that understanding and planning around consumer motivations or desires gives a better sense of the true competition. Does this hypothesis resonate with you and how do you address it from a brand standpoint?

The market is constantly shifting and we are shifting to lead the market. This all boils down to understanding and addressing a customer’s needs and problems which is something we obsess over. You can’t let traditional definitions define your business. You must understand not just what challenges customers have today but what they will have tomorrow.

This is also why traditional categories often can become dated. The market is changing too fast for the naming conventions to keep up. We’ve been working with analysts and others to help them understand the category we pioneered – edge-to-cloud.

If you follow the customer it often leads you to undefined places. And that leads to new solutions and new categories. That’s what’s happening today. We’re hearing from customers who can’t easily move everything to public cloud and that are tied to a data center or edge. They are looking for a new solution a cloud that comes to where the majority of their apps and data are today. But there is not a defined category for this segment. So when you innovate to solve these kinds of new problems you are creating new markets and categories because we continue to evolve to bring a new kind of experience to them.

We are a long way from when we used to view our competitors based on scale. That just no longer works and we have to entirely reset our thinking. We are always looking at smaller players the disruptive players who have built powerful services often based on a cloud model. Disruptors can emerge seemingly out of nowhere so it’s critical that we don’t have a myopic view of the landscape.

Customer expectations are driving a huge shift in our engagement model. We’re shifting from a classic transactional selling motion to an outcome-based consultative approach. Customer business models are changing at incredible speed we need to understand those challenges so we can deliver the right solutions with a simple experience. Additionally we’re building out the enablement curriculum to support our sellers and bringing together the solution stacks to get that outcome-based dialogue kickstarted.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy83MDAtaHAtY2hldnktbm92YS1zcy0xNjAwMDA3OTcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,700-HP Chevy Nova SS Is A Big Block Bully,"⚡️ Read the full article on Motorious

This classic Chevy Nova puts supercharged LS to shame with naturally aspirated power.

Vintage Chevrolet vehicles are among the most popular choices within the classic car scene for their customizability performance and retro design. Of the bunch the Nova has got to be the leader in that charge to be the best a classic car can get as it has been used by thousands of enthusiasts for everything from autocross to drag racing. But of course what's under the hood is just as important as the car itself and for most Chevy-loving car enthusiasts big-block is the only way to go. This car perfectly epitomizes that emphasis on massive displacement engines which put today's supercharged LS engines in their place by making just as much power naturally aspirated.

Under the hood of this wild 1969 Chevy Nova sits a 502 ci V8 powerhouse which produces 730 horsepower and 700 ft.-lbs of torque. The car hadn't been initially created with this engine nor was it when the current owner bought it. So what started as a good 350 ci V8 commuter now lives on with a badass 502 big-block under the hood. The car is held up by a set of 20"" chrome wheels that stand out among a crowd and go perfectly with the front spoiler which gives the vehicle a tremendous low slug look.

The owner wanted to keep the exhaust as quiet as possible to maintain a sleeper vibe to the car. This goes perfectly with the exterior which sports a playful yellowish color deemed Butternut. Long story short you wouldn't expect this car to be packing that massive motor under the hood even if you were a Chevy expert. While the vehicle may not look or sound very fast when the owner gets on the throttle all hell starts to break loose as all 730 wild horses shoot to the back tires with incredible brutality and speed.

HP's VR headset Reverb G2 promises to combine the sharp image of the predecessor with the comfort and sound of Valve Index. How does the VR headset compare to the predecessor and Valve Index?



In this review you will find out

how good the high-resolution display of Reverb G2 is

how comfortable the VR headset is

what the controllers and tracking are good for

and for whom the headset is worthwhile.

Resolution colours and frame rate

As with the predecessor the high resolution of HP Reverb G2 is the best feature of the VR headset. It resolves with 2160 x 2160 pixels per eye which puts it at the top of consumer VR headsets along with Reverb G1. The frame rate is 90 hertz.

However unlike what the pure numbers suggest the image quality of the new model is much better than in the predecessor headset. I noticed that immediately.

Better lenses developed together with Valve software improvements from Microsoft and new display technology result in a crisp image that is almost free of light flashes (god rays) streaking effects (ghosting) or errors in color representation (chromatic aberration). The pixel structure of the display (Screen Door Effect) is no longer visible – everything seems like it was made from one piece.

Thanks to the sharp and detailed image details on weapons and textures can be seen in Half-Life: Alyx for example which I am missing even on the already high-resolution Valve Index (review).

In Elite Dangerous I can see all displays and texts well and they remain crisp even at a distance. For an LC display the HP Reverb G2 also offers surprisingly good black levels: The stars stand out brightly against the darkness of outer space. That looks better than the predecessor or Valve Index.

The VR experience with Reverb G2 is similar to the viewing experience of a Blu-ray remaster of an old classic: You discover details that you have never seen before and the whole experience is taken to a new level.

Of course the high image sharpness comes at a price: SteamVR sets the resolution of HP Reverb G2 to 3184 by 3096 pixels per eye by default. This is standard and is done with all VR headsets to counteract the distortion effects of the lenses.

However with an already very high native resolution like the Reverb G2's one this will melt even strong graphics cards depending on the title. Lower resolutions reduce the performance effort but the picture still looks great – even if the brilliance of the native resolution is lost.

HP Reverb G2: Field of view sweet spot and eye distance

Besides the crisp image something else immediately caught my eye when I first put it on which is less pleasing: the narrow field of view. The field of view of VR headsets always depends on the distance between the eyes and the shape of the head but the field of view of HP Reverb G2 is much narrower than Valve Index and other VR headsets.

Since Reverb G2 unlike Valve Index does not offer the possibility to mechanically bring the lenses closer to the face only more tension on the head strap helps for maximum contact pressure of the VR headset: Because the closer the eyes get to the lenses the wider the field of view becomes.

If I adjust the HP headset accordingly the field of view is about on par with an HTC Vive for me – that's fine. However longer gaming sessions are hard to bear with so much pressure on the face.

In practice this means that during longer use I have to live with a field of view that is below that of my HTC Vive which is more than 4.5 years old. VR enthusiasts therefore partly build and print their face inlays and use other pads that reduce the distance to the lenses and thus expand the field of view while maintaining good wearing comfort. Those who want to make this modding effort can still optimize the field of view.

The narrower standard field of view is one of the two big immersion killers of Reverb G2 for me. However if you're not used to Pimax or Index field of views you'll probably notice it less. Nevertheless it would have been nice if HP could have added a few degrees to the field of view.

Pleasing for me as a fish eye (IPD: 72 mm) is the mechanical regulator for the interpupillary distance (IPD). Reverb G1 didn't offer that at all G2 can be adjusted between 60 and 68 millimeters. This allows me to better adjust the sweet spot which is the sharpest area in the center of the lens to my visual needs. That is a big step forward.

The sweet spot itself is fine for me although I am noticing the drop-off in sharpness towards the edges more noticeable than with my Valve Index. A reason for this is that the difference between the sharp image center and the less sharp image edges is visible more clearly due to the high resolution of Reverb G2.

Conversely however I have to adjust the fit of my Index more precisely to find the sweet spot. Other users may have entirely different experiences though. As with the field of view the head shape of the VR wearer and thus the fit of the VR headset is crucial for the individual VR experience in addition to the lenses themselves. VR headsets are also pieces of clothing after all.

Sits well sounds good – if it fits

The cooperation between HP and Valve is most evident in the design of HP Reverb G2: The VR headset features a similar head mount an almost identical face pad and the Index head speakers that hang elegantly in front of the ear instead of pressing against it.

This makes the VR headset much more comfortable than their predecessor. But it also makes compromises in some areas that will please the simulation target audience but prevent Reverb G2 from knocking Valve Index off its throne as the most comfortable VR headset for me.

Like G1 Reverb G2 is significantly lighter than Index. As a result it sits comfortably on the head even during extended use. The head mount wraps around the back of the head and the entire mount has some clearance making the VR headset relatively easy to put on and take off.

Unlike Index however G2 is tightened with Velcro strips. Here I like the solution of Index much better which can be finely adjusted in seconds and with one hand with a knob at the rear.

The lack of a knob does have one advantage though: The Reverb G2 is particularly well-suited for flight simulators or racing games since players can lean their head against their chair without any problems and won't get stuck anywhere when turning.

The six-meter cable also contributes to the user comfort. It is attached to the headset via a clip and long and flexible enough even for extensive room scale VR adventures.

According to HP the two head speakers correspond to those of Valve Index. Their sound quality and the high wearing comfort due to the distance to the ear are a big bonus of Index for me.

Although the HP version is supposed to be identical in construction I had two issues in practice: At certain frequencies I perceived distortions in the sound that I don't know from Index. And I could never place the head speakers exactly above my ear. Since they don't lie on the ear exact positioning over the ear is especially important for perfect sound. However I am missing a few millimeters vertically with the HP headset.

With the changes to the head mount HP has changed something about the head speaker's headroom. So depending on the head size and shape you may not be able to fully enjoy the otherwise high-quality audio solution.

Another small setback compared to Index is the integrated microphone: When recording Reverb G2 overdrives slightly and sounds a bit tinny even after adjustments. All in all however the recording quality is okay.

Setup and software

Like the predecessor HP's Reverb G2 is based on Windows Mixed Reality so the setup and the software that works in the background are natively built into Windows 10.

After connecting the VR headset the Windows Mixed Reality portal opens and a guide leads the user through the setup of the VR headset and the gaming area. In the system settings of Windows 10 you can find settings for the VR mode: Here the user can change the refresh rate visual quality or the resolution of the application window.

The Windows Mixed Reality portal offers different rooms that can be set up according to the user's own preferences and a dedicated store for VR games. The portal always runs in the background: Pressing the Windows key on the controller starts functions like quick access to the desktop. However those who use the WMR bridge to SteamVR will only use these options very rarely – if at all.

Using HP Reverb G2 with Steam is simple: Launch Steam install the Windows Mixed Reality for SteamVR app start SteamVR and you are ready to go.

Since I'm used to SteamVR in practice the Windows integration is an extra annoying layer of software that I don't need. However the working SteamVR compatibility allows me to avoid it for the most part.

VR controller and tracking quality

Besides the much better comfort compared to the predecessor there is another pleasant news: HP Reverb G2 is the first Windows Mixed Reality headset that comes with improved tracking and VR controllers.

The revamped VR controllers feel much better in the hand than the angular Windows Mixed Reality controllers of the past. They also finally offer analog sticks instead of touchpads and a sensitive button layout. HP has clearly taken its cue from Oculus Touch here – which is good.

The tracking rings of the controllers are unfortunately still huge. That makes the input devices quite clunky and VR interactions often lead to collisions since you easily bump into each other or objects with the rings. Buttons with proximity sensors like in Oculus Touch or the Index controllers for rudimentary finger tracking are completely absent with Reverb G2.

The tracking is better than in the predecessor model: HP has installed two additional cameras on the sides of the VR headset for this. The predecessor only had cameras on the front. The controller tracking is thus much better than with G1 because it is farther but it does not reach the accuracy of the Oculus or Index tracking.

The tracking glitches are particularly noticeable when you use hands at hip or stomach level to operate interface elements like the browser or the SteamVR overlay hold a weapon with two hands or lift your guard in a boxing game. Then the virtual hands float away or simply get stuck for example.

This makes interaction even more difficult besides the thick tracking rings: In VR boxing for example the right fist gets stuck in front of the punching bag when I quickly move to the side. This sometimes makes simple VR interactions a patience chore and disturbs the immersion. Microsoft urgently needs to develop a better tracking solution. Meta Quest 2 (review) proves that good tracking is technically possible with four integrated cameras.

The headset itself tracks reliably as long as you do not attempt to play in the twilight – but this limitation applies to all VR headsets with optical tracking cameras directly in the frame.

Review summary of the HP Reverb G2 VR headset

For just under $600 HP's Reverb G2 delivers the VR headset with the sharpest image. In addition there is a good wearing comfort and a good-sounding audio solution. HP unfortunately inherits the biggest weakness from the predecessor: the mediocre controller tracking.

Nevertheless for casual VR gamers looking for PC VR headsets the controller tracking is sufficient. And Reverb G2 offers strong image quality at a fair price. However Beat Saber experts and passionate shooter gamers will not be able to ignore the obvious weaknesses.

They will have to reach for another VR headset or choose the ""silver bullet"" solution and combine the Valve Index controllers including the corresponding SteamVR tracking system with Reverb G2. This impressive upgrade unfortunately costs between $400 and $600 additionally and requires a receiver (HTC Vive Valve Index or SteamVR dongle of the Vive Tracker).

However those who already own a Valve Index including controller and base stations do not have to pay extra and the setup via software is relatively quick thanks to the detailed tutorial by Reddit user PumkinSpiceTrukNuts. Interested users can also find all the details about the required software and hardware there.

Simulation fans on the other hand can use HP's Reverb G2 without hesitation: They usually do not need the VR controllers anyway and place the highest value on the image sharpness. Thanks to the high resolution they are rewarded with an immersion that even Valve Index with a wider field of view cannot deliver. Those who were annoyed by the G1's teething troubles will be especially happy about the G2's much more homogeneous and clean image.

With Reverb G2 HP has established itself as a relevant manufacturer on the small PC VR market despite the pre-order chaos. Thanks to the cooperations with Microsoft and Valve HP was able to raise the VR headsets to a new level and the company also listened to customer feedback about G1.

For the B2B sector the tracking difficulties are probably not a problem in most application scenarios. HP is also planning the special Omnicept variant for businesses which will offer eye tracking camera-based face tracking and a heartbeat sensor in addition to the standard G2 strengths.

My wish list for the G3: Finally build decent controllers and improve their tracking. Then HP would have a candidate for the best PC VR headset on the market.

HP Reverb G2 is suitable for you if … you are looking for a good VR image

you are a simulation fan

and your graphics card is looking for a challenge.

HP Reverb G2 is not suitable for you if … you value accurate tracking in any situation without crafting

Lovecraft Inspired Shooter FORGIVE ME FATHER Leaves Early Access,"Byte Barrel has recently announced the full release of their dark retro FPS title Forgive Me Father. Currently available on early access Forgive Me Father is an adrenaline-fueled Lovecraftian retro shooter with a comic book art style. We suggest checking out our First Impression to give you an idea of what you can expect for the full release.

1C Entertainment and Byte Barrel are bringing over 50% more levels to the final build of the game and allowing players to play as two main characters. Players can take the role of either a priest or a journalist in the dark evil ridden world and observe the story from each of their perspectives.

The new journalist character will also include their own skill tree to progress through the game and unlock upgraded weapons to help you plow through the undead. Hopefully the new character feels distinct and fresh compared to the priest. This will give the game a great sense of replayability.

The story and amount of content were the only concerns that we had for the early access build of Forgive Me Father. The gameplay is solid and will absolutely satisfy your “retro-shooter itch.”

This is something [Mike Buss] is familiar with as he had the misfortune of being stuck using what he declares is the world’s worst USB hub and it’s not even a mystery discount device from overseas: it’s an HP Thunderbolt Dock G2. It is a sort of combination I/O dock and USB hub and it caused him no end of frustration until he “fixed” it with a crude workaround.

The problems with [Mike]’s dock come down to two major issues. The first is that the USB-C connection will if moved even the slightest amount instantly trigger a disconnect from the host computer. Frankly that sounds like a defect but that’s not all. The other issue is that the whole top of the device is actually a giant hyper-sensitive button. Even a stern gaze seems to be enough to cause it to activate. What does the button do? It puts the host computer to sleep; something that we all agree should suffer from as few false activations as possible.

We’ll spoil the surprise by revealing that the “fix” was nothing more than putting a 3D printed enclosure around the troublesome device as shown in the image above. Keeping the dock covered and perfectly still at least prevents the two aforementioned issues and that’s good enough for [Mike].

The curious part of all this is just how badly the device’s design affected normal use. We’d suspect a defect or malfunction but a cursory search of reviews online suggests [Mike]’s experience isn’t unique. It’s certainly not the first poorly-designed product we’ve seen fixed by a new enclosure but some problems just aren’t worth the effort of a more elegant solution."

Senior Vice President of Communications Technical Solutions Division Huntington Ingalls Industries

Integrating a newly acquired company is never a small feat. So when Jaime Orlando unified communications teams from Huntington Ingalls Industries and newly acquired Alion last fall there was an overwhelming sense of achievement.

“Working alongside some of the most talented communications professionals in our industry is an honor and privilege” she said. “Everything we accomplish is a collaborative team effort.”

In less than a month Orlando’s team creatively and effectively connected every new and existing employee in Alion’s division — more than 7000 around the world — to the HII brand and helped navigate the way forward. And Orlando’s efforts during the worst of the pandemic built employee trust and drove attrition down below industry averages added Andy Green HII executive vice president and president of HII’s Technical Solutions Division.

“Jaime has done an incredible job of developing a sophisticated comprehensive and modern communications strategy for our division while assembling a first-class team to get it done” Green said. “Her efforts to drive strong communications during the integration of multiple acquisitions have earned her praise from both legacy and new team members alike.”

Why Watch

Orlando’s team launched an internal change management communications campaign called “Beyond 2022” to support continued betterment and improve engagement with an inspirational vision and multichannel targeted strategic communications to help bring clarity of expectations and build excitement across the business.

Her team is also on the eve of launching a brand refresh where all audiences will begin to see and experience a modernized visual approach to HII’s brand identity. The goal is to define the HII brand more expansively — beyond shipbuilding — and reflect the enterprise the company is today: a global engineering and defense technologies provider. Leaders say it’s all part of a larger effort to help bridge connections across various audiences that in the end support the nation’s freedom and security.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ib3N0b25oZXJhbGQuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMTkvZnV0dXJlLXVzcy1tYXNzYWNodXNldHRzLW51Y2xlYXItYXR0YWNrLXN1Ym1hcmluZS10by1iZS1jb21taXNzaW9uZWQtaW4tYm9zdG9uLWdyb3dpbmctbW92ZW1lbnQtaG9wZXMv0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3RvbmhlcmFsZC5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy8xOS9mdXR1cmUtdXNzLW1hc3NhY2h1c2V0dHMtbnVjbGVhci1hdHRhY2stc3VibWFyaW5lLXRvLWJlLWNvbW1pc3Npb25lZC1pbi1ib3N0b24tZ3Jvd2luZy1tb3ZlbWVudC1ob3Blcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Future USS Massachusetts nuclear attack submarine to be commissioned in Boston growing movement hopes,"There will soon be a new USS Massachusetts and it could very well join the Navy right here in Boston if a growing movement has its way.

“Having this elite new Navy submarine commissioned here at the Flynn Cruiseport on the South Boston waterfront is symbolic of our rich history and a bold reminder of the importance of valuing and protecting our democracy” said state Sen. Nick Collins a Democrat who represents parts of Boston who drafted a resolution to support having the new Virginia-class nuclear attack submarine commissioned in the city.

The resolution was adopted by the Senate this past Monday.

Boston City Council joined in Wednesday with their own resolution. The commissioning won’t take place until at least next year so there is a lot of lobbying left to go to see Flynn Cruiseport win the commissioning ceremony blessing from the Secretary of the Navy over traditional locations like Groton Connecticut and Norfolk Virginia.

Three submarine sailors assigned to the Massachusetts call sign SSN798 will make an appearance at Collins’ St. Patrick’s Day Breakfast in Southie on Sunday.

“In 2018 the USS Thomas Hudner (DDG 116) a guided-missile destroyer was commissioned at Flynn Cruiseport Boston and our city has the finest hosting site for the commissioning of Navy ships with resources for support and security” states the city resolution.

Commissioning is the final stage the ship — or a boat the preferred term by submariners according to Dinis Pimentel the chair of the USS Massachusetts Commissioning Committee — goes through before elevating from PCU or Pre-Commissioning Unit Massachusetts to USS Massachusetts a full commissioned member of the U.S. Navy fleet.

That’s the event the local and federal politicians from Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker current U.S. Secretary of Labor and former Mayor of Boston Marty Walsh and the Commissioning Committee which is a not-for-profit organization unaffiliated with the Navy are all vying for Massachusetts to receive. An emailed request for comment from current Mayor Michelle Wu’s administration sent Thursday was not answered.

The first event the Keel Laying marked the ceremonial beginnings of the shipbuilding process though ships and boats both are now built in a modular system and no longer assembled over a keel said Jennifer Boykin the president of Newport News Shipbuilding the company building the submarine at the Dec. 11 2020 ceremony in Virginia.

The submarine is part of the Block IV boats of the Virginia class the first block of ships specially designed for crews of both women and men Pimentel said.

Sheryl Sandberg the chief operating officer of Meta the parent company of social media giants Facebook and Instagram is the sponsor of the ship. Sponsors of naval vessels are always women a tradition dating back to the beginnings of English and Dutch naval shipbuilding Pimentel said selected by the Secretary of the Navy to imbue their spirit and personality into the ship. Sandberg’s initials are permanently welded into the ship.

“Far beyond participation in ceremonial milestones Sponsorship represents a lifelong relationship with the ship and her crew” according to the Society of Sponsors of the United States Navy.

The last United States Ship to bear the name Massachusetts is the South Dakota-Class battleship BB-59 commissioned in May 1942 that saw action in World War II first in the Invasion of French Africa also known as Operation Torch.

There she engaged Axis-aligned French warships off the coast of Casablanca Morocco in November 1942 before being transferred to the Pacific Theater taking part in battles at Okinawa and Formosa for the rest of the war according to the U.S. Navy.

IBM stock has proven to be more resilient than many analysts and investors previously thought.

Year-to-date (YTD) IBM stock is down 5% to $127. That’s much better than the 15% YTD decline in the benchmark Nasdaq index and a stronger showing than other technology giants. Household names such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are both down 12% YTD and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is down 10% so far in 2022.

Other less-established technology stocks have fallen 50% or more since the market peaked last November. Yet IBM shares are trading where they were six months ago compared to a much larger rout that has left many investors with big losses.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News Stock Advice & Trading Tips

IBM’s New Business Model

To be sure IBM stock has not been a great long-term investment over the past decade. The share price is down 31% since late 2012 when it was trading right around $185.

However the company appears to have turned a corner — or at the very least it stopped the bleeding — thanks to a new business model. Last November just prior to the stock market downturn IBM effectively split its business in two. The main company that retained the IBM name brand and dividend is now focused on profitable high-growth areas such as cloud computing data security artificial intelligence and blockchain networks.

IBM’s less-profitable legacy infrastructure services business designed built and managed information technology systems for more than 4000 outside companies using an army of consultants. It was spun off into a new publicly traded company called Kyndryl (NYSE:KD).

Since its market debut last fall KD stock has plummeted 59% to $13 per share. Meanwhile IBM stock has largely managed to keep its head above water during the market downturn. The offloading of its increasingly antiquated IT systems and consulting business has allowed IBM to keep its shares above water while Kyndryl has sunk.

Other Positives for IBM Stock

The separation already appears to be benefiting the company and its shareholders. However there are other reasons to like IBM stock including its robust dividend.

The company has reliably increased its dividend payout every year since 1996. The result is that today IBM has a dividend yield of 5.2% placing it among the top 10 S&P 500 companies with the highest payouts.

Story continues

IBM’s dividend is among the most generous of technology stocks placing it in the same category as oil majors and some of the larger real estate investment trusts (REITs). It currently equates to a quarterly payout of $1.64 per share.

The dividend is certainly attractive and partly makes up for the underperformance of IBM stock over the last decade. However IBM is also producing strong earnings that are largely driven by its cloud computing unit.

In the fourth quarter of last year IBM’s revenue grew 7% year-over-year (YOY) to $16.7 billion. That marked a big improvement from Q4 2020 when the company’s revenue declined 6%.

For all of last year IBM’s revenue amounted to $57.4 billion a 4% annualized increase. The company has forecast mid-single-digit revenue growth annually through 2024 and it expects to have cumulative cash flow of $35 billion over that period.

IBM Stock Is Worth Considering

After years of chronic underperformance IBM shares appear to have renewed strength following the spinoff of its legacy IT infrastructure business. The focus on fast-growing areas such as cloud computing and blockchain seems to have injected some life into the company and fortified its stock.

Investors should like that IBM continues to offer one of the best dividend payments available. Its financials have also improved with its revenue growth moving in the right direction. For all these reasons consider adding IBM stock to your portfolio.

John Huffell 90 says he ‘started up’ the Havant manufacturing plant in 1966 where he was responsible for managing it for 16 years.

In 1974 when John was 43 staff invited the Queen to see the premises for herself after their immense success exporting a quota of ‘£40 million’ worth of goods every year – which John says was the ‘second largest export’ in the UK at that time.

John from Old Portsmouth said: ‘We invited her because we were doing extremely well.

‘We were very happy but we didn’t expect it to happen! We were very fortunate and it was a real privilege.

‘One looks forward to this day and then when the time comes you feel a little tense but it was so easy.

‘I didn't know how easy it was going to be to talk to her and we just chatted. It was very relaxing.’

The whole team of IBM staff made the effort to ensure the premises was smart and polished before the Queen’s arrival.

‘We did our best to make it look good and I spent an hour and a half showing the Queen around and she was talking to the people employed there. They were all excited about her coming’ explains John.

At the time the Queen visited IBM employed about 2000 people at the Havant site.

At least 500 people were waiting outside the offices on her arrival with families of employees lining the car park waiting in anticipation for the rare occasion.

A staff member’s six-year-old daughter presented the Queen with a bouquet of flowers on her arrival which John has pictured at his home in Old Portsmouth.

‘It was such an exciting day’ he said.

‘I took [the Queen] around the location to look at all the various things we were making and on a couple of occasions she had a little go herself with the wiring because she was so enthralled by what she saw.

‘The computers were absolutely full of wires – they were bulky back then – and we have these assembly lines and on that particular example there were guys wiring it from one point to another. The Queen was fascinated because she didn't realise there was a centre that told them to go from one to another.

The Havant plant was responsible for manufacturing the central parts of computers marketed across Europe Asia Africa and South America.

IBM have since discontinued their manufacturing of computers and solely focus on IT services enterprise systems and software.

Following the Queen’s visit John received a letter addressed to all the IBM employees at the plant thanking them to say how much the Queen enjoyed her visit.

‘She was very pleased and interested’ John explains.

On March 17 we reported that income tax officials had raided the offices of construction materials startup Infra.Market in several cities including Noida Hyderabad Bengaluru Pune Mumbai and Thane. On Sunday the department said in a press statement that it has found evidence of attempted tax-evasion at “a startup based in Pune and Thane”. While it didn’t name the company there’s little doubt which one it was referring to.■ No longer involved with Trell says cofounder■ India's data centre industry still faces many pain points■ Reliance Retail picks up 89% in Clovia for Rs 950 croreThe Income-Tax department said on Sunday it has found evidence that a startup based in Pune and Thane has not disclosed Rs 224 crore of income. While the I-T department didn’t name the company it is believed to be referring to Infra.Market the construction materials startup that its officials raided recently. Infra.Market is backed by Tiger Global Nexus Venture Partners and Accel and valued at $2.5 billion.It also said the company appeared to have booked bogus purchases made huge unaccounted cash expenditures and obtained accommodation entries totalling over Rs 400 crore. During the search operations Rs 1 crore in unaccounted cash and jewellery worth Rs 22 lakh were also seized the department said.When confronted with the evidence directors of the group “admitted under oath this modus operandi disclosed additional income of more than Rs 224 crore in various assessment years and offered to pay their due tax liability"" the department said.The I-T department said it is investigating how the company obtained huge foreign funding via Mauritius by issuing shares at an ""exorbitantly"" high premium. These funds were routed through a hawala network involving shell companies in Mumbai and Thane it said.“These shell companies exist [only] on paper and were created only for the purpose of providing accommodation entries. Preliminary analysis has revealed that the total quantum of accommodation entries provided by these shell entities exceeds Rs. 1500 crore” the department said.A spokesperson for Infra.Market told ET ""We continue to cooperate with the authorities and provide all necessary information to the department. Since the matter is sub judice we would not like to comment further.”On March 17 we reported that tax officials searched the offices of Infra.Market in 23 locations  including Maharashtra Karnataka Andhra Pradesh Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.Compliance and governance issues have cropped up at some well-funded startups in the recent past including BharatPe Paytm Payments Bank and Trell the subject of our next story.Prashant Sachan one of the founders of influencer-led social commerce platform Trell told us on Sunday that he fully exited the company in October 2021 to build his spiritual and devotional tech startup AppsForBharat. He said he was no longer involved in Trell’s operations.The news comes as a forensic team from EY India is carrying out a detailed investigation into Trell’s finances  as we reported on March 12. The six-year-old firm is also in the middle of a ‘restructuring’ exercise as part of which it plans to lay off hundreds of employees.Sachan said he first diluted the majority of his equity in Trell by transferring it to the management stock options plan (Msop) in December 2020. He later sold his remaining stake about 1.5% to LOGX Venture Partners and LetsVenture syndicate in October 2021.Trell had received a 17% stake in AppsForBharat for Rs 85000 because Sachan started working on it while at Trell. It later diluted its holding to about 10% as AppsForBharat closed two funding rounds of about $14 million from Elevation Capital Sequoia Capital India Beenext and Matrix Partners India.Trell does not have any governance rights in AppsForBharat Sachan said.On March 17 ET reported that Trell cofounder Pulkit Agrawal had sent a fiery note to all investors of the firm questioning the nature of the forensic audit by EY India and claiming the exercise was ordered by a cohort of select financial backers –- not by the company or its board.India’s data centre industry is expected to attract investments worth Rs 70000-72000 crore over the next five to 10 years  driven by large corporate groups and cloud service providers according to an estimate by ratings agency Ind-Ra.Much of this growth will be centred around Mumbai and Chennai due to their business and infrastructure advantages strategic location and cable landing stations an analysis by Airtel and realty industry consultancy JLL has shown.Already major domestic conglomerates such as Reliance Industries Bharti Airtel Adani group Hiranandani group and multinational companies such as Microsoft Alphabet Inc and Amazon Web Services have joined forces with traditional data centre players such as NTT Sify CtrlS STT and others to invest huge sums in the data centre space.The government has also made several positive changes to its data centre policies over the years such as giving the sector ‘infrastructure’ status in the latest budget.A lot remains to be done say stakeholders as the data centre ecosystem is facing quite a few pain points.Issues around power sourcing captive networks procuring equipment and ease of doing business remain major irritants.Industry experts also said things like the restriction on laying captive fibre for data centre use their heavy dependence on telecom operators delayed right-of-way permits restrictions on power banking and a lack of clarity on building codes and permits for establishing data centres are slowing the sector’s growth.John Granger senior vice president of IBM ConsultingIndia remains at the centre of IBM Consulting’s strategy to drive growth according to John Granger senior vice president at the firm. He said India was central to how the company executed its strategy.“We’re doubling down on our acquisition of talent” Granger said.Acquisitions are another area of focus with IBM having acquired 12 companies in the 20 months since Arvind Krishna took over as its chief executive.Its most recent acquisition Neudesic has about 700 employees in India – about half its workforce.The third aspect on which India is driving the global strategy IBM Garage an end-to-end offering to help clients accelerate their digital transformation.

It was stuck on a 14nm process for so long and while it was able to keep up in single-core performance it quickly lost the lead in multi-core performance - something that is getting more important every single year.

However with its 12th-generation Alder Lake processors led by the Intel Core i9-12900K Intel finally gained a fighting chance against the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X - a processor that was untouchable when it came out in late 2020.

And because both processors are trying to do pretty much the same thing albeit in very different ways we thought it was about time to take a closer look at these two processors. After all picking out the best processor isn't just about the numbers on the box or the color theme of the brand.

Intel Core i9-12900K vs AMD Ryzen 9 5900X: price

There's no way of getting around the fact that both the Intel Core i9-12900K and the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X are expensive processors. Looking to build or buy a system with either of these chips likely means you're going for a high-end device. So it shouldn't be too surprising that they have high price tags.

The Intel Core i9-12900K is the most recently released one and it is still at full price pretty much everywhere. You'll find this 16-core processor at around $612 / £559 / AU$949. This is a bit higher than Intel's recommended price of $589-$599 but not by much. We imagine that prices will start to go down as the processor ages and you should be able to find good deals on it soon.

The AMD Ryzen 9 5900X however has been out for about a year and a half and as such is starting to see lower prices. You can find it starting at $499 / £409 / AU$739 which is much more affordable than the Intel Core i9 at the moment. It does have fewer cores though. But if you want an AMD 16-core chip you could fork over around $599 / £548 / AU$919 for the Ryzen 9 5950X instead.

Intel Core i9-12900K vs AMD Ryzen 9 5900X: specs

Both the Intel Core i9-12900K and the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X are high-end CPUs but they're quite different from one another.

The AMD Ryzen 9 5900X will look pretty familiar to anyone with passing knowledge of desktop PC CPUs. It's a 12-core 24-thread processor with a max boost of 4.8GHz. It also comes with a whopping 70MB of Cache split between L2 and L3 and a TDP (thermal design power) of 105W.

The Intel Core i9-12900K is a 16-core processor but the way those cores are laid out is quite a bit different than the AMD chip. Unlike the Ryzen processor - and Intel's previous CPUs no less - the 12900K is using a hybrid chip design. Specifically it follows the big.LITTLE design philosophy popularized by Arm.

Basically it has 8 Performance cores and 8 Efficient cores. The Performance cores are dual-threaded just like the Ryzen Threads but the Efficient cores are not. So while this chip has more cores altogether it has the same amount of threads 24 as the Ryzen 9 5900X.

Both Intel and Apple have moved to a hybrid chip design like this and AMD is the only CPU manufacturer that is still using a monolithic chip layout. We're not sure how much longer AMD will stick with this design philosophy but it seems to be working for the company for now.

Intel Core i9-12900K vs AMD Ryzen 9 5900X: performance

While AMD and Intel have been trading blows for the last few years the release of the Intel Core i9-12900K sees Team Blue pulling ahead again - but this time the difference is pretty significant.

In our review we found that the Intel Core i9-12900K is about 21% faster than the Ryzen 9 5900X in single core workloads particularly Cinebench. It's odd because Cinebench has been the workload that has seen the most success on AMD processors but Intel really pulled away this time.

And it's not just single-core. In the Cinebench multi-core test Intel is 23% faster ending AMD's reign as the multi-threaded champ. This is repeated in pretty much every benchmark we ran in our review with the 5900X not gaining a lead in any of our creative workloads.

The closest it got was in Blender where the Ryzen 9 5900X was just 10% slower than the Core i9-12900K. But even then that's still a pretty major loss.

In gaming Intel is still winning especially in the CPU-intensive Total War: Three Kingdoms. We ran the game on low settings to make sure it was leaning as much on the CPU as possible and the Core i9-12900K got 480 fps to the Ryzen 9 5900X's 380 fps.

However the tables turned in Metro: Exodus where the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X beat Intel with 251 fps to Team Blue's 246 fps. That's a small victory but it's still a victory.

Either way you slice it the Intel Core i9-12900K is faster than the Ryzen 9 5900X. Whether that makes up for the price difference is up to you though. However Intel's support of DDR5 PCIe 5.0 and Thunderbolt may make up the difference to you.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2V4Y2x1c2l2ZS1pbnRlbHMtcG93ZXJmdWwtbmV4dC1nZW5lcmF0aW9uLWdhdWRpLTItaGwtMjA4MC1haS1wcm9jZXNzb3ItbGVha2VkL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2V4Y2x1c2l2ZS1pbnRlbHMtcG93ZXJmdWwtbmV4dC1nZW5lcmF0aW9uLWdhdWRpLTItaGwtMjA4MC1haS1wcm9jZXNzb3ItbGVha2VkL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exclusive: Intel’s Powerful Next Generation Gaudi 2 HL 2080 AI Processor Leaked,"We have something very interesting for our readers today. We recently got our hands on some internal documents that confirm Intel is preparing to launch a next-generation AI training accelerator with monstrous capabilities later this year. Dubbed the Habana Gaudi 2 platform it will take aim at NVIDIA's new datacenter products (launching later this week) for deep learning and aims to provide a higher value (from a TCO perspective) alternative. Keep in mind the documents were dated earlier this year and the launch window *could* have moved during this time so take that with a grain of salt.

Intel gets ready to 'play offense' with Habana Gaudi 2 deep learning processor launching in May 2022

Intel's Habana offerings are split into two categories: AI training and AI inference. The Gaudi platform is the AI training platform and Goya is the AI inference platform. The Gaudi 2 chip will succeed the older Gaudi chips offered by Intel. While the documentation we acquired only talked about a Gaudi 2 chip [caution: editorial speculation] it is possible that there is a Goya 2 chip in the works as well [/editorial speculation] - since AI training and inference is usually a combo offering by most vendors. Vendors can utilize Intel's Gaudi platform using the Amazon AWS EC2DL1 instance where it already offers 40% better performance per dollar than NVIDIA-based instances.

We also have the first-ever picture of the Intel HL 2080 AI chip based on the Gaudi 2 platform:

Our exclusive first-ever look at Intel's new Habana Gaudi 2 HL 2080 Chip with 6 HBM dies.

While we did not receive any additional information on the Gaudi 2 HL 2080 chip we can see that ith as 6 HBM dies. If these are of the HBM2 type this is a total of 48 GB memory onboard. If it is the HBM3 type then the sky is the limit and it could be 96 GB (or more). We can also see the soldering pads for a total of 24 VRMs for what appears to be a 12+12 phase design. This is roughly 50% more power than the older Habana chip which had a 8+8 design for a total of 16 VRMs. Assuming these are standard HBM sized chips it also looks like Intel has increased the die size by 50% over the last generation of Gaudi processors. I am not going to do a die-size estimation here and will leave that to my colleagues to inevitably do.

To get a good idea of the rough transistor count increase however we also need to know the process the chip is built on. We know that the Intel Gaudi 2 HL 2080 chip is built on 'a' 7nm process based on this interview by Eitan Medina COO of Habana Labs. Unfortunately this doesn't really help us much because 7nm could be referring to the N7 process on TSMC Intel 7 (formerly Intel 10nm) or Intel 4 (formerly Intel 7nm and the least likely). The original Habana Gaudi processors were built on the 16nm TSMC process which makes it more likely for this chip to be on N7 or Intel 7. Whatever the case is considering the Gaudi 2 platform is clearly on a far smaller node than 16nm (which in itself gives a density increase of roughly 50%) and combined with the die size increase we are looking at an absolute beast of a processor which should easily go toe to toe with NVIDIA's upcoming Hopper datacenter GPU - in terms of performance per dollar - and maybe even in terms of absolute performance.

Intel's CEO Pat Gelsinger has previously hinted at a ""very aggressive path"" for its Habana AI arm:

‘We are playing offense not defense’.. We also have with our Habana product line [a specialized A.I. chipmaker Intel bought in 2019] unquestionably laid out a very aggressive path and our cloud partnership with [hotlink]Amazon[/hotlink] is a great demonstration of that. So clearly I'd say the idea of CPUs is Intel's provenance. We're now building A.I. into that and we expect this to be an area where we are on the offense not the defense going forward. via Yahoo Finance

Since being acquired by Intel Habana Labs would have had a lot more resources to play with and it looks like the company is getting ready to get serious about DL/ML applications. Intel finally has a very real product roadmap that could fend off - and even take marketshare from NVIDIA.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlcnZldGhlaG9tZS5jb20vaW5leHBlbnNpdmUtNHgtMi01Z2JlLWZhbmxlc3Mtcm91dGVyLWZpcmV3YWxsLWJveC1yZXZpZXctaW50ZWwtajQxMjUtaTIyNS1wZnNlbnNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inexpensive 4x 2.5GbE Fanless Router Firewall Box Review,"Over the past few weeks the new pfSense CE 2.6.0 was released and that has allowed us to more directly use a machine we purchased some time ago. There is an inexpensive 4x 2.5GbE Intel i225 (B3) machine out there that now works with pfSense. OS support as a whole is not overly mature but we have had Ubuntu running on these as well. It seems like now might be the time it is possible to upgrade to an inexpensive 2.5GbE firewall. Let us get into the box and what it offers.

Inexpensive 4x 2.5GbE Fanless Router Firewall Box Review

We actually have a little video accompanying this one where we go into the experience as well as discussing how it compares to an ISP-provided router and WiFi unit. You can find the video here:

As always we suggest opening this in its own YouTube tab window or app for a better viewing experience.

The box itself goes by many names. Here is the unit we have on Amazon (affiliate link) and we will note it was quite pricey for the 8GB/ 256GB configuration. We would only recommend getting that much storage and memory if you have a good reason for a box but since we wanted to use it with Linux as well until pfSense support arrived we used the extra capacity.

The tricky part is that the same motherboard at the heart of this system gets used in many systems with different exteriors. We ordered the less expensive Topton version with a larger heatsink chassis via AliExpress but that is making a slow journey being dragged across the Pacific Ocean seemingly via a lobster.

We also have a few more of these smaller heatsink units but our best advice is to look at the USB VGA and HDMI side to ensure it is this motherboard. Also you will want to ensure you get the same revision of the Intel i225 NICs and likely the Intel Celeron J4125 as we did. Then it is a matter of cost. Let us now get to that hardware to see what we got.

Inexpensive 4x 2.5GbE Fanless Router Firewall Box Hardware Overview

Let us just start with the star of the show. This palm-sized box (you can see it in my hand in the video) has four ports ETH0-ETH3. Each is a 2.5GbE port a big upgrade over the previous generation 1GbE models that many of our STH readers use. We also get status LEDs and a 12V DC input on this side.

The other side has the power button. Our unit was configured to turn on immediately on AC power which is always nice. We also have two USB 3 ports a HDMI port and a VGA port. This unit does not have out-of-band management and that is a good thing.

A quick note is that there is also a reset switch and there are two covers for WiFi antenna holes. We usually would not recommend WiFi in this box and instead simply tell our readers to use dedicated APs. If you are spending a few hundred dollars on a firewall then most likely you have dedicated WiFi APs as well.

The chassis is not completely closed there are actually air vents on the side.

Cooling however is provided by the metal chassis with the small heatsink on the top. This unit absolutely sipped power with most of our usage in the single-digit watts range.

The processor is an Intel Celeron J4125 quad-core CPU with a 2.0GHz base and a 2.7GHz turbo clock. It is part of the Gemini Lake Refresh series of CPUs. Since this is an Atom part it has a paltry maximum TDP of 10W.

Inside the system we have a few components. One that we are not going to talk about much is that there is a SATA data and power setup and one can mount a 2.5″ drive to the lid. We instead have a mSATA drive.

Here is a shot of the inside of the system. The NICs are Intel i225-V SLNMH units and that means they are stepping B3. Earlier steppings of the i225 necessitated new steppings for stability.

Here we can see the single 8GB DDR4 SODIMM and our 256GB SSD. Again this is overkill for most pfSense or OPNsense appliances but if you want to run Linux then it may make sense.

One can also see a SIM card slot and a slot for a WiFi card. Again we suggest simply just getting external WiFi here.

Next let us get to the software.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnhkYS1kZXZlbG9wZXJzLmNvbS9hc3VzLXJvZy1zdHJpeC1nMTUtcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX Review: Is it better than Intel Alder Lake?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnhkYS1kZXZlbG9wZXJzLmNvbS9hc3VzLXJvZy1zdHJpeC1nMTUtcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3ZpZGVvY2FyZHouY29tL25ld3ovaW50ZWwtaGFiYW5hLWdhdWRpLWhsLTIwODAtYWktdHJhaW5pbmctcHJvY2Vzc29yLXBpY3R1cmVkLWZlYXR1cmVzLTYtc3RhY2tzLW9mLWhpZ2gtYmFuZHdpZHRoLW1lbW9yedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel (Habana) Gaudi HL 2080 AI training processor pictured features 6 stacks of High Bandwidth Memory,"Intel’s Gaudi HL2000 AI chip

Habana Labs which was acquired by Intel in 2019 offers two series of products: Gaudi and Goya. The first is targeting AI training acceleration whereas Goya is designed for AI interference.

At Wccftech one can find pictures of the new Gaudi mezzanine card featuring HL 2000 chip. Unfortunately the detailed specs are not available at this moment.

This chip is equipped with 6 stacks of HBM-type memory which could be either 48 or 96GB of capacity depending whether this is HBM2(e) or HBM3 technology. The processor is using OCP-OAM (Open Compute Accelerator mezzanine) form factor which is the same type as its 2019-design HL205.

It is unclear what process technology is the HL2080 chip using but assuming that the company was acquired by Intel it is possible that it might be Intel own fab. Last year Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger highlighted that the company has a very aggressive path for Habana AI arm:

Sky News has learnt that Goldman has been signed up to advise the consortium being led by Todd Boehly one of the owners of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team.

The addition of Goldman to Mr Boehly's bid is understood to have been disclosed in an offer letter sent to Raine the merchant bank overseeing Chelsea's sale on Friday.

While Goldman's involvement is limited at this stage to an advisory rather than financing role its decision to work with Mr Boehly underlines its apparent status as one of the frontrunners to succeed Roman Abramovich as the Blues' owner.

Spokesmen for Goldman and Mr Boehly both declined to comment on Saturday.

News of the Wall Street bank's role comes less than 24 hours after Sky News revealed that Clearlake Capital a California-based investment firm had joined the consortium which also includes Hansjorg Wyss a Swiss businessman and Jonathan Goldstein a London-based property investor.

Raine is expected to whittle down dozens of preliminary offers to fewer than a handful in the next few days leading to more serious and detailed negotiations with the remaining contenders.

Sources said the bid led by Mr Boehly was now ""overfunded"" meaning that it like a number of Chelsea's other prospective buyers have secured more capital than they are likely to require to buy the club.

This is largely because of the truncated timetable on which the sale process is being conducted following the sanctioning of Roman Abramovich the Blues' owner since 2003.

Lord Finkelstein a Times journalist and Barbara Charone a celebrity publicist would join Chelsea's board as non-executive directors if the Boehly bid is successful it emerged this week.

Image: Chelsea fans in the stands stands during a Premier League match at Stamford Bridge London

A source close to the group said its offer could be implemented rapidly and that the required capital was ready to be deployed immediately paving the way for a rapid change of ownership at Stamford Bridge.

Mr Boehly's consortium would provide long-term funding for Chelsea including the redevelopment of its Stamford Bridge home its academy and its women's team the source added.

Other bidders seen as viable contenders include: a group - also revealed by Sky News - comprising the Ricketts family which owns the Chicago Cubs baseball team and Ken Griffin the American hedge fund billionaire; Nick Candy the property entrepreneur; and Sir Martin Broughton whose involvement in the auction was first reported by Sky News last weekend.

On Friday Mr Candy's bid - through a vehicle called the Blue Football Consortium - confirmed that it had secured financial backing from two South Korean companies among a consortium of global investors.

""Chelsea is one of the most iconic and successful professional football clubs in the world with a rich heritage global following and a highly valuable brand"" Mr Candy said.

Image: Todd Boehly part owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers attends the Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation Blue Diamond Gala at Dodgers Stadium on Thursday July 28 2016 in Los Angeles. Pic: AP

""Football clubs are vitally important community and cultural assets and this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to give football back to the fans and put them at the heart of the operations and strategy of a leading global football club.""

The bid led by Sir Martin which includes the support of Lord Coe the former British Olympian is being backed by the American hedge fund billionaire and sports investor Josh Harris.

Sky News reported last weekend that Sir Martin was in talks with Mr Harris about a joint offer for Chelsea.

""I have a track record of success in boardrooms throughout my career and I have done this before"" Sir Martin the former British Airways chairman said.

""I remain the only person to have effected a change of ownership at a major football club in a similar situation which I did at Liverpool 12 years ago.

""But most importantly as a lifelong fan I am committed to ensuring Chelsea maintains its preeminent position at the top of European football and making sure we put fans first.""

Chelsea is operating under a government-issued licence which imposes strict spending limits on the club and which prevents it from selling new match tickets or merchandise.

Last week Chelsea's corporate credit cards were frozen by Barclays as the British bank sought to clarify the implications of the sanctions against Mr Abramovich deepening the sense of anxiety surrounding the club's finances.

Chelsea face Middlesbrough in the FA Cup quarter-final on Saturday evening following a row this week over the London club's hastily withdrawn request that the match be played behind closed doors for reasons of ""sporting integrity"".

A quickfire sale of Chelsea is seen as essential if it is to remain solvent and therefore retain the nucleus of a playing squad which has become established as one of Europe's most successful under Mr Abramovich's ownership during the last two decades.

The government has been clear that none of the proceeds from a takeover could flow to the Russian-born billionaire.

The cluster of American investors circling Chelsea underlines the extent to which the English Premier League has become a magnet for financiers from across the Atlantic during the last 20 years.

Arsenal Liverpool and Manchester United have all been acquired by US-based businessmen during that period and a significant number of other top-flight clubs also have American backing.

Last season's Champions League-winners have been thrown into disarray by Russia's war on Ukraine with Mr Abramovich initially proposing to place the club in the care of its foundation and then formally putting it up for sale.

Mr Abramovich had initially slapped a £3bn price tag on the Stamford Bridge outfit with the net proceeds being donated to a charitable foundation set up to benefit the victims of the war in Ukraine.

The value of the bids tabled on Friday remains unclear however.

Last week Chelsea sponsors such as Three UK the mobile telecoms network and Hyundai the Korean car-maker announced that they were suspending their association with the club.

Whoever buys the club will require the government's consent in the form of a special licence as well as the approval of the Premier League under its fit and proper ownership test.",,,,,,,,,

This compares to earnings of $0.87 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 34.52%. A quarter ago it was expected that this ingredients producer for food cosmetics and consumer products industries would post earnings of $0.75 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.72 delivering a surprise of -4%.

Over the last four quarters the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.

International Flavors  which belongs to the Zacks Consumer Products - Staples industry posted revenues of $2.9 billion for the quarter ended March 2024 surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.35%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.03 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

International Flavors shares have added about 7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 7.5%.

What's Next for International Flavors?

While International Flavors has underperformed the market so far this year the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s) but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release the estimate revisions trend for International Flavors: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Story continues

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.89 on $2.76 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.68 on $10.91 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank Consumer Products - Staples is currently in the top 24% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Another stock from the same industry Chewy (CHWY) has yet to report results for the quarter ended April 2024.

This online pet store is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.21 per share in its upcoming report which represents a year-over-year change of +5%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

Chewy's revenues are expected to be $2.87 billion up 2.9% from the year-ago quarter.

Groceries cost more gas costs more everything seems to cost more. This past week the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in an effort to tame the highest inflation in 40 years.

The cost of rent is really through the roof. Residential rents across the country went up an average of 15% last year – nearly twice the overall inflation rate. That's particularly painful for tenants because according to Census Bureau data they now often have to spend as much as half their total income on rent.

Why are rents rising so much? Well it turns out that big Wall Street firms are playing a role but we found the fundamental problem was years in the making…and will take years to fix.

Lesley Stahl: How much did your rent go up?

Justin Blocki: They attempted to raise it $400 a month.

That would have been a 40% jump for Justin Blocki and Brittney House. She's a nursing student and he's an occupational therapist in Jacksonville Florida. When they first rented their apartment a year and a half ago they were paying just over a thousand dollars a month.

Justin Blocki and Brittney House

Justin Blocki: I eventually came to terms with them for a 30% increase which was $300.

Lesley Stahl: Still 30%--

Justin Blocki: I've never heard of anything like that.

Lesley Stahl: Do you know why your rent jumped that much?

Justin Blocki: They told me the market justified it. And they were right. Because I looked at 30 other apartments and they were all way too-- too much for us to afford.

Lesley Stahl: So when your rent goes up 30% what's the impact? Are you having to give things up?

Brittney House: Yeah our fridge is-- does not look the same as last year before our lease.

Lesley Stahl: Really--

Brittney House: It's-- yeah--

Lesley Stahl: You're really cutting back on groceries.

Brittney House: Yeah.

Daryl Fairweather: It's pretty much universally true rents are going up all around the country. But it's even more severe in migration destinations. Like the sunbelt of the country Austin Phoenix Florida. A lotta people are moving there and there's just more demand for rents.

Daryl Fairweather is the chief economist at Redfin a nationwide real estate brokerage firm that pulls together real-time statistics on both the sales and rental markets. For example their numbers show that rents increased 31% in Jacksonville last year 40% in Austin Texas.

Lesley Stahl: What's causing this?

Daryl Fairweather: We are not building enough housing for everybody who needs a place to live. We built fewer homes in the 2010s than in any decade going back to the 1960s and at the same time millennials are the biggest generation and they're entering into home-buying age. Millennials aren't living in their parents' basement any more or shacking up with roommates they want a place of their own and we didn't build any housing for them in the last decade because we are still so traumatized by the last housing crisis. We didn't put any investment into housing.

Daryl Fairweather

In the economic crisis of 2008 and 2009 construction of new housing came to a grinding halt. But even when the economy recovered home construction didn't.

Lesley Stahl: So how big is the rental shortage in the United States?

Daryl Fairweather: The government has estimated that we are short about 4 million homes in this country and that number is likely growing especially since the pandemic.

Lesley Stahl: 4 million shy.

Daryl Fairweather: Yes. That's the hole that we're in that we need to build ourselves out of.

Lesley Stahl: That number 4 million is that mainly in the south and southwest? Or does that include New York City and San Francisco?

Daryl Fairweather: That's the entire country.

With something as essential as housing in such short supply you'd have to figure that Wall Street would see an opportunity buying modest single-family houses the kind you'd see on any middle class suburban street and then renting them out.

Daryl Fairweather: In places like Jacksonville Atlanta Charlotte investors are buying almost 30% of the homes that are available for regular home buyers.

Gary Berman: This is a home we bought. This is 3518 Shiner Drive in Jacksonville.

Lesley Stahl: Right.

Gary Berman: This home is 1700 square feet.

Lesley Stahl: How many bedrooms?

Gary Berman: Three bedrooms. Two baths. It was built about three years ago.

Gary Berman is CEO of Tricon Residential a Toronto-based company that has quietly become one of the largest owners of single-family homes in the United States.

Gary Berman: So today we own about 30000 single family rental homes across the U.S. largely in the Sun Belt. And we've got probably about 75000 people living in our homes.

Lesley Stahl: You are a multi-billion dollar company. You're publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

Gary Berman: Correct.

Lesley Stahl: And the--

Gary Berman: Toronto Stock Exchange.

Lesley Stahl: --Toronto Stock Exchange. I even read in one of your own documents that your revenue went up last year by 67%? Is that correct?

Gary Berman: Yeah-- we're expanding. I mean when you think about it we have an incredible amount of demand for what we do. So Lesley in any given week we might have two or 300 homes available.

Lesley Stahl: For renting?

Gary Berman: For renting. And we get about 10000 leasing inquiries a week.

Gary Berman

Tricon is trying to buy 800 houses a month and there are companies even bigger. Invitation Homes owns more than 80000 rental houses American Homes 4 Rent close to 60000. Some of the all stars of finance – Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Blackstone - have put hundreds of millions of dollars into these companies. They all offer rental homes online and all focus on the sunbelt.

Gary Berman: Our largest-- portfolio w-- would be in Atlanta in Charlotte in Phoenix in Tampa.

Lesley Stahl: And those are the cities that young millennials are flocking to?

Gary Berman: This is where Americans wanna be. We're finding that Americans are moving from the Northeast from the Midwest to move to the Sun Belt because taxes are lower. It's a friendlier business environment. It's better weather. And so there's a movement taking place. And the pandemic unleashed powerful nesting trends and work-from-home trends.

Lesley Stahl: Nesting trends?

Gary Berman: Powerful nesting trends. When we survey our residents 'Why did they move-- to be with us?' The number one reason is they want more space.

Lesley Stahl: Big investment companies like yours are being blamed for this huge increase in rents across the country. And you can set the rent any way you want really given the demand you're talking about.

Gary Berman: First. I mean corporate landlords represent 2% of all single-family rental housing. So there's a lot more going on than just corporate landlords bidding up homes. It's a very competitive and difficult environment.

It's true that big investors don't own nearly as many houses as mom-and-pop landlords people who might have just a few properties. But big firms like Tricon do play a larger – and growing – role in the sunbelt cities where they're active.

Rent increases are all over the map: 35% in New York but just 9% in Chicago. 29% in Portland only 10% in LA. And in only one big city were rents actually down last year: Kansas City.

Berman says Tricon strictly caps how much it will raise rent on existing tenants when they renew their leases.

Lesley Stahl: But let's say I had come in as a new renter here. Would the rent here be 30% more than it was about a year ago?

Gary Berman: It could be. Because it-- we-- when we come in and buy a home we have to pay a market price for the home. And then we have to set a market rent right?

Here are two examples of homes Tricon recently bought in Jacksonville. This one they're charging 40% higher rent than the previous owner asked this one 30% higher.

These before-and-after pictures taken by Tricon show how they fix up many of the houses they buy. They also have a fleet of trucks and technicians to service them.

Gary Berman: This is-- a standard Tricon home.

Lesley Stahl: And you put in the kitchen? These-- you put in the appliances--

Gary Berman: This home was built three years ago. We put in about $15000. Most of our homes are a little bit older. We probably put in about twenty or $25000. This is very typical of what our product looks like when you move into it. It's in move-in-ready condition. It's broom swept.

Lesley Stahl: And if things go wrong-- if there's a leak--

Gary Berman: If things go wrong--

Lesley Stahl: We call you.

Gary Berman: If we have a leaky faucet or the-- you know oven or microwave's not working you will call us. You'll call and our maintenance techs will come and-- and service the home.

The houses Tricon and other investors are buying in places like Jacksonville are what might be called ""starter homes"" usually selling for about $300000. When one of those comes on the market investors are ready with all-cash offers.

Heather Kruayai: I would say probably a third of the listings that I'm putting up are getting investor offers.

Heather Kruayai

Heather Kruayai is a Redfin real estate agent in Jacksonville. She represents both buyers and sellers.

Heather Kruayai: You are seeing a lot of these Wall Street investors that are coming in. You know you put a house on the market and within an hour I'm getting offers full price cash. And so these-- the sellers are seeing that and-- ""Oh okay. Cash. We can close in 15 days."" It's very enticing to people when they see that offer come across.

Lesley Stahl: So when you sell are you having to stage the house? Paint it? Put furniture in make it look really nice?

Heather Kruayai: Not now. It's not necessary now in this-- this way the way the market's going now. You really don't need to do anything to your house to sell it. Typically the-- investors never look at the home. Never.

Lesley Stahl: They don't even look at the home?

Heather Kruayai: They never look at it.

That plus the fact that investors often waive inspections puts would-be first-time home buyers at a serious disadvantage. Before they can even see a starter house it's gone.

Justin Blocki: Most people our age are not gonna be able to have $350000 in liquid cash.

Justin and Brittney the young Jacksonville couple facing steep rent increases are starting to lose hope they'll ever be able to buy a home.

Even Tricon's own presentation to investors says quote ""homeownership is increasingly out of reach.""

Gary Berman: In our portfolio the majority cannot buy a home. Cannot afford to buy a home or don't have the credit to buy the home. So for example they may have student debt or they may have medical debt. And therefore they can't qualify to get a mortgage. And if they want access to a single family home which we think's incredibly important this is the best way to-- for them to obtain it.

I think if you asked a lot of millennials and that tends to be our primary resident-- they would probably tell you they don't necessarily desire to own a home or to own a car. They've grown up in the sharing economy. And for what's important to them is lifestyle right? And so if they can move into this what we call a turnkey or a hotel ready home and have a low-maintenance lifestyle that's very compelling for them. Very compelling.

Lesley Stahl: We were told by the head of one of these big companies that people your age want to rent that you're not as interested in buying a house.

Justin Blocki: No. I mean (LAUGH) I think the American Dream is owning your own property and having your own dirt that you own. And that's specifically why we moved here was to own a house.

Brittney House: I realize my first house is probably going to be a starter home. It may not be that dream house but it's a house. It's a home. Now the-- our dream is now unattainable. It's-- it's very-- it's disturbing.

Daryl Fairweather: Most people desire that single-family home with the picket fence. And if they can't buy it because they can't afford it their only option is to rent it.

Lesley Stahl: Yeah but the investor's buying it.

Daryl Fairweather: Yeah and they're getting that wealth that normally or in previous years would've gone to the person living there.

Lesley Stahl: So what's happened to the American dream? When we used to say that it meant owning a house. What's the American dream now?

Gary Berman: Well if we think the American dream is-- is embodied in a suburban home with a yard and-- and a white picket fence then I think we're making the American dream much more accessible.

Lesley Stahl: Rent your American dream.

Gary Berman: You can rent the American dream.

That is if you can afford the rent.

An esteemed vocalist and songwriting mainstay Johnson got his invite on Saturday night (March 19) during a writers round at the Opry that also featured the legendary likes of Buddy Cannon and Whisperin' Bill Anderson.

Anderson who is the senior-most Grand Ole Opry member did the honors of asking Johnson to become a member. He began his invitation with a joke telling Johnson -- who debuted on the Opry stage 17 years ago -- that that night would mark his last appearance as a guest performer.

""Well I've been kicked out of a whole lot of places"" Johnson joked back before Anderson gave the big reveal that the next time he played the stage Johnson would be an official member.

He was so overcome by the emotion of the moment that he needed a little prompting from Anderson to actually say ""yes"" to the invitation. ""I accepted it 20 years ago! I really don't know what to say except the obvious"" Johnson finally replied. ""I love country music. I would have never moved here if it wasn't for that; for the Opry keeping it alive and for the fans. I love you. Thank you.""

A mainstay in the country genre since the mid-2000s Johnson charted a Top 10 hit with his song ""In Color"" which also won Song of the Year at the 2009 CMA Awards. Cannon who was also on the bill the night that Johnson got his Opry invite produced Johnson's 2006 debut album The Dollar. Cannon Johnson and Anderson co-wrote ""Give it Away"" which was a hit for George Strait in '06. The song was inspired by Johnson's divorce.

Johnson has remained an in-demand songwriter in Nashville circles; he has co-written songs for Willie Nelson Merle Haggard Trace Adkins Joe Nichols and many more. An official Grand Ole Opry induction date will be announced soon.

Snowflake partners including systems integrators ISVs technology partners and third-party data providers are expected to leverage the capabilities of the new Snowflake Healthcare & Life Sciences Data Cloud.

Snowflake has unveiled a new data cloud service targeting the healthcare and life sciences space making good on the company’s stated strategy to increase its focus on specific vertical industries to maintain its rapid growth.

The new Healthcare & Life Sciences Data Cloud unveiled this week will provide healthcare and life sciences solutions for partners and enable them to develop their own solutions – both leveraging the interoperability and data sharing capabilities of the Snowflake platform.

The Snowflake announcement is indicative of efforts by leading IT vendors including Databricks and ServiceNow to build on their core systems with applications and services for vertical markets – creating opportunities for channel partners along the way.

The new Healthcare & Life Sciences Data Cloud centralizes integrates and exchanges high volumes of cross-cloud data at scale while ensuring high levels of data security and governance said Todd Crosslin healthcare and life sciences industry principal at Snowflake in an interview with CRN.

The new service is expected to attract healthcare providers seeking ways to leverage healthcare data including unstructured data such as clinical documents DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) files and radiology images to improve healthcare delivery and patient outcomes and enhance clinical and operational decision making.

Life sciences companies including pharmaceutical companies can use the service to integrate and analyze healthcare and clinical trial data for drug development purposes.

“There’s just tons and tons of unstructured data in our ecosystem” Crosslin said pointing to the healthcare and life science companies and organizations that Snowflake already works with including Anthem IQVIA Komodo Health Novartis Siemens Healthineers and Spectrum Health.

Snowflake sees vertical industries including healthcare and life sciences as key to helping the data cloud company maintain its rapid rate of growth. During a second quarter earnings call in August 2021 CEO Frank Slootman said Snowflake was putting increased emphasis on developing data services for clients in vertical industries such as financial services retail and consumer packaged goods manufacturing public sector education and advertising/media/entertainment.

Snowflake isn’t alone in targeting the healthcare space. Data lakehouse platform developer Databricks launched its Databricks Lakehouse for Healthcare and Life Sciences on March 9 targeting data management analytics and advanced AI use cases for disease prediction medical image classification biomarker discovery and other tasks according to the company.

That announcement was the latest of Databricks’ own growing portfolio of vertical industry-focused services following the debut of Databricks Lakehouse for Retail in January and Databricks Lakehouse for Financial Services in February.

Beyond the data management arena ServiceNow unveiled a strategy in 2020 to develop workflow solutions on its core Now Platform for specific industries including telecommunications banking and manufacturing.

In addition to tapping into the data sharing and collaboration capabilities of the Snowflake platform the Healthcare & Life Science Data Cloud leverages the Snowpark developer framework that developers data engineers and data scientists use to create data applications and manage pipeline and machine learning workflows.

“This is applying the workload capabilities of Snowflake to healthcare and life sciences” Crosslin said. “For our partners it’s really taking advantage of Snowpark and building solutions that are native to Snowflake. It’s a huge deal for our partners.”

The new service supports industry data governance and security requirements and standards including HIPAA and HITRUST and GxP compatibility audits. It supports the OHDSI OMOP data model and ecosystem according to Snowflake and can process and run HL7/FHIR messages.

Solutions and services developed and delivered by partners are a critical element of the Healthcare & Life Science Data Cloud Crosslin said. That includes systems integrators and consulting service partners such as Cognizant Deloitte Infosys and NTT Data who are already building solutions for their clients on the new platform.

Also benefiting from the new offering are ISVs and application developers in the vendor’s Powered by Snowflake program including Health Catalyst Strata and IQVIA who are building software – including analytics-as-a-service applications – that run on the Healthcare & Life Science Data Cloud.

The Healthcare & Life Science Data Cloud also enables third-party healthcare and life sciences data providers in the Snowflake Data Marketplace including Compile Equifax Invitae and SameSky Health who can market data without the need for data copying and data movement. And Snowflake’s technology partners including machine learning technology providers Dataiku and H2o.ai and data analytics tool supplier ThoughtSpot also work with data provided through the new cloud service.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Two Hall of Fame coaches. Two national-championship winners. Two good friends. But maybe the simplest way to understand what separates the coaches from even the best of their peers is to start here:

Duke and Michigan State have not looked outside of their own campuses for a coach in 40 years. Kansas has. Kentucky does it with almost every hire. UCLA does it all the time. Even North Carolina which believes it has the best family atmosphere in college basketball has done it twice (though both times UNC hired alums).

But Duke hired Krzyzewski in 1980. Michigan State promoted Izzo to replace his mentor Jud Heathcote in 1995. The two have maintained—and benefited from—stability in an extremely volatile sport creating a cycle of success that is self-perpetuating. Private Duke touts its Brotherhood; public Michigan State loves its Spartan Dawgs. The effect is the same.

This will be Krzyzewski and Izzo’s sixth meeting in the NCAA tournament. Above they shake hands at the 2015 Final Four. Bob Donnan/USA TODAY Sports

To players at Duke and MSU the coach is the school. This gives Krzyzewski and Izzo credibility in recruiting authority during rigorous practices and trust in the final minutes of a tight NCAA tournament game. It all rests on an understanding that serves the subfloor for both programs: For decades players who put their faith in these two coaches were ultimately happy that they did. So many coaches talk about wanting to give their players a great collegiate experience and a lot of them even mean it but it’s hard when the coach is one season from either getting fired or jumping to a better job.

They have both evolved from scrappy underdogs—Krzyzewski trying to catch up to Dean Smith Izzo bristling under Michigan’s shadow—and they know it too.

“We have two of the best programs in sport not just in basketball” Krzyzewski said in 2019 after beating Izzo’s Spartans in East Lansing. “We have it because of the values and the standards the principles that he evokes and we do too. And it started with Jud [Heathcote] too. I mean Michigan State is the crème de la crème and we are too. There’s not one. When you are that you have ultimate respect for the guy leading the other group. …. Their former players are like our former players. They feel like they are part of a family. When you have that continuity then those players come back and there's family. Not many programs—hardly any programs have that. They do and we do.”

Izzo would never speak like that. One of his biggest fears in life is having anybody in his little Upper Peninsula hometown of Iron Mountain thinking he has gotten too full of himself. But he knows what Krzyzewski said is true and that knowledge has comforted him at this stage of his career.

After Michigan State’s first three Final Fours consecutively from 1999 to 2001 Izzo alternately chafed whenever somebody said his program was falling off and worried when it looked like it was. In recent years as he kept winning Izzo has grown more secure in his standing. Losses still bother him but don’t consume him in the same way. Cheating coaches still piss him off but don’t hit the same nerve. In conversations he seems far more worried about the future of college basketball than of his program.

One of the greatest compliments Izzo’s program has received is on display every November. The Champions Classic features four teams: Kansas Kentucky Duke and Michigan State. When Izzo became head coach it would have been ridiculous to group Michigan State with those other three. In the last decade nobody has thought twice about it.

And yet Krzyzewski has gotten Duke to a place even Michigan State hasn’t reached. He is 12–3 against Izzo. (Izzo joked this weekend that “I’ve gotta be his favorite coach because he’s beaten us like a drum.”) There was a time this would have made Izzo angry; now he sees it in the proper context. Duke usually beats Michigan State because Duke usually beats everybody. Duke almost always has more talent than Michigan State. It’s not an indictment of Izzo or his program. In any matchup of great coaches the team with better players usually wins.

As they gear up to meet Sunday in the NCAA tournament second round Duke has better players again. What Michigan State has is a foundation a culture of relentlessness and a coaching staff that is great at finding subtle strategic advantages especially this time of year. Izzo surely knows what he is up against: Not just Paolo Banchero and Wendell Moore and AJ Griffin and Mark Williams but a culture that runs as deep as Michigan State’s a coach who still stays up late watching film and a staff that also excels at finding subtle strategic advantages.

This weekend Izzo gave Krzyzewski’s program the greatest compliment Izzo can give anyone the one he always hopes applies to himself: “It’s been earned” Izzo said. “It’s not been given. It’s been earned.”

This company which is in the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Services industry shows potential for another earnings beat.

This payment processsing company has an established record of topping earnings estimates especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7.38%.

For the last reported quarter Jack Henry came out with earnings of $1.22 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 per share representing a surprise of 7.02%. For the previous quarter the company was expected to post earnings of $1.29 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.39 per share delivering a surprise of 7.75%.

Price and EPS Surprise

For Jack Henry estimates have been trending higher thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words if you have 10 stocks with this combination the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Jack Henry has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% at the moment suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 7 2024.

With the Earnings ESP metric it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Jacobs who is running to represent California's 26th District in Ventura County and parts of northern Los Angeles believes the concept of the American Dream has been passed down through generations in his family touching his father and uncle and eventually himself.

Jacobs' grandparents who were born in Poland survived World War II and the Holocaust before immigrating to New York with ""no money no family"" and no knowledge of the English language. His grandfather worked as a tailor for decades before eventually opening up his own tailor shop. His grandmother was a laundrywoman and a seamstress.

After studying international relations and security law at Princeton University and law at New York University he realized the best way to use ""that skillset and service in the country was as a prosecutor in the counterterrorism space.""

GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM ROASTED FOR TELLING DISNEY TO ‘BRING BACK JOBS’ TO CALIFORNIA: ‘GOOD LUCK WITH THAT'

Jacobs now a father of three began his career as a prosecutor in Brooklyn working crimes-against-children and child trafficking cases. He recalled one defendant — a child trafficker — who branded 12 and 13-year-old girls with gun tattoos on their faces. He then moved to the Organized Crime Unit where he focused on Russian organized crime before eventually being promoted to the National Security Unit where his job was to ""investigate and prosecute high-level terrorists that our military or allied militaries captured after 2008.""

One of his most high-profile counterterrorism cases was that of Ibrahim Suleiman Adnan Adam Harun an Al-Qaeda operative from Niger who killed two U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan and conspired to attack a U.S. embassy in Nigeria in the early 2000s.

CALIFORNIA MURDER VICTIM'S FAMILY APPALLED BY GASCON PUSH TO DROP KILLER'S DEATH SENTENCE

""I spent my career prosecuting some of our country's worst enemies and most dangerous criminals and … I loved every second of that job I never wanted to leave it. But the reality is while I was spending the 16 18-hour days focused on individual bad actors it felt like the far left was taking this country in a very dangerous direction"" Jacobs said. ""And so I decided to leave that job and run for Congress in my hometown here in Ventura County California. And my mission writ large is just to defend the American dream.""

Jacobs also believes the American Dream is still alive and well today despite the insistence from some pundits and politicians that the dream is dying or no longer achievable for certain people.

""[I]t drives me crazy when I hear the far left saying that the American dream is dead or not accessible to certain people because I know it's alive and well My family's proof of it. … That's how I grew up — very proud and grateful to be an American wanting to give back.""

LOS ANGELES DA GASCON GIVES ‘TIPS’ ON HOW TO AVOID AUTO THIEVES AMID CRIME WAVE

Ventura County home of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library has been represented by Democratic incumbent Julia Brownley since 2013. But Jacobs believes it's time for change particularly as voters express concerns about education in the wake of COVID-19 school shutdowns; the economy and record-high prices at the gas pump and in grocery stores; and rising violent crime in traditionally safe neighborhoods.

Jacobs criticized Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascon for ""effectively legalizing crime"" in LA County where about 7% of the 26th District is located.

""He's putting the interests of criminals before the well-being of victims law-abiding citizens and society generally"" Jacobs said. ""And the tragedy is that criminals have received that message. And they don't respect invisible county lines. So what we're seeing here are skyrocketing crime rates smash and grab lootings home invasions burglaries follow-home [robberies] murders even. There was a carjacking and pistol-whipping in a nice part of our district — a place where you'd go out on a date with your spouse. And these are crimes that we just haven't seen before.""

The portion of LA County in the 26th District is ""very safe historically"" but is currently seeing ""an uptick in these scary violent crimes are making it such that crime is not an abstract issue anymore to a lot of people in middle-class communities in this district"" Jacobs said.

Jacobs argued that the solution to crime in LA County and elsewhere in California is to ""stop demonizing police"" and implement programs like the Justice Department-backed ""Project Safe Neighborhoods"" which brings local law enforcement prosecutors and community leaders together to target local crime.

The second day of the World Athletics Indoor Championships in Belgrade (SRB) produced more fireworks more history and an inspirational win for Ukraine with:

● Men/60 m: 6.41 Lamont Marcell Jacobs (ITA) and Christian Coleman (USA)

● Men/Shot Put: 22.53 m (73-11) Darlan Romani (BRA)

● Men/Heptathlon: 6489 Damian Warner (CAN)

● Women/High Jump: 2.02 m (6-7 1/2) Yaroslava Manuchikh (UKR)

That’s a total of nine world-leading performances for 2022 with a full day remaining! Here’s what happened on Saturday:

● Men/60 m: The semifinal winners were American Marvin Bracy (6.51) Italy’s Olympic 100 m titlist Lamont Marcell Jacobs (6.45 equaled the world lead) and defending champ Christian Coleman of the U.S. (6.51). Bracy ran a personal best 6.46 in the heats.

Coleman got out best in the final and looked strong past 50 m but Jacobs and Bracy were coming hard at the finish. It was too close to call at the line and it took what seemed like forever for the top two to be determined.

It was Jacobs timed in 6.41 the same as Coleman who was called the winner with Bracy third in 6.44. The timer saw Jacobs at 6.407 with 6.410 for Coleman; Jacobs moves to equal-fourth-best all-time both with the no. 8 performance in history.

● Men/400 m: Trinidad & Tobago’s Jareem Richards better known as a 200 m Worlds bronze medalist from 2017 started on the outside in the final and ran hard from the start to take the lead at the break. But he was stalked by American Trevor Bassitt of Ashland University who charged off the final turn but could not catch Richards 45.00-45.05 nos. 2-4 on the indoor year list. Sweden’s Carl Bengstrom got third at 45.33. American Marqueze Washington was sixth (46.85).

● Men/800 m: The final saw Canada’s Marco Arop take the lead and try to run away from everyone crossing 400 m in 50.34 (!). But on the final lap Sweden’s Andreas Kramer was the first to challenge joined by world leader Mariano Garcia (ESP) and Kenyan Noah Kibet.

Garcia pushed hard around the turn and came into the straight with the lead followed by Kibet with Arop dropping back. A tight chase pack broke up as Bryce Hoppel of the U.S. emerged on the straight to get third 1:46.20-1:46.35-1:46.51. Fellow American Isaiah Harris faded to seventh (1:47.00) with Arop finishing eighth (1:47.58).

● Men/Shot: Expected to be a showdown between Olympic champ Ryan Crouser (USA) and New Zealand’s two-time indoor Worlds winner Tom Walsh and after Walsh opened in the lead at 22.29 m (73-1 3/4) in the first round Crouser did better and took over at 22.44 m (73-7 1/2).

In the third round Brazil’s Darlan Romani – the Olympic fourth-placer – exploded with an indoor best at 22.53 m (73-11) and took the lead with the best throw of 2022! Crouser responded with a fourth-round 22.32 m (73-2 3/4) but stayed in second.

In the final round Walsh got out to 22.31 m (73-2 1/2) an improvement but still in third place. Crouser finished with a 21.93 m (71-11 1/2) and had to settle for silver after 26 straight wins. Romani claimed the upset and the world title after being fourth at the 2018 World Indoors 2019 World Championships and in Tokyo last summer. Wow.

American Josh Owotunde stood fifth at 21.70 m (71-2 1/2) going into the final round and got a giant throw that was called foul.

● Men/Heptathlon: The event was dominated by Olympic decathlon champion Damien Warner of Canada who took the lead in the 60 m and continued to the no. 5 performance of all time at 6489 easily the best in 2022. Only American icon Ashton Eaton has scored more four times. Simon Ehammer (SUI) got the silver at 6363 now no. 14 all-time. The bronze went to Australia’s Ashley Moloney (6344). Steven Bastien of the U.S. was sixth (6074). American Garrett Scantling was fourth after the first day but could not go on Saturday due to food poisoning.

● Women/400 m: Could anyone beat Olympic champ Shaunae Miller-Uibo in the women’s 400 m? No. Miller-Uibo starting on the far outside took the lead from the start and no one could mount a serious challenge. Only Dutch star Femke Bol – the 400 m hurdles bronze winner in Tokyo – got close finishing a clear second 50.31-50.57. Miller-Uibo winning time was the second-best on the season 0.01 from Bol’s 50.30. The bronze went to Jamaican Stephenie Ann McPherson (50.79).

● Women/1500 m: World leader Gudaf Tsegay of Ethiopia left no doubt about being the class of the field running away from the start passing 800 m in 2:06.17 and winning in 3:57.19 at the head of an Ethiopian sweep: the first ever in a World Indoors. She finished her last 400 m in 62.89.

She was followed by Axumawalt Embaye (4:02.29) and Hirut Meshesha (4:03.39); Uganda’s Winnie Nanyondo passed American Josette Norris for fourth with about 100 m left and they finished in 4:04.60 and 4:04.71. American Heather MacLean was seventh in 4:06.38.

● Women/60 m hurdles: Devynne Charlton (BAH) led the qualifying at 7.81 but the final was going to be close. Charlton and France’s Cyrena Samba-Mayela were stride for stride for most of the race but Samba-Mayela took the lead over the final hurdle and held on for the run-in winning in 7.78 a national indoor record.

Charlton was second in 7.81 equaling her national mark and American Gabbi Cunningham was steady over the final half of the race to get third in 7.87.

● Women/ High Jump: This was held in the morning session with a heartwarming victory for Ukraine’s Tokyo Olympic bronze medalist Yaroslava Manuchikh in a world-leading 2.02 m (6-7 1/2) on her first attempt. That was enough to shake former world leader Eleanor Patterson of Australia who cleared a season-best (and national indoor record) 2.00 m (6-6 3/4) on her second try. Patterson missed once then moved to 2.04 m (6-8 1/4) but missed twice. Nadezhda Dubovitskaya (KAZ) won the bronze at 1.98 m (6-6). American Rachel McCoy was 12th (1.84 m/6-0 1/2).

● Women/Pole Vault: The critical height was 4.70 m (15-5) cleared immediately by 2018 World Indoor Champion Sandi Morris of the U.S. and Tokyo gold medalist Katie Nageotte. It took former Arkansas star Tina Sutej (SLO) three times to make it but she joined the Americans at 4.75 m (15-7) with the medals decided. All cleared 4.75 m on their first tries and the bar moved to 4.80 m (15-9).

All three missed twice but then Morris cleared on her third try to take the lead. Sutej wasn’t close and had to settle for bronze. Nageotte had the height but hit he bar on the way down giving her the silver and Morris a repeat world indoor championship. She tried 4.90 m (15-0 3/4) but missed all three times.

Through two of three days the U.S. leads the medal table with an astonishing 15 (1-7-7) to five for Ethiopia (2-1-2); no other country has more than two. In the eight-places-score placing table the U.S. leads Ethiopia 133-39 with Switzerland third at 24. The meet concludes tomorrow.

In the end it happened just as Jacobs shock winner at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics had predicted as he kept in touch with the superfast-starting Coleman - who missed the Olympics due to a six-month ban for anti-doping whereabouts failures - and then won on the dip.

Coleman defending the title he won four years ago in Birmingham was also credited with 6.41 with bronze going to Coleman’s compatriot Marvin Bracy in a personal best of 6.44.

The United States had earlier suffered another significant reverse in the men’s shot put where their double Olympic champion and world indoor and outdoor world record holder Ryan Crouser suffered a rare defeat.

The mighty American had to give best to the amiable Brazilian Darlan Romani who inflicted upon him his first loss since the epic Doha 2019 World Championships final.

Romani who has come so close to big medals in recent years - fifth at the Rio 2016 Olympics fourth at Doha 2019 fourth again at Tokyo 2020 - hit the spot in the Stark Arena with a Championship record of 22.53 metres which tops this year’s world lists.

It had appeared to be business as usual for Crouser as he opened with a Championship record of 22.44 metres but he could not improve upon it even after Romani attained peak performance in round three.

New Zealand’s Tom Walsh seeking a third consecutive title earned bronze after equalling his own Oceania indoor record of 22.31m.

But the United States had a far happier time in the women’s pole vault where Sandi Morris became only the second woman in history to successfully defend the world indoor pole vault title as her third-time clearance of 4.80 metres proved decisive.

An early failure at 4.60m put Morris behind on countback for the majority of the competition as her team-mate Olympic champion Katie Nageotte who has been hampered by an ankle injury sailed over four consecutive heights at the first attempt before 4.80m proved too much.

If ever an athlete deserved a turn of luck it was Morris one of only four women athletes to have cleared 5.00m whose ambitions of adding Olympic gold to the silver she won at Rio 2016 ended when she was injured when her pole snapped in mid-air during a rainswept qualifying session.

A blistering start by double Olympic 400 metres champion Shaunae Miller-Uibo earned her a first world indoor title as the Bahamian athlete held off the late charge of 21-year-old Dutch athlete Femke Bol to win in 50.31sec.

Bol the Olympic 400m hurdles bronze medallist had fallen onto her face over the line as she tried in vain to overtake Jamaica’s 33-year-old Stephenie Ann McPherson in her semi-final.

But she showed no ill effects as she sought to apply pressure to her 27-year-old rival who had won only one previous indoor medal - world bronze at Sopot in 2014.

Bol clocked 50.57 and McPherson earned bronze in a national indoor record of 50.79.

Ethiopia’s world record holder Gudaf Tsegay was in a class of her own in the women’s 1500m final - as were Ethiopia as a team in winning gold silver and bronze on the night.

But Tsegay who set her record of 3min 53.09sec in Lievin last year finished more than 30 metres clear of her team-mates Axumawit Embaye and Hirut Meshesha in a Championship record of 3:57.19.

Jereem Richards of Trinidad and Tobago fully honoured his late friend and team-mate Deon Lendore killed in a car crash two months ago by winning the men’s 400 metres title in a Championship record of 45.00.

Richards thus became the first athlete from his country to win this title - one to which Lendore twice came close finishing in bronze medal position at this event in Birmingham four years ago and Portland Oregon in 2016.

Trevor Bassitt of the United States was his only serious challenger taking silver in 45.05.

Canada’s Olympic champion Damian Warner missed heptathlon gold by just five points last time round in Birmingham - but four years on he made sure as he restored the lead he had held for the majority of the competition by finishing third in the concluding 1000 metres - and crucially well clear of the leader after six events Switzerland’s Simon Ehammer.

After winning the morning’s pole vault with 5.10m the latter led narrowly from Warner coming into the last event - 5634 points to 5611 - but the Canadian who had a personal best that was superior by around 14 seconds only needed to finish a couple of seconds in front of his 22-year-old rival to resume golden position at the close.

His time of 2:39.56 was amply sufficient as Ehammer came home ninth in 2:53.54 and he ended up breaking the Canadian record he set in 2018 totalling 6489 points.

Ehammer secured silver with a Swiss indoor record of 6363 and Australia’s 22-year-old Tokyo 2020 bronze medallist Ash Moloney - making his indoor competition debut - maintained bronze position as fifth place earned him an area indoor record of 6344.

France’s 21-year-old Cyrena Samba-Mayela who has got better and better in the course of the women’s 60 metres hurdles event came through for a superlative gold in a national record of 7.78 after a performance that was almost faultless.

The men’s 800 metres final was lacking two of the pre-event favourites in Britain’s Elliott Giles second fastest of all time indoors who pulled an intercostal muscle before his heat and Kenya’s Collins Kipruto whose form unravelled dramatically in the final 30 metres of his first race in the arena.

But it was not lacking in excitement or drama.

Manuel Garcia who likes to mime the revving of a motorbike before he starts his races was at full throttle in the closing stages of the men’s 800m final as he hung on to earn Spain’s first gold in the event since the precursor to the first edition in 1985.

After early leader Marco Arop of Canada ran out of gas after 650 metres Garcia moved into the lead and was soon under pressure from the outside lane from Kenya’s extravagant 17-year-old talent Noah Kibet.

But Garcia held on to claim victory in 1:46.20 with Kibet earning silver in 1:46.35 and Bryce Hoppel of the United States coming through for bronze in 1:46.51.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvb3Blci5jb20vODA0MzIyL3RoZS10cmFuc2Zvcm1hdGlvbi1vZi1qYWNvYi1lbG9yZGktZnJvbS1jaGlsZGhvb2QtdG8tZXVwaG9yaWEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Transformation Of Jacob Elordi From Childhood To Euphoria,"Elordi was born in Brisbane in 1997. A self-described ""spoiled"" younger sibling to three older sisters (via GQ) Elordi caught the acting bug at 11. ""When I was 11 ... I went with my dad to see Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight.' I think that was the first time I remember watching Heath Ledger."" It was his countryman's famed ""magic trick"" scene that pushed the young Elordi over the edge. ""I was like 'That's what I want to do. Whatever that is that's what I want to do'"" (via Vogue). His interest blossomed even more in secondary school. ""From when I was 15 years old"" the actor told Esquire Middle East ""I just really liked watching movies and doing plays.""

At the same time Elordi's mother pushed him to try modeling. Luckily for Elordi his 6'5” frame was too tall for the sample sizes. ""I'm very grateful"" he told Men's Health. ""I truly think I would've been miserable if I had to do that."" If Elordi has anything in common with his ""Euphoria"" character it's his natural athleticism for which his staggering height proved to be an advantage. The actor played basketball and rugby while growing up in his native Australia — that is until a back injury sidelined the athlete for good (via Men's Health). The injury gave Elordi whose sights were set on acting the opportunity to focus on his preferred hobby.

Unfortunately Elordi's early auditions didn't prove successful for the young actor. He repeatedly auditioned for the Australian soaps ""Home and Away"" and ""Neighbors"" — shows that helped launch the careers of major names like Heath Ledger Chris Hemsworth and Margot Robbie among others — to no avail. But luckily Elordi stuck with it and we all know how well it's worked out for him so far."

Four men in black tactical gear pinned him his face to the concrete to cuff his hands behind his back.

He did not resist. He couldn’t. He was so gravely dehydrated he would be dead by their next shift change.

“I didn’t do anything” Mr. Johnson moaned as they pressed a shield between his shoulders.

It was 1:19 p.m. on Sept. 6 2019 in the Danville Correctional Center a medium-security prison a few hours south of Chicago. Mr. Johnson 21 and serving a short sentence for gun possession was in the throes of a mental collapse that had gone largely untreated but hardly unwatched.

He had entered in good health with hopes of using the time to gain work skills. But for the previous three weeks Mr. Johnson who suffered from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia had refused to eat or take his medication.

At the height of the disaster 32 roads were closed due to flooding and emergency crews responded to 17 high-water rescues. Unfortunately one of these rescues was for a little boy who was found dead hours after being swept away by floodwaters early Sunday morning.

Johnson County Emergency Management Director Jamie Moore described the situation as ""scary to be in fast water.""

""It's been a difficult time for Johnson County over the last several days"" said Moore.

Emergency crews from across the county worked tirelessly to rescue those trapped in the floodwaters including Moore himself who was caught in high water on the way to rescue the Warren family.

""I accelerated and came around the corner and ended up in high water and my vehicle was surrounded"" Moore said. He had to work on top of his truck. ""I ended up spending the next hour and a half on top of my truck.""

Across the city of Venus firefighters responded to another high water rescue on County Road 616. Firefighters said a woman who was eight months pregnant was trapped.

""We witnessed a car that was being swept off the bridge into flood waters"" said Venue Fire Department Engineer Zach Hagaman.

""By some miracle I don't know how she was able to grab ahold of a tree and she climbed up higher into the tree to escape the flood waters which was still inaccessible for us but it bought us a little more time.""

Hagaman said he tied a rope to his waist and tried to walk through the swift water to the woman but could not reach her. A swift water rescue crew from Red Oak was able to get her to safety.

The star has 'mountains of public goodwill' to offset negativity ...,"Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson’s nice guy reputation has been taking some hits — but the “mountains of public goodwill” he’s built over the years should outshine the drama an expert tells Yahoo Entertainment.

A recent report from the Wrap saw more than a dozen people who worked with Johnson on the upcoming holiday action-comedy film Red One criticize his “chronic lateness and lack of professionalism on set.”

Insiders claimed the Black Adam actor — who co-stars alongside Chris Evans and J.K. Simmons — “was late an average of seven to eight hours per day and missed several entire days of production” resulting in the movie running at least $50 million over budget. They pointed fingers at the film’s “inexperienced” lead producer Hiram Garcia who is Johnson’s ex-brother-in-law and ex-personal assistant for letting things spiral. An insider called the situation “a f***ing disaster” and claimed “Dwayne truly doesn’t give a f***.”

Sources claimed Johnson’s lateness is a pattern saying he had a “huge fight” with an “infuriated” Ryan Reynolds after showing up five hours late to the set of their movie Red Notice in 2020. There’s also a wild story about him urinating in water bottles (something he previously copped to doing).

A spokesperson for Amazon MGM the film studio behind Red One denied the claims in the report calling Johnson and his production company Seven Bucks “incredible partners.” Johnson insiders told the outlet he “averaged no more than one hour late” and “the budget did not deviate much from the agreed-upon figure.” Johnson’s rep did not respond to Yahoo’s request for comment.

Despite the scathing report a crisis and PR expert doesn’t expect this to cause lasting damage to Johnson’s reputation.

“There is a better chance of Martians landing on the lawn of the Biden White House than this ever permanently hurting the Rock” Eric Schiffer of Reputation Management Consultants tells Yahoo.

What’s going on with Johnson?

In addition to being one of the most bankable actors in Hollywood Johnson is one of the most likable celebrities — and a large part of that is due to his strong work ethic. Johnson brands himself as a hard worker — his Instagram with 397 million followers shows a dizzying schedule of gym time movie shoots meetings adorable girl dad moments and philanthropy.

Johnson’s production company Seven Bucks is a nod to his bank account balance when he was cut from a pro football team at age 22. It made the then broke star pivot to a career in wrestling rising through the ranks at the World Wrestling Federation (later called World Wrestling Entertainment or WWE) before crossing over to Hollywood and starring in the Fast and the Furious and Jumanji franchises. In 2016 Forbes listed Johnson as the highest-paid actor and currently estimates his net worth at $270 million between his movies production company wrestling endorsements and brands. A key part of his success is being able to connect with the masses but not forgetting his roots which is why many want to see him run for president.

It seems that over the last year-plus however there have been some negative headlines. The biggest prior to now was in September when he and Oprah Winfrey faced backlash after asking people to donate to their Maui wildfire fund — instead of giving more of their own money. He acknowledged the criticism and he and Winfrey quietly donated more than they had pledged.

The drama has been simmering elsewhere: His bankability took a small hit with 2022’s Black Adam which didn’t perform as well as anticipated and he faced criticism over how he handled it. The Wrap story also seemed to confirm that Johnson attempted to have his production company take over the DC films universe in 2022. It didn’t happen and Johnson going around others for the secret meeting didn’t sit well. Variety reported on that in 2023 with an insider saying Johnson’s “demands” — including having his brand of tequila served at a premiere of PG-13-rated Black Adam — “increased and the returns just weren’t there.”

This year Johnson made a big return to WWE and was appointed to the board of its parent company TKO but he was booed by fans for being almost two hours late to an April event. Recently he’s been hamming it up to play the villain in the pro wrestling storyline. The same week the View audience jeered the mention of his name for saying he won’t be endorsing a presidential candidate in the 2024 election. (He endorsed Joe Biden in 2020 but said he learned that sharing his political opinions only causes division.)

The Wrap story has brought back into conversation Johnson’s infamous feud with his Fast and the Furious franchise co-star Vin Diesel. If Johnson really does show up eight hours late to set — or not at all — that could certainly fuel tension (though reports at the time also cited Diesel’s lateness). The article also surfaces drama with Reynolds noting that the co-stars “didn’t speak for years” after their fall 2020 blowup but have since patched things up.

There’s been counterprogramming to the Wrap story. An unconfirmed report from Puck suggests that “unflattering” press about Johnson may stem from a former publicist. People magazine ran a story about Johnson’s “flourishing career” and how he’s found “success in many areas” with an unnamed source saying “People love him.” And the Rock’s own Instagram feed has been filled with sweet fan encounters and charitable endeavors.

Years of building a good reputation will ‘offset these recent damaging allegations’

It’s true — people do love Johnson who has spent years cultivating a good reputation and it should help see him through this negative patch of press.

“The best strategy for the Rock is to tackle the bad press in a setting where he can poke fun at himself and the facts of his situation” says Schiffer. “The Rock is beloved globally and has built mountains of public goodwill that can offset these recent damaging allegations.”

How does a star like Johnson who will voice the Maui character in the Moana sequel out later this year break the cycle of bad press? By “addressing the negative items with empathy and truth owning your part in it and then showing what you learned” says Schiffer.

He adds “The Rock did that well with the outcry in Hawaii and will likely do the same with the hits on being late on the set of his film.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmN5anVuZ2xlLmNvbS8yMDI0LzUvNi8yNDE1MDQyNS9jaGFkLWpvaG5zb24tb2Nob2NpbmNvLXRlZS1oaWdnaW5zLWNvbnRyYWN0LWJlbmdhbHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chad Johnson believes Tee Higgins and the Bengals will work out contract situation,"Joe Burrow and others are back in the building for the beginning of the offseason program for the Cincinnati Bengals.

It has been an interesting offseason for the Bengals... There were solid free-agency pickups and a good draft class but two trade requests since the end of last season.

One of those trade requests came from Tee Higgins after the Bengals placed the franchise tag on him.

There has been little to no progress since the trade request according to reports but Zac Taylor has made it clear he looks forward to seeing Higgins for the 2024 season.

Cincinnati Bengals legend Chad Ochocinco hit on the topic recently and says he has been in contact with Higgins “a few times.”

“I think we’re going to work it out. We’ll figure it out” Ochocinco said when asked about the contract issues between the two sides according to TMZ Sports.

Higgins is set to make over $20 million this season with the franchise tag but it is clear he wants long-term security as well.

Ochocinco ended his conversation with TMZ saying “It’s business — it’s the nature of the business. He’s going to be all right though.”

We will see what the long-term future holds for Higgins and the Bengals but as of right now I expect to see him suited up in week one and ready to roll.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvc2VhbmRncmFoYW0uY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvcm9nZXItam9obnNvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Roger Lane Johnson Obituary 2024,"Garner NC: At 5:14AM on May 5 2024 Heaven gained another angel when Roger Lane Johnson age 72 known to many as “Rog” or the “Running Man” won his battle with cancer.

As empowering women is one of the main pillars of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 this has contributed to boosting women’s participation in all sectors of the labor market and at all functional levels by providing them opportunities and expanding their work options.

The Kingdom’s heating ventilation air conditioning and refrigeration sector is one such sector that has welcomed qualified Saudi women over the past few years. These women have proven their mettle and gone on to achieve important leadership positions thereby opening the door wide for the significant presence of women in this field for years to come.

CEO of Al-Salem Johnson Controls in Saudi Arabia Egypt Lebanon and Yemen Dr. Mohanad Al-Shaikh said the company has been a pioneer in hiring and promoting women in the HVAC-R sector expanding the scope of women’s employment in recent years by 107 percent to include managerial positions as well. At present the number of female employees at Al-Salem Johnson Controls stands at 118 and leadership positions for women have seen a rise of 10 percent.

Al-Shaikh said that the company started its endeavor of empowering women more than 15 years ago by being keen on attracting women in several departments within the company including IT financial affairs supply chain data analysis and others. In recent years a number of Saudi female engineers have joined the company’s Young Leaders Program targeting areas that were mostly dominated by their male counterparts in the past.

With the opening of the YORK Manufacturing Complex in King Abdullah Economic City in 2021 the company is training Saudi women in various production lines enabling them to be directly involved in the manufacturing and assembling of Saudi-made YORK units and thus play a role in achieving the two major goals of Vision 2030 which include developing the local manufacturing sector and empowering women.

“The Saudi women working in the HVAC-R sector feel happy and proud because they are among the first to be working in this field in the Kingdom” the CEO added.",,,,,,,,,

Kevin Johnson said he will retire next month after five years as president and CEO and 13 years at Starbucks. Johnson a former executive at Microsoft and Juniper Networks succeeded Schultz as CEO in 2017.

Starbucks made the announcement last Wednesday ahead of its annual meeting.

In an open letter to Starbucks’ employees Johnson 61 said he told the company’s board last year that he was considering retirement. His most obvious successor had been Roz Brewer the company’s chief operating officer but Brewer left the company in February 2021 to become the top executive at Walgreens.

Starbucks said its board has been engaged in “continuous CEO succession planning’’ since last year and expects to name a permanent CEO by this fall. While Schultz leads the company he will get $1 in compensation. Schultz 68 is also rejoining Starbucks’ board.

Some observers expressed surprise that the board would name Schultz instead of a new permanent CEO.

“It’s curious that they were not able to find a successor within a year” said Timothy Hubbard assistant professor of management at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business. “For a company the size and stature of Starbucks not to have a solid succession plan is surprising.”

Andrew Charles an analyst with Cowen said Schultz’s return to the board signals he wants greater say in Starbucks’ future strategy.

Workers at Starbucks stores – including five in Buffalo New York and one in Mesa Arizona – have voted to unionise since late last year. As of Wednesday 140 stores in 27 states have petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to hold union elections according to Workers United the union organising the Starbucks campaign.

When Schultz bought Starbucks in 1987 it had unionised workers at six stores and a roasting plant. One of his first acts as CEO was to lead an effort to decertify the union. Starbucks has fought multiple unionisation efforts since then.

“I was convinced that under my leadership employees would come to realise that I would listen to their concerns. If they had faith in me and my motives they wouldn’t need a union” Schultz wrote in his 1997 memoir “Pour Your Heart Into It.”

In a statement Workers United noted that Schultz visited Buffalo late last year to try to convinced employees to vote against the union.

“We encourage Howard Schultz to put union-busting behind him and embrace Starbucks’ unionised future” the union said.

Schultz is credited with growing Starbucks into the global behemoth it has become. When he bought the chain in 1987 it had 11 stores and 100 employees. Four years later when Starbucks went public the chain had grown to more than 100 stores. Starbucks now has more than 34000 stores worldwide.

Schultz stepped down as CEO in 2000 and became the company’s chairman. But he returned as CEO in 2008 when the company was struggling in the recession. He stepped down again in 2017 and became the company’s chairman emeritus in 2018.

Schultz spent 2019 testing the waters for a possible run for president as an independent. But he announced in the fall of that year that he had decided against it.

In a statement issued by Starbucks Schultz said he had not planned to return to the company but wants to help it transform again as the pandemic recedes.

“When you love something you have a deep sense of responsibility to help when called” Schultz said.

KDP,Keurig Dr Pepper,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvbWFuZG8uY29tL3Jldmlld3MvcmV2aWV3LXNtYXJ0ZXIta2V1cmlnLzgzMDE2NS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: Keurig K-Supreme Plus Smart Single Serve Coffee Maker,"For many of us that morning cup of coffee is necessary to start the day on the right track. It’s usually more than a couple of cups for me but I could rarely get through a whole pot when I used to own a traditional brewer.

So for well over a decade I’ve owned a few different Keurig models from very basic K-Cup brewers to more advanced options with touch displays. When my most recent Keurig finally started showing signs of fatigue a few months ago I had a decision to make: get a similar option or upgrade to the company’s latest offering with internet connectivity.

I love gadgets but did I really need a smart coffee brewer? No but of course I had to try it. Even with some clever new tricks that I didn’t expect keep reading to find out if this smart Keurig is worth the price.

Keurig K-Supreme Plus Smart Brewer

Courtesy: Keurig Dr. Pepper

One of the key features of the Keurig K-Supreme Plus Smart Brewer is what’s called BrewID which customizes brew settings by recognizing specific K-Cup brands and roasts. Here are other highlights of the brewer which first hit the market in July 2021:

Customize settings schedule and brew from anywhere using the Keurig app

Compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant

OLED display

Ability to save up to 10 custom brews

Five brew strengths from Balanced to Intense

Six temperature settings from Warm to Max Hot

Five brew sizes from four to 12 ounces

78 ounce removable reservoir

Back-to-back brewing (no need to wait for reheating)

MultiStream Technology extracts full flavor and aroma

Retails for $219.99 – but is on sale from time to time

Smart features aside this Keurig brewer has far more customization options than any previous models I’ve owned.

Setup and use

The first thing I noticed when taking this Keurig out of the box is that it definitely had a different design than what I’ve been used to but I have to say that the stainless steel finish is pretty nice.

The design also makes it seem more compact even though this thing has a pretty big reservoir. Speaking of the reservoir handle is a great addition over the often clumsy way to remove and refill the tank on my previous Keurig K575 system which we’ve had since 2017.

The setup of this smarter brewer was straightforward especially getting it connected. It took less than 5 minutes to link the brewer with my home Wi-Fi network then link it to the Keurig app.

The display is not a touchscreen but the physical buttons and easy-to-navigate user interface simplified the setup process even further. There’s no clock on this Keurig but come on you already have one on the microwave.

Once it was ready to go I put in the first pod which was quickly identified by BrewID — displaying the name of the product and showing recommended brewing options for that specific K-Cup. Nice feature so I went with its suggestion and pushed the big “K” button in the center.

It took mere seconds for the water to heat which used to take a little while when I first turned on my old Keurig.

Then came the brewing process which seemed to take a little longer than my old one considering it was only a 10-ounce cup. Either way the recommended settings brewed a good cup of coffee but I still prefer my own customizations.

Using the app I created a custom brew for a 12 ounce Intense setting but not too hot then saved it as a favorite. Regardless of pods that’s still my usual go-to. Check out the image below showing the physical controls and one of the Keurig app setting screens.

What’s nice about the app is that you can create schedules for example to brew a cup at the same time every weekday and be ready to go when you are. Just make sure you already have a K-Cup in place and I can’t stress this enough — that you also have a cup waiting.

Other app features include the Keurig online store where you can buy more coffee brewers and accessories. You also can set up auto-delivery with Keurig’s Smart Coffee Subscription. The price depends on what you choose but signing up saves you 25% off every order.

In addition to identifying the pods BrewID also keeps track of how many you’ve used and notifies you when it’s time to order more. You’ll also receive notifications through the app and on the brewer’s screen when regular maintenance is needed like descaling.

Is this smart coffee brewer worth it?

Over the past decade I’ve had to make plenty of decisions regarding the transition to basic smart home gadgets all the way up to connected large appliances. It involves factors like is this a product that warrants a smart upgrade? Would I use the features? Should I wait until some of the bugs are worked out in later product generations?

For some purchases it took no time to decide. I knew how helpful a smart garage door opener could be. The same goes for a smart thermostat auto-adapting sprinkler control system and a video doorbell.

I even found that a smart washer and dryer were great additions. No it won’t load and unload your laundry but getting notified on my Apple Watch that a load is complete has saved all sorts of time when it comes to not having to deal with wrinkled clothes.

A smart coffee maker on the other hand is something I had to put a little more thought into in terms of how often I would even use its smart features or the app itself. And the verdict after using the Keurig K-Supreme Plus for the past three months … I’m glad this is the one I bought.

While it’s somewhat more expensive than other Keurig brewers the broader range of custom controls on this one makes it worth the price of admission alone. The ability to save favorites brew on a schedule and set up recurring deliveries that automatically adjust based on need are just added bonuses as far as I’m concerned.

If you’re in the market for a replacement Keurig or your very first one and would like the added convenience of smarter features I definitely recommend the top-of-the-line K-Supreme Plus Smart Brewer — especially if you manage to snag one when it’s on sale.

Soaring oil prices are padding the fortunes of U.S. shale and gas tycoons even vaulting one into the ranks of the world’s 500 richest people for the first time.

American oil and gas industrialists on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index now have a collective net worth of $239 billion a jump of nearly 10% since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. The growth is being fueled by near-record high energy prices as sanctions by the U.S. and Europe threaten to choke off Russian exports.

Brent crude prices have spiked as much as 32% since the invasion began and were at about $106 a barrel on Friday. That’s caused markets in everything from airlines stocks to tech shares to gyrate but it’s been a boon to many companies that make money producing selling or transporting fossil fuels.

Harold Hamm 76 co-founder of shale giant Continental Resources Inc. has moved up 28 places on Bloomberg’s wealth index to 93rd and now controls an $18.6 billion fortune. Richard Kinder’s net worth has grown to $8.5 billion thanks to his stake in pipeline and energy-storage firm Kinder Morgan Inc while rising demand for liquefied natural gas has helped Freeport LNG founder Michael S. Smith crack the 500 wealthiest list for the first time.

‘Growing Production’

Even before the Ukraine war the U.S. oil and gas industry’s revenues had been growing rapidly as demand rebounded from pandemic lows. One segment of the hydrocarbon industry that’s reaping more profits is private companies.

Previous oil booms in places like Texas and New Mexico have been fueled by publicly traded companies as behemoths such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. consolidated their holdings in a rush to pump more product. That all changed with the pandemic. Public companies that once gorged on cheap debt have been forced to scale back by cautious shareholders while private companies have seized the moment to boost production.

“On the private side those pressures from shareholders aren’t nearly as acute” said Andrew Dittmar a director at energy-analytics and software firm Enverus. “It makes good economic sense for private firms to invest in growing production.”

It’s also helped boost the fortunes of private operators. Jeffery Hildebrand 63 the founder and sole owner of Lafayette Louisiana-based Hilcorp Energy is now worth more than $12 billion while Endeavor Energy Resources founder Autry Stephens 84 has capitalized on his company’s vast holdings in the Permian Basin to expand his net worth to $5.2 billion.

One closely held company that’s done well is liquefied natural gas exporter Freeport LNG which shipped its first commissioning cargo as recently as September 2019. The sale of a 25% stake in November to a Japanese energy company valued Freeport at an implied $9.7 billion.

That has propelled Michael Smith who owns about 63% of the company into 409th place on Bloomberg’s wealth list with a fortune of $6.2 billion.

Smith’s Houston-based company is poised to benefit if Europe -- which currently gets 40% of its natural gas from Russia -- turns to the U.S. to procure more supplies.

Even if that doesn’t happen the increased demand would raise prices and help the company’s bottom line. Prices of LNG -- gas that’s been chilled into a liquid to make it easier to transport -- have surged.

“Michael Smith’s bet on the U.S. gas industry has paid off” said Talon Custer a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. “And they have options to grow.”

Heather Browne a spokeswoman for Freeport LNG declined to comment on Smith’s net worth or the company’s plans.

Freeport LNG has faced delays in recent years expanding its export infrastructure because of difficulty obtaining government permits and low gas prices. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could speed up those plans as government and industry officials reassess their reluctance to ramp up production Smith told Bloomberg News last week.

“Hopefully this will change the narrative” he said.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sparked big gains in crude oil prices and along with them the fortunes of American oil and gas tycoons with Bloomberg reporting that one company founder has been jettisoned into the ranks of the world's 500 richest people.

There has been a roughly 10% climb to $239 billion in the collective net worth of American oil and shale industrialists on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index since Russia launched its war against Ukraine Bloomberg reported Friday. Russia - the world's third-largest oil producer - invaded the former Soviet republic on February 24.

The increase was driven by a surge in energy prices fueled by concerns about disruptions to Russian output in the face of sanctions imposed by the US and its Western allies. Brent crude the international benchmark gained as much as 32% since the outbreak of war.

Harold Hamm the co-founder of shale heavyweight Continental Resources Inc. rose 28 places on Bloomberg's wealth index to 93rd. The 76-year old now controls an $18.6 billion fortune according to the report. Kinder Morgan Inc. co-founder Richard Kinder's net worth has swelled to $8.5 billion from his stake in the pipeline and energy-storage company.

Meanwhile Michael S. Smith founder of Freeport LNG entered Bloomberg's track of the world's 500 wealthiest people for the first time helped by rising demand for liquefied natural gas. There was a sale in November of a 25% stake in closely held Freeport LNG to a Japanese energy company valuing Freeport at an implied $9.7 billion. That put Smith who owns about 63% of the company into 409th place on Bloomberg's wealth list with a $6.2 billion fortune.

Revenue for oil and gas companies had been growing before Russia attacked Ukraine. Easing COVID-19 restrictions have revived demand for oil but the demand has been met by a short supply of the commodity.

The International Energy Agency on Friday released its 10-point plan to cut global oil demand saying the ""emergency measures"" can cut demand by 2.7 million barrels a day within four months. The IEA said Russia's invasion of Ukraine leaves the world facing its biggest oil supply shortage in decades. OPEC's Secretary-General Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo recently said there's ""no capacity in the world"" that could replace the 7 million barrels of oil Russia produces per day.

Brent crude prices and West Texas Intermediate crude after a pullback resumed trading above $100 a barrel this week. Brent pierced above $139 at its peak earlier this month.",,,,,,,,,

That's who unions liberal advocates have in mind to increase tax revenue promote equity,"Whether they know it or not a dozen billionaires in Connecticut have become pin-ups for organized labor and its allies pushing for higher taxes.

Liberal advocates have highlighted the wealth of the 12 men and women many of whom operate asset or hedge funds that profited during the run-up on Wall Street in the past two years. At protest rallies activists demanding higher taxes have posted photos of some of the billionaires in galleries of sorts.

Puya Gerami campaign director at Recovery for All a coalition of labor community and faith groups told the General Assembly’s Labor and Public Employees Committee at a recent meeting that Connecticut’s ultra-wealthy have increased their net worth by billions of dollars during the pandemic.

“How outrageous is that?” he said.

Collectively the billionaires were worth about $59 billion at the start of the pandemic in 2020. They’re richer by about $15 billion now according to information published in Forbes magazine and cited by Recovery for All.

The State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition which represents about 43000 public sector workers and others also has invoked the “tiny percentage of billionaires” that unions say are outpacing working people in Connecticut’s economy.

A Republican lawmaker pushed back against Rick Melita director of the Connecticut State Council of the Service Employees International Union who said at a recent Finance Committee meeting that the ultra-wealthy “seized” billions more during the pandemic.

“We’re not talking about people holding up other people” said state Rep. Holly Cheeseman of East Lyme. “We’re talking about how they earn their money. This was not money that was stolen.”

In an interview she said the state’s retirement funds and middle-class investors also benefit from rising share values of publicly traded companies.

“That kind of inflammatory language does not add to the debate” Cheeseman said.

But critics of amassed wealth contend higher taxes should target the ultra-rich. They support state Senate President Pro Tem Martin Looney’s so-called “mansion tax” a higher estate tax digital ad tax and an increase in the corporate income tax Gerami said.

It mirrors a national debate over the same issue with left-of-center Democrats trying to push moderates in their party to embrace higher taxes and greater public spending to fight poverty particularly in underrepresented communities. Vermont’s socialist U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders has said taxes should fall heavily on billionaires with the aim of redistributing much of their wealth to finance health care college education and other social programs.

Who are the billionaires?

Many operate asset management firms while two are well-known in Connecticut: Ray Dalio co-chief investment officer and chairman of the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates who was a partner with Gov. Ned Lamont from 2019 to 2020 in a state education project and Vince McMahon founder and chief executive officer of World Wrestling Entertainment.

Asked to comment on activists making an issue of his wealth a spokesman for Dalio cited work by the hedge fund executive and his wife Barbara Dalio to promote education initiatives with teachers administrators schools nonprofits and communities in Connecticut.

The other business executives did not respond to emails seeking comment.

Ray Dalio

Mark Boughton commissioner of the state Department of Revenue Services said he does not know if Connecticut is home to a dozen or more billionaires.

“I’m prohibited from just generally digging around into peoples’ incomes unless there is a specific need or an audit or some ruling that has to be made” he said.

Dalio has found fault with capitalism telling an audience at the annual Greenwich Economic Forum in November 2019 that the U.S. economic system does not work for the “average person” and “needs to be fixed.”

“And if you don’t fix it you’re going to have a revolution. And then you’re also going to chase the capitalists away” he said.

World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. CEO Vince McMahon in the ring in Las Vegas.

Taxes

A Tax Incidence Study by the Department of Revenue Service last month showed 772 taxpayers or 0.04% of Connecticut’s 1.7 million taxpayers paid $983.2 million in taxes in 2019 or 12.7% of the entire $7.7 billion in taxes.

“They do make a significant amount of money and they pay a significant amount of taxes” said Boughton a former Republican mayor of Danbury.

But as a share of their incomes the burden on the ultra-rich from all taxes — on income property excise and sales taxes and other levies — was 6.7%. In contrast the study shows nearly half of Connecticut’s population paid about 26% of their incomes in all taxes.

“I don’t know if anything gets more stark than that” state Sen. John Fonfara co-chairman of the legislature’s tax-writing Finance Committee told Boughton at a recent committee meeting.

The Hartford Democrat last year pushed for a package of tax increases that was approved by the legislature’s Finance Committee. It included increasing capital gains by 2 percentage points for high-income earners establishing a consumption tax on high earners and retaining a 10% surcharge on corporate profits.

Opposition by Lamont who has said broad-based tax increases would reverse the state’s fiscal gains killed the proposals.

Gerami said none of the tax measures he and others advocate would target billionaires in particular.

“I do think it’s helpful to name some of these folks” he said. “We’re not talking about these billionaires because of a personal attack. This is a result of decades of flawed public policy.”

Set to roll out in April the new treats will be available at over 2000 Kroger and Kroger-owned grocery stores across the US. The line will feature pints in Vanilla Chocolate Mint Chocolate Chip and Cookie Dough varieties as well as three specialty cones and bars:

Chocolate and Red Berry Cone – A gluten-free maize cone with sweet ice cream red berry sauce and chocolate chips

Chocolate and Almond Bar – Vanilla ice cream and toasted almond pieces wrapped in a chocolate flavored coating

Berry White – Sweet vanilla ice cream and swirled berry sauce wrapped in a white chocolate coating with red berry pieces

A “true disruptor”

According to Wicked Kitchen CEO Pete Speranza lupins provide a level of nutrition and creaminess unmatched by any other legume: “Our plant-based ice creams are true disruptors to the category” Speranza recently told vegconomist. “We’re using a base made from the lupin bean a legume prominent in Mediterranean cuisines that provides an astonishing richness to plant-based dairy products.”

Compared to other common plant proteins lupins contain more protein per serving than peas chickpeas and even soy. They also provide a rich source of fiber and according to Speranza lack any unappealing aftertaste.

A supreme bean

Thanks to their top-quality nutrition and functionality lupin beans are quickly gaining popularity as a star protein ingredient. Last month Australian startup Eighth Day Foods raised $1 million for its LUPREME® lupin-based protein while food brands PLANT B and Mikuna released liquid vegan eggs and protein powder made from the plant.

“This is a game-changer and Wicked will launch our first-to-market ice creams in the US this spring” Speranza added. “They are so dreamy and creamy no one who tries them will ever miss dairy ice creams again.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndva3YuY29tL3ZpZGVvL2hvdC12aWRlby9rcm9nZXItcGFuY2FrZS13YWZmbGUtbWl4LXJlY2FsbGVkLTE3LXN0YXRlcy9jNmYyZjljZS02Y2QwLTQ3YmEtOWFhOS03YmQwYWRjN2RmMzkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kroger pancake waffle mix recalled in 17 states,"We’re Sorry!

Lam Lai Han thought she would have some respite from the 24/7 care she was providing for her husband who has Parkinson’s disease when they were approved for government-funded home visits by care aides in 2017.

But the added help forced Ms. Lam to take on a new role: translator. Until recently the couple often had to deal with different aides and Ms. Lam with her limited English had to communicate her husband’s situation every time. Their two sons live in Hong Kong.

“I am very exhausted” said Ms. Lam 74.

Ms. Lam’s husband Lam Ming Hong has not been able to walk since 2016. She said they appreciate the help but their needs are sometimes overlooked.

Thousands of seniors in B.C. receive provincially subsidized home-care support but the province’s Seniors Advocate says people who speak little or no English have trouble receiving those services in their native tongue. That leaves them with home care that can’t meet their needs or unable to obtain such help in the first place.

“There are two issues: You don’t get it or you’re getting it but it’s more frustrating for you” said Isobel Mackenzie B.C.’s Seniors Advocate.

That reality has prompted calls for more provincial funding to increase the availability of culturally and linguistically appropriate services for seniors. But Ms. Mackenzie argues that the system needs a fundamental redesign.

Twenty per cent of home support clients in the province do not speak English she said compared with about 30 per cent of British Columbians who primarily communicate in other languages.

“So what that is telling us is that there would appear to be people disproportionately not accessing home support who speak an immigrant language primarily.”

The paucity in service pushed the Lams to seek help elsewhere. The couple is among more than 80 families in B.C. that have been assisted by the Gaia Community Care and Wellness Society a Richmond-based charity dedicated to supporting Chinese and other seniors and family caregivers who belong to minority ethnic groups.

Open this photo in gallery: When they were approved for government-funded home visits by care aides in 2017 Ms. Lam was forced to take on a new role: translator.Taehoon Kim/The Globe and Mail

The organization’s volunteers have paid about 240 home visits to seniors of Chinese descent since November many of whom live in single-room dwellings in Vancouver’s Chinatown.

Language “is a very big issue” said Gaia’s executive director Percy Wong adding that the vast majority of seniors they help have encountered language barriers.

Dr. Karen Kobayashi a professor in the Department of Sociology and a research affiliate with the Institute on Aging and Lifelong Health at the University of Victoria said much of the government’s funding goes toward standardized services that aren’t tailored to the individual needs of patients.

“You cannot send in a non-Chinese-dialect-speaking or a non-South-Asian-dialect-speaking worker into the home of older immigrant adults from these communities and expect them to thrive or to benefit from the service to the same degree as if you sent a front-line worker who was from their own ethnic cultural background” she said.

Both Dr. Kobayashi and Mr. Wong who has extensive experiences in senior care domestically and abroad are calling on the government to hire more staff that can provide linguistically and culturally appropriate services.

“The government needs to provide more resources … because the population is going to become increasingly diverse” Dr. Kobayashi said. “I think the changes that we need to make is to unstandardize these programs and services. In other words we need to first of all create a more equitable system.”

A survey conducted by the Seniors Advocate office shows that among staff for long-term care and assisted-living facilities 76 per cent considered English to be their first language 21 per cent did not and 3 per cent preferred not to answer. But neither it nor the province’s Ministry of Health has data on the language proficiency of home support caregivers.

Ms. Mackenzie said she does not think there has been a proper inventory of language proficiencies among home-care aides in a formal way. “And that would be helpful.”

She agrees that hiring more staff who can provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services could also be beneficial but added that in practical terms it’s going to be challenging for some of the less-common languages.

A better approach she said would be for the government to allow direct funding to clients so that families can hire their own care aide if their loved ones don’t speak English.

Sharon Koehn adjunct professor in the Department of Gerontology at Simon Fraser University said language is just one piece of improving cares for seniors from minority ethnic communities.

“Everyone talks about language and language is huge but it’s not the only thing. It’s more about having quality care that is consistent that is respectful. It is anti-oppressive in its orientation.”

Based on her years of research on long-term care and assisted living Dr. Koehn believes those “big systemic” issues in the care system such as the lack and inconsistency of staff disproportionately disadvantage elders with minority backgrounds.

They particularly need time with the same caregivers because of their communication issues and cultural differences she said.

“It’s not just a minority problem. It’s an everybody problem but it’s especially that for ethnocultural minorities.”

The B.C. government is examining options to improve and expand home health services including suggestions from the Seniors Advocate related to direct client funding and improving continuity of care providers the Ministry of Health said in a statement adding that health authorities assign home support workers based on language preference whenever possible. In 2020/2021 according to a Seniors Advocate report 132801 people received professional home care services.

General Dynamics Information Technology on Dec. 8 was selected for a 10-year deal to modernize NGA’s cloud platform and data centers. The award was challenged by another competitor Leidos which filed a protest Dec. 28 with the Government Accountability Office.

General Dynamics on March 18 announced it won the contract. According to GAO the protest filed by Leidos was withdrawn March 16 allowing NGA and General Dynamics to move forward with the work. Bid protests are common on government contracts this size especially in the highly competitive cloud market.

A component of the U.S. intelligence community NGA analyzes satellite imagery and other geospatial data for the U.S. military allies and homeland security agencies.

NGA first solicited bids for the cloud services contract in 2019. The work covers a wide range of services in support of geospatial intelligence users including the integration of commercial clouds data center design and operations mobile secure wireless across multiple networks and agency locations worldwide. Much of the new technology will support NGA’s new campus in St. Louis known as NGA West. The agency’s headquarters is in Northern Virginia in the Washington D.C. metro area.

The $1.7 billion facility in north St. Louis has been under construction since November 2019 and NGA expects it will be open for business in 2025.

General Dynamics on Dec. 13 announced it is opening a new facility and geospatial innovation center at the Cortex in St. Louis.

NGA officials said upgrading its cloud computing and data infrastructure is a top priority for the agency as it tries to improve the quality and speed of services. A modern cloud enterprise for example will facilitate interoperability between the agency and commercial geospatial data providers.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Brian May is no stranger to the Canary Islands’ largest island. The star first visited Tenerife back in 1970 to work on his PhD at the observatory high up in Teide National Park by an active volcano. Now the Queen guitarist returns to shoot a new music video for the remastered re-release of his second solo album Another World following on from last year’s Back to the Light. Taking a breather from filming the 74-year-old shared a video with his fans by the Observatorio del Teide where he performed ’39.

Brian wrote ’39 for the 1975 Queen album A Night at the Opera with lyrics telling a story that years later would coincidently be reflected in Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar. The song speaks of an astronaut who travels far away into space returning to Earth after one year but finding that it’s been a century for those who stayed behind thanks to Einstein’s clock paradox. In his new video Brian said: “Hello folks this is Bri with an unusual Instagram post. I’m here in the wonderful Tenerife at the beautiful observatory feeling very privileged shooting a video for Another World. And it’s been a great kind of time travel journey for me because of course the song goes back many many years. But the song that I’d like to sing for you today goes back further than that. I’ve been reluctant to post anything recently because of the terrible tragedy unfolding in the world. But I’m hoping this song might offer a little bit of hope; some belief that things will be okay in the future. And if we look at things in the context the passage of time everything has to be and will be and it’s going to be okay.” He then took it away encouraging fans to join in at home.

Especially since I’m reliably informed this song was the 39th Queen song we ever released …. Enjoy !!!

As you will soon see I hope ! Bri.” Back in 2015 the Queen legend admitted he’d probably like the park to be his final resting place.

Brian May's re-release of Another World arrives on April 22

According to The Telegraph May said: “The island's Teide National Park has a kind of pull on my spirit. It's a feeling of being close to heaven up there in the national park and it's a place that is very spiritual to me - it’s probably where I would like my ashes to be scattered.” On his astrophysics work own in Tenerife the star said: “The views of the cosmos up there [Observatorio del Teide] are amazing” he said. “You get beautiful views of the Milky Way and the zodiacal light. I’ve also seen the gegenschein [a faint glow or spot in the night sky associated with the zodiacal light] there which is something not many astronomers have seen. The atmosphere above Tenerife is very transparent and they have been very good at controlling the amount of light pollution so it’s a wonderful place to look at the stars.” DON'T MISS

Scotland’s finest singer-songwriter takes to our screens this evening with a storming set packed with hits from both her solo career and Eurythmics days. Appearing on BBC One Sessions pop’s enduring diva will roll out ‘Sweet Dreams’ ‘Here Comes The Rain’ ‘Little Bird’ and a host of other classics. Named one of The 100 Greatest Singers of All Time by Rolling Stone Annie proves time and time again that her voice has lost none of its ability to thrill.

Away from her musical career Annie is a political and social activist. She was deeply critical of the Iraq War has long supported Tibetan freedom and was a staunch critic of the UK’s decision to leave the European Union — labelling the decision a “TOTAL train wreck” on her blog adding that it was a “total set up right from the start”. Aberdeen-born Annie initially claimed she was “agnostic” about the prospect of an independent Scotland but threw her support behind the Union in the week leading up to the vote arguing there was an “element of risk” in voting Yes. Scotland went on to vote to remain part of the UK in the 2014 referendum and Annie addressed the matter a month later. READ MORE: Elvis Presley’s Graceland security: The door that was kept unlocked

Annie was born on Christmas Day in Aberdeen in 1954.

Annie has lived in London for much of her life sine moving from Scotland.

Speaking in October 2014 she described the division between Scotland and England as “embarrassing”. She said: “I’d like to see the Scots put their hatred of the English aside and grow up just a little bit. “We should be way beyond that now. It’s actually slightly embarrassing. “It's nonsense. The English are no longer the terrible overlord of the Scots.

“Westminster I understand they have an issue with but we all have an issue with Westminster.” Annie admitted that she did not vote in the referendum but received a barrage of abuse for voicing her opinion. In the days that followed the interview she issued a lengthy apology on her Facebook page. She wrote: “This morning I woke up to a tsunami of hatred and vitriol on my Twitter and Facebook pages.

“Those who appear to be deeply offended by an apparent quote from a newspaper have had no hesitation in publicly describing me in the most vile pejorative terms. “They demand an apology and here it is... 'I apologise wholeheartedly to anyone who's been offended by whatever they've read in a headline or quote from me'... “I'm deeply proud of my heritage and it's a massive part of who I am and I just want people to get along no matter where they were born or where they live in the UK. Peace be with us all."" She went on to reveal that she almost deleted her social media accounts because of the online abuse adding in a subsequent post: “Massive thank yous to every single one of the people who've posted supportive and positive messages regarding yesterday's blog.

“I truly appreciate every one of them. Yesterday I was ready to throw in the towel and shut down my Facebook profile but your encouragement has turned it around for me."" Since then Annie has voiced her objection to Brexit on a number of occasions. Alongside Pink Floyd’s Nick Mason and Billy Bragg as well as numerous other musical figures she signed an open letter to the Government in 2018 stating that Brexit posed a “significant threat to the UK’s music industry”. A year later she encouraged her followers to sign the petition for Article 50 to be revoked which eventually gained some six million signatures.",,,,,,,,,

Phased array antennas are collections of antennas that have the unique ability to change both the shape and direction of the emitted radiation pattern without actually moving the antenna itself. They’re designed so that the signals transmitted by the individual antennas in the array sum up and ultimately result in better gain and directivity in a specific direction.

In the context of satellites phased array antennas are a crucial radiofrequency (RF) component in communications systems allowing for long-range signal transfer between space and the earth.

“We look forward to this developing collaboration with Lockheed Martin a global technology leader in aerospace space and security” said Dr. Emile de Rijk Founder and CEO of SWISSto12. “There is a tremendous opportunity offered by our 3D printed antenna technology to help upcoming satellite missions optimize their performance and throughput while enhancing their coverage flexibility. We are grateful for the trust Lockheed Martin places in SWISSto12 and CAES.”

RF 3D printing with SWISSto12 and CAES

Founded as a spin-off from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) SWISSto12 specializes in high-performance RF components for communications and radar applications in the aerospace sector. The firm has its own patented laser-based 3D printing technology which it uses to fabricate optimized parts made of aluminum INVAR PEEK and titanium.

On the other hand CAES is based in the US and develops advanced electronics for defense and aerospace systems. The firm claims to be the largest provider of mixed-signal and radiation-hardened technology for the US aerospace and defense industries.

“SWISSto12 and CAES provide a strong mix of innovative technical solutions and skilled talent” said Kyle Griffin VP of Lockheed Martin Space’s Advanced Program Development group. “We look forward to strengthening this relationship as we build solutions for increasingly complex challenges in space.”

3D printed phased array antennas

As partners SWISSto12 and CAES aim to make additive manufacturing technology more easily accessible for US defense manufacturers like Lockheed. The former’s 3D printing capabilities combined with the latter’s design engineering expertise enable custom RF systems designed to meet stringent size weight and performance requirements.

For their latest project with Lockheed Martin Space the partners will conduct the initial development of the 3D printed phased array antennas at SWISSto12’s headquarters in Switzerland. Then they’ll be manufactured for end-use at CAES’ new 3D printing laboratory in Exeter New Hampshire.

“For decades CAES has developed and manufactured a variety of antennas RF subsystems and microelectronics for Lockheed Martin’s space missions” said David Young CTO at CAES. “Together with our partner SWISSto12 we are thrilled to collaborate once again to usher in a new wave of pioneering advanced electronic solutions based on additive manufacturing technologies.”

The 3D printing of RF components and other electronics is an emerging area of additive manufacturing. Just this month researchers at Iowa State University tested a novel approach to 3D printing electronics in zero-gravity conditions. In place of gravity the team’s technology utilizes electrical force to print conductive inks onto a glass base layer-by-layer in a way that allows for the creation of complex circuitry. Working with NASA the engineers aim to develop the process into a means of producing sensors in space.

Elsewhere UK-based robotics firm Q5D Technology recently secured $2.5 million in seed funding to advance the development of its new multifunctional wiring and electronics 3D printer. Known as the ‘CU500’ the 5-axis FFF system features a changeable tool head that can be adapted to deposit either polymers metal pastes or wiring onto large aerospace and automotive parts or electronic devices.

Hermeus also announced its advisory board in a statement issued Monday (May 13); the board includes the former president of Blue Origin and former associate administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration.

The mission of this aerospace startup is to increase the speed of air transportation by developing vehicles that can fly ''in excess of Mach 5 — over 3000 miles per hour [4800 km/h]. At Mach 5 flight times from New York to London will be reduced from 7 hours to 90 minutes'' Hermeus officials said in the statement. Mach 1 is approximately the speed of sound traveling through Earth's atmosphere.

The idea is to connect the world's cities ''significantly faster than ever before'' which Hermeus CEO A.J. Piplica likened to the broadband era of data transmissions.

The round of seed investment led by Khosla Ventures (with additional participation from private investors) will continue the development of Hermeus' hypersonic propulsion system the statement said.

''Hermeus is developing an aircraft that not only improves the aviation experience with very reduced flight times but also has the potential to have great societal and economic impact"" Vinod Khosla founder of Khosla Ventures said in the statement.

Hermeus will join a burgeoning field in aerospace. A year ago NASA gave the aerospace and defense contractor Lockheed Martin a $241.5 million contract to develop a quiet supersonic plane that could fly by mid-2022. In June 2018 Boeing unveiled its hypersonic plane concept at the Aviation and Aeronautics Forum in Atlanta. Two years ago the startup Boom Technology partnered with Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson to create a carrier that could reach Mach 2.2.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kZncvbmFtZS9tYXJ2aW4tYmVhbi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMzgxODY2OdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marvin Bean Obituary (1927 - 2022) - Arlington TX - Star-Telegram,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/dfw/name/marvin-bean-obituary?id=33818669 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kZncvbmFtZS9tYXJ2aW4tYmVhbi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMzgxODY2OdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vYnVsZ2FyaWFubWlsaXRhcnkuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMjAvc3RlYWx0aHktZi0zNS1leHBlY3RzLWFub3RoZXItcm9sZS10ZWFtZWQtdXAtd2l0aC11bm1hbm5lZC1haXJjcmFmdC_SAW1odHRwczovL2J1bGdhcmlhbm1pbGl0YXJ5LmNvbS8yMDIyLzAzLzIwL3N0ZWFsdGh5LWYtMzUtZXhwZWN0cy1hbm90aGVyLXJvbGUtdGVhbWVkLXVwLXdpdGgtdW5tYW5uZWQtYWlyY3JhZnQv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stealthy F-35 expects another role - teamed up with unmanned aircraft,"WASHINGTON — In the coming years with the advancement of the US Air Force’s Next Generation Air Dominance [NGAD] program the fifth-generation F-35 stealth fighter could control up to five unmanned autonomous and attritable aircraft. This opinion was expressed by Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall quoted by Defense News.

His comment comes amid expectations from the US Air Force to find out how manned fighter jets and bombers will combine with drones. The US Air Force may receive this response in late March as the budget proposal will be published.

“The F-35 could also be teamed up with unmanned aircraft” Kendall said. This is not the first time Kendall has talked about the possibility of manned aircraft participating in joint drone missions. A year ago he told Politico that he expected funds to be allocated in 2023 for two combat drones to unite with fighters and bombers. In this regard in addition to the F-35 which is supposed to be a key “player” in the NGAD program B-21 Raider long-range bombers are the next idea for joint operational work in the air. “The Air Force needs to define a family of systems for the developed B-21 Raider … including by combining autonomous drones with the B-21” Kendall said.

However there are still many “gaps” and “ambiguities” in the idea of ​​a manned aircraft controlling a team of combat drones in various defense missions. One of the main problems that the Pentagon will have to solve is the operational range of the drones ie. they have to get as far as the F-35 for example. The second issue to be addressed is the payload. Assuming the drone can support the F-35 to its final destination will there be any “reasonable payload” left to use Kendall said.

In any case the idea of ​​an autonomous and unmanned aerial vehicle providing air support to a combat aircraft has its advantages. Saving lives using more drones than airplanes is a key factor as is the cost of such a mission. It would be much more expensive to use several fighter jets than one “manned fighter” and up to four drones. This is the opinion of Lieutenant General Clint Hinote Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategy Integration and Requirements which he recently expressed.

“Some of the platforms being considered or experimented with are” exquisite “… others are lower cost and just do one or two things well. There’s also matters of range speed weapons capacity and other factors that affect the cost” Hinote said.

First the US Air Force must decide which of the many combat drones and autonomous devices is perfectly suited to perform such missions and “come under the command” of a manned F-35 for example. Analyzes are yet to come but many experts believe that the Skyborg currently being developed as an unmanned aerial vehicle and artificial intelligence is the solution the Air Force is looking for. At least according to Kendall this is a very possible option.

Skyborg the Golden Horde and NTS-3

Skyborg is one of the three “avant-garde” programs of the US Air Force selected as priorities at the end of 2019. They are to lead to a jump in the capacity of this formation. In addition to unmanned “companions” for fighters there is also the “Golden Horde” program aimed at creating communication cooperation and thus group behavior of weapon systems [missiles] which will increase their effectiveness on the battlefield.

The third program is the program of the new NTS-3 navigation satellite which will be remotely programmable in orbit and thus effectively avoid interference. Of course this satellite will also have better technical parameters of sensors and transmitting and receiving devices than its predecessors.

Skyborg is to enable the creation of a cheap fleet [it seems that a maximum of USD 10 million per copy] and consequently numerous accompanying machines.

The USAF claims that this will make it possible to change the doctrine of its operation which may be seen as the fact that the United States gained numerical superiority on the air battlefield. Currently Americans theoretically have it too but the forces are scattered all over the world and the number of aviation in the People’s Republic of China and the Russian Federation is expected to increase.

Gaining an overwhelming numerical superiority in the air and with machines that can be sacrificed contrary to the current doctrine of taking care of every aircraft [moral political financial costs] can actually change the way of conducting air battles of the future.

And after 77 years of dutiful service it’s not ready to quit yet. This Martin JRM-3 Mars is the largest flying boat in operation and it’s been waiting six years for someone to give it a new home.

The stats of this aircraft are absolutely incredible. Its wings spread out 60.96 m just 3.35 m shorter than a Boeing 747-400’s. That’s still 36.58 m shorter than the king the massive Hughes H-4 Hercules. Lined up along those wings are four Curtiss Wright R-3350-24WA 18-cylinder radial engines rated at 2500 HP each. There have been larger and heavier flying boats but none of them can say that they’re still airworthy like this 1945 JRM-3 Mars named Hawaii Mars can.

You can own it too but it’s going to set you back a whopping $US5 ($7)000000 ($6941000).

The Glenn L. Martin Company was founded in 1912 by the man it was named after. Martin was one of aviation’s pioneers who flew and designed his own aircraft. The man broke early records like in 1912 flying 106 km in 80 minutes over water during a round trip from Newport Bay California to Catalina Island’s Avalon. In 1913 he set another record by flying to an altitude of 2743.20 m.

His company had a focus on building warplanes for the United States and its allies. Martin Co. built bombers for the World War I war effort and in the years after the war it even built civilian China Clipper flying boats for Pan American World Airways. Martin Co. would later merge with American-Marietta Corporation which would merge again into Lockheed Martin.

In 1938 the National Museum of the U.S. Navy notes Glenn Co. developed a long-range patrol flying boat. The XPB2M-1 Mars was a PBM Mariner patrol bomber design but scaled up. The prototype launched on November 8 1941 and had its first flight in 1942. After tests going into 1943 the Navy liked what it saw but the role of a patrol bomber was no longer necessary. It was converted into the XPB2M-1R transport and the Navy ordered 20 of them.

The first Hawaii Mars was delivered in June 1945 too late to aid in World War II. Thus the Navy scaled back its order to the five others still on the production line. A total of seven were made with production concluding in 1947. The original Hawaii Mars was lost early on in its career crashing in Chesapeake Bay just weeks after its first flight.

This specific flying boat the second Hawaii Mars was completed in 1945 and delivered to the Fleet Tactical Support Squadron 2 at Alameda California in 1946. There it joined its siblings in carrying cargo. This role didn’t last too long however and it was retired in 1956.

In 1959 the flying boat was picked up by Canadian company Forest Industries Flying Tankers. It was given the tail number CF-LYL and converted into a forest firefighting aircraft. Its registration would change to C-FLYL in 1983 and remains unchanged today.

And as you’d expect a big flying boat means that it can drop a huge load of water. C-FLYL’s carrying capacity is 27255 l!

It would continue flying as a firefighting water bomber into the present day getting purchased by the Coulson Group in 2007. Its home base would become Sproat Lake where it is now and over time the flying boat’s become a bit of a celebrity. I mean largest operational flying boat is a pretty awesome honour.

And during the plane’s tenure with British Columbia’s Wildfire Service? As CNN Travel notes one of the flying boat’s pilots had pulled the trigger between 600 and 700 times since 2009. So the plane was definitely doing some hard work.

Unfortunately the Wildfire Service declined to renew the flying boat’s contract and as Global News notes it fought its last fire in 2016. The aircraft made an appearance at 2016’s EAA AirVenture dazzling crowds with an airshow. Coulson Group had hopes of finding someone willing to buy it for $US3 ($4) million. That didn’t happen. The Canadian public has begged for the aircraft’s return but the government took a different approach to forest firefighting with smaller aircraft.

That means this beast has been waiting for about six years for someone anyone to take it home. The flying boat hasn’t even flown since 2016. It’s been maintained in flying condition and had its last annual inspection in 2016.

Most of the plane’s siblings met a sad fate. All of the others but Philippine Mars were lost to crashes or reached the scrapper. Philippine Mars is intact but not airworthy.

Coulson owns that one too and the goal is to put it in the National Naval Aviation Museum.

So this isn’t just the largest flying boat operating but the last airworthy of its kind. And it’s not ready to quit. The price is now $US5 ($7) million on Platinum Fighter Sales and the buyer would get a fresh annual with the purchase. Hopefully someone rich enough for a vintage bird keeps it alive.

Author’s note: An earlier version of this story’s sub-headline said that this aircraft is the “second largest.” That was an error somehow carried over from an early draft. That has been fixed."

I remember thinking: well that will never happen! Even with the popularity of distance learning and digital education platforms to support in-person learning I couldn’t imagine a world in which the campus didn’t feature as the hub of resources networking and socialising. Yet that was exactly the world the pandemic brought us.

In September 2020 my colleagues at Brunel University London and I lamented (over a video call) how hard the coming term was going to be how our students were losing out how our teaching wouldn’t translate online. The main pedagogy of my subject creative writing is the writing workshop by which students read and offer feedback on each other’s work. For students new to this discipline being in a room together engaging in what can be a nerve-racking activity felt very important. No online version could replace real human connection surely?

University is not just a place where teaching and learning happens – it is where young people transition from teenage to adult life where they feed themselves do their own laundry manage their money find their adult friendship groups. It is where they learn to take charge of their lives.

This was my experience of university 25 years ago. But at Brunel many of the students were already having very different experiences from mine. Some lived at home and commuted across London to classes. Some balanced studying with part-time or not-so-part-time work. Crucially most had a sophisticated digital literacy which in some ways meant they were far more prepared for online learning than I was.

Here are some of the things that happened in the past two years.

Student attendance improved – in some cases significantly. With no commute to face more students logged in to classes – often I suspect from bed. Why don’t I know whether or not they were in bed? Because in the first weeks many kept their cameras off – until my team decided that talking into an abyss of black screens was awful and introduced a “cameras on” policy. The chat function in Zoom is an interesting place – students who might be shy to talk in class might not be shy in chat. Sometimes I struggled to keep up with the speed of their responses. My day became full of new language: “Let’s Zoom” “I’ll just screen-share” “See you on Teams!” On good days I had 40 students attending fruitful online discussions giving many responses to my questions and sensitive feedback about each other’s work. But other words and phrases entered my language too such as “digital poverty” which applied to students who didn’t have laptops or an internet connection. One young woman told me that she was sharing her mum’s phone with her three younger siblings all of them meant to be learning online. My eyesight got rapidly worse. In December 2020 I appeared on video wearing glasses for the first time. My colleagues and I curated our video backgrounds to look learned – many sat in front of bookshelves. I seemed always to be moving my washing rack out of sight. It wasn’t great but it wasn’t awful. My students seemed to cope with online learning better than my six-year-old son who languished at home with 155 “outstanding activities” on Seesaw his primary school’s digital platform. (That is no criticism of primary teachers who were legendary in their response to delivering online and in-person teaching throughout.)

We have been teaching face-to-face again since September. No mandate was issued on face masks so the students mainly didn’t wear them. On the first day back – teaching second-year undergraduates who had studied their entire first year online – there was a buzz in the room. Meeting someone “IRL” is very different from meeting them in a tiny digital box. One student whom I had spent much time talking to over video the previous year surprised me by being really tall.

Students’ experiences of Covid were hugely varied but I doubt any of them would say they were unaffected. The university’s mental health services are now overrun. Immunocompromised students are still effectively in lockdown. In my life writing module I asked students to reflect on their experience of the pandemic. Their moving testimonies – on feeling isolated lonely their sense of missing out on life – reminded me of how we must take care of our young people and understand that although lockdown is over the shadow it has cast endures.

In his recent “10 Things” feature ESPN’s NBA Senior Writer Zach Lowe illustrated one of those in Trendon Watford.

Across two different frontcourt positions Watford — who recently had his two-way deal converted to a four-year $5.8 million contract — has become a featured option in the Blazers’ offense. Most often he uses a soft touch through his work from floater range where as Lowe notes he’s shooting 51 percent from this season.

Watford flicks up this bad boy out of all kinds of actions: face-up drives; coast-to-coast takes some with Eurosteppy finishes; quarterback keeper-style fake handoffs; and via a bruising post-up game that has proven effective against guards on switches

Lowe also praised Watford’s ability to play hard and his athleticism when it comes to defending multiple positions in pick-and-roll switches. In accessing him long-term he gave a prediction on what Watford could end up being going forward.

Watford probably tops out as a solid backup but that’s a nice find; Portland nabbed Watford on a two-way deal after he went undrafted and then bumped him up to a three-year contract.

Over the last eight games he’s averaging 15.8 points 7.1 rebounds 3.0 assists and 1.1 blocks per game on 47-30-88 percentage splits.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWlseWdhemV0dGUvbmFtZS9rYXRoYXJpbmUtbG93ZS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMzY5NDE4NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Katharine Lowe Obituary (1926 - 2022) - Lake Placid NY - The Daily Gazette Co.,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/dailygazette/name/katharine-lowe-obituary?id=33694184 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWlseWdhemV0dGUvbmFtZS9rYXRoYXJpbmUtbG93ZS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMzY5NDE4NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The 150th Kentucky Derby on Saturday featured a photo finish and record betting interest.

According to Churchill Downs $210.7 million was wagered on Mystik Dan's win of the Kentucky Derby besting by $20 million the previous betting record set last year.

Mystik Dan went off as an 18-1 underdog and held off Sierra Leone and Forever Young in what was the closest finish in the Kentucky Derby since 1947 according to the track.

Overall betting on the Kentucky Derby Day card soared to a record $320.5 million beating last year's record of $288.7 million. Additionally TwinSpires an online racebook and official betting partner of the Kentucky Derby took a record $92.1 million in wagering on Saturday's races at Churchill Downs.

The 20-horse field included two entries from Japan: third-place-finisher Forever Young and T.O. Password running fifth.

Ron DeSantis barred the sale of lab-grown meat in the Sunshine State.

DeSantis signed the legislation called SB 1084 into effect on May 1 casting it as a bid to stop the World Economic Forum’s goal of forcing the world to eat lab-grown meat and insects “an overlooked source of protein” according to a news release.

Rather “Florida is increasing meat production and encouraging residents to continue to consume and enjoy 100% real Florida beef” the governor’s office added.

DeSantis previously has blasted “the global elite’s plan to force the world to eat meat grown in a petri dish or bugs to achieve their authoritarian goals.”

4 Jeff Bezos and his fiancée Lauren Sanchez moved to Florida mere months before announcing a $60 million investment into lab-grown meats via the Amazon founder’s Bezos Earth Fund. Bezos Earth Fund

The move comes about a month after the Bezos Earth Fund chaired by the Amazon founder and Sanchez announced a hefty investment into sustainable protein including plant-based fermented and cultivated meats — part of the organization’s larger $1 billion commitment to expanding food production Fortune earlier reported.

“We need to feed 10 billion people with healthy sustainable food throughout this century while protecting our planet. We can do it and it will require a ton of innovation” Sanchez wrote in a statement announcing the $60 million investment.

Lab-grown meats differ from its slaughter-free counterparts like Impossible Foods in that they are grown from real animal cells that are replicated scientifically eliminating the need to farm animals.

Impossible burgers and other vegan proteins such as Beyond Meat meanwhile are made using alternative protein sources like tempeh tofu seitan and beans among other products.

According to science magazine Scientific American the US Department of Agriculture granted its first-ever approval of cell-cultured meat produced by two companies GOOD Meat and UPSIDE Foods last June — less than a year after the Food and Drug Administration declared the companies’ products safe to eat.

Florida for reference ranks 13th in the US in overall cattle numbers with a total herd size of 886000 among 15000 beef producers with total sales of $546 million according to Fortune citing the Florida Beef Council.

Before garnering US approval GOOD Meat had already been selling its cultivated chicken in Singapore. It made its debut in America in a dish curated by well-known chef José Andrés at his Washington DC restaurant China Chilcano.

The nonprofit Good Food Institute reports that the cultivated meat industry has grown to include more than 150 companies backed by $2.6 billion in investments Fortune cited — with Bezos among those funding the sector.

Bezos and DeSantis’s clashing opinions on the lab-grown meat industry are coming to light shortly after the 60-year-old tech billionaire moved from Seattle near Amazon’s headquarters to Miami closer to his space exploration firm Blue Origin’s home base.

In October 2023 it was revealed that Bezos had purchased two mansions on Florida’s exclusive “Billionaire Bunker” the man-made island formally known as Indian Creek Island.

Last month he added a third multimillion-dollar estate to his sprawling Miami portfolio in an off-market transaction reportedly worth $90 million.

Universal’s The Fall Guy the Ryan Gosling starrer inspired by the 1980s TV show kicked off the summer movie season at No. 1 with $28.5 million while Disney’s rerelease of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace surprised by coming in at No. 2 with $8.1 million.

Despite The Fall Guy’s No. 1 finish its haul came in behind initial expectations of $30 million to $35 million and overall the box office is down dramatically from the same frame a year ago when Marvel Studios’ Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 bowed to $118.4 million domestically. The weekend is down 53 percent from last year and off more than 66 percent from 2022 when Marvel’s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness opened to $187.4 million domestically.

The Fall Guy is said to have a net budget of $130 million after tax incentives for shooting in Australia. Universal will now hope that Fall Guy’s A- CinemaScore from audiences will help it make up ground in the coming weeks with word of mouth. It also boasts strong reviews out of South by Southwest.

The feature hails from stuntman-turned-director David Leitch and has been marketed as a love letter to the stunt community. Gosling at the height of his star power thanks to his Oscar-nominated turn as Ken in Barbie fronts the picture as a beaten down stuntman who comes out of retirement to try to find a missing A-list star and save a film (which happens to be directed by his ex played by Emily Blunt). The feature has a global cume of $65.4 globally.

Phantom Menace‘s weekend is a nice turn of events for the film. It kicked off George Lucas’ Star Wars prequel trilogy in 1999 and for years after was a punchline for audiences and Star Wars fans but has grown in appreciation in the decades since with younger fans who grew up on the film coming into adulthood and star Ewan McGregor reprising his role of Obi-Wan Kenobi for his own Disney+ series in 2022 helping further build nostalgia for the film. It returned to theaters as part of the film’s 25th anniversary as well as for May the 4th the unofficial Star Wars holiday.

The Phantom Menace edged out Amazon MGM Studios’ sexy tennis drama Challengers for No. 2. The Luca Guadagnino feature had a solid hold in weekend two dropping just 49 percent for a weekend gross of $7.6 million and a cume of $29.4 million. Zendaya Josh O’Connor and Mike Faist star.

Sony and Screen Gem’s Tarot bowed in its first weekend to $6.5 million a solid start considering the feature cost $8 million and did not have a traditional marketing campaign. Sony embarked on its first digital-only campaign for Tarot meaning no TV spots or billboards for the feature in which seven friends accidentally unleash an evil entity trapped in a deck of cursed Tarot cards. Neither critics nor audiences embraced this one. It has an 8 percent on Rotten Tomatoes while audiences gave it a low C- CinemaScore. It ends the weekend with a global haul of $10.2 million to date.

For one night only this weekend it also had Madonna.

More than a million people thronged Copacabana beach on Saturday night turning its vast stretch of sand into a massive dancefloor for a free concert by the pop star as she completed her world tour.

“Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world” Madonna 65 told the tightly packed crowd. Pointing out the ocean view and the mountains she added: “This place is magic.”

In the run-up to the concert the city had been buzzing with fans lined up outside the stately Copacabana Palace hotel in the hope of catching a glimpse of the star. The city’s airport fielded an estimated 170 extra flights as fans poured in from around the world.

City officials estimated that 1.6 million people turned up for the concert some watching from brightly lit apartments or hotels overlooking the beach while others looked on from motorboats and sailboats anchored nearby.

As drones and helicopters flew overhead the singer offered up a dazzling show playing classics ranging from Like a Virgin to Like a Prayer and cycling through dozens of sets and costume changes.

Flanked by giant screens she began the show with her 1998 hit Nothing Really Matters eliciting a huge cheer from the crowd.

“Oi Rio!” she called out in Portuguese. The response was swift carried by more than a million voices: “Oi Queen Madonna!”

The singer also paid an emotional tribute to “all the bright lights” lost to Aids as she sang Live to Tell against a backdrop of black-and-white photos featuring people who died from the illness.

The Brazilian pop artists Anitta and Pabllo Vittar as well as younger musicians from samba schools also took part in the show.

The show which Madonna’s official website described as the biggest ever in her 40-year career marked the final stop on her Celebration tour. Giant screens and 18 sound towers had been spread out along the beach to ensure the crowds could enjoy the event.

Fans many of whom lined up hours or even days before the concert to get a good view hailed Madonna’s performance. “I have never seen such a powerful show” one told the BBC. “It’s unimaginable very much out of the ordinary” she added.

“Madonna is spectacular” said another. “There’s no concert better than Madonna’s.”

City officials on high alert after a young Brazilian fan died at a Taylor Swift concert last year as a result of heat exhaustion ordered firefighters to cool down fans by spraying water before the concert. Free drinking water was also handed out as temperatures hovered at about 27C (81F) during the late-night show.

More than 3000 police officers were deployed around the concert area where the Rolling Stones and Rod Stewart have also drawn million-strong crowds.

Across Rio anticipation had been building all week. “Welcome Queen!” read Heineken ads plastered around the city while bars and restaurants served up “Like a Virgin” cocktails. Across the Copacabana neighbourhood the singer’s image was emblazoned on billboards souvenirs and T-shirts.

As hotel bookings in Copacabana climbed to an estimated 98% of capacity Rio state’s security readied plans that included the presence of 3200 military personnel and 1500 civilian police officers on standby while the country’s navy carried out inspections of any vessel looking to follow the concert offshore. City officials estimated that the concert would inject as much as 293m reais (£46m) into the local economy.

The oil and automotive industries as well as the Koch network undercut efforts to make today’s fleet of vehicles more efficient and less reliant on fossil fuels.

This article originally appeared in DeSmog a global investigative reporting and research organization that works “to provide climate accountability and serve as an antidote to science denial and disinformation.”

For roughly a decade the U.S. oil industry and its backers touted American oil abundance and “energy dominance.” But in the face of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and resulting sanctions gasoline prices immediately spiked 79 cents a gallon in the span of two weeks briefly touching a record high of $4.43 a gallon and the market’s been in turmoil ever since.

Domestic oil drillers have proved unable or unwilling to offer drivers rapid relief with one oil executive warning that shale companies were already struggling and would not be able to increase production. Indeed weekly crude oil production in the United States hovered at 11.6 million barrels a day through February and into mid-March federal data shows – down from pre-pandemic heights of over 13 million.

The pain at the pump for American drivers has roots that run deeper than today’s crisis. In recent years while fracking’s supporters were shouting “drill baby drill” the oil industry began lobbying behind the scenes to undercut programs designed to make vehicles more fuel-efficient or less reliant on fossil fuels. Alongside automakers they helped pave the way for a boom in gas guzzlers that attracted consumers when gas prices were relatively low: In 2021 a stunning 78% of new vehicles sold in the United States were SUVs or trucks according to the Wall Street Journal. American carmakers like Ford General Motors and Fiat Chrysler have nearly abandoned making sedans for U.S. drivers altogether.

That was a step in the wrong direction efficiency advocates say. “We absolutely should be moving to establishing independence from fossil fuels both for geopolitical and for public health and climate reasons” said Luke Tonachel director of the Natural Resources Defense Council’s (NRDC) clean vehicles and fuels group. “I think our best tool to fight petro-dictators is to shake off the need for the petroleum that is the source of their power.”

The recent bigger-is-better boom is creating big problems for drivers as gas prices soar because once a vehicle is built keeping up with maintenance and deploying a few tips and tricks are about all your average driver can do to improve a car’s fuel efficiency beyond its design specs. Until today’s cars are retired American drivers are pretty much stuck with hundreds of millions of vehicles built while gas prices largely hovered between $2 and $3 a gallon.

But while conversations about fuel efficiency are often dominated by debates about whether buyers or sellers should shoulder the blame for the stampede towards SUVs over Priuses there’s another often-ignored actor in the room.

Federal rules shape the menu of options offered to consumers by requiring automakers to achieve fleet-wide averages on fuel efficiency. A quick look back shows the oil industry’s fingerprints (alongside those of car manufacturers) on gambits to grind down those fuel efficiency standards leaving everyday Americans more dependent on oil.

“Least efficient globally”

This isn’t the first time Americans have been burned by vehicles that fail to deliver good mileage – nor that foreign governments sought to leverage that inefficiency against American drivers. In fact today’s fuel-efficiency framework was born in response to another oil supply crunch with geopolitical roots almost 50 years ago.

In 1973 the average gas mileage of new American cars had plummeted to an all-time low of 12.9 miles per gallon (MPG) — or about half the Ford Model T’s 25 MPG according to The Atlantic. That same year the first major oil crisis hit the United States in the form of an oil embargo by OPEC. As the Nixon administration scrambled to respond oil rationing soon followed.

In response the federal government created the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards or CAFE standards designed to push automakers to make increasingly efficient cars by raising fleet-wide minimum requirements every year.

That push worked for about the first decade. From 1975 to 1987 average fuel economy rose quickly – but then it declined between 1988 and 2004 as the Energy Department reported last year.

Average fuel economy rose again by 29% between 2005 and 2020 the Energy Department added. But a closer look suggests that by other measures efforts to improve the average gas mileage of all the cars SUVs and light trucks driving America’s streets slowed to a crawl in recent years despite technological leaps and bounds in hybrid and electric vehicles.

“Even as standards have tightened over time the actual sales-adjusted fuel economy rating of new vehicles has been unchanged at around 25 miles per gallon since 2014” the Wall Street Journal reported in January. “No wonder U.S. vehicles are among the least efficient globally.”

A November 2021 Environmental Protection Agency report touts the climb in fuel efficiency in 2020 noting a 0.5 mile-per-gallon gain to 25.4 MPG “a record high.” But efficiency advocates noted those numbers actually fell short of federal targets faulting loopholes in the law that they say promote larger vehicles.

“We’re facing a climate crisis yet automakers are producing cars that are barely more fuel efficient on average than what they sold a year earlier even as technology improves” Avi Mersky senior transportation researcher for the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy said in a statement that month. “They’re following the letter of the standards but exploiting all the weaknesses in the regulation to keep making gas guzzlers. It’s terrible for the climate and it costs drivers at the pump especially now as gas prices are increasing.”

Fighting fuel economy

Battles over fuel-efficiency standards most recently came to a head as the Trump administration considered unwinding Obama-era rules that would have pushed CAFE standards to 50 MPG by 2025 (with the caveat that because of the law’s quirks real world gas mileage differs from the CAFE numbers).

“The auto industry has really been the main fighter [against] improvements to the CAFE standards” Dan Becker director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Safe Climate Transport Campaign said describing lobbying fights stretching back decades. The oil industry he said had seemed to stay mostly on the sidelines. “I think the reason was there was enough of a market for oil that even if the U.S. demand was down somewhat the oil majors would find plenty of people to buy their oil.”

But he added as President Trump entered office some oil refiners also began to involve themselves in fighting auto-efficiency regulations. In 2018 the New York Times uncovered lobbying efforts by oil companies and the Koch network.

“The oil industry’s campaign the details of which have not been previously reported illuminates why the rollbacks have gone further than the more modest changes automakers originally lobbied for” the New York Times reported describing fuel-economy lobbying by the nation’s largest oil refiner Marathon Petroleum and by oil trade groups.

“‘With oil scarcity no longer a concern’ Americans should be given a ‘choice in vehicles that best fit their needs’ read a draft of a letter that Marathon helped to circulate to members of Congress” the Times found. “Nineteen lawmakers from the delegations of Indiana West Virginia and Pennsylvania sent letters to the Transportation Department that included exact phrases and reasoning from the industry letter.”

A number of organizations with ties to the Koch network also joined in lobbying to weaken clean car standards as DeSmog previously reported. In March 2018 representatives from 11 groups including the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) the 60 Plus Association Frontiers of Freedom and the Taxpayers Protection Alliance (TPA) asked EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt to prevent California from setting its own fuel-efficiency standards.

Koch Industries itself the Times found even lobbied to repeal CAFE standards entirely.

The subsequent Trump rollbacks (which reduced plans for fleetwide averages to hit roughly 55 MPG by 2025 to about 40 MPG by 2026) had significant impacts said Tonachel. “It was a huge setback in terms of the innovation signal to the market and the opportunity for consumers to have access to cleaner more efficient vehicles” he said. “It cost consumers money at the pump as well as putting us in reverse in terms of addressing climate change.”

Over the past year the Biden administration began unwinding moves made by President Trump to loosen fuel-economy standards. “We’re now headed back in the right direction” said Tonachel adding that the administration’s goal of having 50% of car sales be zero emission vehicles by 2030 is “actually the minimum of what we should be doing.”

Nonetheless the Trump-era rollbacks have continued to echo. Not only did they impact cars on the road today Becker noted they were also used by auto lobbyists to argue for weaker standards in California whose authority to regulate car emissions was recently restored.

The notion of oil abundance was never a good reason to loosen fuel standards efficiency advocates said.

“Even if there’s an abundance of fossil fuels if we burn it we’re burning the planet” Tonachel said. “There’s no basis to burn more of it when we’re in a climate crisis.”

Electrifying the future

Gas prices of course deeply affect the ways that potential car buyers think about fuel efficiency. A widely cited 2018 report by Cox Automotive highlighted $4 a gallon as a “tipping point” for consumer demand for hybrids and sedans.

These days fuel-efficient vehicles and EVs are increasingly catching buyers’ eyes (though some fear supply chain issues may make transitioning today harder than it would have been yesterday). Demand for Ford’s F150 Lightning EV pickup truck for example has vastly outstripped supplies; there is approximately a three-year wait for the vehicle trade publication Equipment World reported on March 14. “With more than 200000 reservations by December the company announced plans in January to double production of the electric trucks as reservations were cut off.”

A poll by Consumer Reports last year found that 89% of U.S. drivers supported improving fuel efficiency for pickup trucks SUVs and other vehicles. “Car buyers expect new vehicles to be more fuel-efficient but automakers are failing to deliver what their customers want” David Friedman Consumer Reports’ VP of advocacy said as that poll was released.

But as lawmakers consider ways to reduce oil dependence following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February some Koch-linked organizations have re-entered the fray. On March 8 Tom Pyle president of the Institute for Energy Research also linked to Koch testified at a congressional hearing on electric vehicles faulting the concept of an energy transition for higher prices.

“A significant part of our current problem is the endless repetition of the propaganda about the utility of alternative sources of energy the possibility of net zero greenhouse gas emissions and the inevitability of an ‘energy transition’’’ Pyle said. “These foundational myths have led directly to higher energy prices for Americans.”

Americans for Prosperity (co-founded by David Koch) has also sought to shift some of the blame for rising gasoline prices away from the invasion of Ukraine and onto the Biden administration’s climate policies.

“The price at the pump and for home expenses began to rise before the Russian invasion of Ukraine” a post by AFP updated on March 7 says before launching into a list of ways it alleges the Biden administration “affected gas prices home heating costs and other energy-related burdens U.S. families and businesses face” (with no mention of the oil and gas industry’s own financial failures that drove investors away).

Of course fuel inefficiency has significant climate impacts.

He was the son of the late James and Barbara (Rasor) Dysinger and was born in Ann Arbor Michigan on April 15 1961. Matt and his family relocated to Findlay in 1968 when his father was transferred by Marathon Oil Company.

During his early years Matt played cello in the orchestra and was a competitive swimmer serving as co-captain of the FHS Swim Team his senior year. He helped coach kids in the Findlay Area Swim Team from 1976-1978. Matt graduated from Findlay High School in 1979. After high school he moved to Baton Rouge LA for 5 years attending Louisiana State University before returning to his hometown of Findlay. He turned back to roots in athletics and helped coach the Findlay High School swim team from 1983 - 1986 while also beginning his career as an insurance agent.

Matt began his long and successful insurance career in 1983 as a co-owner and sales executive of Spencer-Patterson Insurance. In 2004 they sold the Agency to Sky Financial where Matt continued on the leadership team as a V.P. under the new name Sky Insurance. In 2007 Sky Financial and Huntington Financial merged again changing the business name to Huntington Insurance where he remained a V.P. Matt finished his career as a Sr. Risk Consultant and Sales Executive for Knight Insurance Group.

While numerous some of Matt’s many passions were community involvement and leadership. During his life he served as president of the Hancock County chapter of the American Cancer Society served on the board for The Arts Partnership centennial president of Findlay Country Club member of the Recovery Oriented System of Care Committee of the Hancock County Board of Alcohol Drug Addiction and Mental Health Services (ADAMHS) and initial class of the Hancock Leadership program.

Matt had many pastimes a few were attending his daughter’s sporting events and activities spending a day on the golf course tending to his yard and landscaping detailing his car and most of all spending time with his family. Matt was dedicated to his years of sobriety from alcohol and to helping others struggling with addiction. For the past 12 years he has spent “happy hour” with a group of close friends relating and sharing their experiences strength and hopes with each other in relation to their lives as sober people.

He is survived by his beloved wife Jennifer (Payne) Dysinger; daughters: Rachel Dysinger of Cleveland Melissa Dysinger of Chicago and Charlotte White of Findlay; sister: Carrie (Dysinger) Bice of Lima nephew: Tyler (Natalie) Bice great nephew: Pierce and great niece: Palmer. He is preceded in death by his parents James and Barbara Dysinger.

When asked once why he stayed in Findlay he simply said “It’s my home - it’s where I’m from.”

A Celebration of Life Service will be held on Monday April 11 at Brix 411 S Main St from 4:00-8:00 pm with an opportunity for loved ones to share words of remembrance at 6:30 pm.

The airline’s refinery outside Philadelphia was the nation’s largest single importer of Russian crude oil last year buying 10.7 million barrels or 15% of the total U.S. crude imports from Russia according to U.S. Energy Department data analyzed by The Inquirer. PBF Energy which operates nearby refineries in New Jersey and Delaware also imported a significant amount of Russian crude and unfinished oils last year.

Under President Joe Biden’s March 8 ban on Russian energy imports those refiners and dozens of other importers of Russian oil and petroleum across the nation must switch to new suppliers. However Russian shipments already ordered are allowed to continue. Biden imposed the ban in response to growing calls from Congress to punish Russia for its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.

U.S. industry can adapt

The administration and the oil industry say the ban on Russian imports will be manageable as were previous market disruptions after the United States imposed sanctions on Iranian and Venezuelan crude. The Russian ban could contribute to rising energy costs that have caused pump prices to soar in the last year.

Russia is the world’s second-largest exporter of crude oil and a major supplier to Europe. But Russia accounted for only 3% of U.S crude imports last year.

It was a bigger exporter of petroleum products to the United States which includes refined fuels and unfinished oils. Altogether it accounted for 245 million barrels of crude oil and petroleum imports to the United States or about 8% of total U.S. petroleum imports.

While American industry can adapt to the loss of Russian imports the change in flows of crude and petroleum disrupts international shipping which can affect prices said Dean Foreman chief economist of the American Petroleum Institute.

“On a systemwide basis these volumes are relatively small” he said. “Shipping markets however are tight. And if you need to change the source of crude oil or these intermediate products in a relatively tight shipping market this change of source could result in higher costs.”

Russia accounted for 29% of Monroe’s imports

The Russian import ban will be felt in some parts of America more than others. Russian products arrive by large ships to a few coastal customers such as Monroe Energy and PBF while refiners in the nation’s interior are unaffected. For Monroe Russian crude amounted to 29% of its total imports last year second only to crude imported from Nigeria. For PBF Russia’s 7.5 million barrels amounted to about 12% of its imports last year ranking behind Saudi Arabia Canada and Mexico.

Monroe Energy says it placed its last order for Russian crude in November. “Monroe doesn’t plan to enter into additional agreements for Russian-supplied crude oil for the foreseeable future” said Adam Gattuso a company spokesperson who declined to answer other questions about the refinery’s crude oil sourcing practices.

PBF whose local refineries are in Delaware City Del. and Paulsboro referred questions to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) an industry trade group.

“No American refinery is contracting for new orders of Russian oil or petroleum products” said Ericka Perryman an AFPM spokesperson.

Why Philly refineries need imports

Industry experts say Russian crude oil can be replaced by similar grades of crude oil from other countries or from U.S. producers though it costs more to transport domestic crude by rail or American-flagged ships to Northeastern refineries that are not connected to producers by pipelines.

That’s a curse for import-dependent East Coast refineries whose output has declined by two-thirds in the last 15 years after a raft of plants closed including the giant Philadelphia Energy Solutions refinery in South Philadelphia in 2019.

But no American refineries were dependent specifically on Russian imports said John R. Auers executive vice president of Turner Mason & Co. an energy consultancy. Refineries bought Russian crude because it made economic sense in the prevailing market. ”Russian crude is more of an opportunistic piece of the crude slate” he said.

Auers said the economic advantages of buying Russian crude were dissipating at the end of 2021 explaining why Monroe and other refiners were already reducing their orders months before the Ukraine invasion. After the invasion Russian crude attained instant pariah status. Workers in Britain refused to unload a shipment earlier that arrived in a German-flagged vessel.

Now orphaned Russian crude is cheap on world markets while activists track vessel shipments online and are poised to publicly shame any buyers.

“Currently Russian crude is at a high discount because their markets are limited” said Auers. “But it doesn’t matter because you can’t buy it.”

The Monroe Energy refinery is configured to use light crude that is “sweet” meaning it contains low levels of sulfur an impurity that needs to be removed during the refining process. In addition to Russian and Nigerian crude Monroe also imported shipments last year from Canada Kazakhstan Angola and a small amount from North Sea producers in Britain and Norway.

Monroe can receive domestic crude by rail and ship though individual movements of U.S. crude are not reported publicly by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). According to maritime sources the Trainer refinery received several visits by crude oil tankers from the U.S. Gulf Coast last year. Cargo that moves between U.S. ports must be transported on U.S. flagged vessels which increases transportation costs.

Delta Air Lines bought the Trainer refinery in 2012 from Conoco-Phillips and optimized production for jet fuel. It transports jet fuel to Northeastern airports including major Delta hubs at LaGuardia Airport and JFK International Airport in New York. According to its financial reports Delta swaps the gasoline diesel and other fuels it manufactures at Monroe Energy for jet fuel delivered to other airports across the nation where it operates.

Where does the Russian oil go?

The end-users for much of the Russian products to the United States are not always easy to track beyond the companies that import the material.

Besides Monroe Energy and PBF Russian crude was delivered to refineries on the Gulf Coast the West Coast and Hawaii according to EIA company-level reports.

The two largest corporate buyers were Marathon Petroleum Corp. which imported 13.9 million barrels to refineries in Alaska California Washington and Texas and Valero Energy which bought 13.1 million barrels of Russian crude for plants in Louisiana Texas and two locations in California.

Russia also exported 129 million barrels of partly refined unfinished oils to the United States last year 78% greater than its crude oil exports to the U.S. Most of these heavy intermediate oils were delivered to Gulf Coast refineries which have the equipment to refine the material into valuable fuels like diesel and gasoline. The PBF refinery in Delaware City which is configured to refine heavy sour crude oil also received 4.1 million barrels of intermediate product from Russia last year.

The United States also imported some Russian finished fuel and “motor fuel blending components” which includes materials like alkylate benzene toluene and xylene that are mixed into fuel to make finished motor gasoline (it doesn’t include ethanol).

Most of the 18.4 million barrels of blending components were imported into the Northeast by companies like ExxonMobil and BP Products North America Inc. which added it to fuel supplies.

The U.S. imported about 24 million barrels of refined Russian products mostly into East Coast markets including diesel gasoline jet fuel and residual fuel a heavy oil used to power some marine vessels and industrial boilers. The fuels were primarily imported by large international commodity trading companies like Trafigura AG and Gunvor USA LLC which sold them to distributors or large industrial customers. Most of the gasoline was destined for Southeastern ports: Norfolk Va. Savannah Ga. Jacksonville Fla. and San Juan Puerto Rico.

Lukoil the Russian oil company that has become the target of a consumer boycott after the Ukraine invasion imported about 1.1 million barrels of Russian diesel and heating oil into Northeast markets.

A silver lining?

Monroe Energy which has struggled in recent years amid efforts by Delta to sell the facility or to find a strategic partner reduced production during the pandemic when airline traffic cratered and changed its output last year to produce more motor fuel and less jet fuel according to Delta’s financial reports.

But Auers the refinery consultant believes that the current crisis in Eastern Europe and the uncertainty of Russian energy flows may be favorable to Monroe Energy and other beleaguered East Coast refiners that in recent years have been at the short end of a competition with European refiners that can export surplus production to the United States.

European refiners now face uncertain crude oil supplies from Russia as well as soaring prices for Russian natural gas which is a major cost for refiners he said. And with elevated crude oil prices the profit margins for U.S. refiners have gone up.

“I think Delta/Monroe actually has pretty good prospects for the foreseeable future given the negative environment for European refiners” said Auers. “The short-term and even medium-term prospects of East Coast refineries have really improved at the expense of the European refiners.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9iZWF0cmljZWRhaWx5c3VuL25hbWUvamVzc2Uta296YWstb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzM3MDUzNzbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jesse Kozak Obituary (1923 - 2022) - Beatrice NE - Beatrice Daily Sun,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/beatricedailysun/name/jesse-kozak-obituary?id=33705376 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9iZWF0cmljZWRhaWx5c3VuL25hbWUvamVzc2Uta296YWstb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzM3MDUzNzbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

The oil and automotive industries as well as the Koch network undercut efforts to make today’s fleet of vehicles more efficient and less reliant on fossil fuels.

This article originally appeared in DeSmog a global investigative reporting and research organization that works “to provide climate accountability and serve as an antidote to science denial and disinformation.”

For roughly a decade the U.S. oil industry and its backers touted American oil abundance and “energy dominance.” But in the face of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and resulting sanctions gasoline prices immediately spiked 79 cents a gallon in the span of two weeks briefly touching a record high of $4.43 a gallon and the market’s been in turmoil ever since.

Domestic oil drillers have proved unable or unwilling to offer drivers rapid relief with one oil executive warning that shale companies were already struggling and would not be able to increase production. Indeed weekly crude oil production in the United States hovered at 11.6 million barrels a day through February and into mid-March federal data shows – down from pre-pandemic heights of over 13 million.

The pain at the pump for American drivers has roots that run deeper than today’s crisis. In recent years while fracking’s supporters were shouting “drill baby drill” the oil industry began lobbying behind the scenes to undercut programs designed to make vehicles more fuel-efficient or less reliant on fossil fuels. Alongside automakers they helped pave the way for a boom in gas guzzlers that attracted consumers when gas prices were relatively low: In 2021 a stunning 78% of new vehicles sold in the United States were SUVs or trucks according to the Wall Street Journal. American carmakers like Ford General Motors and Fiat Chrysler have nearly abandoned making sedans for U.S. drivers altogether.

That was a step in the wrong direction efficiency advocates say. “We absolutely should be moving to establishing independence from fossil fuels both for geopolitical and for public health and climate reasons” said Luke Tonachel director of the Natural Resources Defense Council’s (NRDC) clean vehicles and fuels group. “I think our best tool to fight petro-dictators is to shake off the need for the petroleum that is the source of their power.”

The recent bigger-is-better boom is creating big problems for drivers as gas prices soar because once a vehicle is built keeping up with maintenance and deploying a few tips and tricks are about all your average driver can do to improve a car’s fuel efficiency beyond its design specs. Until today’s cars are retired American drivers are pretty much stuck with hundreds of millions of vehicles built while gas prices largely hovered between $2 and $3 a gallon.

But while conversations about fuel efficiency are often dominated by debates about whether buyers or sellers should shoulder the blame for the stampede towards SUVs over Priuses there’s another often-ignored actor in the room.

Federal rules shape the menu of options offered to consumers by requiring automakers to achieve fleet-wide averages on fuel efficiency. A quick look back shows the oil industry’s fingerprints (alongside those of car manufacturers) on gambits to grind down those fuel efficiency standards leaving everyday Americans more dependent on oil.

“Least efficient globally”

This isn’t the first time Americans have been burned by vehicles that fail to deliver good mileage – nor that foreign governments sought to leverage that inefficiency against American drivers. In fact today’s fuel-efficiency framework was born in response to another oil supply crunch with geopolitical roots almost 50 years ago.

In 1973 the average gas mileage of new American cars had plummeted to an all-time low of 12.9 miles per gallon (MPG) — or about half the Ford Model T’s 25 MPG according to The Atlantic. That same year the first major oil crisis hit the United States in the form of an oil embargo by OPEC. As the Nixon administration scrambled to respond oil rationing soon followed.

In response the federal government created the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards or CAFE standards designed to push automakers to make increasingly efficient cars by raising fleet-wide minimum requirements every year.

That push worked for about the first decade. From 1975 to 1987 average fuel economy rose quickly – but then it declined between 1988 and 2004 as the Energy Department reported last year.

Average fuel economy rose again by 29% between 2005 and 2020 the Energy Department added. But a closer look suggests that by other measures efforts to improve the average gas mileage of all the cars SUVs and light trucks driving America’s streets slowed to a crawl in recent years despite technological leaps and bounds in hybrid and electric vehicles.

“Even as standards have tightened over time the actual sales-adjusted fuel economy rating of new vehicles has been unchanged at around 25 miles per gallon since 2014” the Wall Street Journal reported in January. “No wonder U.S. vehicles are among the least efficient globally.”

A November 2021 Environmental Protection Agency report touts the climb in fuel efficiency in 2020 noting a 0.5 mile-per-gallon gain to 25.4 MPG “a record high.” But efficiency advocates noted those numbers actually fell short of federal targets faulting loopholes in the law that they say promote larger vehicles.

“We’re facing a climate crisis yet automakers are producing cars that are barely more fuel efficient on average than what they sold a year earlier even as technology improves” Avi Mersky senior transportation researcher for the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy said in a statement that month. “They’re following the letter of the standards but exploiting all the weaknesses in the regulation to keep making gas guzzlers. It’s terrible for the climate and it costs drivers at the pump especially now as gas prices are increasing.”

Fighting fuel economy

Battles over fuel-efficiency standards most recently came to a head as the Trump administration considered unwinding Obama-era rules that would have pushed CAFE standards to 50 MPG by 2025 (with the caveat that because of the law’s quirks real world gas mileage differs from the CAFE numbers).

“The auto industry has really been the main fighter [against] improvements to the CAFE standards” Dan Becker director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Safe Climate Transport Campaign said describing lobbying fights stretching back decades. The oil industry he said had seemed to stay mostly on the sidelines. “I think the reason was there was enough of a market for oil that even if the U.S. demand was down somewhat the oil majors would find plenty of people to buy their oil.”

But he added as President Trump entered office some oil refiners also began to involve themselves in fighting auto-efficiency regulations. In 2018 the New York Times uncovered lobbying efforts by oil companies and the Koch network.

“The oil industry’s campaign the details of which have not been previously reported illuminates why the rollbacks have gone further than the more modest changes automakers originally lobbied for” the New York Times reported describing fuel-economy lobbying by the nation’s largest oil refiner Marathon Petroleum and by oil trade groups.

“‘With oil scarcity no longer a concern’ Americans should be given a ‘choice in vehicles that best fit their needs’ read a draft of a letter that Marathon helped to circulate to members of Congress” the Times found. “Nineteen lawmakers from the delegations of Indiana West Virginia and Pennsylvania sent letters to the Transportation Department that included exact phrases and reasoning from the industry letter.”

A number of organizations with ties to the Koch network also joined in lobbying to weaken clean car standards as DeSmog previously reported. In March 2018 representatives from 11 groups including the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) the 60 Plus Association Frontiers of Freedom and the Taxpayers Protection Alliance (TPA) asked EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt to prevent California from setting its own fuel-efficiency standards.

Koch Industries itself the Times found even lobbied to repeal CAFE standards entirely.

The subsequent Trump rollbacks (which reduced plans for fleetwide averages to hit roughly 55 MPG by 2025 to about 40 MPG by 2026) had significant impacts said Tonachel. “It was a huge setback in terms of the innovation signal to the market and the opportunity for consumers to have access to cleaner more efficient vehicles” he said. “It cost consumers money at the pump as well as putting us in reverse in terms of addressing climate change.”

Over the past year the Biden administration began unwinding moves made by President Trump to loosen fuel-economy standards. “We’re now headed back in the right direction” said Tonachel adding that the administration’s goal of having 50% of car sales be zero emission vehicles by 2030 is “actually the minimum of what we should be doing.”

Nonetheless the Trump-era rollbacks have continued to echo. Not only did they impact cars on the road today Becker noted they were also used by auto lobbyists to argue for weaker standards in California whose authority to regulate car emissions was recently restored.

The notion of oil abundance was never a good reason to loosen fuel standards efficiency advocates said.

“Even if there’s an abundance of fossil fuels if we burn it we’re burning the planet” Tonachel said. “There’s no basis to burn more of it when we’re in a climate crisis.”

Electrifying the future

Gas prices of course deeply affect the ways that potential car buyers think about fuel efficiency. A widely cited 2018 report by Cox Automotive highlighted $4 a gallon as a “tipping point” for consumer demand for hybrids and sedans.

These days fuel-efficient vehicles and EVs are increasingly catching buyers’ eyes (though some fear supply chain issues may make transitioning today harder than it would have been yesterday). Demand for Ford’s F150 Lightning EV pickup truck for example has vastly outstripped supplies; there is approximately a three-year wait for the vehicle trade publication Equipment World reported on March 14. “With more than 200000 reservations by December the company announced plans in January to double production of the electric trucks as reservations were cut off.”

A poll by Consumer Reports last year found that 89% of U.S. drivers supported improving fuel efficiency for pickup trucks SUVs and other vehicles. “Car buyers expect new vehicles to be more fuel-efficient but automakers are failing to deliver what their customers want” David Friedman Consumer Reports’ VP of advocacy said as that poll was released.

But as lawmakers consider ways to reduce oil dependence following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February some Koch-linked organizations have re-entered the fray. On March 8 Tom Pyle president of the Institute for Energy Research also linked to Koch testified at a congressional hearing on electric vehicles faulting the concept of an energy transition for higher prices.

“A significant part of our current problem is the endless repetition of the propaganda about the utility of alternative sources of energy the possibility of net zero greenhouse gas emissions and the inevitability of an ‘energy transition’’’ Pyle said. “These foundational myths have led directly to higher energy prices for Americans.”

Americans for Prosperity (co-founded by David Koch) has also sought to shift some of the blame for rising gasoline prices away from the invasion of Ukraine and onto the Biden administration’s climate policies.

“The price at the pump and for home expenses began to rise before the Russian invasion of Ukraine” a post by AFP updated on March 7 says before launching into a list of ways it alleges the Biden administration “affected gas prices home heating costs and other energy-related burdens U.S. families and businesses face” (with no mention of the oil and gas industry’s own financial failures that drove investors away). First on AFP’s list is the EPA’s regulation of methane emissions – a major contributor to climate change.

Of course fuel inefficiency has significant climate impacts. The EPA now ranks the transportation sector as the top contributor to U.S. greenhouse gas emissions with light-duty vehicles responsible for the majority of those emissions. Becker called the push for efficiency “drilling for oil under Detroit” rather than Texas saying it offered major climate benefits.

“The biggest single step we can take to cut our dependence on oil and to stop global warming is to make vehicles efficient” said Becker “and ultimately they need to be electric.”

Most of the 18.4 million barrels of blending components were imported into the Northeast by companies like ExxonMobil and BP Products North America Inc. which added it to fuel supplies.

The U.S. imported about 24 million barrels of refined Russian products mostly into East Coast markets including diesel gasoline jet fuel and residual fuel a heavy oil used to power some marine vessels and industrial boilers. The fuels were primarily imported by large international commodity trading companies like Trafigura AG and Gunvor USA LLC which sold them to distributors or large industrial customers. Most of the gasoline was destined for Southeastern ports: Norfolk Va. Savannah Ga. Jacksonville Fla. and San Juan Puerto Rico.

Lukoil the Russian oil company that has become the target of a consumer boycott after the Ukraine invasion imported about 1.1 million barrels of Russian diesel and heating oil into Northeast markets.

A silver lining?

Monroe Energy which has struggled in recent years amid efforts by Delta to sell the facility or to find a strategic partner reduced production during the pandemic when airline traffic cratered and changed its output last year to produce more motor fuel and less jet fuel according to Delta’s financial reports.

But Auers the refinery consultant believes that the current crisis in Eastern Europe and the uncertainty of Russian energy flows may be favorable to Monroe Energy and other beleaguered East Coast refiners that in recent years have been at the short end of a competition with European refiners that can export surplus production to the United States.

European refiners now face uncertain crude oil supplies from Russia as well as soaring prices for Russian natural gas which is a major cost for refiners he said. And with elevated crude oil prices the profit margins for U.S. refiners have gone up.

“I think Delta/Monroe actually has pretty good prospects for the foreseeable future given the negative environment for European refiners” said Auers. “The short-term and even medium-term prospects of East Coast refineries have really improved at the expense of the European refiners.”",,,,,,,,,

I’m not a big fan of airport hotels so I just searched for what seemed like the best value. I chose the Renaissance because it was the least expensive of the close Marriott options…and I was pleasantly surprised.

Renaissance Newark Airport Bottom Line Review

Bottom line: I’m not a big fan of airport hotels I simply look for what seems like good value. The Renaissance fits the bill and more. It offers good runway views an incredible fitness room (one of the more important things for me at the airport) a decent breakfast comfortable rooms and a nice club lounge…when it’s open. All this plus quick and efficient transport to and from the airport make it one of the more appealing Marriott options near EWR.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGVsaWVybWlkZGxlZWFzdC5jb20vcHJvcGVydGllcy9hbW1hbi1tYXJyaW90dC1nbS00MC15ZWFyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Reflecting on 40 years of The Amman Marriott Hotel,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.hoteliermiddleeast.com/properties/amman-marriott-gm-40-years on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGVsaWVybWlkZGxlZWFzdC5jb20vcHJvcGVydGllcy9hbW1hbi1tYXJyaW90dC1nbS00MC15ZWFyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhdGVyZXJtaWRkbGVlYXN0LmNvbS9jbWUvbWFycmlvdHRzLW1vcmUtY3JhdmluZ3MtYXBw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marriott's More Cravings app created to stand out Caterer Middle East,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.caterermiddleeast.com/cme/marriotts-more-cravings-app on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhdGVyZXJtaWRkbGVlYXN0LmNvbS9jbWUvbWFycmlvdHRzLW1vcmUtY3JhdmluZ3MtYXBw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWZyb21hbG91bmdlLmNvbS9yaXR6LWNhcmx0b24tbWFsZGl2ZXMtZmFyaS1pc2xhbmRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Reader Success Story: How our reader generated INR 4/point value out of Marriott Bonvoy Points at the Ritz Carlton ...,"We love to hear stories from our readers about how a passion for collecting miles and points and sharing all sorts of do-it-yourself information on our site has affected their lives. Status via work trips Honeymoon plans in the works celebrating an anniversary in the Maldives a gift to their parents a vacation to Srinagar or Singapore or just that premium airline seat they secured on redemption. We’ve heard many such stories and this year we are trying to share more of these stories with you.

Reader Mrinal Thakkar who frequently contributes to the comments section as well recently headed to the Ritz Carlton Maldives Fari Islands using his points. I requested him to write up his story for the Live From A Lounge community. Read on.

I have been a long-time reader of LiveFromALounge.com and I’ve been collecting and spending points since 2017. I also attended the Mileage Mentor MasterClass in January 2021. (The April 2022 one is open for ticketing right now).

I did not sign up for the Marriott Platinum Challenge in 2020 as I was not sure about travelling in 2021 owing to the pandemic but when Marriott announced that they would be honouring status achieved in 2021 all the way till February 2023 I decided to do a mattress run in march 2021 across Marriott hotels in Mumbai using the double night promotion along with the 19 nights credited by Marriott owing to the Gold status via American Express Platinum Charge Card earlier on.

I managed to achieve Marriott Bonvoy Platinum status just before the second wave of Covid-19 in India so I was only able to start reaping the benefits and collecting a significant amount of points via my travels post-July 2021.

I had initially booked the Taj Chia Kutir for my sixth wedding anniversary using the 50% discount sale announced by Taj for Gold and Platinum-tier Inner Circle members. But as the dates started closing in Marriott had announced that they will be moving to dynamic points pricing for rewards. I changed tack to try and see if I could spend all my accumulated points before the devaluation happens. I had about 210000 points lying in my account and about 95k lying in my Amex Membership Rewards account. So I started searching for redemption options in the Maldives as I figured via LiveFromALounge.com that they offered good value for redemptions in the Maldives.

Initially I had planned to book 3 nights on points but I eventually went with 5 nights by using the 5th night free on redemptions feature of Marriott Bonvoy. So I bought 100000 Marriott Bonvoy points for USD 1250 transferred 90000 points from American Express Membership Rewards and then started searching for hotels. (At this moment Marriott Bonvoy is offering a buy miles promotion where you get a 50% bonus when you buy miles by March 23 2022.)

I was very confused between the St Regis Maldives and the newly-opened Ritz Carlton Maldives but since my wife was sceptical about the seaplane ride and she wanted an overwater villa it made the Ritz Carlton choice a no brainer.

Booking Experience

I started looking for availability around my anniversary date. Initially I didn’t get them but around a day before the free cancellation period expired I was able to see availability for my anniversary date and quickly switched the booking via Marriott’s platinum line over the phone. The initial booking was done via the Marriott Bonvoy app. I was happy I bagged a USD 22500 booking for a little over USD 1250 and it would have been even cheaper in fact next to zero had I had adequate points in my Marriott Bonvoy account.

The Transfer Experience

Transport to/from Male airport to resorts is definitely not cheap. I ended up spending USD 1356 for 2 people for a shared speedboat transfer (while St. Regis charges USD 1490 for a seaplane) + USD 60 tourist tax. The payment was made via an online link sent by the hotel.

The next day the At Your Service team got in touch with me via email and noted my arrival and departure details and asked for any special needs we had during our stay. We relayed it to them that we were pure vegetarians.

When we arrived in Male we were greeted by the Ritz Carlton team just outside of the customs area and taken to a restaurant called Secret Recipe to wait about 15 minutes till the boat arrived from the resort. We were supposed to share transfers with a Russian group arriving at the same time as our flight but that flight landed early and the group left ahead of us. The Ritz Carlton does not have a lounge at the airport as most star properties do. Anything you eat or drink at the restaurant is taken care of by the Ritz Carlton. So as I ordered ice cream the boat arrived and my ice cream was taken away and served to me on the boat.

We ended up having the boat to ourselves (both ways). A nice clean air-conditioned boat with a washroom and refreshments (granola bars fruits champagne soft drinks tea/coffee on offer). It took us about 45 minutes to get to the resort. The shared boat service is run by the Fari Marina village staff and shared between the Ritz Carlton Patina and Capealla resorts (under construction).

Once at the resort we were greeted by the wonderful staff and our Aris Meeha (butler) was waiting for us with a buggy at the jetty. We were given a property tour and taken to our seaside sunrise overwater villa. All 1-bedroom villas are the same at the property. Only the location of the room determines the price.

The resort is spread across 1.2 kilometres end-to-end across 3 islands where the 2 flanking islands have rooms with a central small island where the restaurants and the pool are located.

They have a recreation centre with gym steam sauna and tennis court and a recreation room with a PS5 where I lost a couple of football matches against a member of the staff whom I requested to play with. The resort also has a huge kids’ area but we didn’t go there.

Within the resort you can either walk or take the bicycles provided with each room or call your butler to be transported by buggy anywhere around the island.

High tea was complimentary for all Marriott Bonvoy members from 4-5 pm resort time and Gold and above members also had cocktail hours from 5-6 pm at the Eau bar. The In-room Minibar is complimentary (non-alcoholic beverages+ snacks) and refilled once a day during turndown service in the evening.

Dining

The Ritz Carlton Maldives has 5 dining options:

La Locanda is an Italian restaurant as well as an all-day cafe where breakfast is also served

Beach Shack which is only open for lunch and serves multiple cuisines

Arabesque which is the Lebanese and Indian restaurant which is located on a separate village attached to the Patina property (A 10-minute boat ride frequency every hour)

Iwau the Japanese teppanyaki restaurant

Summer Pavilion the Cantonese inspired restaurant

Eau bar (poolside bar)

We ate at all the restaurants and they did have a few vegetarian options to order from. We were introduced to an Indian chef at La Locanda who took care of our breakfast and dinner needs. We used to pre-order Indian breakfast (dosasvadas parantha etc. the previous night) apart from the widespread buffet options available.

All in all we spent most of our time between the room and the beach and doing a couple of activities like a dolphin cruise and a photoshoot. Spa according to another Indian family we met was great but we didn’t take spa treatments.

On our anniversary day the hotel arranged for us a wonderful cake along with a bubble bath setup.

We had all our meals as a-la-carte as none are included in points bookings though the resort did offer half board at USD 265 + taxes per night per person.

The staff and service were really good. The hotel is into nature conservation so my wife wasn’t allowed to feed the fish as she did on our previous trip to the Maldives. Understandable as they don’t want to change their behaviour and make them used to be fed by humans.

Bottomline

All in all it was a fun-filled trip that just cost us a bit over 4.15 lakh rupees

USD 1250 for 100000 points bought

USD 1356 for transport

INR 35000 air tickets (Vistara premium economy was 15% discounted via American Express and return was on Air India partly paid with HDFC Bank Infinia points and the rest in cash)

USD 2100 in food and activities (out of which USD 1350 was for food)

If converted to Indian rupees at INR 78 (that’s the final exchange rate I paid for $1250 for buying points) the value per American Express point/Marriott Bonvoy points is just north of INR 4. That is a massive redemption value.

(Editors Note: The Ritz Carlton Maldives will head to dynamic pricing effective March 29 2022.

Companies have had to make billion-dollar decisions in recent days that would normally take weeks pulling entire operations out of Russia and closing plants and factories in protest.

While this crisis might seem ethically clear cut the next one may be less so. So what lessons can companies draw from this? BRINK spoke to Jason Miklian and John Katsos who have written about doing business in these conditions for Harvard Business Review.

BRINK: What is different about this crisis versus previous political and ethical dilemmas that big companies have had to face?

MIKLIAN: The main difference is the speed of this crisis and the speed in which business has reacted to it. This is something that is almost completely unprecedented and it speaks to several converging factors.

First of all many of these firms working in Russia clearly saw the need to have a risk mitigation strategy before this happened. That meant they could implement their policies very quickly instead of having to think about them in the moment of crisis.

But also shareholders and employees are forcing firms to take a more vocal and more substantial moral stand very quickly. This has been really encouraging to see.

A Fundamental Pivot in CSR

BRINK: Do you think this is going to change the way in which companies make their future calculations about political and ethical dilemmas?

MIKLIAN: It’s a good question. Of course it will vary tremendously from company to company from sector to sector. But I would argue that we do have one of those rare moments where there is a sliver of opportunity for companies to really think and perhaps even fundamentally change the way that they approach these sorts of issues.

I think it could very well set a precedent for the next time political actors elsewhere in the world undertake an activity that is considered to be politically or morally unethical.

KATSOS: This crisis has given an outer boundary as to what is acceptable behavior from government partners. Now the question is “How far can countries go in pushing particular political agendas without having this kind of economic blowback?” and will companies be comfortable with maintaining their presence in countries when governments do things that are widely perceived as problematic?

Companies’ Relationships With Government Entities Could Change

BRINK: Do you think it’s going to change the way companies look at China for example?

KATSOS: What we’re hearing from companies with public shareholders is that they’re getting a lot of pressure from their biggest shareholders to either withdraw from similar problematic environments or to re-evaluate their relationships with government-controlled or government-owned entities.

I think what will happen outside of Russia is that other countries will be much more mindful of the relationship between their governments and the foreign private companies that are coming in as investment or operational partners.

I think now that they’ve expressed themselves for this issue we might see shareholders especially the biggest ones being much more aggressive in their statements about what they expect from companies.

Chinese companies and other non-Russian companies that have a lot of government presence are also seeing what’s happening and are understanding that they’re going to have to make some amendments on their side as well to make sure that this sort of reaction doesn’t happen to them.

Is There a First-Mover Advantage?

MIKLIAN: As we said the speed in which firms didn’t just pause operations but even withdrew completely has been remarkable. Now the cynic in me could say well this was just them waiting for the right opportunity to do something they’d wanted to do for a while but were worried about the blowback of doing it without this situation.

But at the same time firms that moved quickly have earned reputational rewards for leaving coupled with the fear of not wanting to be the last one there and have all of the international community all of the ESG people all of the stakeholders all of the shareholders piling upon them as the last one standing.

KATSOS: In the past shareholders would keep quiet so long as profitability and dividends were continuing. What’s interesting is how aggressive some shareholders have been in expressing their displeasure in this particular instance.

I think that’s one thing that won’t change. I think now that they’ve expressed themselves for this issue we might see shareholders especially the biggest ones being much more aggressive in their statements about what they expect from companies.

Re-Entry Is Going to Be Difficult to Manage

BRINK: If this crisis goes on for a long time how does a company decide when it’s okay to go back in?

KATSOS: With re-entry the key is to think really hard — before you’ve decided to withdraw — about what needs to change on the ground on the issues that made you withdraw in the first place. Have they gone away? Do they need to go away or do the underlying causes need to be alleviated before re-entry?

In terms of going back into Russia are we talking about the prerequisite of a withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine? Or a peace agreement with Ukraine? Or the government no longer being in place?

Most of the companies when they withdrew made statements that reflected that their withdrawal was not just about sanctions but also about the underlying political conditions. That will make the barrier for them to re-enter higher.

MIKLIAN: I would just add to that that very often one of the biggest challenges when firms return after a conflict is in making smart decisions about who they partner with and who they work with to get back in.

If they just end up partnering with the same sorts of powerful oligarchs or elites it runs the risk of this whole cycle repeating five years 10 years down the line.

It’s really really hard for firms because those are the people who can get you access into the country so it’s tremendously attractive to work with those sorts of people and tell yourself that you are helping them become actors for good. But as we’ve seen in Myanmar or in many other cases sometimes that just emboldens those elite actors to be the worst versions of themselves and creates a whole host of new problems down the line.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9ob3VzdG9uY2hyb25pY2xlL25hbWUvZGF2aWQtbWFydGluLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMzNjYyNTI00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David Martin Obituary (1954 - 2022) - Houston TX - Houston Chronicle,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/houstonchronicle/name/david-martin-obituary?id=33662524 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9ob3VzdG9uY2hyb25pY2xlL25hbWUvZGF2aWQtbWFydGluLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMzNjYyNTI00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Trevor Story has reached an agreement with the Boston #Redsox — Bob Nightengale (@BNightengale) March 20 2022

Story 29 is an annual 20/20 threat and appears slated to take over the second base role for Boston. This would give him 2B/SS eligibility (eventually) and solidifies his top 5 draft position among shortstops. Given the recent injury to Fernando Tatis Jr. you can argue that Story is fourth among his peers trailing only Trea Turner Bo Bichette and Tim Anderson. And there’s probably room for debate against Anderson who hasn’t proven as sturdy as Story and who won’t carry 2B/SS eligibility. I can justify Story as early as Round 2 given that he’ll now call the AL East home and enjoy plenty of hitter-friendly parks.

Aligning with the Government’s plans to drive Vietnam towards a cashless society Petrolimex has officially operated the non-cash payment project entitled “Smart payment – countless benefits” nation-wide accompanied by a big promotion programme for customers since November 19 2021.

Petrolimex’s petrol stations accept all advanced payment methods namely: (1) VISA and MasterCard credit cards; (2) Domestic ATM cards branded by Napas; (3) Scanning VNPAY-QR code. In partnership with Ho Chi Minh City Deveopment Joint Stock Commercial Bank (HDBank) the project applies latest payment technologies to ensure rapid user-friendly and safe authentication and accumulation of bonus points.

Besides Petrolimex develops a loyalty programme through Petrolimex ID. Each Petrolimex ID account after being validated for the first time and making a purchase at any Petrolimex petrol station will receive 01 bonus code to participate in the lottery programme running from November 11 2021 until March 31 2022.

Soon after the “Smart payment – Countless benefits” project was launched reports from some petrol stations in key localities show that customers are quite satisfactory with cashless payment downloaded Petrolimex app and registered for Petrolimex ID to enjoy added services as well as the Group’s promotion programme.

Nguyen Cong Khanh at Petrolimex Saigon’s petrol station No 1

As a loyal customer at Petrolimex Saigon’s petrol station No 1 Nguyen Cong Khanh (a resident in HCM City’s District 1) said: “When introduced on the non-cash payment and point accumulation programme I felt so excited. Just a few steps after I downloaded the Petrolimex app I was validated as a loyal customer of Petrolimex. Without any cash in pocket I can buy oil and petrol in a quick easy and accurate manner whilst checking the accuracy of the transaction through Petrolimex app. Petrolimex’s cashless payment service helps save our time and ensures safety especially in the complex developments of the COVID-19 as present. Becoming a loyal customer I have received practical incentives such as partaking in the lucky draw and accumulating bonus points for each purchase and I can use those points for following purchases of oil and petrol.”

Introduced to the service by staff at Petrolimex Hanoi’s petrol station No 80 Pham Quang Hoa – Huong Viet Sinh Company Limited (Gia Lam District - Ha Noi) said: “Aware of Petrolimex’s loyalty programme designed for organisations I registered a Petrolimex ID for our Company to enjoy the accumulation of bonus points from each purchase for the following transactions. The Petrolimex app enables our company’s leaders to manage in detail the quantity of goods daily petrol costs without performing manual comparison. The company can easily manage the data anywhere anytime as details of each purchase is available on the app. I expect that Petrolimex will continue upgrading the app and optimise the app’s utilities to bring best experiences for customers.”

Eager to register a Petrolimex ID and download Petrolimex app Dang Tuyet Nhung (Hung Yen City) said she was pretty pleased with the “finding your nearest petrol station” function on the Petrolimex app. Nhung said due to her work she had to travel to various places by her own car. She used to concern most about looking for a Petrolimex filling station when the car ran out of fuel. “I’m no longer worried about that. Simply opening the Petrolimex app I can immediately find the nearest Petrolimex filling station on the route that I’m travelling” Nhung said.



Workers at Petrolimex Tien Giang’s Petrol Station No 29 supply fuel for customers using the non-cash payment service

The numbers tell it all about cusomters’ acceptance. Within a short period of time since the project was officially launched more than 100000 Petrolimex IDs have been registered; including 83000 downloads of Petrolimex app on App Store and Google Play. Nearly 100 million transactions have been made with value increase day after day; in which payment via Napas ATM cards accounts for 55 per cent; via Visa and MasterCard credit cards 39 per cent; and via VNPAY-QR code 6 per cent.

Till now despite the continously complicated developments of the COVID-19 pandemic Petrolimex and HDBank have jointly installed 5085 POS machines at 2523 petrol stations of the whole Petrolimex systtem in 62 out of 63 cities and provinces across the country.

Petrolimex Deputy Director General – Head of the Cashless Payment Project Luu Van Tuyen said: “The official application of non-cash payment solutions in the system of Petrolimex petrol stations is part of the strategy to develop the Group into a leading enterprise in digital transition and based on smart secure technologies to optimise service quality to further reinforce customers’ trust and satisfaction; and concurrently to accelerate the digitisation process at Petrolimex.”

The Deputy Director General said the Group was also speeding up studies to seek for cooperation with certain partners including Be Group and expand the payment channels within the VNPay alliance (including Momo e-wallet) Vinaphone’s Mobile Money service and via bank cards co-branded with HDBank.

“Petrolimex will continue investment and research activities to incorporate online sales services with the cashless payment service on the Petrolimex app to bring about optimal utilities for customers” Tuyen said.

It’s estimated that at the very moment the project has gained initial successes thanks to the cooperation of partners and member companies and particularly the acceptance of customers. Petrolimex believes that non-cash payment will be an inevitable trend and an essential part of Petrolimex’s digital transition.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZ3VhcmRpYW4ubmcvc2F0dXJkYXktbWFnYXppbmUva2FmYXdhLXRyYWlucy15b3VuZy1uaWdlcmlhbnMtaW4tbGVhdGhlci1tYWtpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kafawa trains young Nigerians in leather making,"To drive the growth of the leather sector the Kafawa Training Programme a partnership between My World of Bags a bag design and corporate accessories brand and the Mastercard Foundation has formally graduated its first set of trained leather industry artisans entrepreneurs craftsmen and craftswomen.

The programme aimed to train young Nigerians in leather and non-leather manufacturing work was launched in October 2021.

It was learnt that the vision of the programme that has enrolled over 400 young women and men through in-person and virtual sessions is to change the narrative around production tailoring and manufacturing jobs with most of the graduates starting their own businesses or joining the workforce.

At the graduation ceremony the Creative Director FemiHandbags Femi Olayebi said: “Through initiatives like this the brand has sought out ways to level the playing field and improve access for Nigerian Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) operating in the leather space. The goal for Kafawa is to drive the growth of the leather sector and improve youth unemployment rates.

“We are encouraged by the enormous potential that exists across Nigeria’s youth group and we are excited to be creating channels that will tap into that potential. Through Kafawa hundreds of young dreamers have started defining their goals and taking control of their future.”

The MSME Finance Lead for Mastercard Foundation Chioma Nwagboso said: “In Nigeria Mastercard Foundation’s Young Africa Works strategy seeks to enable access to dignified work for 10 million youth by 2030 – with a 70 per cent focus on women – across the agricultural and adjacent sector the creative industry and through digital interventions. So we are confident that the Kafawa graduates will use their newly-acquired technical and soft skills to reach their full potential.”",,,
MTCH,Match Group,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAzLzE5L2NvdWxkLWJ1bWJsZS1iZWNvbWUtdGhlLW5leHQtbWF0Y2gtZ3JvdXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Could Bumble Become the Next Match Group?,"The female-oriented dating company is likely using a different playbook.

Bumble (BMBL 3.35%) and Match Group (MTCH 0.97%) can be considered the David and Goliath respectively of the online dating market. Bumble owns just three apps (Bumble Badoo and Fruitz) while Match owns Tinder and over a dozen others.

The two companies have a complicated relationship. Bumble's founder Whitney Wolfe Herd was previously a co-founder at Tinder before being stripped of the title following an acrimonious split with the company. Match and Bumble subsequently sued each other for years over patent infringement allegations before finally settling all of those claims in 2020.

Today Bumble's eponymous female-oriented app is Tinder's closest competitor in the U.S. Between 2017 and 2020 Bumble's share of the U.S. dating app market nearly doubled from 10% to 19% according to Sensor Tower as Tinder's share dipped from 43% to 40%. Badoo an older app that's more popular in Europe and Latin America is still the second most downloaded dating app in the world behind Tinder.

Yet Bumble is still a lot smaller than Match. Its $5.3 billion market cap is less than a fifth of Match's at almost $30 billion. So could this underdog of the dating industry eventually catch up to its larger rival?

Bumble would need to grow a lot faster

Bumble is the faster growing company but only by a small margin. Its revenue rose 32% to $766 million in 2021 and management is guiding for 23% growth (at the midpoint) this year. Match grew revenue 25% to $2.98 billion in 2021 with about 18% growth expected for 2022.

As for users Bumble reported 2.9 million of them up 16% last year with the total consisting of 1.5 million Bumble users (up 31%) and 1.4 million Badoo users (up 2%). It will also add Fruitz a smaller Gen-Z-oriented European app to its ""Badoo and others"" segment later this year.

Match ended 2021 with 16.2 million paying users up 15% as Tinder led the pack with paying users increasing 18% to 10.6 million.

Based on revenue and user metrics Bumble needs to grow a lot faster if it wants to catch up to Match in the online dating market. The most straightforward approach would be to acquire more dating apps to expand its geographic reach and carve out more niche categories for itself.

But will Bumble replicate Match's growth strategy?

However it's unclear if Bumble actually wants to follow in Match's footsteps as the latter has added apps like Hinge Chispa and BLK to its portfolio.

Buying or launching more apps could dilute Bumble's brand which is tightly tethered to its namesake offering and female-first approach. Bumble has been heavily promoting its brand with a restaurant in New York City and an online apparel store so it seems much more interested in expanding its core app instead of adding smaller ones to its portfolio.

Bumble's other apps also seem secondary to its main service. Bumble only inherited Badoo from Wolfe Herd's initial partnership with the Russian entrepreneur Andrey Andreev and its recent acquisition of Fruitz mainly seems aimed at offsetting Badoo's decline in Europe.

The Bumble app generated more than twice as much average revenue per paying user (ARPPU) than Badoo in the fourth quarter. On its own Bumble generated an ARPPU of $30.57 but including Badoo that figure fell to $22.83. Therefore it could be counterproductive for Bumble to further reduce that metric by buying other low-ARPPU apps.

Match which blends together higher-value and lower-value services generated just $16.16 in its comparable revenue per payer (RPP) in its latest quarter. Therefore Bumble might have acquired Fruitz to reach more Gen Z users but that doesn't indicate it will go on a shopping spree like Match -- especially when it still has more debt than cash on its balance sheet.

Different plans for the future

Bumble probably won't expand and evolve into the next Match. Instead it will focus on improving its namesake app expanding the platform with non-dating features like Bumble Bizz for business connections and Bumble BFF for platonic friendships making its brand synonymous with female-friendly dating and social-networking services.

That long-term strategy would arguably be much smarter than battling it out with Match in frequent bidding wars over new apps. Focusing on Bumble's main app could gradually boost its ARPPU and enable it to generate sustainable growth without spinning too many plates at once.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWNvZXIuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMjAvYS1kaXZlLWJhY2staW4tdGltZS13aXRoLWRpYW1vbmQtbWF0Y2gtY29tcGFueS_SAVZodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaGljb2VyLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAzLzIwL2EtZGl2ZS1iYWNrLWluLXRpbWUtd2l0aC1kaWFtb25kLW1hdGNoLWNvbXBhbnkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A dive back in time with Diamond Match Company,"CHICO — Today the land where the Diamond Match factory once stood is mostly empty with overgrown rubble amidst Chico’s farms and the Barber Neighborhood; the only remaining buildings are its engineering department and a small storage facility.

But before its demise in 1975 retired Chico State Chemistry Professor Don Alger said it was once the center of a thriving community with its own work-life culture.

Alger along with co-writer Ray Rolls gave a presentation Saturday morning at the Chico History Museum about the history and legacy of the Diamond Match Company’s facility in Chico and its effect on social life in the area.

“They had a huge impact on Chico activities which were primarily oriented towards employees but it spilled out into the community” Alger said. “As an example they had employee dances but the community was invited.”

Alger said the company had major economic influence as the primary industry in the area processing lumber products and employed hundreds of people at a time but also influenced the social life in the community around it.

The company held city-wide dances; built a tennis court and a baseball field; pushed for more housing in the area of Chico now known as the Barber Neighborhood; had a symphonic band and endorsed other activities.

“They provided the swimming pool which wasn’t very successful because they got their water out of the ground and it was a little chilly” Algiers said. “And I think it was described as ‘cold as hell’”

As Alger explained the chronology of the Diamond Match Factory’s operation in Chico local residents looked at photos of the coming and going of the company’s many facilities including the match factory engineering department machine shop foundry box factory door factory lumber facility multiple offices and even the apiary which once was a top producer of honey in the United States.

“I didn’t realize the apiary was as prominent as it was” said visitor Chuck Priddy whose parents both worked at the factory. “My dad started in the box factory and cut a thumb off and there wasn’t any disability at the time. So they bandaged it up and he went to go work for the match factory painting blocks.”

Priddy said he would join his parents in the 1930s and 1940s to go to their employee barbecues and spend time doing company-provided activities.

“They had a big rec building — must have been 8000 square feet — right on the property where they had pool tables and games and stuff and they had parties there with families” Priddy said. “It was really family-oriented at that time.”

Visitor David Welch said the social history of the Diamond Match Factory and how it affects the development of the community still has room to explore.

“The sheer size of that development and how big it was a big thing in a small town. I think that part is really interesting” Welch said.

At the presentation Saturday Chico Historian David Nopel brought out two boxes the museum received the day before to show the audience.

On the side of the box spelled out W. B. Dean the lumber and building material department manager for Diamond Match Company.

“These boxes are going to offer a wonderful opportunity to expand that Diamond story a touch” Nopel said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vZ29sZi9uZXdzL2Zvcm1hdC1maWVsZC1ob3ctd2djLWRlbGwtdGVjaG5vbG9naWVzLW1hdGNoLXBsYXktd29ya3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,From format to field how the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play works,"The WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play Championship begins Wednesday at Austin Country Club. The early-week start isn’t the only difference for this PGA Tour stop. Here’s how the tournament works:

Field size: Sixty-four players comprise the field based off the Official World Golf Ranking as of March 13. If any player decides not to compete he is replaced in order of the ranking at the cut-off date.

Format: The 64 players are divided into 16 groups of four (click here for this year’s groups). Each player will compete in match play against the other three players within his group over the first three days. A match victory is worth one point. A tied match is worth a half-point. A loss is worth zero points.

The player with the most points in his group after three days of round-robin play will advance to the knockout stage (click here for the full bracket).

If two or more players are tied in their group after the three pool-play matches then those players will compete in a stroke-play sudden-death playoff to determine who advances.

Sixteen players will qualify for the single-elimination portion. Here’s how the week’s schedule plays out:

Wednesday: Group play

Thursday: Group play

Friday: Group play

Saturday: Round of 16 (morning); quarterfinals (afternoon)

Sunday: Semifinals (morning); finals and third-place match (afternoon)

What is match play? Instead of players competing against par like in stroke play they compete against each other in one-on-one matches. If a player scores lower on a hole than his opponent he wins the hole. Once a player is leading by more holes than there are to play then he is declared the winner.

Holes can be tied and so too can be matches – in pool play. Over the first three days matches conclude after 18 holes even if tied (half-points are awarded). Once the knockout stage begins a winner must be declared so players will compete in sudden death if tied after 18 holes.

How are the groups determined? The top 16 committed players based on the OWGR head each group. That is the “A” player. Each group also has a “B” player a randomly drawn player among the next 16 committed players in the rankings; a “C” player from the next 16 committed players in the rankings; and a “D” player from the final 16 committed players in the rankings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwb3J0c3Rlci5jb20vd3Jlc3RsZW1hbmlhLXRhZy10ZWFtLXRpdGxlLW1hdGNoZXMtcmFua2VkLWZyb20td29yc3QtdG8tYmVzdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The First 10 WrestleMania Tag Team Title Matches Ranked From Worst To Best,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwb3J0c3Rlci5jb20vd3Jlc3RsZW1hbmlhLXRhZy10ZWFtLXRpdGxlLW1hdGNoZXMtcmFua2VkLWZyb20td29yc3QtdG8tYmVzdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZm9iYWUuY29tL2VuLzIwMjIvMDMvMjAvdGhlLW1vc3QtdW51c3VhbC1tYXRjaC1pbi1mb290YmFsbC1oaXN0b3J5LWJhcmJhZG9zLWdyZW5hZGEtYW5kLXRoZS0xOTk0LWNhcmliYmVhbi1jdXAv0gGRAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZm9iYWUuY29tL2VuLzIwMjIvMDMvMjAvdGhlLW1vc3QtdW51c3VhbC1tYXRjaC1pbi1mb290YmFsbC1oaXN0b3J5LWJhcmJhZG9zLWdyZW5hZGEtYW5kLXRoZS0xOTk0LWNhcmliYmVhbi1jdXAvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1wLXR5cGU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The most unusual match in football history: Barbados - Grenada and the 1994 Caribbean Cup,"Sometimes football has unusual things like that divine hand of Diego Maradona in the middle of the Azteca Stadium that unlocked a difficult match and gave Argentina the move to the semifinal of the 1986 World Cup which he would eventually win.

But if that “hand of God” was immortalized among the most iconic plays in the history of the king sport a match much more earthly than that Argentina-England it could perhaps win the title of the most unusual in history even if the memory was not as benevolent to it as with Maradona's blessed punch.

We are referring to Barbados-Granada played in the final stage of the group stage of the Caribbean Cup in 1994 a very strange match whose result was motivated by a rule that has not since been implemented in the tournament: the double gold goal.

What was so strange about it? Well I don't know if I've ever heard of a team defending the opponent's goal to prevent it from scoring a goal against it.

But before we go into history let's first have some context.

The Caribbean Cup

The Caribbean Cup was a tournament organized by the Caribbean Football Union a small concacaf-affiliated body representing some 25 national teams from the Americas.

The tournament was held until 2017 when it was replaced by the Concacaf Nations League and by 1994 it was in its fifth edition.

The championship had a somewhat strange organization scheme. First there was a group stage with 16 zones of which only the first in each zone qualified for the next round. The second phase was also group but there were only two zones made up of the qualifiers of the first phase. Then the semifinal and final instances were played.

The flags of Barbados and Granada.

The winner of the tournament won a spot in the Concacaf Gold Cup which is equivalent for North and Central America to the Copa America for the nations of the south of the continent.

But even if this were the case the low level of the teams competing in the tournament and the little cultural penetration of football in these countries made the Caribbean Cup an unattractive spectacle for the public.

Therefore the organizers of the 94 edition decided to make some changes to the football regulations to make it more interesting which would end up having unusual consequences.

They first determined that no match could be tied not even those in the group stage so if equality was decreed in the regular 90 minutes an additional 30 minutes would be played. But there was an additional trick: in the elongation the golden goal rule would be implemented that is whoever scored the first goal won the match.

The rule common in several tournaments during the 1990s had another “Caribbean” adaptation for this tournament because instead of a golden goal the teams that scored in the elongation were awarded “golden goals” that is every so often they were worth twice as much. Something I've never seen before.

The Caribbean Cup awarded a spot to the Concacaf Gold Cup before being replaced in 2017 Concacaf Nations League

These strange rules had a direct effect on the standings many of them defined by the number of goals in favor of one team especially when they tied in points with another. In other words there were situations where it was 'most profitable' for the teams to tie in the 90th minute and score a double goal in the elongation.

The final match

The final group phase of the 94′ Caribbean Cup had its epicenter in Trinidad and Tobago which had recently recovered from a strong coup attempt and an intense tropical storm.

As news that year Haiti returned as a contender in the final group phase and the Montserrat team made its debut. In addition the selections of the Netherlands Antilles Aruba Saint Lucia Cuba and Jamaica were absent.

These “big absences” added to the overall low level of the tournament whose attention was focused on the definition of Group A in which Puerto Rico Granada and Barbados were.

The final match which would define the passage to the next round of only one of the three teams would be played between Granada which was tied three points with Puerto Rico and Barbados who had 0 points.

To pass the round Barbados had to win to draw in points and score at least two goals to beat them in the tiebreaker.

With this scenario the ball rolled in the National State of Barbados on January 27 1994.

An unusual definition

As expected the match began with the locals thrown with everything to look for the two goals that would give it the final phase of the tournament in Trinidad and Tobago.

With 10 minutes left until the end of the match the “Pride de Bajan” was getting the epic it won 2-0 against Granada and had the classification in the stock market. But in the 83′ minute of the game the visitors discounted 2-1 result enough to qualify despite the defeat.

The Barbados players could not believe it the victory escapes them at all in the end and no matter how much they tried to score another goal time was playing against them. On the other side of the court Granada fans celebrated the qualification.

But the celebrations ended soon because Barbarean technical director Kevin Millard had an unusual but very intelligent idea. Playing by the particular rules of the tournament he ordered his players to score at their own door. Yeah as incredible as it sounds he sent them to score an own-goal.

Remember that the matches could not be tied there had to be a winner so the own-goal sent them directly to overtime and thanks to the double golden goal rule Barbados would only have to score one more goal in the elongation to be victorious.

A risky strategy but which in principle bought the game another 30 minutes of play a better alternative to being eliminated when normal time was already dying.

So defender Terry Sealey sneakily approached his area passing the ball short and at the foot of his goalkeeper until he finally kicked to score in his own goal. Match score 2 to 2 and there were three minutes left to finish the game.

Those last few minutes were crazy. Because the Granada team desperately sought to score... Where was it!

If they scored in the Barbados goal they would qualify by winning the match and adding 6 points in the group overall but if they scored in their own goal they also qualified because although they lost the match the goal difference still favored them.

This is how madness broke out with the Barbados team split in two half team defending their goal and the other half in the Granada goal to prevent the Grenadians from scoring an own goal.

The madness broke out when the Barbados players split up to defend the two arches and prevent Granada from scoring in any of the goals.

The slogan was clear: Granda couldn't score a goal no matter what goal he tried to do it in.

What was observed in this match stunned the fans and the referee himself because they could not believe that something like this was happening. The craziest thing of all was that the strategy worked the match was tied and in the extension Trevor Thorne scored the golden goal that being worth double gave the long-awaited qualification to the Barbados national team.

Group A was like this: Barbados 3 points+1 goal difference; Granada 3 points and 0 goal difference; and Puerto Rico 3 points -1 goal difference.

For posterity the statements of the coach of Granada James Clarkson were left after the match: “I feel like I was cheated. The person who invented these rules is a candidate for an asylum. Our players didn't know where to attack. I've never seen anything like that. In football you have to score goals against your opponent to win not against.”

This story also has a fundamental difference with that Maradonian hand of God and that is that what could be described as 'divine justice' operated here since Barbados was eliminated in the first match of the next phase while Argentina not only won that match against England but would win the world cup.

Maybe Barbados was just lucky and wasn't as blessed as Diego in the 86 World Cup. In any case the unusual match they played served to ensure that the crazy rule of the double golden goal was never used again.

Graeme McCormick who stood to become SNP president in 2023 earlier claimed he could gather the 100 signatures needed from 20 different party branches to mount a challenge for the leadership.

However McCormick’s decision not to pursue a leadership bid leaves Swinney the former deputy first minister of Scotland as the only official candidate after Humza Yousaf announced he is stepping down. The deadline for nominations is noon on Monday.

McCormick said he reached the nomination threshold of 100 signatures but chose to back Swinney after a “lengthy and fruitful conversation” and said this could be a “fresh start”.

In a statement on Sunday night he said: “John and I agreed the challenges which the SNP our government and our people face and explored new thinking on a range of issues which I am confident as they are advanced will inspire activists both within the SNP and wider independence movement in the following weeks and months.

“This is a fresh start for our members and our politicians and I’m sure that John’s determination to deliver independence will be rewarded at the forthcoming general election.

“I have therefore concluded that I shall not proceed with my nomination for party leader but instead support John Swinney’s nomination for party leader and first minister of Scotland.”

McCormick’s supporters had argued it would have been undemocratic for the party’s leader to win an unopposed coronation and insist that Swinney ought to face a contest. He won applause from hardliners when he denounced the SNP’s caution over mounting a second independence referendum without Westminster’s approval as “flatulence in a trance” during last year’s party conference.

One of McCormick’s backers Iain Lawson earlier attacked Swinney for criticising the planned challenge and in another post accused Swinney of being entitled and “raging” that an ordinary member was going up against him.

Swinney who described himself as the candidate to unite the party after a “difficult” few years said an election contest would delay the SNP’s essential rebuild. But he signalled he would win any potential contest telling Sky News that party members “probably know the outcome” between the two potential candidates.

His call for SNP members to realise the urgency of the need to restore public confidence in the party was underlined by a poll by Norstat for Sunday Times Scotland which said support for the party in a Westminster election had slumped to 29%.

The poll the first to be carried out since Yousaf suddenly quit last week put Labour on 34% and the Scottish Conservatives on 16%. Those figures suggest the SNP could lose 28 Westminster seats a fall from 43 MPs at present to 15. Labour which has only two Scottish seats would win 28.

Once Swinney is named the next SNP leader he will have to win a subsequent vote in Holyrood later in the week to become Scotland’s first minister.

It means the party will avoid a three-week leadership contest which would have been triggered had Mr McCormick not stepped aside and received the required 100 nominations.

Assuming there are no last-minute challengers the leadership bid will not have to be put to SNP members and Mr Swinney is likely to become Scotland's next first minister as early as Tuesday.

Barring a bombshell - Swinney will become leader today Connor Gillies Scotland correspondent @ConnorGillies The SNP establishment is quietly breathing a sigh of relief after a wildcard challenger pulled the plug. Grassroots member Graeme McCormick has been a thorn in the side of the party hierarchy for a long time but the truth is he never stood a chance of becoming leader. Apparently he was gathering the required 100 signatures from party members on his clipboard at an independence rally in Glasgow on Saturday. It doesn't get more grassroots than that. His move to trigger a contest would have delayed the inevitable Swinney win but it would have forced the party to spend three weeks having another internal debate. It would have been difficult (and embarrassing) for Mr Swinney and co as they try and pull a divided party back together. Mr McCormick told Sky News he had a discussion with Mr Swinney on Sunday and it seems the pair came to some sort of agreement. Many will see this as a small diplomatic win for the incoming first minister as he uses soft power to spare the SNP’s blushes. Barring a bombshell Mr Swinney will become leader tomorrow and first minister of Scotland on Tuesday as Humza Yousaf packs his bags and heads for the same door he kicked the Greens out of a few weeks ago.

Who is John Swinney?

What direction will the SNP take?

Earlier on Sunday Mr Swinney warned potential challengers from entering the race saying it would delay the party from ""rebuilding"".

""My bid to become SNP leader has received very very comprehensive support within the SNP. I have sent out a message which is about unifying the SNP to strengthen our party and win Scottish independence"" he told Sky's Trevor Phillips.

""I think that is necessary as the SNP is not as cohesive today as the party needs to be and my campaign has attracted very wide support.

""So I think the SNP has got a chance to start rebuilding from the difficult period that we've had under my leadership and bluntly I would just like to get on with that as quickly as I can do because every day that we spend in an internal contest which I think we all probably know the outcome of we delay the ability for the SNP to start its rebuilding and I want to get on with that as quickly as I possibly can do.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWhpbmR0aGVzdGVlbGN1cnRhaW4uY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gtc3RlZWxlcnMtcm9zdGVyLzIwMjQvNS82LzI0MTQ5ODc1L2NvdWxkLXN0ZWVsZXJzLWZvdXJ0aC1yb3VuZC1pb2wtbWFzb24tbWNjb3JtaWNrLWZpbmQtaGlzLXdheS10by10aGUtc3RhcnRpbmctbGluZXVwLWluLTIwMjQtbmZs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers rookie IOL Mason McCormick could find his way to the starting lineup in 2024,"The Steelers used their first two picks in the 2024 NFL Draft toward the continued overhaul of the offensive line by selecting tackle Troy Fautanu and center Zach Frazier. Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjQvbWF5LzA1L3NucC1hY3RpdmlzdC1ncmFlbWUtbWNjb3JtaWNrLWpvaG4tc3dpbm5leS1sZWFkZXJzaGlwLWNvbnRlc3TSAXZodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vcG9saXRpY3MvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDI0L21heS8wNS9zbnAtYWN0aXZpc3QtZ3JhZW1lLW1jY29ybWljay1qb2huLXN3aW5uZXktbGVhZGVyc2hpcC1jb250ZXN0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SNP activist aims to challenge John Swinney for party leadership,"John Swinney could face a leadership contest before he becomes Scottish National party leader after an activist said he expected to win enough nominations to stand.

Graeme McCormick a well-known party activist who stood to become SNP president in 2023 claimed he would gather the 100 signatures needed from 20 different party branches to mount a challenge for the leadership.

His supporters argue it would be undemocratic for the party’s leader to win an unopposed coronation and insist that Swinney ought to face a contest. If one does take place Swinney will not be appointed as first minister until late May.

One of McCormick’s backers Iain Lawson posted on X on Sunday that he had already obtained the 100 signatures required and was planning to hand them in to the SNP “in person”.

Lawson also attacked Swinney for criticising the move and in another post accused Swinney of being entitled and “raging” that an ordinary member was challenging him.

“So Graeme McCormick has succeeded in getting the nominations he needed. Disappointed that JS [Swinney] has already had a dig at him before nominations even close for daring to challenge him. He is to give ordinary members the chance to question the new leader. New idea?”

McCormick some of whose allies want the Scottish government to mount a second independence referendum without Westminster’s approval won applause from hardliners when he denounced the SNP’s caution as “flatulence in a trance” during last year’s party conference.

Nominations to succeed Humza Yousaf as SNP leader close at noon on Monday. If another candidate crosses the nominations threshold and forces a contest Yousaf is expected to remain in post and as Scotland’s first minister until a winner is declared.

McCormick was very confident he would gather the signatures before the deadline after canvassing for support at an independence rally in Glasgow organised by All Under One Banner the Sunday Herald newspaper reported.

Swinney who has been expecting to be confirmed as the new SNP leader on Monday afternoon and be voted in as first minister this week warned on Sunday that a contest would delay his efforts to rebuild the party and put its deep divisions on public display.

“I think it would be better if we just got on with things that we started the rebuilding of the SNP and its political strength” he told BBC Scotland’s Sunday Show. “We had a lot of strains around a couple of issues in parliament and I think we’ve just had a rough couple of years.

“[The] SNP has not looked cohesive; the SNP has not looked together. The central point of my message is we’ve got to get ourselves together.”

An unopposed coronation would not be the SNP’s first: Nicola Sturgeon succeeded Alex Salmond in November 2014 without a contest.

Swinney’s call for SNP members to realise the urgency of the need to restore public confidence in the party was underlined by a poll by Norstat for Sunday Times Scotland which said support for the party in a Westminster election had slumped to 29%.

The poll the first to be carried out since Yousaf suddenly quit last week put Labour on 34% and the Scottish Conservatives on 16%. Those figures suggest the SNP could lose 28 Westminster seats a fall from 43 MPs at present to 15. Labour which has only two Scottish seats would win 28."

REUTERS/Maxim Zmeyev

Fast food chains operate largely through franchise agreements where restaurants are operated by third parties.

Franchising makes it more complicated for international companies to close Russian locations.

Contracts can only be terminated if one of the parties violates the terms an expert told Insider.

McDonald's Burger King and Papa John's are being criticized for still having some stores open in Russia but they're powerless to do anything about it.

While many western companies were able to halt business in Russia almost immediately after saying they would for others it has been more complex.

Rather than owning and operating their own stores in Russia many fast-food chains franchise out their brand to other third-party operators.

This means that they enter into a long-term agreement that permits a third party to use their brand. While they will give franchisees guidance and support to ensure the quality meets their own criteria once they enter into this agreement they won't have full control over these locations.

McDonald's was the first major US fast-food chain to pull out of Russia on March 8 and other big chains quickly followed suit. However some of the 100 franchise-operated Russian locations are still open McDonald's confirmed to Ria Novosti.

Papa John's has faced a similar problem of a franchisee that doesn't want to close. Christopher Wynne an American from Colorado owns a company that operates 190 Papa John's locations in Russia The New York Times reported.

The companies are speaking out to distance themselves from franchisees still operating in Russia.

""We at Papa Johns took swift action to cease any and all corporate operations in Russia including withdrawing any form of corporate support for the restaurants there. We do not own any assets or have any employees in Russia. We also are not deriving any income from Russia at this point. That being said we cannot unilaterally cause the independent franchisees that operate there to stop operations"" Papa John's told Insider. ""We hope for a fast arrival of a peaceful outcome. Until that happens we will not be operating in Russia as a company.""

The president of Burger King's parent company Restaurant Brands International was similarly upfront about the limitations of a franchise agreement in a letter to employees this week.

""Would we like to suspend all Burger King operations immediately in Russia? Yes. Are we able to enforce a suspension of operations today? No"" he said wrote explaining that a ""complicated legal process"" prevents it from forcing franchisees to halt business.

""There are no legal clauses that allow us to unilaterally change the contract or allow any one of the partners to simply walk away or overturn the entire agreement"" he said. ""Any current attempt to enforce our contract would ultimately require the support of Russian authorities on the ground and we know that will not practically happen anytime soon.""

Robert Lands a lawyer at Howard Kenney who focuses on intellectual property law said it's not easy for brands to duck out of these agreements.







""They can't just rip up a franchisee agreement as the franchisee hasn't done anything wrong it's the government that is the issue"" he told Insider.

Only if a franchisee is acting in a way that harms the brand then they would have a right to terminate the contract he said.

""But if they are not doing anything other than being in Russia then you don't have a right to terminate the contract so you would have to wait until it comes up for renewal and not renew it or negotiate an exit"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9tYy1kb25hbGRzLWlzLWJyaW5naW5nLWJhY2stc3plY2h1YW4tc2F1Y2Utd2hpbGUtc3VwcGxpZXMtbGFzdC0wNDAwNTU5MzguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's is bringing back Szechuan Sauce — while supplies last,"McDonald's (MCD) is bringing back its fan-favorite Szechuan Sauce.

Beginning on March 31 and for ""only a few days"" the sauce will be available for free with any Chicken McNuggets order at U.S. locations. There's a catch though the dipping sauce will only be sold via the McDonald's app.

This is the sauce's fourth return to the Golden Arches since its debut 24 years ago as a promotional tie-in to Disney's animated movie ""Mulan."" The sauce made a cult-fan comeback 20 years later in 2017 after being referenced on the hit animated science-fiction series ""Rick and Morty"" leading the show's followers to create a petition to bring the dipping sauce back.

Later that year McDonald's sent the creators of ""Rick and Morty"" a four-pound bottle of the sauce hinting that a limited batch would be available in the near future. But its Oct. 7 release backfired. Fans drove hours only to find out locations didn't have the sauce. At some spots customers took to Twitter to share videos of angry customers chanting ""We want sauce!""

There's currently a resale market for the sauce on eBay (EBAY) with prices ranging from $1 per packet to $850 dollars for 100 packets.

The newest rendition of the sauce packets features five different designs which together spell “Szechuan.”

In the company's fourth quarter and full-year 2021 results the app-driven MyMcDonald’s Rewards program helped to drive digital sales of over $18 billion in 2021 or over 25% of total sales in McDonald's top six markets.

Year-to-date shares of the Golden Arches are down nearly 11% but compared to a year ago shares are up more than 7%.

Applebee’s used to pitch itself as a place for customers to come sit and stay a while. Then the pandemic happened and Applebee’s had to pivot.

When local governments ordered restaurants to close their dining rooms they had to quickly make their food available for delivery or pickup. For some restaurants like pizzerias that wasn’t such a big deal. But for others like Applebee’s it meant a drastic change in their operations — and a huge dip in sales at least at first.

It’s also led to a seemingly permanent change in behavior. Prior to the pandemic in the last three months of 2019 Applebee’s pickup and delivery orders accounted for about 12.8% of sales. In that same period two years later even after its dining rooms re-opened its off-premise sales spiked to about 27% of all sales.

That jump meant Applebee’s suddenly had a different and significant stream of revenue –— but one that’s not necessarily as attractive as dine-in where customes can splurge on high-margin items like mixed drinks.

So Applebee’s has been getting creative with its off-premise options. It launched for example a virtual brand called Cosmic Wings during the pandemic. And last year it tried something new — its first-ever drive-thru window.

The drive-thru at Applebee’s is far less complex than one you might find at a McDonald’s (MCD) or Burger King. An Applebee’s customer shouldn’t expect an outdoor menu board or to be able to place an order with an employee. Instead they have to order ahead – online or through the restaurant’s app – and use the window just for pickup.

Applebee's first drive-thru pickup window in Texarkana Texas. Applebee's Grill + Bar

Ten years ago someone looking for a to-go meal wouldn’t even think of Applebee’s said John Cywinski the brand’s president. At the time “Applebee’s was not really part of that consideration set” Cywinski said during an investor day in March. “If you didn’t have 1.5 hours to dine-in and you were on the go … you’re probably thinking about McDonald’s Wendy’s and Burger King and maybe a burger fries and a Pepsi through a drive-thru window.”

But now he said “we are competing directly with [quick-service restaurants] and fast casual.”

That means exploring new concepts including drive-thru an idea championed by a franchise operator.

It’s early days for now: Just two restaurants have the windows one in Texarkana Texas and another in Monroe Louisiana. The company expects two more to open in West Columbia South Carolina and Colonial Heights Virginia in coming weeks. By the end of this year Cywinski expects there could be about 15 Applebee’s restaurants with drive-thru windows.

That’s still a small number considering that there are about 1600 Applebee’s restaurants overall. But it should be a big enough sample size to figure out if it makes sense to install a drive-thru window at more restaurants Cywinski said.

Though he isn’t ready to say how many Applebee’s will ultimately have drive-thru windows he has high hopes.

“We think there’s a really strong argument for it” Cywinski told CNN Business adding “we will scale it should the business case be clear. My instinct says yes there’s a genuine need.”

What does it take to build a drive-thru?

More restaurants could one day have drive-thru windows like this one in Texarkana. Applebee's Grill + Bar

It may seem relatively simple to set up these kinds of drive-thru windows. But it requires some logistical maneuvering Cywinski told CNN Business. “It’s really going to be contingent on the site and the municipality” he said.

Opening up a drive-thru window at Applebee’s means getting rid of a few spots in the restaurant parking lot to add another lane. It also requires some construction to make the window itself.

At some locations that’s no big deal.

“There’s some Applebee’s parking lots where …. it’s easy” he said. “And you’re working with a village or municipality who is fully supportive.”

But he noted “there are others where you just don’t have the space or the throughput logistics aren’t right.” Most Applebee’s locations are operated by franchisees so they also have to be on board with the changes.

Cywinski thinks that the drive-thru windows also would be helpful for delivery drivers who can pick orders up that way. And more to-go options could also help Applebee’s should customers sour on delivery.

Delivery is typically unappealing to restaurants. It’s expensive because restaurants have to pay third-party providers or hire a fleet of delivery drivers themselves. And it cuts into profits because customers are less likely to order high-margin items like alcoholic beverages when they order delivery.

Applebee’s has passed delivery costs onto customers said Cywinski. Right now delivery accounts for about 13% of Applebee’s sales.

And so far customers have largely accepted these higher prices as the cost of convenience. But with inflation soaring they could turn on delivery — and decide that to-go is better.

“The intent is just to make the experience easy for the guests” Cywinski said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc2hlZC5jb20vODA0MTQyL3doeS1mYWNlYm9vay11c2Vycy1kZWZpbml0ZWx5LWFyZW50LWxvdmluZy1tY2RvbmFsZHMtc2F1Y2UtZHJvcC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Facebook Users Definitely Aren't Loving McDonald's 'Sauce Drop',"Why Facebook Users Definitely Aren't Loving McDonald's 'Sauce Drop'

Like many fast food chains Mickey D's has certainly upset people over the years. For us the first thing that comes to mind is how the ice cream machine always seems to be out of order. When craving a McFlurry we all know there's a good chance we won't get one. Another past disappointment was the McDonald's Spam-and-Oreos burger from 2020 and it's still leaving a bad taste in our mouths.

Of course there are plenty of more serious issues we could talk about but let's keep this lighthearted shall we? McDonald's has taken to Facebook with what they must've assumed would be a clever post a teasing about a new sauce. While you might get excited at the thought of replacing your favorite dipping contender most people just aren't lovin' it.

With 2900 comments on the non-descriptive Facebook post you might think most would express some sort of hyped anticipation. As it turns out there are many who don't want a new sauce — or a new anything for that matter."

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

""We have confidence in a successful launch of Winrevair consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress"" Litchfield said.

Merck is also cutting costs under a new restructuring program it announced in February. Those efforts aim to improve the manufacturing network of both its pharmaceutical division and animal health business.

The company recorded charges of $246 million related to restructuring in the first quarter which are excluded from its adjusted results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9tZXJjay1yYWlzZXMtMjAyNC1wcm9maXQtZm9yZWNhc3Qtc3Ryb25nLWNhbmNlci1ocHYtZHJ1Z3Mtc2FsZXMtMjAyNC0wNC0yNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck raises 2024 profit forecast on surging sales of cancer drug Keytruda,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-raises-2024-profit-forecast-strong-cancer-hpv-drugs-sales-2024-04-25/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9tZXJjay1yYWlzZXMtMjAyNC1wcm9maXQtZm9yZWNhc3Qtc3Ryb25nLWNhbmNlci1ocHYtZHJ1Z3Mtc2FsZXMtMjAyNC0wNC0yNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTgvaGVhbHRoL2hwdi12YWNjaW5lLWFmcmljYS1tZXJjay5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Millions of Girls in Africa Will Miss HPV Shots After Merck Production Problem,"Nearly 1.5 million teenage girls in some of the world’s poorest countries will miss the chance to be protected from cervical cancer because the drugmaker Merck has said it will not be able to deliver millions of promised doses of the HPV vaccine this year.

Merck has notified Gavi the international organization that helps low- and middle-income countries deliver lifesaving immunizations and UNICEF which procures the vaccines that it will deliver only 18.8 million of the 29.6 million doses it was contracted to deliver in 2024 Gavi said.

That means that more than 10 million girls will not receive their expected HPV shots this year — and 1.5 million of them most likely will never get them because they will be too old to qualify for the vaccine in subsequent years.

Patrick Ryan a spokesman for Merck said the company “experienced a manufacturing disruption” that required it to hold and reinspect many doses by hand. He declined to give further details about the cause of the delay."
META,Meta Platforms,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAzLzE5L2JldHRlci1idXktbWV0YS1wbGF0Zm9ybXMtdnMtbnZpZGlhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: Meta Platforms vs. Nvidia,"Which tech giant is the better long-term investment today?

Meta Platforms (META 3.04%) and Nvidia (NVDA 3.77%) both seemed like unstoppable growth stocks in 2021. After the initial COVID lockdowns a surge in advertising growth drove Meta's stock to an all-time high of $382.18 last September. Nvidia stock peaked around the same time reaching $333.76 in November 2021 as the chipmaker dazzled investors with robust sales of gaming and data center GPUs.

February brought that growth to a grinding halt for both companies badly burning investors who had chased earlier rallies. After mixed fourth-quarter earnings and weak guidance in the year ahead due to its shifting business model Meta stock now sits near $200. Nvidia stock has similarly stumbled dipping to the mid $240s amid concerns about decelerating growth peaking gross margins and the ongoing chip shortage. Nvidia's plan to buy Arm Holdings and become a chip design powerhouse failed disappointing investors.

Should investors take the contrarian view and jump on opportunities to buy either tech stock at a steep discount? Let's take a fresh look at both companies to decide.

What happened to Meta?

Recent years have been good to Meta. While its advertising business struggled at the onset of the pandemic the company bounced back in the second half of the year with revenue rising 22% to $85.97 billion in 2020. That same year Meta expanded operating margins by four percentage points to 38% and increased earnings per share (EPS) by 57% year over year.

Meta had good fortune in 2021 too: revenue increased 37% to $117.93 billion as businesses continued ramping back up ad spending. Following 2020's trend Meta's operating margin expanded to 40% and EPS jumped 36%.

Those past numbers look fantastic but Meta anticipates a slowdown in 2022. The company expects revenue in the first quarter of 2022 to represent 3% to 11% year-over-year growth. Meta primarily blames this halt on Apple's (AAPL -0.91%) iOS privacy update which enables users to opt-out of data-tracking features. The company also anticipates increased competition from short video apps like ByteDance's TikTok.

To keep pace with TikTok Meta plans to prioritize short video content on Facebook and Instagram Reels. That shift though will throttle near-term revenue and earnings growth as videos are difficult to monetize. Meta also plans to pour more cash into its unprofitable Reality Labs division which focuses on virtual reality and the metaverse. This segment may prove promising in the future but it's currently burning money: in 2021 Reality Labs racked up an operating loss of $10.1 billion while generating just $2.27 billion in revenue.

Investors are spooked by this combination of slow growth and high spending. Meta's sliding stock price reflects analyst expectations that company revenue will grow just 12% this year while earnings slide 10%. The future though isn't all bleak: assuming Meta overcomes near-term challenges analysts expect revenue and earnings alike to rise about 17% in 2023.

What happened to Nvidia?

Pandemic trends proved a boon for Nvidia: in fiscal year 2021 (ended January 2021) revenue surged 53% to $16.68 billion. Sales of gaming GPUs jumped as people played more video games while stuck at home. Demand for cloud services increased as people worked from home streamed media and played video games causing data centers to purchase more high-end GPUs to process AI and machine learning tasks.

It's no surprise then that Nvidia's adjusted gross margin expanded from 62.5% to 65.6% over its 2021 fiscal year with its adjusted EPS soaring 73%.

The following year Nvidia's revenue continued to grow hitting $24.91 billion by the end of January. What's more adjusted gross margin rose to 66.8% and adjusted EPS grew by 78%. Again gaming and data center GPUs did most of the heavy lifting. Competitors could barely keep up: according to JPR during the fourth quarter of 2021 Nvidia controlled 81% of the discrete GPU market while its rival AMD (AMD 3.44%) held a 19% share.

Those growth rates are surely solid but analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and earnings to slow this year as the market's appetite for new gaming and data center GPUs wanes. Predictions have the company growing revenue by 29% and earnings by 26%. Looking ahead to fiscal year 2024 analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and earnings to decelerate further growing just 17% and 20% respectively as the upgrade cycle continues to cool.

Other unpredictable headwinds await on the horizon and could impact growth. Intel (INTC 0.63%) is launching new discrete GPUs to compete against Nvidia and AMD which is sure to bite into both companies' market share. The use of Nvidia's gaming GPUs to mine cryptocurrencies could pin the company's growth on the volatile crypto market. The ongoing chip shortage threatens to cap Nvidia's supply of available chips.

The valuations and verdict

Bearing this in mind which bargain stock is the better buy? Examining valuation offers insight into which company currently offers the most bang for your buck. Meta trades at just 16 times forward earnings making it the cheapest FAANG stock by a wide margin. Despite its recent dip Nvidia is still one of the priciest semiconductor stocks trading at 44 times forward earnings.

Both of these companies are solid long-term investments but I believe that Meta's discount valuation and less cyclical business model make it a more compelling investment than Nvidia. Nvidia is still growing at a healthy clip but its high valuation will hamper possible returns.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3doYXQteW91LW5lZWQtdG8ta25vdy1hYm91dC10aGUtc3RhdGUtb2YtdGhlLW1ldGF2ZXJzZS10b2RheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What you need to know about the state of the metaverse today,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://venturebeat.com/business/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-state-of-the-metaverse-today/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3doYXQteW91LW5lZWQtdG8ta25vdy1hYm91dC10aGUtc3RhdGUtb2YtdGhlLW1ldGF2ZXJzZS10b2RheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhaGVyYWxkLmNvbS92aWV3LnBocD91ZD0yMDIyMDMyMDAwMDE0M9IBOGh0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYWhlcmFsZC5jb20vYW1wL3ZpZXcucGhwP3VkPTIwMjIwMzIwMDAwMTQz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,K-pop idols bond with Gen Z and Alpha fans on metaverse platforms,"Girl group Billlie and the group members’ avatars are seen in the group’s virtual fan space (SK Telecom) Girl group Billlie and the group members’ avatars are seen in the group’s virtual fan space (SK Telecom)

An increasing number of K-pop acts have jumped into the metaverse a shared virtual world where people can interact with others via avatars creating virtual spaces to build stronger and closer connections with their fans.



Girl group Billlie met their fans on local telecommunication carrier SK Telecom’s metaverse platform ifland last week. The latest event is part of the girl group’s effort to expand its presence in a three-dimensional virtual space.



The seven-member group invites their fans to a virtual world featuring Billlie’s K-pop Guest House Land where visitors are allowed to experience various types of content from the group’s pictures and music videos to members’ statues made with holograms.



Fans can tour the metaverse space to look at Billlie’s stage costumes and observe the dance choreography as well.



Rookie girl group NMIXX also created a fandom space earlier this month on local tech giant Naver’s metaverse platform Zepeto. Fans can view the members’ costumes and accessories through their avatars.

In one of the virtual spaces closely resembling the girl group’s practice studio at its agency JYP Entertainment visitors can practice dance moves and take selfies with the members using their own avatars.



About one million users visited NMIXX’s virtual space in the first six days of its launch and created more than 600000 pieces of content on the platform according to Zepeto.



Fans can make a choreography video of NMIXX’s debut song “O.O.” They can also team up with the girl group members to form a team to complete a quest in the virtual space.



Other K-pop idols have chosen to create opportunities for fans to communicate with them in the virtual world aiming to attract Generation Z and Generation Alpha -- those born from the mid-1990s to the mid-2020s.



Another reason for opening metaverse platforms is to make up for the lack of opportunities to meet in person with fans as the COVID-19 pandemic continues into its third year.

NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported Friday that Ryan agreed to terms on a contract with the Buccaneers.

Ryan spent four seasons with Brady in New England after becoming a third-round pick in the 2013 NFL Draft — he went on to win two Super Bowls during his time in Foxborough.

In 2017 the 31-year-old defensive back signed a big-money deal in Tennessee and went on to famously intercept Brady's final pass as the Patriots quarterback NFL Network reports. He stayed with the Titans until signing with the Giants in 2020 spending the past two seasons transitioning to a safety role.

Ryan was released Thursday despite his $5.5 million in guaranteed salary in what NFL Network calls ""another failed Dave Gettleman move."" ESPN reports releasing Ryan saved the Giants a little less than $800000 against the salary cap and it's believed the release of the former team captain has more to do with the Giants being in the midst of a defensive reset rather than with cap space.

After Tampa Bay safety Jordan Whitehead — who had been a consistent hard-hitting force in the Bucs' defense since the team drafted him in 2018 — signed with the New York Jets in free agency the Bucs needed to fill the void and Ryan was able to quickly find a landing spot.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The grueling intensive process to earn that title means the prestigious nonprofit organization has served as a gatekeeper for wine’s high-flying elite class for decades.

The organization has received accolades for increasing the professionalism of wine service in high-end restaurants but it has also been criticized for its lack of diversity. Of the 172 master sommeliers in America 144 are men and 28 are women. Douglas Kim the newly appointed wine director at MGM Resorts said there are approximately 10 master sommeliers who are Asian and three of them are Korean.

Kim is one of those certified master sommeliers and at 35 has one of the most coveted careers in the hospitality industry. He oversees 350000 bottles within MGM Resorts’ collection of hundreds of restaurants and bars at 13 flagship destinations including Bellagio Aria MGM Grand Park MGM and Mandalay Bay.

He looks the part of a wine director. Dressed in a tailored suit adorned with a red master sommelier lapel pin not a single hair is out of place as he walks up to 10000 steps a day between MGM’s Strip properties.

But Kim’s path to the top of the wine world has been anything but typical.

Born in Incheon South Korea Kim immigrated to the U.S. with his family when he was 2 years old. His parents decided to immigrate in the hopes of better opportunities settling in Chicago where the family of five shared a two-bedroom apartment.

His family moved to the suburb of Lincolnwood when he was in elementary school. His parents had bought a bigger house and worked 12 hours a day operating a dry cleaning business called Lincoln Park Cleaners to provide a quality middle-class life for their children.

Kim says even though he is a master sommelier he is probably the least successful sibling because his sisters attended Ivy League schools. Kim’s oldest sister is an e-commerce director for a professional development company stemming from the work of the late self-improvement icon Dale Carnegie and his middle sister works as a high yield analyst at MFS Investment Management.

“[My sisters] have done fine for themselves but they think my job is the coolest because I get to deal with wines” Kim said.

Whether making fried rice or baking a pizza together cooking was an activity that Kim and his siblings could enjoy together when their parents were at work.

Kim said his favorite class in middle school was home economics and that he naturally gravitated towards cooking and food. After his sister participated in a two-week spring break program at the renowned Culinary Institute of America Kim was introduced to a career prospect that could fit his interests.

After enrolling at CIA Kim credits a three-week mandatory wine class for cementing his culinary focus on wine. Kim said he was inclined towards becoming a sommelier because in addition to loving wine he wanted to financially support himself. Being at the front of the restaurant rather than working in the back provided better prospects.

Becoming a master sommelier is not an overnight process. Once Kim was determined to pursue that path he had to progress through four levels of sommelier certification: introductory certified advanced and master.

A sommelier refers to a wine steward or a trained and knowledgeable wine professional. While many sommeliers reach the certified or advanced level there are few master sommeliers because of the extensive wine knowledge and advanced wine tasting skills required making the title the highest accomplishment for wine professionals and a desirable talent for the hospitality industry.

The tests take various forms and are notoriously grueling. The master sommelier test is broken down into three sections: theory service and blind tasting. Candidates are not only asked about the region and the year of wine but they are also asked about its distilling methods and ideal aperitif and food pairings. During the blind tasting portion candidates must correctly identify and describe three glasses of reds and three glasses of whites.

The master sommelier exam has a typical pass rate of around 3 to 8 percent of applicants. And in some instances as few as 1 in 70 have succeeded.

According to Kim the fastest that a person can achieve master sommelier status is six years with some taking as long as 20 years.

Kim’s 10-year journey to becoming a master sommelier began promisingly. He passed the introductory level when he was 21 passed the certified level when he was 22 and passed the advanced level when he was 24. However he said he got “caught in a loop” during the blind tasting portion of the master’s level causing him to take the final test five times.

“When I took the first master exam for the first time I was married but I didn’t have kids” Kim said. “And then I had two kids along the way and it kind of gets to be a lot. But it’s something that I always wanted to do.”

Although it was challenging at times he never wavered in the pursuit of his goals.

“I definitely was upset and angry when things didn’t go the way I wanted” Kim said. “But that’s just the process. It only made me more knowledgeable more hungry to get to the finish line.”

After he graduated from the CIA with an associate’s degree Kim moved to Las Vegas to pursue a bachelor’s degree at UNLV. He said he made the choice to move to Las Vegas because of the city’s access to restaurants and job opportunities.

After graduating from UNLV Kim’s parents helped him find a job at Restaurant Charlie owned by the late cutting-edge restaurateur and celebrity chef Charlie Trotter. His parents’ dry cleaning business was down the street from Trotter’s restaurant in Chicago so they cleaned the chef’s coats regularly.

“My mom called [Chef Trotter] and said ‘Hey give my son a job’ and he called me I came in for an interview and then started working there” Kim said.

After working at Restaurant Charlie Kim quickly rose among the ranks including working as the sommelier at Mandalay Bay’s Aureole and as the wine director at Bellagio’s two Michelin-starred Picasso Restaurant.

At his current job Kim is more focused on the back end of operations — coordinating with wine suppliers while creating and maintaining wine programs for all MGM resorts and hotels. He works with close to 50 sommeliers in different restaurants to understand their needs and to curate wine lists specific to a restaurant’s identity.

“On the front end it seems very glamorous but there’s a lot of work that goes into the job” Kim said.

He regularly checks inventory transfers pricing and deals with supply chain issues in addition to staying on top of each of the properties’ demands and understanding their needs.

Kim said the availability of domestic and imported wine selections drastically changed during the pandemic. And environmental factors such as the 2020 Napa fires or frost damage on vines in France also decreased production levels for certain wines. He said there were also shortages in glassware stoppers and boxes for shipping which made it more difficult to source wines.

His vision is to cultivate a macro wine program that can be micro-focused to each restaurant’s needs and personalized to guests’ individual preferences.

“At the end of the day it is wine and it is a luxury to be in this position and to be in this industry” Kim said.

In his personal life Kim actively participates in exams and courses offered through the Court of Master Sommeliers Americas domestically and in South Korea — where he is hoping to expand both the market for wine and grow education opportunities.

“In South Korea the barrier to wine is very high” Kim said. “It’s very expensive over there because of taxes. But we are seeing more and more people enjoying them.”

He said as more people enjoy Western cuisine South Koreans are taking an interest in wine to pair with their food. He is planning to revisit Seoul in June to teach classes in partnership with a company called Wine Vision.

For those who are looking to learn about wine Kim recommended trying different kinds as much as possible and attempting to understand how to talk about wine. He said asking questions such as “Why do I like this particular wine more than others?” is a good first step.

“As you develop your palate you will say ‘Oh I like this about wine’ and then you can communicate to the sommelier at the restaurant” Kim said. “You might say ‘Hey I like wines that have strong tannins or higher in alcohol more powerful versus something that’s more delicate and more perfumed.’”

Kim said every person’s palate is different when it comes to flavor weight texture or balance.

“But honestly just drinking wine in general is probably a good place to start” Kim said. “Even if it’s a bad wine as long as you are drinking with a friend you would probably enjoy it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2xvY2FsL2xvY2FsLWxhcy12ZWdhcy9jYW5jZXItZmlnaHRlcnMtc3QtYmFsZHJpY2tzLWhlYWQtc2hhdmluZy1mdW5kcmFpc2VyLWhlbGQtb24tc3RyaXAtMjU0ODMzNy_SAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmV2aWV3am91cm5hbC5jb20vbG9jYWwvbG9jYWwtbGFzLXZlZ2FzL2NhbmNlci1maWdodGVycy1zdC1iYWxkcmlja3MtaGVhZC1zaGF2aW5nLWZ1bmRyYWlzZXItaGVsZC1vbi1zdHJpcC0yNTQ4MzM3L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cancer fighters: St. Baldrick’s head-shaving fundraiser held on Strip,"A dog named “Dante” sits next to a St. Baldrick's teddy bear during the annual head shaving event benefiting kids with cancer outside New York-New York on Saturday March 19 2022 in Las Vegas.

More than 100 Las Vegas residents and tourists had their heads shaved Saturday to raise money for childhood cancer research.

Local performers served as hairdressers shaving off mohawks foot-long locks and beards for the St. Baldrick’s Foundation’s 13th annual Brave the Shave outside Nine Fine Irishmen at New York-New York.

“It’s a great cause I think everybody can support” said this year’s event organizer Jason Wooge. “Whether you’re personally affected by cancer or know someone who is it’s a very sad truth. It’s something we can all stand behind.”

Wooge MGM Resorts International’s director of retail operations shaved his head for St. Baldrick’s on Tuesday but his two children Noah 10 and Seth 7 waited until Saturday.

Wooge said his 10-year-old was nervous other kids in school would make fun of him so Wooge wrote Noah’s teachers a note explaining that he was raising money for cancer research. The teachers read the note to the class explaining why Noah would be bald Monday and several teachers donated money.

“By shaving your head you really stand in solidarity with the children who are going through this” Wooge said.

Dr. Kenneth Misch of St. Rose Pediatrics opened the ceremony Saturday after the Las Vegas Emerald Society Pipe Band marched to the stage playing bagpipes. He thanked the participants for the money they had raised and their choice to make a drastic change in their appearance.

“I can tell you from working with a lot of these kids that have been unfortunately stricken with cancer that what you’re doing today by being here means so much to those kids and our community” he said.

Among the 125 people scheduled to lose their hair Saturday Wooge said at least 80 were MGM Resorts employees. Others could sign up at the event as well.

Stewart Patchefsky general manager of the Mansion at MGM said he wanted his kids to be involved in charity work. Patchefsky’s five sons Max 17 Zachary 13 Frankie 11 Michael 8 and Nicholas 4 sat next to their dad onstage each saying goodbye to their hair.

“I want to teach my children to look out for others and love others and look for the good in the world” Melissa Patchefsky said standing with her two daughters who got to go home with their hair untouched.

Erik Vela director of finance operations for New York-New York said if the crowd could raise $150 while he was onstage he would let them shave his beard. To shave his thin mustache his family was pressed into raising another $100 for the cause.

Cash Garcia 38 sat next to his 9-year-old nephew Xander Martinez while the two were shaved. Garcia has participated in the fundraiser for five consecutive years and this year he came with a foot-tall spiked mohawk.

“I lost a friend to cancer in high school and my brother-in-law is a cancer survivor” Garcia said onstage.

The fundraiser came to Las Vegas through Brian and Lynn McMullan owners of McMullan’s Irish Pub in 2007. The McMullans lost their 2-year-old daughter Kyra to a brain tumor that year.

On Saturday the McMullans stood among dozens of families tourists and anxious shavees.

MGM Resorts President and CEO Bill Hornbuckle said Saturday that he plans to keep the event on MGM property and that he’s proud of employees who choose to participate each year.

“I think it’s part of our culture who and what we are” Hornbuckle said. “We’ve been supporting this thing for over a decade and couldn’t be more excited to be here.”

These days vehicle technology is taken for granted almost as quickly as it’s implemented. Whether its navigation Bluetooth or heated seats a vehicle without modern conveniences is seen as inferior to those that have them.

Many of the features that consumers now require in a vehicle were pioneered by Japanese automakers. In a YouTube Video Donut Media drops some truth bombs about the Japanese origins of the car features we take for granted.

Toyota Production System

Because of a lack of space Japan’s vehicle factories can’t carry massive amounts of inventory like the ones in America. Thus in 1948 Toyota implemented Toyota Production System with the goal of reducing excess waste while also increasing efficiency.

The system is so typically Japanese but the inspiration actually came from a visit to an American supermarket. Customers would buy the items they wanted and the store would restock the shelves as needed. Now known as Lean Manufacturing it meant that the factory only needed to stock the parts that are needed when they are needed.

By the 1990s American manufacturers began to catch on to the idea with Ford being one of the first to implement Lean Manufacturing with the Taurus.

Oil Filters

Filtering the oil inside an engine wasn’t invented in Japan but it wasn’t until Toyota optimized the system that it became fully effective.

American engines would only filter about 10 percent of the oil resulting in a lifespan of only 50000 miles (~80000 km). It seems like common sense now but Toyota developed a system to filter 100 percent of the oil in the engine virtually quadrupling engine life. Cleaner engines are also able to be built to tighter tolerances improving efficiency and performance.

Navigation

Japan didn’t just revolutionize how to build cars it also dramatically changed how we use them in our daily lives.

The idea of on-board navigation might have first appeared in 007’s DB5 but Honda was actually able to build it for their 1981 Honda Accord – although it was $2746 option.

By 1982 Honda realized that a helium-filled gyroscope on the dashboard wasn’t the best solution for a portable map but the seed had already been planted. GPS navigation as we know it would make its debut on the 1991 Toyota Soarer (Lexus SC400 in the U.S.) and once again America would take notice and offer “Guide Star” navigation on the 1995 Oldsmobile Eighty-Eight.

Back-up Cameras

With the requirement for cars to be safer during a crash they’ve had to increase in size in just about every direction. Thicker pillars to keep the roof from caving in during a rollover meant that vehicles became harder to see out of but Japan had a solution for that too.

Japan has always been a pioneer of video technology so it wasn’t too hard for engineers to figure out how to mount a small rearward-facing CCD camera so you could see behind you. For the 1991 Toyota Soarer there was already a screen on the dashboard for navigation so the connection was as simple as hooking up a VCR (remember those?)

As an added bonus the multifunction screen also featured touch control an absolute must-have in any new vehicle today.

Microchips

In this case it was actually Ford who arrived at microchips in vehicles before any other manufacturer but the microchips themselves were made by Toshiba in Japan.

Microchips control almost all operations including fuel injection transmission shifting traction control power windows door locks and even the throttle pedal. Without the microchip modern vehicle technology would simply not be possible.

So next time you jump into your vehicle take a moment to think about how far it’s come technologically – and maybe the things we have to thank the Japanese auto industry for.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXppbWJhYndlbWFpbC5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS1zY2llbmNlL3J1c3NpYS11a3JhaW5lLWNyaXNpcy1wdXRzLXByZXNzdXJlLW9uLW1pY3JvY2hpcC1zdXBwbHktY2hhaW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Russia-Ukraine crisis puts pressure on microchip supply chain,"Spread the love

THE already-stretched semiconductor industry is expected to suffer more interruptions from the current conflict in Eastern Europe as Ukraine and Russia provide the bulk of the world’s supplies of neon and palladium vital for the production of microchips.

Neon critical for the lasers used to make chips is a by-product of Russian steel manufacturing. It is then purified in Ukraine. Palladium is used in sensors and memory among other applications.

The current global chip shortage will worsen if the standoff persists as more than 40% of the world’s supply of palladium comes from Russia while Ukraine produces 70% of the global supply of neon according to Moody’s Analytics.

“During the 2014-2015 war in Ukraine neon prices went up by several times over indicating how serious this can be for the semiconductor industry: semiconductor-exposure companies make up 70% of total neon demand as it is an integral part of the lithographic process for making chips” Tim Uy of Moody’s Analytics wrote in a recent report seen by the Business Standard.

The ongoing chip shortage severely hit global producers during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020-21 after remote work and mobility restrictions triggered an acceleration of digitization across the world.

Moody’s expects the chip crunch to deepen if a deal is not brokered in the coming months with industries highly dependent on semiconductors to be impacted accordingly.

“This means significant risks are ahead for many automakers electronic device manufacturers phone makers and many other sectors that are increasingly reliant on chips for their products to work” the experts warn.

Global semiconductor sales

Global computer chip industry sales reached the highest-ever annual total of $555.9 billion last year the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) reported this week. The figure represents an increase of 26.2% compared to the 2020 total of $440.4 billion.

The association went on to report that the industry shipped a record 1.15 trillion units in 2021 in response to high demand.

“In 2021 amid the ongoing global chip shortage semiconductor companies substantially ramped up production to unprecedented levels to address persistently high demand resulting in record chip sales and units shipped” said SIA president and CEO John Neuffer.

SIA predicts that demand for semiconductors will “rise significantly” in the coming years as chips become heavily embedded in the essential technologies.

Millions of products such as cars smartphones and washing machines rely on computer chips.

When the coronavirus pandemic began in 2020 some tech firms started stockpiling chips or ordering them in advance which led to many companies struggling to buy the components. As lockdowns forced millions to work from home demand for laptops tablets and webcams skyrocketed. At the same labor shortages at chip factories lead to shortages worldwide.

The situation has led governments and lawmakers to work on securing the supply chain and bringing the manufacture of semiconductors closer to home as some of the biggest chip makers are located in Asia.

Last year US President Joe Biden pledged $50 billion for semiconductor manufacturing and research with a bill known as the CHIPS for America Act.

Earlier this month the EU announced a new European Chips Act that will see €15 billion ($17.11 billion) of additional investments in the industry until 2030.

SIA represents 99% of the US semiconductor industry by revenue and nearly two-thirds of non-US chip firms.

In a Twitter post he said that the next-gen passports will ensure the security of biometric data and smooth passage through immigration posts globally. He further mentioned that these passports are ICAO-compliant and will be produced at India Security Press in Nashik Maharashtra. The E-passport is not a new idea as several countries including Germany the UK and Banglades currently issue biometric passports.

How an e-passport works

At first glance an e-passport looks just like a regular passport. However an e-passport comes fitted with a small electronic chip something similar to as seen on a driver’s licence. The microchip stores all the information that is printed on your passport including name date of birth address and other details. The microchip will help immigration counters to quickly verify the details of a traveller. The move will also help to reduce the circulation of fake passports. The chip is rumoured to have enhanced security features making it difficult for fraudsters to tamper with the information stored.

Currently travellers have to spend lots of time at immigration counters to complete the formalities as the officials have to physically go through each detail on the passport. With an e-passport the time spent at an immigration counter is expected to go down by more than 50%. The microchip is also said to store biometric details along with other information which makes it easier to identify a traveller digitally. The chip can store details of your previous trips.

What is biometric data

In simple terms biometrics is the metric that is related to features of your body. This data has to be unique and it can be your eyes fingerprint face and other features. One of the most common examples of biometric technology that most of us use daily is the smartphone’s fingerprint and facial recognition feature. These security features use your unique physical characteristics to verify your identity.

In the case of e-passport this biometric data can be your fingerprints. The government already saves your fingerprints before issuing a new passport. With this information stored in the microchip it will be easier to compare and verify your identity at any immigration counter.

The procedure to apply for a new passport will remain the same and there will be no changes in the application form as well. As per the reports all 36 passport offices in India under the Ministry of External Affairs will issue e-passports. The issuance process will also remain the same.",,,,,,

Microsoft ultimately still hasn't produced devices based on its new qubit design but is adding credence to their feasibility with proofs produced by immense simulations within and without Microsoft's Azure Quantum cloud infrastructure. Microsoft’s research into quantum computing focuses on a special exotic type of qubit topological qubits that it has touted as its vehicle into the future of quantum since 2016.

Despite Microsoft’s investments in the field there has been relatively little heard from the company. Moreover Microsoft's tech giant competitors Google and IBM and much smaller companies than Microsoft like Riggetti Computing and IonQ have already deployed quantum computing systems while Microsoft hasn't. So one might think that two-trillion-dollar Microsoft has been dragging its feet in the race towards scalable quantum computing.

The Road Less Travelled By

However Microsoft would say that it has chosen to go after a type of qubit that its competitors wouldn't. Topological qubits were initially proven to exist in a 2018 Nature magazine publication and then disproven as the original researchers retracted the article “for insufficient scientific rigour in our original manuscript.”

Microsoft is not only demonstrating that topological qubits are on the verge of becoming a reality: the company says they are ultimately the only currently valid bet for sustainable scalable (to the tune of millions of harnessed qubits) and ultimately meaningful quantum computing.

""The qubits of today are not going to be the basis of the quantum computers of tomorrow"" Microsoft DIstinguished Engineer Chetan Nayak told Ars Technica. ""The qubits we have today are very interesting very impressive - you can learn a lot and do a lot of research and make good incremental progress. But some kind of new idea is going to be necessary to make a commercial-scale quantum computer.""

The world’s record for the highest qubit-count on a single device IBM’s Eagle currently stands at 127 addressable qubits — a far cry from the million qubit figure Microsoft expects will be needed. And because IBM uses transmon-based qubits the company’s devices have to be cooled to absolute zero (-273.15 ºC) to keep the qubits safe from environmental interference.



Another element of note is that because non-topological qubits are particularly sensitive to decoherence these quantum architectures usually include additional qubits whose only function is to provide a measure of error-correction capabilities meaning that they aren’t directly employed in the calculations. This is inefficient especially when considering the current difficulties in scaling the number of qubits. Hence Microsoft’s choice to go the long way around. But what is this long way around – what are topological qubits?

Absence of Proof ≠ Proof of Absence

The first thing to remember about topological qubits is that they still haven't materialized. Instead they are theorized to exist (as we've covered and explored in further detail here) as pairs of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) a special type of quasiparticle that naturally behaves as if it were only half of an electron. These MZMs have been shown to deposit as a layer on the surface of superconducting materials and showcase extreme resilience to environmental noise (such as heat stray subatomic particles or magnetic fields). Left unchecked or not engineered against this environmental noise leads to decoherence — the process by which qubits fall out of their superposition state and reveal their value. When qubits reveal their value too early an error appears before the calculation is finished.

Microsoft’s topological qubit design features a U-shaped wire with a Majorana zero mode at each end thus providing physical separation in proximity to a quantum dot. This quantum dot serves as a control mechanism because its capacitance changes whenever it interacts with either of the Majorana zero modes which allows it to be measured. This is the part Microsoft still hasn’t figured out: its design still hasn’t incorporated a quantum dot.

The resilience of topological qubits comes from the fact that both MZMs (in Microsoft’s design at each end of the U-shaped wire) are responsible for encoding the quantum information. However because the information is only reachable by looking at both quasiparticles’ states simultaneously the qubit’s state doesn’t decohere unless both MZMs are equally affected and “forced” to reveal their contents. And depending on the engineering design researchers can provide a measure of distance between the MZMs creating a gap between them that reduces the chance of both particles decohering.

To better visualize this imagine you’re a world-class villain and you write the password to your doomsday device on a piece of paper. You then give half of it to two of your trusted subordinates (before forgetting it forever). Whatever happens no single one of them can disclose the password irrespective of what methods are applied to reveal the information. In quantum terms the information has become non-local. The only way for someone to recover your full password would be to take both pieces of information and join them together to reveal the final result. In an extremely simplified way this is what grants MZMs their resilience to decoherence.

To achieve the final superconducting wire design that allows all this Microsoft's research had to simulate the materials and their shape across 23 adjustable parameters. This step requires tremendous amounts of computing power but Microsoft does have one of the most powerful computing networks in the world with Azure. In addition the simulations allowed Microsoft’s team to quickly iterate on both fronts a process that would have been unfeasible with the stock hands-on approach to materials engineering. According to Nayak ""If you had to sort [the materials] experimentally by trial and error you would never be able to optimize over all those parameters in any reasonable amount of time.""

Ultimately Microsoft settled on aluminum as the superconducting wire and indium arsenide as the semiconductor that surrounds it and the company fabricates the devices itself. This new data and materials-driven approach have been the glue that holds Microsoft’s approach to quantum computing together.

“We are now led by designs that are based on simulations not just someone batting ideas around in a conference room” said Nayak. “And now we have the unique growth and fabrication technologies to bring those ideas to life. It doesn’t matter if you have the best designs in the world — if you can’t make them they just stay on paper.”

It seems that Microsoft's intention of being a hardware provider goes way beyond Xbox and its devices division — the company wants to be the one to provide the fundamental hardware for quantum computing systems both for on-premises installations and in cloud environments. Microsoft's quantum hardware could very well end up powering a hypothetical Apple ""iQuantum"" product. In theory of course.

Future Computing

Microsoft has expectations for the compute density of machines powered by its future topological qubits: Microsoft says a million of these qubits can be fit on a wafer that’s smaller than the security chip on a credit card. It’s the transistor revolution all over again but with qubits.

Despite Microsoft still not having delivered a working quantum computing product we have to remember this is one of the most complex fields possible at a nightmarish interception between theoretical physics practical engineering and pure economics. But there is also a time-critical factor: the company is ceding ground on a market that is estimated to be worth up to $76 billion dollars by 2030. But then again should Microsoft truly deliver on an openly scalable quantum computing system before anyone else the market won't care who moved first in the space.

Experts in the quantum computing field are even more aware of how feeble the status quo still is for quantum computing systems. One of the critics of the since-retracted 2018 Nature publication Marco Valentini believed at the time that Majorana Modes would eventually be created detected and harnessed as qubits — just not as they were presented in the retracted 2018 paper.

That same paper was subject to an investigation by an independent committee of experts which found no evidence of data tampering. In the end it was the most common cause for error: human failure. The original data fell to confirmation bias as the authors of the report noted writing that “The research program the authors set out on is particularly vulnerable to self-deception and the authors did not guard against this.”

Microsoft knows what is at stake with its choice of qubits - and was already deep into its research when the entire drama surrounding the paper exploded. Perhaps because of this Microsoft is keen to defend its results: The company's research wing had one separate team for analyzing the output data precisely to avoid confirmation bias. And the company also submitted its research data to ""an expert council of independent consultants"" which sounds a lot like inviting eminent peers in the field to constructively look at the researcher's work. Microsoft is pressing on with topological qubit research while attempting to insulate its efforts from previous vices.

“It would be irresponsible of the physics community to decide now that we already know the only way” Ady Stern of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot Israel told Quanta Magazine. “We’re on page 10 of a thriller and we’re trying to guess how it’s going to end.”

With its topological qubits Microsoft is aiming to be the BluRay of the quantum format conflict. And perhaps it will be – the company seems to be convinced of the physics behind its calculated choice. Time as always will tell.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5lb3dpbi5uZXQvZWRpdG9yaWFscy90aGUtbWljcm9zb2Z0LXN0b3JlLWluLXdpbmRvd3MtMTEtYW5kLXdpbmRvd3MtMTAtcmVhbGx5LW5lZWRzLXZlcnNpb24taGlzdG9yeS1mb3ItYXBwcy_SAXJodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZW93aW4ubmV0L2FtcC90aGUtbWljcm9zb2Z0LXN0b3JlLWluLXdpbmRvd3MtMTEtYW5kLXdpbmRvd3MtMTAtcmVhbGx5LW5lZWRzLXZlcnNpb24taGlzdG9yeS1mb3ItYXBwcy8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Microsoft Store in Windows 11 and Windows 10 really needs version history for apps,"I've talked about the revamped Microsoft Store in Windows 10 and Windows 11 quite a bit in the past few months. I gave it positive feedback in my dedicated Closer Look piece and our Windows 11 review. It is also among the top five things I love about Microsoft's latest OS.

That said like every piece of software out there it's still not perfect and that's something I have mentioned in my previous writings too. The quality of the storefront and the apps available on it is another story altogether but today I want to talk about one missing capability on the UI front that I hope Microsoft adds soon.

The missing feature I'm talking about is the lack of app version history. If you're unaware what this means let me explain a bit with comparison to the other two major storefronts. Starting off with Apple's App Store - which I think has the best implementation out of the three - we get a whole list fo previous versions and their respective change logs. You can check out the screenshot above to see the latest version of Spotify available in the App Store in the window on the left (highlighted) as well as change logs version numbers and update dates for previous versions in the window on the right.

While the Google Play Store doesn't provide this level of detail at least it tells you the last updated date for the app. It also has a label for current version but in most cases it says ""varies with device"" if you check from a desktop browser. However if you check on a mobile device you do get to see additional information such as the exact version number for your device as well as the initial release date.

On the other end of the spectrum I think that the Microsoft Store is the most disappointing in this regard. If you don't have an app installed (for example Facebook) and you visit its store listing you can only see the initial release date for the app. I personally think that this is the most useless piece of information without additional context. See the screenshot of Facebook's store listing above. You know that it was released in 2013 (highlighted) but has it actually been updated since then? Good luck figuring that out.

The Microsoft Store does attempt to provide you some more information if you have the app installed. For example I have installed Spotify on my machine and now the store listing for the app shows me the installed version (highlighted). However once again without additional context this information is useless to me as well. Sure I know the installed version but do I know if this app has now been abandoned by the developer? Your guess is as good as mine.

To be fair Microsoft does try to answer this question but it's not really an elegant solution. If you visit your app library in the Microsoft Store you can see when an app was last updated (highlighted). But the problem is that it shows you the last updated date for your device. Maybe the update came out two years ago and you had auto-updates turned off so you only got it when you manually triggered the update process. All in all even this information is pointless without extra context.

I understand that the lack of a version history may or may not bother certain people depending upon how frequently they use the Microsoft Store. But as someone who has invested time and money in Microsoft's storefronts since the Windows Phone days and knows how developers used to suddenly abandon development of apps because of a low customer base version history is information that is vital to me before I decide to give the app a go.

Let's take Spotify as a hypothetical example. If the company decides to abandon support for the Microsoft Store but doesn't decide to pull the app completely the storefront itself would provide no information to give me this indication unless Spotify explicitly highlights it in the change log. Due to the lack of version history I might install the app spend lots of time migrating my library and curating my playlists and then find out next month that Spotify is pulling its app after all because hey it's already been in an ""unsupported"" state for some time.

While this is a hypothetical example that probably won't come to pass in the case of Spotify people who have been customers of Microsoft's storefronts understand quite well that this is always a possibility given the dwindling user base of the store in general. You could blame the developer for not giving clear guidance in their app's description about lack of support but at the same time I think that Microsoft needs to proactively tackle the issue of low transparency in abandonware too.

When developers submit apps and updates to the Microsoft Store a version number and a change log is clearly defined. The last updated date is obviously stored on the developer portal for tracking purposes too. What's stopping Microsoft from sharing this information with consumers as well? I honestly don't know.

That said with the development of the Microsoft Store now being helmed by star developer Rudy Huyn I do hope that the company invests more time and thought in improving the user experience for its storefront. The Microsoft Store is in a much better place than it was a year ago but there is clearly room for improvement.

Do you use the Microsoft Store frequently? Do you think that the Microsoft Store would benefit from an app version history?

According to a new study released on Thursday the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has prevented Paytm from accepting new users for its Payments Bank.

The launch of the Unified Payment Interface in 2017 which allows cash to be transferred instantly has been a crucial stimulant for the development of digital payments according to Moody’s Investors Service due to its simplicity of use of apps running on the system.

“However their dominance may not translate into advantages over banks” said Srikanth Vadlamani Moody’s Vice President and Senior Credit Officer. “Because of the UPI’s open architecture a huge user base does not automatically make a service provider more competitive than others on the system” he added.

Banks which play a critical role in facilitating UPI payments also access the network’s transactions.

“As a result” the paper stated “fintechs’ dominance in digital payments may not result in a major data advantage over banks.”

On the other hand large banks have increased their digital capabilities for essential retail services dramatically.

Private sector banks and industry leader SBI have vastly upgraded their digital solutions primarily adopted by customers in other sectors.

“This will aid these banks in fending off fintech competition outside of the payment industry. Public sector banks other than SBI on the other hand have fragile digital products and will be harmed by the increased competitive intensity. “According to the analysis Fintechs will keep branching out into other financial services particularly personal loans and loans to small businesses.

According to Moody “the total industry may increase as technology creates greater options allowing banks to offset margin pressure with business development.”

Overall fintech payment companies in India have been at the forefront of its rapid growth in digital payments. Still their dominance may not transfer into competitive advantages in expanding into other financial services.

According to the survey India’s main banks have greatly increased their digital product offerings and can withstand competition from fintech.

What does the RBI order signify for Paytm Payments Bank?

Customers have raised concerns over the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) ruling on Paytm Payments Bank. Paytm’s parent firm One97 Communications has clarified that the RBI directive will not affect existing Paytm Payments Bank users (PPBL).

The RBI ordered Paytm Payments Bank which was recently pushed by Vijay Shekhar Sharma to suspend creating new accounts due to “serious supervisory concerns” in the bank.

RBI ORDER TO PAYTM PAYMENTS BANK

“The Reserve Bank of India has today under section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act 1949 directed Paytm Payments Bank Ltd to cease onboarding of new customers with immediate effect” according to a statement from the central bank.

The bank has been ordered to hire an IT auditing firm to undertake a full system audit of its IT system.

“Paytm Payments Bank’s onboarding of new customers will be subject to RBI’s specific clearance provided when the IT auditors’ reports are reviewed.” According to the statement this action is being taken as a result of “some material supervisory concerns discovered in the bank” according to the statement.

FREQUENT PROHIBITIONS

Since its start in May 2017 the banking authority has targeted Paytm Payments Bank three times. According to a PTI report it has been barred from opening new accounts for the second time.

Paytm Bank was established in August 2016 and started operations in May 2017 from a Noida branch. According to the most recent figures PPBL had roughly 6.4 crore customers.

PPBL was barred from onboarding new customers by the RBI in June 2018 due to supervisory concerns. On December 31 2018 the limitations were eliminated.

The central bank also issued a show-cause notice to Paytm Payments Bank on July 29 2021 alleging that the company had violated the Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007 by submitting false information to RBI confirming the completion of One97 Communications’ transfer of the Bharat Bill Payment Operating Unit business to PPBL.

The Reserve Bank of India fined Paytm Payments Bank Rs 1 crore for the offence.

Sharma owns 51 per cent of Paytm Payments Bank (PPBL) while One97 Communications owns the remaining 49 per cent.

Alibaba Group based in China is the largest shareholder in One97 Communications owning around 31% of the company through its subsidiaries.

TOP POINTS FOR CUSTOMERS

According to a BSE filing “the Company would like to underline that this has no impact on any existing PPBL customers who can continue to use all banking and payment services without interruption.”

According to One97 Communications all existing users of Paytm UPI Paytm Wallet Paytm FASTag and bank accounts can continue to use these instruments for payments including debit cards and net banking.

New users can sign up for the Paytm app and conduct transactions by registering UPI handles and attaching them to their bank accounts or by utilizing third-party payment instruments according to the business.

However users cannot open new PPBL wallets savings or current accounts until further notice.

NO DATA LEAK

Paytm Payments Bank said on Monday that it complies fully with the Reserve Bank of India’s data localization guidelines and that all of the bank’s data is stored in India.

According to CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma investors in India’s Paytm do not have access to the payments bank’s client data. He responded to accusations that user data had been leaked to Chinese enterprises.

Paytm says that restrictions on Payments Bank won’t hamper its business

Paytm’s parent company One 97 Communications has reiterated that the Reserve Bank of India’s recent restrictions on Paytm Bank will have no meaningful impact on Paytm or its ability to sign up new consumers on its app.

“Paytm thinks that the PPBL [Paytm Payments Bank Limited] actions will have no meaningful impact on Paytm’s overall business.” In a stock exchange filing on March 15 One 97 Communications noted “This direction does not influence the services that Paytm delivers in conjunction with other financial services companies.”

This Bank is a joint venture between Paytm and Vijay Shekhar Sharma the company’s creator. Paytm Payments Bank is an associate entity of One 97 Communications and is not included in the public offering of One 97 Communications. Paytm Payments Bank is the backbone of many Paytm operations including insurance digital payments and lending even though it is not open to the public.

From March 11 the Reserve Bank of India stopped Paytm Payments Bank from opening any new accounts. The central bank has requested an independent technological audit from Paytm Payments Bank but only after engaging with them. According to reports the payments bank would have to choose potential auditors who the RBI would then finalize.

According to a Bloomberg article citing sources the central bank put this restriction on Paytm Payments Bank since the business enabled data to travel to servers that shared information with China-based entities. One97 Communications directed by Vijay Shekha Sharma has refuted these charges calling the news “totally false” and “simply sensationalizing.”

“Paytm Bank is happy to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Paytm and is fully compliant with the RBI’s data localization directives.” The Bank’s data is kept entirely within the country. The company’s representative stated “We are true believers in the Digital India project and are dedicated to driving financial inclusion in the country.”

Paytm Payments Bank will have independent tech audit regulations set up by the RBI according to a report.

After banning the company from onboarding new customers for alleged violations of customer acquisition and privacy standards with a possible data flow to Chinese entities the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will now develop audit criteria for an independent technological examination of Paytm Payments Bank.

Paytm Bank will submit a list of third-party auditors for clearance in the coming days. The central bank will next choose the final candidate from the list of candidates provided. The RBI will define the terms and references for the independent technology audit based on its findings including the corporation failing to meet Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements.

“The payments bank failed to rectify the system’s flaws despite several relevant referrals from the regulator.” “Repeated vulnerabilities in the bank’s KYC procedure were uncovered” according to the ET article “including such accounts that required a full KYC were not completed.”

The RBI revealed during its investigation that data from payments banks was being transmitted to the wallet operator in an insecure manner in violation of RBI guidelines. The RBI’s compliance has been either pending or unacceptable according to the sources.

Under Section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act 1949 the RBI stopped Paytm Payments Bank from onboarding new customers last week. The bank stated that the approval to onboard new customers would be conditional on special authorization being granted once the RBI evaluates the IT auditors’ findings. The action was taken due to the RBI’s material supervisory concerns.

Vijay Shekhar Sharma the founder of Paytm denied any data sharing with Chinese companies.

“The RBI has laid forth a list of tasks that Paytm Bank must complete in order to complete the audit. I also want to confirm that no duty in the letter of observation mentions data access unlawful data access allowing data access data localization data system or servers or any foreign shareholder or foreign access.” Sharma expressed his point of view.

The stock of Paytm is now worth less than a third of what it was when it was first sold. On March 14 the stock fell to a 52-week low. On the National Stock Exchange Paytm dropped 13% on the day closing at Rs 674.80 a share (NSE).

What Is Fintech?

Consider your life before COVID-19 for a moment. Fintech was the unsung hero of your lonely night in those less socially distant days.

You uploaded a photo of your paycheck to your bank’s mobile app by taking a picture with your smartphone. You used Mint to figure out how much money you had set aside for entertainment each month. You and your friend split the bill during dinner using Venmo. Later you used Apple Pay to pay for a drink at the bar with your phone. When it was time to go home you took an Uber and delivered it with a stored credit card—or even Bitcoin—for the ride.

Fintech is undoubtedly a massive part of your personal and professional life even if you don’t recognize it. According to Ernst & Young’s 2019 Global FinTech Adoption Index more than two-thirds of the world’s population (64 per cent) has adopted fintech up from 16 per cent in 2015. Last year 3 out of every 4 consumers used money transfer and payment options according to the research.

Fintech like many other rising technology sectors maybe a hazy idea due to the vast array of tools platforms and services that lie under its extensive umbrella. If you’re still unsure what fintech is here’s a quick rundown.

Fintech is a combination of “financial technology” and “portmanteau.” Any technology used to augment streamline digitize or disrupt traditional financial services is referred to as fintech.

Software algorithms and applications for both computer and mobile-based tools are referred to as fintech. Hardware like smart connected piggy banks or virtual reality (VR) trading platforms is sometimes included. Depositing checks moving money between accounts paying bills and apply for financial aid are all possible with fintech platforms. They cover more technical topics like peer-to-peer lending and cryptocurrency exchanges.

The Forbes Fintech 50 is an annual list of some of the most exciting platforms. Chime a financial technology startup whose banking services are supplied by and whose debit card is issued by The Bancorp Bank or Stride Bank and Affirm a resource for fast fixed-rate point-of-sale loans were the companies on the 2020 list. This year stripe has become an investor darling receiving a $1 billion investment from Sequoia Capital General Catalyst and Visa among others.

Wealthtech invest tech and insurtech are all subsets of fintech.

Banks use fintech for back-end procedures like account activity monitoring and consumer-facing solutions like the app you use to check your balance. Individuals use fintech for tax calculations to market speculation and no prior investing experience is required.

Businesses use fintech for payment processing e-commerce transactions accountancy and more recently government aid programmes like the Payroll Protection Program (PPP). Following the COVID-19 pandemic many companies turn to fintech to offer features like contactless payments and other tech-enabled transactions.

How Has Fintech Changed Over Time?

Fintech isn’t spanking new just because it’s popular. Although the phrase was only added to Merriam-lexicon Webster’s in 2018 the concept has been around for decades. ATMs for example were once considered cutting-edge fintech as were signature-verification technology which banks first utilized in the 1860s.

Fintech has evolved from being associated with scrappy startups to becoming a major component of established and legacy financial institutions in recent years. Whereas the word was initially primarily associated with Silicon Valley-based disruptors shaking up the big banks several businesses have partnered with the incumbents they ostensibly aimed to dethrone.

As a result several of the world’s most well-known institutions now have their own fintech savings account. In 2019 JP Morgan made a $25 million investment in fintech firms. To attract youthful digitally aware consumers Capital One has built fintech-infused “banking cafés.” Citi also developed the Citi Developer Hub in 2016 to allow third-party programmers to test and provide input on application programming interfaces (APIs).

Even as some of its incarnations falter fintech has proven its worth in the face of the coronavirus outbreak. Although the Capital One cafés are temporarily closed banks and credit unions across the United States have been able to transact digitally and provide COVID-19 support and services. Going online or using a bank or credit union’s mobile app can also help you avoid longer-than-usual phone wait times.

How Does Fintech Affect Me?

The financial services industry isn’t usually associated with agility. Today consumers and business owners expect—and increasingly require—adaptability and rapid iteration (not to mention fast pleasure).

Fintech helps speed up activities like seeking a credit report or sending an international money transfer that used to take days weeks or even months. Platforms like Upstart and TransferWise can complete these activities a fraction of the time it took five years ago. Fintech has been proposed to speed up typically time-consuming operations like distributing economic stimulus funding.

Fintech has the potential to improve financial inclusion in some parts of the world where governmental or institutional backing is insufficient.

Fintech’s capacity to streamline historically clumsy operations is partly based on numbers rather than human talents and views. While many fintech services combine parts of traditional brokers/advisors with algorithms others assist customers in navigating financially challenging activities without requiring them to engage with an actual live human.

For example today’s consumers can avoid going to a regular bank branch to apply for a loan or even a mortgage. Casual investors no longer need to meet with financial gurus face to face to go over the ins and outs of their portfolios; they can look through their alternatives online or even utilize chatbots to help them make selections.

Look no further than robo-advisors—digital platforms that provide automated algorithm-based investment choices and financial planning guidance with little to no human oversight—to see how far fintech has moved the financial services market into a Jetsons-style reality. Betterment an advice service that bills itself as “the smart money manager” is one such platform in this space that made Forbes Fintech 50 for 2020.

Many fintech is also mobilizing to assist consumers in staying afloat amid the pandemic’s financial chaos. Some companies such as Lending Club actively give financial assistance and establish aid programmes to help the most affected individuals. Others are concentrating their efforts on aiding those on the front lines. Stripe for example is prioritizing telemedicine platform integration.

In the end the answer to how fintech affects your life is a case-by-case situation. Aside from chores that have become engrained in day-to-day banking such as online account monitoring the impact of fintech on your life is a personal choice determined by the number of services you choose to connect with.

Is Fintech Safe?

Consumer trust is one-way fintechs have innovatively changed the financial services business. A startling trend emerges from the EY report: The desire to employ financial tools developed by unconventional (that is nonfinancial) entities was stated by 68 per cent of respondents. Moreover 89 per cent of SME adopters said they were eager to exchange data with fintech firms.

Consumers and corporations no longer require Wall Street cachet to hand over financial data or even their hard-earned cash to platforms.

However whether this faith is well-founded or whether the advantages outweigh the risks it needs to be seen. Engaging with fintechs many of which are still entirely unregulated especially in the wild west of cryptocurrencies and blockchain might expose you to undesired or unanticipated threats.

The notion that fintech is held to a higher moral standard than central banks is also a myth. As financial expert Ron Shevlin points out many promising firms face challenges due to and independent of the coronavirus outbreak.

With a fair dose of scepticism it’s advisable to approach dazzling yet unproven fintech and their grandiose claims. Large-scale security snafus are becoming more common as digital data becomes more broad and crucial to day-to-day living. Recent breaches especially high-profile Bitcoin heists have raised awareness of these dangers.

There hasn’t been a consensus on how safe fintech products are. Given the scope and size of fintech expansion such assurances will likely be challenging. On the other hand consumers are wise to be cautious: “I am concerned about protecting my personal data while engaging with companies online” said 71 per cent of fintech adopters in an EY survey.

What Does the Future Hold for Fintech?

Nobody knows what fintech advancements are on the horizon and the upheaval generated by the pandemic only adds to the uncertainty. Early 2020 forecasts that the mature sector will continue to grow in 2020 proved to be only partially correct. Interest rate cuts and the covid-induced economic roller coaster according to Deloitte have upended industry beliefs about fintech’s immediate future.

Fintechs like their clients have faced financial difficulties—some have had to lay off employees while others are struggling to gain investor backing as they make fast transitions to virtual meetings with venture capitalists. Demand for fintech is perhaps at an all-time high: Businesses and banking consumers are increasingly turning to technology to manage their finances.

According to Deloitte an economic rebound will coincide with fresh potential for fintech. This is especially true in a company context where digital banking services and e-commerce have become more readily available due to necessity.

Fintech’s larger and longer-term trends have remained unchanged. Legacy banks and fintech appear to be merging forming alliances and collaborating. Fintechs like their customers have struggled financially—some have had to lay off personnel while others are battling for investor backing as they migrate to virtual meetings with venture capitalists. Simultaneously demand for fintech is at an all-time high: businesses and banking customers alike are increasingly looking to technology for help with their finances.

A recovery in the economy according to Deloitte will coincide with new fintech opportunities. This is true in the workplace where digital banking and e-commerce have grown more widely available due to need.

The larger and longer-term tendencies in fintech have stayed primarily constant. Fintechs and legacy banks appear to combine create alliances and collaborate.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Oil is set to surge to $120 a barrel as the Ukraine conflict rocks energy markets Morgan Stanley's chief commodities strategist has predicted.

Crude oil prices will then stay around the $100 mark for the whole of 2023 Martijn Rats told Insider.

The war in Eastern Europe will mean Russian oil production will fall by around 1 million barrels per day as the country struggles to find buyers for its energy.

Although European governments have not followed the US in banning Russian energy imports many companies in the region are ""self-sanctioning"" and shunning them Rats noted.

""The oil market was tight is tight and is getting tighter"" he said. ""A 12-to-18 month period ahead with elevated prices is quite likely.""

Russia-Ukraine pressure

Crude oil prices have surged as a result of Ukraine's invasion by Russia which is an important global energy supplier.

Brent crude the international benchmark oil price shot to a 14-year high of $139 a barrel earlier in March having started the year at around $79.

Prices then cooled sharply in light of reports that Russia and Ukraine were thrashing out a peace agreement. Brent stood at around $106 a barrel as of around 11 a.m. ET Friday while WTI crude traded at around $103 a barrel.

Governments and investors worry that rising oil prices could put more upward pressure on inflation which is already running at multidecade highs in the US and Europe.

Rats' baseline prediction is that Brent crude will consistently trade at $120 a barrel by the third quarter of 2022 as the lower levels of Russian supply make themselves felt.

The strategist said oil would likely fall to around $100 a barrel in the fourth quarter and stay around that level for the whole of 2023. ""I would categorize that as a high price"" he said.

Oil scenarios

However Rats said forecasting in the current climate is hugely difficult. ""There's certainly scenarios imaginable where oil prices go higher than what we're forecasting"" Rats said.

A move by the EU to ban the import of Russian oil and gas would further tighten supply and push up prices he predicted. A failure by Western governments to reach a nuclear deal with Iran which would reconnect the country with global energy markets would also drive prices higher.

The International Energy Agency has gone further than Morgan Stanley in estimating oil markets could lose 3 million barrels a day from April as a result of the Ukraine conflict. The world consumes around 100 million barrels a day according to IEA estimates.

The IEA warned Friday that oil markets are in an ""emergency situation"" and it urged Western countries to cut back on their energy consumption by limiting air travel and restricting driving.

Equity investors have been watching oil markets closely as they try to predict inflation and gauge central bank policy.

Stocks fell sharply when oil surged earlier in March. But they have posted solid gains over the last week after energy prices cooled although other factors have also been driving markets. The S&P 500 was on track for a weekly gain of around 5% as of Friday afternoon ET.

Direct air capture (DAC) sounds too good to be true. Humanity is threatened by an excess of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere so build a giant DAC machine that can remove it.

By the numbers ▸ 415 ppm 2022 Atmospheric CO 2 concentration in 2022 ▸ 280 ppm Atmospheric CO 2 concentration in 1850 ▸ 1080 Gta CO 2 added to the air since the start of the Industrial Revolution ▸ 36.3 Gt per year Ongoing global greenhouse gas emissions ▸ 1.3–29 Gt per year Estimated hard-to-abate greenhouse gas emissions ▸ 10000 t per year Estimated current direct-air-capture (DAC) capacity ▸ $300 to $400 per metric ton Cost of DAC credits for large corporate buyers Sources: CDR Primer South Pole Carbon Engineering Lux Research International Energy Agency. a gigatons equivalent to a billion metric tons.

And it can be done. Right now in Iceland a plant built by the DAC start-up Climeworks is pulling CO 2 out of the air at a rate of about 4000 metric tons (t) per year and pumping it deep underground. The CO 2 reacts with basalt rock there to form stable carbonate minerals. The plant named Orca runs on low-carbon geothermal electricity and waste heat so it is by all accounts a carbon-negative process.

But DAC is expensive and energy intensive. Critics of DAC say that other forms of carbon removal are cheaper and that reducing emissions in the first place will always be a better investment in the fight against climate change. So the question isn’t if DAC works; it’s if DAC makes economic sense. There’s a lot riding on the answer.

In an influential report in 2018 the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that humanity can keep global warming below 1.5 °C and dodge the worst consequences of climate change if we can reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

The strategies for getting there fall into two buckets: emission reduction and carbon removal. Emission reduction is anything that results in less CO 2 being released including point-source carbon capture improved energy efficiency electrification renewable energy regenerative agriculture and forest management and reengineering of industrial processes. Carbon removal is anything that pulls CO 2 out of the air including nature-based methods such as planting trees and technologies such as DAC.

Though the two approaches sometimes compete for investment and for buyers of the emissions-offset credits they create many experts say both will be needed. Marcius Extavour vice president for energy and climate at the XPrize Foundation says the IPCC report and its follow-ups lay out the need clearly. “If we want to avoid warming beyond 1.5 °C every scenario is going to require some kind of carbon removal in addition to reducing emissions immediately and as fast as possible.”

Even within the area of carbon removal DAC has competition from other methods most of which are lower cost. “In the nature-based solutions community they say ‘It’s a no-brainer. We’re the cheapest or the most abundant’ ” Extavour says. At the same time he adds many people in DAC “think direct air capture is the only thing that’s really scalable.”

Extavour is leading the Carbon Removal XPrize a competition that will award $100 million to groups developing DAC and other carbon removal methods. Eighty million of that will be split between up to four teams that demonstrate systems that remove 1000 t of CO 2 per year and present a clear techno-economic path to expanding to a megaton scale. On April 22 Earth Day XPrize will announce 15 contestants that will receive $1 million each in milestone funding to develop their concepts.

DAC has a lot in common with point-source carbon capture in which CO 2 is scrubbed from the flue gas of power plants or other industrial facilities. But the two address very different markets and needs according to Thomas McDonald the former CEO of Mosaic Materials. Mosaic has developed CO 2 sorbent materials based on metal-organic frameworks for both DAC and point-source carbon capture.

Applied to combustion power plants McDonald says point-source carbon capture can result in clean electricity that competes with renewable and nuclear power. It can also handle process emissions such as the CO 2 produced by yeast during ethanol fermentation or by refineries and chemical plants.

DAC comes into play to deal with CO 2 emissions that are unavoidable and can’t be captured with point-source methods such as those from aviation. It’s also necessary to remediate historical greenhouse gas emissions—the CO 2 the world has been spewing for the past 100-plus years.

Exactly what emissions can and can’t be avoided is the subject of some debate. “There’s going to be a fight across the economy for every sector to be considered hard to abate so they don’t have to change” says John Noël a senior climate campaigner at the environmental nonprofit Greenpeace.

The CDR Primer a digital textbook about carbon dioxide removal published in 2021 by a team from the University of Pennsylvania estimates truly hard-to-abate emissions at 1.5–3.1 gigatons (Gt) of CO 2 per year. That number assumes that the electricity and industrial sectors can be completely decarbonized. It thus includes only some shipping aviation and heating CO 2  along with emissions of nitrous oxide—a greenhouse gas more potent than CO 2 —from agriculture wastewater and landfills.

Other estimates classify some emissions from power and manufacturing as hard to abate including those from the chemical industry. They range from 5 to 29 Gt per year.

According to the International Energy Agency an intergovernmental organization 19 DAC plants including Orca currently operate for a total capacity of roughly 10000 t per year. Most are pilot-scale facilities built to develop the technology rather than to capture a meaningful amount of CO 2 ; several are not even net negative in carbon.

DAC companies are developing two basic business models: sequester the CO 2 underground and sell credits to companies looking to offset their emissions or sell the CO 2 to companies that can use it.

We want to remove our emissions today. And this means we must limit our investment in direct air capture where plants are still under construction. Mario Tuthorn marketing manager Thermo Fischer Scientific inorganic mass spectrometry group

The aviation industry is one hoped-for customer for CO 2 from DAC. Carbon dioxide can be combined with hydrogen to produce hydrocarbons such as kerosene-type jet fuel though that technology is also not yet at commercial scale.

“Direct air capture is an essential step to decarbonization in the sense that it should be in the longer term the only way to produce synthetic kerosene” says Matteo Mirolo sustainable aviation policy officer at the nonprofit Transport and Environment. Flying all European Union–originating flights on such “e-kerosene” would consume 365 million t of captured CO2 per year Mirolo says.

Climeworks is bullish on fuels derived from captured CO 2 . It’s part of a consortium called Norsk e-Fuel that recently announced plans for a plant in Norway that it expects to produce 25 million L of jet fuel per year from DAC CO 2 and renewable electricity.

But critics say better options will be available to decarbonize jet fuel too. Biomass-derived fuels can in principle be carbon negative if plants use waste biomass and are fitted with carbon capture. The biofuel company Gevo for example has aviation fuel partnerships with Archer Daniels Midland Chevron and Delta Air Lines. And Strategic Biofuels is working with regulators on an injection site in Louisiana for a jet fuel project consuming forestry waste.

Other DAC firms are racing to join Climeworks in having steel in the ground. Carbon Engineering is working with Oxy Low Carbon Ventures a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum on megaton-scale DAC plants in Norway and Texas. Carbon Engineering’s system uses a set of calcium-chemistry “loops” to isolate the CO 2 it catches using a potassium hydroxide solution.

The firm’s Norwegian plant will inject its CO 2 underneath the ocean floor. Oxy will use the Texas plant’s CO 2 to push more oil and gas out of depleted wells a practice called enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Global Thermostat with backing from ExxonMobil and the US Department of Energy is working on both EOR and ways to use captured CO 2 as a feedstock for fuels and plastics.

Greenpeace’s Noël calls using captured CO 2 to extract more oil a “joke” and warns that partnering with the oil and gas industry is a dangerous path. “It is a Trojan horse for these companies to maintain their access and influence over climate policy and design and implementation going forward at the state federal and global level” he says.

At the same time EOR operators are willing to pay some of the highest prices for CO 2  and DAC needs customers in order to grow.

Former Carbon Engineering CEO Steve Oldham who left the firm in January says EOR from DAC can be carbon neutral. But the firm is also looking at e-fuels and pure sequestration. “DAC is fundamentally a service” Oldham says. “You and I pay someone to take garbage away from our house. DAC is a model that makes sense for hard-to-decarbonize sectors.”

The market for removing carbon the way we remove the trash is gaining steam McDonald says. “There’s an incredible amount of demand that’s coming to purchase these and there’s actually not enough supply of high-quality additional verifiable credits.”

Despite that need DAC has struggled to catch on because of high prices and limited capacity.

Thermo Fisher Scientific’s experience is instructive. The company launched a line of carbon-neutral mass spectrometers in 2021 using carbon removal credits to offset the emissions created during the instruments’ life cycle. The firm’s inorganic mass spectrometry group calculated that 15 kg of CO 2 is emitted for every 1 kg of spectrometer delivered.

“Emission reduction is obviously the most important long-term goal for decarbonizing the economy” Mario Tuthorn marketing manager for the group said in a presentation on the program. But that’s hard to do in precision manufacturing where performance of the final device is very sensitive to material and design choices he added. “If we want to make a change today the most practical approach is to offset our emissions.”

If we want to avoid warming beyond 1.5 °C every scenario is going to require some kind of carbon removal in addition to reducing emissions immediately and as fast as possible. Marcius Extavour vice president for energy and climate XPrize Foundation

Avoided emissions such as those gained from planting or protecting trees were not good enough in the team’s analysis because they are hard to calculate and track. “Will the forest you paid to protect still be protected in 50 to 100 years’ time?” Tuthorn asked. “A much more rigorous offsetting approach is carbon dioxide removal.”

In a white paper the group detailed how it shopped for carbon removal credits. It emphasized permanent removal of CO 2 that would not have been removed other ways. Priority also went to technologies that have the potential to scale but need investment now to drive down costs.

Though Thermo Fisher sounds like the exact customer DAC firms are courting DAC won only 3%—which went to Carbon Engineering—of the program’s 2021 carbon removal spending. Instead 78% went to construction with sustainable timber and insulation with recycled paper. Biochar and bio-oil projects which heat plant matter to convert it to charcoal or pyrolysis oil that is then buried or injected into old wells shared 19%.

Though Tuthorn described DAC as the gold standard for carbon removal alongside biomass-based energy plants that sequester their CO 2 emissions he said it wasn’t ready and affordable yet. “We want to remove our emissions today” he said “and this means we must limit our investment in direct air capture where plants are still under construction.”

Price was also a concern. Thermo Fisher was willing to spend an average of $80 per metric ton of carbon removed more than most other initiatives want to spend. Market watchers estimate the current price of DAC offsets at about $400 per metric ton. At that price DAC could be only a small part of the pie. Over time Tuthorn said DAC will gain a bigger share of the credits the program buys.

DAC similarly won only a small chunk of Microsoft’s fiscal 2021 carbon removal credit purchases. The software giant bought 1400 t of removal credits from Climeworks 4000 t from biochar and bio-oil projects and 193000 t from soil carbon management. Most of its purchases—1.1 million t—were from forestry projects.

In 2022 Microsoft replaced DAC in its offset portfolio with a project to mineralize CO 2 in old concrete. The company paid an average of $19.40 per metric ton for its 2022 offsets.

Microsoft detailed the problem in its 2022 carbon offset white paper. “High-durability solutions are critical but supply is limited and expensive and many companies cannot yet afford them at scale” it says referring to biochar bio-oil mineralization and DAC. “We need expensive higher durability solutions to become more affordable.” Microsoft says it is both an offset credit customer of Climeworks and an investor in the firm through its Climate Innovation Fund.

“It’s great to have these customers” says Christoph Beuttler head of climate policy at Climeworks. But it’s a chicken-and-egg moment: for prices to come down DAC needs to scale up and to do that DAC needs customers buying carbon offsets. “We are a technology right? So we’re expensive now; we get cheap as—if—we scale up. We need the money now” Beuttler says.

He estimates that DAC needs $100 billion in R&D investment to reduce the price to a point where the technology can really compete.

In a 2021 paper in Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research Klaus Lackner and Habib Azarabadi of Arizona State University were more optimistic. They argue that DAC costs could fall with increased use as solar photovoltaic costs have; it might take only $200 million of carbon credit purchases to bring the cost of DAC down to $100 per metric ton (DOI: 10.1021/acs.iecr.0c04839).

“In just the chemistry there’s still a lot of potential that we can tap into” Beuttler says. “But obviously there’s also a lot to gain from economies of scale. The ones behind me are handmade in Switzerland” he says pointing to a photo of a Climeworks DAC module. That is “probably not the most cost-efficient way to produce them” he adds. “If we continue making them by hand it will remain a luxury product.”

Climeworks is planning to build a plant in 2024 that will be 10 times as large as Orca moving the firm in the right direction on both chemistry advances and economies of scale Beuttler says.

Nearly everyone working in DAC agrees that emission reduction is the low-hanging fruit in fighting climate change and should be harvested as quickly as possible. The importance of carbon removal will grow over time though and DAC may be the most scalable trackable and tradable way to cover the “last mile” of hard-to-abate and historical emissions.",,,,,,,,,,,,

With the current mix of potential stock market headwinds on deck could investing in cyclical stocks make sense now? Well for one thing this section of thestock market todayis closely linked to the state of the economy. The likes of which continue to recover at a notable pace. Sure there is the issue of inflation weighing in on consumer spending now. With the economy running hot the Federal Reserve has finally approved the first interest rate hike in more than three years. Not to mention the latest weekly jobless claims came in below expectations a further testament to the strength of the economy.

As all of these factors come into play some investors could be considering cyclical stocks. For one thing companies in the cyclical space are not sitting idly by amidst all this. Take Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) for instance. As of last week the energy firm is working with European jet-maker Airbus. Through the four-year deal Occidental will be supplying Airbus with emissions-offsetting carbon credits. Furthermore even consumer discretionary firms like Roblox (NYSE: RBLX) are expanding their offerings as well. The company is reportedly looking to hire a PlayStation software engineer which could help in expanding the reach of its platform. With all this in mind here are four cyclical stocks making headlines in the stock market now.

Cyclical Stocks To Buy [Or Sell] In March 2022

GameStop Corporation

Starting us off today we have GameStop a cyclical company that focuses on its consumer electronics and gaming merchandise retail.

FedEx Corporation

Another cyclical name worth noting in thestock market todaywould be the FedEx Corporation. Overall FedEx is one of if not the most prominent players in the logistics business now. Through its vast portfolio the company primarily offers transportation e-commerce and business services. For a sense of scale FedEx’s operations rake in revenue of roughly $90 billion per year. More importantly FDX stock seems to be gaining attention following its latest quarterly earnings update.

In it FedEx reported earnings of $4.59 per share alongside revenue of $23.6 billion. For comparison consensus forecasts on Wall Street were expecting $4.64 and $23.4 billion respectively. For the most part the focus of investors today seems to be FedEx’s earnings miss. Even so the company continues to go from strength to strength on the operational front. Through solid performances from its team FedEx is now looking at record December operating income figures. The company highlights higher revenue per shipment and a net fuel benefit throughout its transportation divisions as key contributors to this. As such would you consider FDX stock worth investing in amidst the current dips?

Thanks to a strong digital presence the company has continued to post double-digit same-store sales growth while also opening new locations at a healthy clip. And shares are up more than 200% since bottoming out when the pandemic first hit in March 2020.

Chipotle's simple yet tasty menu is a big part of the reason the chain has been so successful. But from a customer perspective the convenience and value proposition is also unmatched. A recent announcement proves the business and its management can still find new ways to keep loyal fans coming back for more.

Even restaurants can innovate

Chipotle announced it would begin offering pollo asado to its menu in the U.S. and Canada. In its 29-year history this is the first time the business has added a new chicken offering.

""Chicken is easily our most popular protein with many of our most loyal Chipotle customers ordering it the majority of the time"" Chief Marketing Officer Chris Brandt highlighted in the recent press release.

Test results at select stores in Cincinnati and Sacramento were extremely positive. Customer feedback and sales of pollo asado were similar to the limited-time brisket offering which was Chipotle's best-selling menu introduction in recent years. That's a great sign for pollo asado's prospects.

This tasty development shows even companies in the restaurant sector can find ways to innovate. In Chipotle's case new menu items like this one can have a profound impact on engaging existing customers and attracting new ones. The menu might be simple and focused but Chipotle has shown that it can shake things up quite well.

CEO Brian Niccol previously held the same role at Taco Bell and in that position he similarly oversaw new menu introductions for the fast-food chain so it's no surprise he's bringing some of that expertise to Chipotle's operations. Since Niccol took over leadership at Chipotle in March 2018 its shares have skyrocketed almost 400%.

Navigating the inflationary environment

The current economic situation characterized by soaring inflation and a tight labor market has hit restaurants particularly hard. Even Chipotle regarded as a leader in the cutthroat industry isn't immune to these issues. Fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $5.58 exceeded Wall Street estimates but rising beef avocado and freight costs resulted in Chipotle's 8.6% operating margin coming in far below the previous three quarters.

But by continuing to introduce new menu items Chipotle is finding ways to keep its customers excited and coming back for more. Furthermore it gives the business an opportunity to raise prices. The new pollo asado entrees will cost an average of $9.11 in the U.S. $0.65 more expensive than the regular adobo chicken. Shareholders should appreciate this proven pricing power as it gives management another lever to help drive sales growth.

Compared to last year customers are paying about 10% more for their food orders due to strategic price hikes management has implemented. Revenue in 2021 was 26.1% higher than in 2020 demonstrating resilient demand for Chipotle's offerings. There are likely even more opportunities to increase prices should inflation stay elevated in the near term.

While Chipotle stock is expensive and priced for perfection with a price-to-earnings ratio of 68 this is a high-quality business that investors should keep on their watch lists.

While Musk obviously has plenty of money to buy a home outright if he wishes to do so he's opted out of this approach.

In fact Musk reportedly took out a combined total of $61 million in mortgages in 2018 for several properties in Bel Air and the Bay Area. This included $50 million in new mortgage debt as well as a refinance loan that he used to repay a mortgage that he had used to purchase a property in 2017. Collectively these mortgages had a monthly payment totaling around $180000.

Given the amount of money that Musk has it's reasonable to wonder why the billionaire would bother borrowing to buy properties. But there's one simple reason why his decision to take out loans was likely a smart one.

The simple -- yet important -- reason why Musk borrows to buy properties

Musk likely borrowed to purchase his properties for the same reason that other wealthy people -- including Warren Buffett -- choose to take out home loans. Doing so allows them to avoid tying up their assets and to maintain liquidity so they can do other things with their money that can produce better returns.

See mortgage loans tend to have very low interest rates. So although Musk borrowed a fortune the financing charges that he'll pay will be very affordable relative to the amount of money the bank loaned him. Mortgage rates are generally well below 5% -- even when borrowing large sums of money -- and the only return on investment (ROI) that you'd get from avoiding this type of loan is the interest savings.

That means if Musk suspects he can make more on his money than the amount he could save by avoiding interest he's better off borrowing for a home and putting his dollars elsewhere.

In his particular case Musk has repeatedly purchased shares of Tesla on the open market to show confidence in his company. And since Tesla shares have increased substantially in value since 2017 Musk made a smart decision by betting on his company rather than tying up his money in a home.

What can the average home buyer learn from Musk's example?

The fact that Musk opted to take out a mortgage on his homes shows why most typical Americans should do the same.

While finance experts such as Dave Ramsey suggest paying cash for a house when possible or taking out the smallest mortgage you can for the shortest time doing so comes at a big cost. You give up the chance to do other things with your money that could produce a better ROI.

While you do want to put around 20% down on a home if you can -- both to avoid private mortgage insurance and to reduce the chances of owing more than your house is worth -- putting down more or paying off your loan early may not pay off for you in the end.

A historic opportunity to potentially save thousands on your mortgage

Chances are interest rates won't stay put at multi-decade lows for much longer. That's why taking action today is crucial whether you're wanting to refinance and cut your mortgage payment or you're ready to pull the trigger on a new home purchase.

Our expert recommends this company to find a low rate - and in fact he used them himself to refi (twice!).

March Madness isn’t just for college basketball fans. That phrase is also an apt description of the volatility on Wall Street and this March is no different.

Just look at what stocks have done so far this month. It began with worries about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the spike in oil and gas prices. The Dow plunged nearly 800 points on March 7 as energy prices surged.

And if that weren’t enough the market was girding itself for the Federal Reserve’s first rate hike since late 2018. The Dow was down nearly 4% for the month as of March 8.

It has since come roaring back and is now up 2.5% in March. The S&P 500 has risen 2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has gained 1%. At one point this month the index plummeted as much as 9%.

March has often been a dramatic month for stocks. The dot-com boom of the late 1990s ended in March 2000 when the Nasdaq peaked and subsequently crashed more than 10% that month.

And just two years ago stocks plunged in March after the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak in America ground the US economy to a halt.

Hopeful signs despite awful start to the month?

The Great Recession (aka the 2008 Global Financial Crisis) peaked in March 2009. Stocks bottomed that month after a nearly 60% decline from a high in October 2007 putting an end to a brutal bear market.

If you have the stomach for it you can do reasonably well in March. According to data from Yardeni Research which looked into returns dating back to 1928 the S&P 500 on average rises 0.5% in the month. Stocks have gone up 57 times in March during that time frame and have fallen 37 times.

LPL Financial chief market strategist Ryan Detrick looked back at how the S&P 500 fared in the 17 times since 1957 when the market fell in January and February and found that stocks usually rebound. The S&P 500 rose by an average of 1.1% in March of those years and wound up with a nearly 4% gain over the final 10 months following the drops in January and February.

“Seeing the first two months of a new year in the red isn’t a great feeling but the good news is lately it hasn’t been a major warning sign” Detrick said in a report.

Soothing comments from Fed chair Jerome Powell about the economy after the Fed’s rate hike Wednesday could also be good news for stocks for the rest of March.

“There has been no doubt that it has been a rocky start to the year” said Angelo Kourkafas investment strategist with Edward Jones. “Powell struck a positive note about the strength of the economy and the market’s ability to withstand rate hikes.”",,,

The global success of Turkish television series — often with government-pleasing narratives — has made the country a small-screen superpower.

But “The Club” and its sumptuous recreation of 1950s Istanbul is a first not least because some of the dialogue is in Ladino the language of Istanbul’s Jews which derives from medieval Spanish.

While minorities once flourished in the cosmopolitan capital of the Ottoman Empire they suffered persecution as it fell and discrimination ever since.

Jews have generally kept their heads down to protect themselves sticking to the Turkish Jewish custom of “kayades” meaning “silence” in Ladino.

But “The Club” — which is set around a nightclub in Istanbul’s historic European quarter — puts an end to that silence.

Pogrom against minorities

The attacks and persecution that drove many Jews Greeks and Armenians to leave Turkey in the 20th century are dealt with including a crippling 1942 tax on non-Muslims and a pogrom against Greeks in 1955 which also unleashed violence against all the other minorities.

“Silence has neither protected us from antisemitism nor prevented migration to other countries” said Nesi Altaras editor of Avlaremoz online magazine run by young Turkish Jews.

“We need to talk including on political issues that previous generations wanted to avoid” he told AFP.

Less than 15000 Jews remain in Turkey down from 200000 at the beginning of the 20th century. The majority are Sephardic whose ancestors fled to the Ottoman Empire after they were expelled from Spain in 1492.

In a rare case of life imitating art “The Club” became Netflix’s number one show in Turkey just as Ankara tried to repair ties with Israel.

While both countries have been historically close relations soured badly over Turkish criticisms of Israeli policy towards the Palestinians and remarks by the Turkish president seen as antisemitic.

Indeed until recently Turkish pro-government dailies regularly published stories seen to be antisemitic.

But ties between the two sides have thawed in recent years as Turkey has sought a rapprochement with its rivals across the region.

President Isaac Herzog made a landmark visit to Turkey earlier this month — the first by an Israeli head of state since 2008 — where he held talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Herzog even visited the Istanbul district in which “The Club” is set.

Fierce debate

The show — and particularly the scenes of the pogroms on Istanbul’s Istiklal Avenue in September 1955 when mobs lynched minorities and ransacked their shops — has also sparked a fierce debate in the Turkish media and online about the need to confront history.

“No other TV show featured the antisemitic incidents of this period in such a remarkable way” said Silvyo Ovadya president of the Jewish Museum of Turkey.

“We don’t teach this part of history in schools in Turkey. Many Turks have learnt it thanks to the series” Altaras said.

“The series invites us to question the official narrative and ask ourselves ‘What happened to the Jews of Turkey?'” said Pinar Kilavuz a researcher on Sephardic Jews at Paris-Sorbonne University.

Altaras believes the series has influenced domestic Turkish politics.

“It is no coincidence that the leader of the main opposition party has just included ‘healing the wounds of the past’ in his campaign referring to the attacks against minorities” he said.

‘We’re part of this country’

For Izzet Bana a musician and an advisor to the series the show accomplished a “miracle” by recreating the Jewish quarter of his childhood.

“I was worried at first because other shows caricatured Jews. But the series reflects real characters far from cliches” Bana said.

Despite this progress on screen Kilavuz said more needs to be done for Turkey’s Jews to feel equal.

“There is a myth about the Ottoman Empire welcoming Jews expelled from Spain in the 15th century” she said.

“It is used to stigmatize anyone asking for equal rights as showing ingratitude” she argued.

Even if everyone is considered equal before the law in Turkey in practice non-Muslim minorities face huge obstacles from getting government jobs to opening or repairing churches or synagogues.

It is also rare to find a senior minority figure in government or in state institutions where Sunni Turkish Muslims still dominate.

For Altaras the series which is due to come back with a third season shows Turkish society that Jews were part of “the story of this country.”

“We already knew that but it’s good that the Turks realize it too.”

(WCAX) - Nearly a year after it debuted on Netflix a docuseries featuring the love story of two Vermont farmers has won an international award.

Ginger and David Isham of the 11-generation Isham Family Farm in Williston are one of six senior couples from around the globe who share an intimate portrait of their lives together in a six-part series called “My Love: Six Stories of True Love.”

On March 4 the show took home the prestigious title of Best Episodic Series from the 2022 International Documentary Association’s (IDA) Documentary Awards.

The Ishams now 82 and 87 years old say they’re still getting used to their newfound fame.

“Walking into the library or walking into someplace at like the dentist and the doctor’s office and somebody says ‘Oh the stars are here.’ We’re going to live with this the rest of our lives and it’s been very exciting to think that we’re just ordinary people and that we got to this spot the spotlight” Ginger Isham said. “Everybody loved it. It was very exciting. We were very overwhelmed.”

The Ishams say tourists who have watched the series have even stopped by the farm to meet and snap a picture with them and strangers from across the country have sent them supportive letters.

“I think our relationship has gotten much closer more loving since this film came out” Ginger said.

Read this article on the new Outside+ app available now on iOS devices for members! Download the app.

Tadej Pogačar’s UAE Team Emirates squad has explained why it turned the chance to be part of the all-new Tour de France docu-series set to air on Netflix citing logistical issues and a lukewarm need for added exposure at this point in time. The team has told VeloNews that the door remains open for 2023.

UAE Team Emirates was one of the original eight teams to be shortlisted for the project but it declined the invitation as reported by VeloNews.

To some the fact that the winner of the last two editions of the Tour de France would be missing from the series raised questions about the storylines and potential missing gaps in the eight-part project. However just as with the Formula 1 Drive to Survive series on Netflix not all of the top teams were involved in the inaugural season.

Andrea Agostini the team’s chief operating officer at UAE Team Emirates spoke to VeloNews and explained that while the project had momentum and obvious benefits for the broader cycling world and some specific teams it did not fit with UAE’s current position.

Logistics was one concern especially given the fact that Netflix film crews would follow the teams and go behind the scenes weeks in advance of the race during the grand tour and then again after the event.

“What I can say is that it’s a really good project. It could bring a lot of benefits to the cycling world but it throws up a lot of complications for us” Agostini told VeloNews.

“We agreed with our owners that this wasn’t a priority for us but maybe in the future if Netflix leaves the door open for us then we could jump in but at this moment it’s not our priority.

“It’s also a matter of logistics. To have a cameraman around you all the way through the Tour de France before the race too and when every team is already full. We have our own camera person photographer and media person so the space on the bus isn’t so big. Sometimes having people from outside it’s not so easy to manage. There’s no one particular reason so maybe next year.”

Agostini likened UAE’s stance to that of Mercedes and Ferrari after both Formula 1 teams decided not to be part of the first series of Drive to Survive. That stance changed at a later date but Agostini pointed to the fact that the Tour de France was stressful enough and that his current squad had a perfect balance internally. It was felt within the UAE team management — and ownership — that the risks outweigh the potential rewards at this point.

“It’s the same with Mercedes and Ferrari in Drive to Survive. We have a great balance right now with staff and riders and everyone is super happy and motivated. Sometimes introducing something new could be dangerous. We pay a lot of attention to things like this because we’re a perfect machine and the atmosphere is so good. Mauro gives us great direction and we all know our jobs.”

Agostini also pointed out that teams have different priorities when it comes to exposure and publicity. Jumbo-Visma EF Education-EasyPost Quick-Step Alpha Vinyl Groupama-FDJ Ineos Grenadiers Ag2r Citroën Alpecin-Fenix and Movistar are all set to feature in this year’s series but the majority of those squads have heavy commercial lead sponsorship deals whereas UAE Team Emirates is state-owned.

UAE Team Emirates also knows that the likely scenario is that Pogačar will be competing for the yellow jersey and that the attention the maillot jaune naturally brings from the world’s media off-sets the rewards from a streaming provider at this point in time.

“A lot of teams jump in because they need that kind of visibility” Agostini said.

“We honestly don’t need it. If we’re lucky enough to fight for victory at the Tour again we don’t need that visibility. I spoke to colleagues [ed. at other teams] a lot before we made a decision and they had the same doubts as me. There’s obviously nothing to hide but it’s really important to have that balance inside the team. Other teams said to me that they understand our position but they don’t have the visibility that we do. There are teams in the Tour de France who have not had the same exposure as us in the last two years and for them it’s really important.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNici5jb20vbmV0ZmxpeC1iZXN0LWRvY3VtZW50YXJpZXMtMjAyMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best Documentaries on Netflix,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNici5jb20vbmV0ZmxpeC1iZXN0LWRvY3VtZW50YXJpZXMtMjAyMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

While evaluating their portfolio of mines the Nevada Gold Mines team recently made the decision to look into the option of finding a buyer for Long Canyon.

“Although once permitted Long Canyon will continue as a low-cost producer with a long life Nevada Gold Mines is considering whether given its size and location the operation meets its investment criteria or it might fit better with a smaller operator that can give it the focus it needs to continue to produce and add value for all stakeholders” NGM said in a statement.

“During our annual review process at the end of last year the question around the Long Canyon fit with NGM’s tier one focus was raised and whether the team should test the market and see what interest there was in Long Canyon from the many junior companies that have recently acquired assets in Nevada.”

“We’ve got all the data and information being collated in a way that can be viewed by potential buyers” said Anita Percy head of growth and planning for Nevada Gold Mines.

“We will only proceed with a transaction if it makes sense for the business with favorable terms to our shareholders” NGM said. “Long Canyon has been a valuable and low-cost operation and there remains considerable opportunity for this asset to continue well into the future.”

Ramping down

Mining started six years ago at Long Canyon and NGM Executive Managing Director Greg Walker said it has been a good small open pit operation with high grades. It is all run-of-mine heap leach with no mill to crush the ore. Long Canyon has produced up to around 200000 ounces of gold a year and more recently as operations have ramped down it has been producing about 150000 ounces a year.

The original plan from Newmont was to have a phase 1 open pit operation and then move on to a phase 2 underground mine. As NGM reevaluated the mine they decided to have a phase 2 open pit operation a cutback with longer and deeper and extensions. NGM has been working on the permitting for this open pit phase 2. There is still the potential for a phase 3 underground mine where the ore body plunges deeper into the ground.

Long Canyon has employed up to around 250 people.

“Over the last six months we’ve been slowly reducing those numbers” Walker said. “People have been moving to our other operations as required. Right now there are about 90 people still left and most of those people have been offered roles within NGM at different operations.”

There are plenty of openings at NGM’s other mines for the people that have been leaving Long Canyon Walker said. NGM mines have positions for a total of around 7000 people and the company has been about 10% short of that goal as it continues to look for more people to work at the mines.

“We currently have over 700 vacancies” Walker said.

As Long Canyon ramps down about 15 to 20 people who were working at the mine have decided to leave Nevada Gold Mines Walker said. Some of these people live in Wendover and did not want to make the long commute to Nevada Gold Mines operations west of Carlin.

“If we sell the Long Canyon operation and a new buyer comes in and wants to retain any of those people they have an option to stay with the buyer. But they’ve been given opportunities and been given offers to stay with NGM” Walker said.

The mining operations at Long Canyon are scheduled to conclude around April. Residual production from the leach pads will continue into 2025 at least but the gold production numbers will fall into the tens of thousands of ounces by next year Walker said.

“Even if we retain the asset we would still phase down for a period of about 18 months while we got permitting completed and then we would ramp back up and be operating again” Walker said. “So any purchaser coming in would do the same thing. They would run through the permitting process and then they would start mining once they got the permit for the phase 2 expansion.”

Long Canyon history

Long Canyon was one of the five Newmont mines along with Carlin Phoenix Twin Creeks and Lone Tree which became part of Nevada Gold Mines when the new company started as a joint venture between Barrick and Newmont on July 1 2019. Newmont is the 38.5% owner of NGM and Barrick is the 61.5% owner and operator.

The Long Canyon site is unique in that it was the first significant gold discovery in an unexplored area of northern Nevada in quite a few years and it is a new mine in an area where there hasn’t been a mine before.

Fronteer Gold Inc. explored the Long Canyon site in the late 2000s. Fronteer was the 51 percent owner and operator of Long Canyon and in August 2010 Fronteer made a C$281 million deal with AuEx Ventures to become the 100 percent owner of the Long Canyon project.

Newmont acquired the Long Canyon project in Feb. 2011 in a $2.33 billion dollar deal with Fronteer.

“Newmont is able to recognize the characteristics of a large long-life deposit” Newmont spokesman Omar Jabara said at the time.

Newmont later described Long Canyon as “the most significant Carlin-type oxide gold discovery in Nevada in more than a decade.”

Mining officially started at Long Canyon on Jan. 4 2016. Commercial gold production began with the first gold pour in November of that year.

Dewatering plans

In the spring of 2020 NGM submitted an application to the Nevada Division of Water Resources to expand their phase 2 mining operations below the water table.

A coalition of conservation groups and the Confederated Tribes of the Goshute Reservation filed protests opposing NGM’s water application. They said the dewatering would have negative impacts on the Johnson Springs wetlands and groundwater and on wildlife in the area including a rare small spring snail and a minnow-like fish called relict dace which lives only in Johnson Springs.

In August 2020 NGM announced its decision to put the Bureau of Land Management’s review of the proposed Long Canyon expansion on hold.

“The formation of the NGM joint venture between Barrick and Newmont Corporation in July of 2019 created an opportunity to challenge assumptions and apply new perspectives to projects including evaluation against the company’s environmental and sustainability values” NGM said in a statement at the time. “This analysis resulted in the decision to delay the permitting process to re-evaluate aspects of the project and engage in additional studies and designs to reduce the expected impacts. This work will be focused on water management and mitigating potential impacts to the aquifer and the nearby Johnson Springs Wetland Complex.”

“By the company acting in this way they’re acknowledging that something more needs to be done to try to protect the environment there and that’s important” Great Basin Resource Watch Executive Director John Hadder said.

“The original plan that Newmont had for that asset was to do a general dewatering of the area” Walker said in a recent interview.

He said the NGM team and their hydrogeologists did more studies of the area and decided to look at ways to do localized dewatering which would reduce the costs of the dewatering and the rehabilitation and would also shorten the timeframe for the rehabilitation.

“We thought there was a different way we could do it and a better way we could do it” Walker said. “And we were correct. Our plan has improved so our dewatering is more localized and our rehabilitation plan is shorter and more focused.”

If Long Canyon is sold NGM will pass along all the information they have gathered about the site and their dewatering plans.

The Long Canyon mine is surrounded by the Big Springs Ranch which is owned by NGM. The Big Springs Ranch is leased to a rancher.

Whether or not the Big Springs Ranch will sell with the mine is a discussion that will be had with potential buyers.

“Having one owner for the ranch and the mine in my opinion is the best option” Walker said.

Finding the right buyer

Walker said NGM will vet any potential buyers to make sure they have the right values on safety environmental social and governance issues.

“On the ESG side of it we will make sure any potential buyer aligns with our same values” Walker said. “What we don’t want to do is sell an asset and then have somebody do the wrong thing and then we get tarnished with that same brush. So once we’ve got down to a short list of people that we are okay to be potential purchasers we’ll give them access to the data and the information on the mine.”

Having the Long Canyon mine in eastern Elko County has gotten NGM involved in the communities in that area like Wells and Wendover. Once Long Canyon sells NGM will have less involvement with these communities but Walker said they will make sure the company that purchases Long Canyon is committed to community involvement. NGM will also recommend the new company carries on the contracts and agreements which the mine currently has in place.

While operating the Long Canyon mine NGM developed a relationship with the Confederated Tribes of the Goshute Reservation Walker said and that relationship will continue along with all of the relationships which NGM has with Native Americans tribes throughout the region. The Goshute Reservation will continue to participate in programs like the Western Shoshone Scholarship Foundation along with having the additional opportunity to participate in any programs offered by the new owner of the Long Canyon mine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2doYW5hLmNvbS5naC9uZXdtb250LWZvdW5kYXRpb24tcHJvdmlkZXMtc3RhcnQtdXAta2l0cy10by03NS1hcHByZW50aWNlcy_SAVVodHRwczovL25ld3NnaGFuYS5jb20uZ2gvbmV3bW9udC1mb3VuZGF0aW9uLXByb3ZpZGVzLXN0YXJ0LXVwLWtpdHMtdG8tNzUtYXBwcmVudGljZXMv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Newmont Foundation Provides Start-up Kits To 75 Apprentices,"The Newmont Akyem Development Foundation has provided start-up kits to 75 apprentices at New Abirem in the Eastern Region to enable them to practice their trade and employ others.

The items worth 65000 Ghana cedis included sewing machines and accessories dummies towels hammers chopping boards measuring scales rolling pins and baking tins.

This is part of efforts by the Foundation under its ASSIST Programme to create employment for the youth within its catchment communities.

As a result the youth have received training in auto electrical tailoring hairdressing fabrication masonry carpentry and plumbing.

As they learned their various trades the apprentices also received a monthly allowance of 150 Ghana for three years.

Mr Paul Apenu the Executive Secretary of NAKDeF at a ceremony to present the items to the beneficiaries said the Foundation allocated 74800 Ghana cedis to the master craftsmen through the ASSIST Programme to enable them to give of their best in training the apprentices.

He stated that since its inception in 2017 the programme had trained more than a thousand youth in various trades to help reduce unemployment in their catchment areas.

Aside from apprenticeship training Mr Apenu said many beneficiaries were sent to Asankare in the Ashanti Region to be trained to meet Newmont’s standards and that some had put what they were taught into practice creating employment for themselves and others.

Mr Apenu said the programme was made possible through the assistance of the Sustainable Development Committee a group formed to plan the Foundation’s operations and development to ensure that communities benefited from the activities of Newmont’s Akyem Mines.

Citing the success stories of countries like Malaysia Singapore and South Korea with whom Ghana began its independence journey he observed that Ghana could only attain a global giant status with deliberate and heavy investment in TVET the area for the development of skills needed for a modern economy.

Consequently he said government had adopted a strategy to expand technical and vocational opportunities at both secondary and tertiary levels to strengthen the linkages between education and industry and empower the youth to deploy their skills and employ themselves and others.

“This is the reason why government has placed such importance on guaranteeing access to a minimum of Senior High School education for all Ghanaian children and is laying emphasis in particular on technical and vocational training as a major pillar for development” he added.

The President was speaking at the 92nd speech day durbar of the St Augustine’s College in Cape Coast on Saturday under the theme: “Redefining Education Delivery in Technological Aid: The Role of St Augustine’s College.”

The event was marked by the commissioning the school’s renovated and expanded computer laboratory by the President donated by alumni of the school.

He indicated that concrete efforts were underway to disabuse misconceptions that technical and vocational education was inferior and only patronised by financially or intellectually less endowed students.

Among other measures President Akufo-Addo averred that government had officially rolled out a ‘Free TVET For All’ programme in addition to its Free Senior High School (SHS) policy which had catered for some 1.6 million students since inception.

He added that the Ministry of Education was currently undertaking cutting-edge policies to achieve it object of 60:40 Science-Humanities ratio enrolment in secondary schools for its transformation agenda.

“The construction of eight model Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) high schools and 20 STEM Centres across the country are at various stages of completion together with the construction of Accra STEM Academy are some of the pragmatic steps the government is taking to promote the advancement of science and technology education in Ghana” he explained.

The President further announced that government’s goal of furthering and facilitating the use of technology in the promotion of education in the country was on course.

“While government does its utmost best to ensure that it provides the requisite tools and environment for learning especially of the model science heads of schools must supervise teaching and learning check absenteeism of the teachers and students and develop any effective strategies to monitor the activities of the school” he charged.

He also admonished teachers to bear in mind that they were role models to the students and must therefore project excellence to the students.

Addressing the students he urged them to learn hard imbibe the values of honesty and integrity and refrain from acts that could jeopardize their prospects of a bright future.

“Parents and guardians too have the responsibility to advise their wards to exhibit good behaviour in school or wherever they may be. They are partners with the school in educating their children” he said.

Responding some requests earlier made by the school the President pledged government’s commitment to satisfy all “reasonable requests” including the demand for a new science equipment.

“And to commemorate this occasion I am taking as my personal responsibility to provide a new 60-seater school bus for the school” he pledged.

Mr Henry Arthur-Gyan the headmaster of the school while presenting a report on the school indicated that St Augustine’s with the exclusion of first year students had a student population of 1470 comprising 750 in form two and 720 in form three.

He added that the school had a staff strength of 123 regular teaching staff 12 temporary teaching staff and 78 non-teaching staff.

Touching on performance he announced that the school scored 99.36 per cent in the 2021 West Africa Secondary School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) describing the school as a pacesetter.

While expressing appreciation to the government and all other stakeholders Mr Arthur-Gyan highlighted some challenges of the school and called for immediate support.

A bigger bus musical instrument for the regimental band ceremonial dress for cadet renovation of teachers’ bungalows and laboratory equipment for robotic activities were among the challenges he outlined.

For his part Mr Alexander Afenyo-Markin the Member of Parliament for Effutu and an alumnus of the school recounted his difficult experience during his days in school as motivation to the students and urged them be determined in life.

He discouraged any thought of committing suicide or other self-harm owing to hardships stressing that they could make it through hard work.

“You can be the best businessman you want to be you can be the richest man you want to be you can the most respected politician you want to be you can be a good teacher and an excellent one for that matter. You have no excuse to disappoint yourself” he urged.",,,,,,

In 2018 Kohl’s was a bright spot in the beleaguered department store sector.

Sales were growing Kohl’s (KSS) stock price was booming and new CEO Michelle Gass was earning widespread praise for her creative approach including partnering with Amazon (AMZN) to offer free Amazon (AMZN) returns at Kohl’s (KSS) stores.

Out of the three largest US department store chains — Kohl’s Macy’s (M) and Nordstrom (JWN) — Kohl’s looked to be in the strongest position.

Not anymore. Kohl’s is in turmoil today.

The chain’s sales are lower than before the pandemic despite strong consumer spending and as its rivals enjoy big gains. Activist investors are circling Kohl’s and demanding leadership changes. A sale of the company could be on the horizon.

“We see a company that’s lost its way” said Jonathan Duskin managing partner at Macellum Advisors an activist investment firm that has become Kohl’s third largest shareholder.

Macellum and a group of activist investors took a stake in Kohl’s last year. The group reached a settlement with Kohl’s in April but Macellum has recently revived its effort to overhaul Kohl’s because of continued stock price weakness and market share losses.

Kohl’s “should be doing better than Macy’s not worse” Duskin said. “We see a lot of initiatives that sound okay but never really result in growth.”

In a statement a Kohl’s spokesperson blasted Macellum saying the firm was “using a misinformed shifting and hollow narrative” to push for changes that would not improve Kohl’s and result in “poorly qualified and inexperienced” board directors.

The spokesperson said Kohl’s has made “substantial progress in transforming our business and positioning the Company for long-term success.”

“We are already delivering results” the spokesperson added pointing to the company’s record earnings in 2021 operating profit margins reached two years ahead of schedule and an increase in the company’s quarterly dividend.

Kohl’s is attempting yet another makeover to turn things around but its success is far from guaranteed.

Fighting the tide

With more than 1100 US stores and around $19 billion in annual sales Kohl’s is the largest department store chain in the United States.

The department store sector has been in structural decline for years against pressure from Amazon growing big-box chains including Walmart (WMT)and Target (TGT) and discount clothing stores like TJMaxx. Companies such as Sears JCPenney Neiman Marcus Barney’s and others have filed for bankruptcy in recent years.

Department stores including Kohl’s have been undercut on prices by discount players from the bottom and prestige by luxury stores at the top said John Fisher a senior lecturer at Boston College’s Carroll School of Management and former CEO of Saucony running shoes.

“It’s hard to be unique” Fisher said. “I think Kohl’s is caught right now by death in the middle.”

Kohl’s has lost around 17% of its market share since 2011 primarily to off-price retailers such as TJMaxx as well as Amazon according to UBS.

“[F]orces like consumers’ migration to online and preference for value have contributed to this erosion” UBS analyst Jay Sole said in a recent report. “This will likely continue after the pandemic.”

Since Gass a former top deputy to Howard Schultz at Starbucks (SBUX) took over as Kohl’s CEO in 2018 the company has attempted a handful of approaches to draw customers and stave off competitors.

In addition to the returns partnership with Amazon Kohl’s expanded its athleisure clothing business with brands such as Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UA). Kohl’s also shrunk the size of a handful of stores and leased out the extra space to Aldi and Planet Fitness made a bigger play for Millennials with new brands such as PopSugar and more recently opened Sephora beauty stores inside Kohl’s.

These strategies have not led to major improvements. Kohl’s has improved its athleisure business and other areas but its women’s clothing business has slumped.

In 2018 sales inched up 0.7% from the prior year. In 2019 they dropped 1.2% before plunging 20% in 2020 due to store closures and Covid-19 restrictions.

Last year after stores reopened and shoppers refreshed their wardrobes sales bounced back 23% — but that was still below pre-pandemic levels.

Competition has become more cutthroat in the four years since Gass took over and “a lot of Kohl’s stores feel tired” said Neil Saunders managing director of retail at GlobalData. “It has been very easy for customers to switch away from Kohl’s to others offering something better.”

And brand partnerships with Amazon and Sephora do not address core issues he added. “Kohl’s needs to look to improving its own brand rather than relying on others to lift it.”

A sale looming?

Over the last few months activist investors have been pressing for changes at Kohl’s.

One firm Engine Capital urged Kohl’s to spin off its e-commerce business from its stores or find a buyer to take the company private. “Even the most patient long-term shareholders cannot be expected to endure the punishing underperformance and perpetual value disconnect seen at Kohl’s” Engine Capital said in December.

A month later Macellum Advisors said it would nominate a slate of new board members at Kohl’s because Kohl’s board and leadership “spent another year materially mismanaging the business.” Private equity firms also made buyout offers for Kohl’s which the company rejected.

To fight off pressure Kohl’s last week laid out plans for a “complete reinvention of our business model and our brand” at an investor day.

Kohl’s said it would add Sephora mini-shops to roughly 75% of its 1100 US stores open 100 new locations at half the size of its traditional outlets in the next four years and increase its popular Kohl’s Cash rewards program to 7.5% on purchases up from 5%. Kohl’s also unveiled new strategies to grow online including self-service for pickup orders and returns.

“We’re evolving our position from a department store to a more focused lifestyle concept centered around the active and casual lifestyle” Gass said in a presentation.

But to Duskin at Macellum Advisors the plan was “disappointing.”

He believes the strategy won’t meaningfully change how consumers see Kohl’s — and he says it’s time for a new board and possibly a new CEO. Kohl’s has not fully taken advantage of its stores being located away from traditional malls which are losing foot traffic he said and he questions whether the investment in Sephora is worth the cost.

Kohl’s said last week that it has engaged with more than 20 potential buyers for the company a sign of wide interest. Hudson’s Bay Co. the owner of Saks Fifth Avenue also is considering a bid Axios reported Wednesday.

Kohl’s board has an “ongoing dialogue with potential bidders” and will measure any offers against its own “compelling standalone plan” a spokesperson said.

Duskin expects Kohl’s to accept a buyout offer he said. “This company can easily be turned around.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NhbmRzZW50aW5lbC5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyLzAzL2NvbXBhbnktY2xvc2VzLWRlYWwtdG8tYnV5LW1lbW9yaWFsLWJyaWRnZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Company closes deal to buy Memorial Bridge | News Sports Jobs,"PARKERSBURG — The Memorial Bridge is now owned by a private company although the City of Parkersburg will continue to operate the toll bridge while a $50 million rehabilitation project is under way.

“I’m very pleased that we’ve come to this point” Mayor Tom Joyce said Friday a week after the sale to Parkersburg Bridge Partners officially closed. “It’s not the final stage.”

With the transfer of ownership the company has begun the rehabilitation project to extend the useful life of the 67-year-old bridge by at least 50 years. The span was closed to traffic for an estimated 45 days starting Tuesday. Parkersburg Bridge Partners representatives have said the closure will allow contractors to replace welds that connect the steel grid deck beneath the driving surface to the rest of the superstructure.

Once the bridge reopens traffic is expected to flow with at least one lane open as the project continues through October 2023.

With Kokosing Construction as the lead contractor the work will include a new paint and coating system complete deck removal and replacement replacement of the existing bridge parapet handrail steel superstructure repairs concrete pier and column repairs new LED roadway and decorative lighting and repaved and improved bridge roadway approaches.

As part of the sale agreement approved by Parkersburg City Council in May Parkersburg Bridge Partners a subsidiary of Colorado-based United Bridge Partners will pay the city $4 million and make no claim on approximately $11.8 million the city has allocated over the years for maintenance and the eventual demolition of the bridge.

“I look forward to working with City Council to figure out how to appropriate those funds” Joyce said adding that he hopes to use the money to make a significant tangible improvement to the quality of life for people in the city and region.

Joyce said the city will continue to pay the bridge toll workers during the closure and Parkersburg Bridge Partners will reimburse those funds. The city will operate the bridge during the rehabilitation work with the company providing reimbursements for the expenses.

Once the project is complete the bridge will move to a fully electronic tolling system and the price will rise to at least $1 for a single trip.

The primary detour while the Memorial Bridge is closed directs motorists to the Belpre Bridge in downtown Parkersburg. Police Chief Scott Elliott said officers are monitoring traffic downtown particularly during morning and evening commute times and there have been no major issues.

“It is busier obviously but it is flowing” Elliott said.

A representative for Parkersburg Bridge Partners said the company would have a statement on the closing of the sale next week.

Units in Surfers Paradise emerged as the property type most sought after by investors nationwide last month.

The Glitter Strip suburb famous for its high-rise lifestyle offered investors rental yield of 6.17 per cent. The median unit price for units there was $480000.

Southport was another popular pick for investors chalking up the fourth highest volume of inquiries per listing on www.realestate.com.au REA Group data shows.

The Gold Coast CBD suburb has a median unit price of $442600 and rental yield of 6.17 per cent.

With QLD’s current housing crisis pinned to record interstate migration and now residents displaced by flooding Ray White Surfers Paradise CEO Andrew Bell said low interest rates and higher rents made owning an investment property attractive at any buy-in.

“There is a huge demand from tenants so what has changed dramatically is most landlords have moved from a negative gearing situation to positive cashflow” Mr Bell said.

“My advice for investors is to buy with the dollars and cents in mind not with your heart. You are looking for buildings that give the best yield you don’t necessarily have to buy one that you’d want to live in yourself.

“There is strong demand for all sorts of property — you don’t have to pay premium prices” he said.

The investor sweetspot previously sat about $500000 with a rental yield of 5 per cent but many had been scared off as owner-occupiers became the dominant presence in markets ruled by a lack of supply and buyer FOMO over the last two years.

BuyersBuyers co-founder Pete Wargent said the investor buy-in had soared accordingly.

“For houses $750000 to $1.25 million is the new normal” Mr Wargent said.

“Unit prices have generally increased but less dramatically.”

Latest Ray White data shows investors remain purchase-shy with these buyers making up just 25 per cent of buyers from 406 auctions in January Australia-wide.

Investors showed best confidence in Brisbane accounting for 37 per cent of buyers at Ray White auctions in the QLD capital followed by the Gold Coast with 35 per cent.

Houses in Pimpama were another top choice for investors offering rental yield of 4.87 per cent. The northern suburb has one of the lowest median house prices on the Gold Coast at $572000 and ranked twelfth among suburbs with the highest number of inquiries in February.

First-time investor Mohamed Radwan could have upped the rent on the Pimpama property he purchased in May 2021 by more than $100 a week.

But buying in a renters’ haven meant he could opt instead for a modest increase keep the longterm tenant and still be confident of a strong return.

Mr Radwan a chartered accountant with MAR Advisory purchased a four-bedroom house in the suburb for $485000 from the original owner who had leased it to the same tenant since 2012 for $425 a week.

A rental appraisal showed similar properties were leased for $550 but Mr Radwan only increased the rent to $460 per week.

“This was still way under market return but for me because the tenant is loyal I preferred to have a good tenant and lower rent than a bad tenant with expensive rent” he said.

“The yield in Pimpama overall is good compared with other suburbs so even at $460 I had a good cashflow positive rental return compared to the purchase price especially with low interest rates.

“I was researching in other areas as well and the reason I chose Pimpama was that it was a well-developed area with many amenities like good soccer fields and access to the motorway and everything looks new in the suburb” he said.

Mr Radwan offers tax advice on property development and investment through a division of his firm.

Broadbeach units also ranked highly for units with a median price of $670000 and 4.87 per cent yield.

>>>>>>INVESTOR TOP TIPS<<<<<<

• Don’t buy with your heart. Be ruthless and put the same effort into due diligence for buying an investment property as you would making any business decision.

• Location is key. Remember you want the location and the affordability of the property to appeal to the rental market. Check out vacancy rates and typical rents.

• Buy land. Land in fast-growing areas is the safest and best-performing asset you can invest in. As the population grows so too will the value of your land.

• Make sure there is more than one industry contributing to the local economy. Don’t invest in one horse towns.

• Ensure there is future infrastructure spending which will improve amenities.

• Ensure there is solid future population growth.

Photo: News Corp Australia

JIM STYNES knew a thing or two about life.

The Irish-born footballer who played 264 games in the red and blue was as much of an inspiration off the field as he was on it.

His gutsy spirited performances were matched with a selfless caring and inspiring nature that away from football wanted only to see young people reach their full potential.

It was this vision that led Stynes to co-found the Reach Foundation – a not-for-profit designed to inspire Australian youth which now works with more than 30000 young people every year.

But his work was far-reaching. Stynes had an ability to impact many be it with a nod smile or small gesture.

For Melbourne captain Max Gawn it came in the form of belief.

What started as an appreciation for each other’s quirks quickly became a connection deeper than most and one that transcends Stynes’ tragic passing 10 years ago.

“When I think of what Jim taught me it’s two-fold” Gawn told Melbourne Media.

“As a player I’m lucky enough to wear one of the greatest Demons of all time’s numbers who was a ruckman and an innovator.

“The second part is what he taught me as a person.

“Football is crazy. We are young adults being courageous standing out on the arena and doing our best every week.

Jim reminded me that there’s a whole other life outside of that football field.

“Looking at that number – the No.11 – every time I go out there it just makes me realise that it’s a game of football. It’s just another game of football.

“Jim taught me that balance and values that I’m using now as a captain a husband a brother a son and a dad.”

Their unique bond saw them make many memories and while some were more challenging than others there was one that stands true for Gawn.

It was during a meeting at the club on a Wednesday. Team selection was traditionally announced on a Thursday but a dedicated Stynes wanted to be there to present the No.37 jumper – Stynes wore this number in his debut season – to the youngster he saw potential in.

01:17

“Jim could only make it down on a Wednesday because he had an operation on the Thursday and also wasn’t going to be at the game on the Friday” Gawn recalled.

“Jim came to the front; he had a jumper in his hand. I was sort of catching on because I had played a couple of good VFL games and every ruckman in our team was injured. I had a feeling it was going to be my time.

“When I saw him with the jumper in his hand and he started speaking about how his health was and how much of an effort he made to come down because he really wanted to see me play it was a pretty magical moment.

I was able to get my jumper off my idol and I was able to go and play.

“That’s easily the memory that sticks in my mind the most.”

Sunday marks a decade since the loss of one of the greatest players the game has ever seen.

Having never played AFL when he arrived in Australia as an 18-year-old Stynes went on to claim a Brownlow Medal four club Best and Fairest Awards and two All Australian selections while setting a record of 244 consecutive games.

He added to his incredible contribution as Club President during the late 2000s where he helped Melbourne navigate its way out of financial trouble.

Through all those proud to belong to both the Demons and Reach Stynes’ legacy is one that lives on and lives strong helping young people believe in themselves and get the most out of life.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxlc3RhdGUuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvaW52ZXN0b3ItYmFncy1wb3N0Zmxvb2QtYmFyZ2Fpbi1mb3ItMTAway1sZXNzLXRoYW4tYXNraW5nLXByaWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Investor bags post-flood bargain for $100k less than asking price - realestate.com.au,"JOHN Ruzgani had just signed a contract to buy a home in the Brisbane suburb of Rocklea when devastation struck.

A line showing how high the water rose can still be seen around the 70cm mark on the walls inside the three-bedroom house in Marshall Road.

But while many people would pull out the property investor saw an opportunity.

Despite the flood damage and the risk of it happening again Mr Ruzgani negotiated with the vendor to secure a sweet deal.

“They were asking for offers in the high $600000s when I first went to buy it” Mr Ruzgani said.

“After the floods I said; ‘How much now?’

“I started offering from $490000 and the owner accepted $500000.”

Mr Ruzgani had secured a loan pre-approval and is now waiting for the sale to be unconditional.

“A lot of people are already saying I’ve made a mistake” he said. “But it doesn’t really worry me.

“I think now is a good time to buy. I like the location very close to the city.”

“You can’t stop natural disasters. Flooding happened in high-profile suburbs like Bulimba and Auchenflower as well.”

This will be Mr Ruzgani’s fourth investment property and he is confident it will generate a strong rental income.

He plans to spend some money fixing damage done to the kitchen and bathroom and repainting the property.

“This is something I can handle without a big budget” Mr Ruzgani said. “I’d say it will cost around $20000 to fix.

“Otherwise it’s liveable. Maybe I’ll pay more insurance but in any business you have to take risks. At the end of the day people always forget.”

Nick Bowen of LJ Hooker who negotiated the sale said Mr Ruzgani ended up securing the property for $107000 less than the original contract.

“I think it’s a clever investment and rents have jumped so much” Mr Bowen said.

“Rocklea’s always been affordable in comparison to immediate surrounding suburbs that are flood-free so the yield for rent has always been better.

“I think now people will be getting a smidge of a discount (because of the floods) but I really think (the market) will bounce back quicker than in 2011 because the rest of the market is so active.”

PRD chief economist Dr Diaswati Mardiasmo said home buyers looking to nab a bargain might be hit with high flood insurance premiums.

“More often than not after a flood event buyers and investors become more aware of risks and thus hesitate to purchase in the area” Dr Mardiasmo said.

“This allows for buyers who have been hunting for a property for a period of time to enter the market with the knowledge that they may need to pay for a higher insurance premium.

“In a market where supply is low particularly in certain areas that would normally have high liveability — for example a desirable school catchment close to public transport plenty of green spaces and parks close to shops and amenities — the risk of flood damage can often be mitigated.”"

In 2018 sales inched up 0.7% from the prior year. In 2019 they dropped 1.2% before plunging 20% in 2020 due to store closures and Covid-19 restrictions.

Last year after stores reopened and shoppers refreshed their wardrobes sales bounced back 23% — but that was still below pre-pandemic levels.

Competition has become more cutthroat in the four years since Gass took over and “a lot of Kohl’s stores feel tired” said Neil Saunders managing director of retail at GlobalData. “It has been very easy for customers to switch away from Kohl’s to others offering something better.”

And brand partnerships with Amazon and Sephora do not address core issues he added. “Kohl’s needs to look to improving its own brand rather than relying on others to lift it.”

A sale looming?

Over the last few months activist investors have been pressing for changes at Kohl’s.

One firm Engine Capital urged Kohl’s to spin off its e-commerce business from its stores or find a buyer to take the company private. “Even the most patient long-term shareholders cannot be expected to endure the punishing underperformance and perpetual value disconnect seen at Kohl’s” Engine Capital said in December.

A month later Macellum Advisors said it would nominate a slate of new board members at Kohl’s because Kohl’s board and leadership “spent another year materially mismanaging the business.” Private equity firms also made buyout offers for Kohl’s which the company rejected.

To fight off pressure Kohl’s last week laid out plans for a “complete reinvention of our business model and our brand” at an investor day.

Kohl’s said it would add Sephora mini-shops to roughly 75% of its 1100 US stores open 100 new locations at half the size of its traditional outlets in the next four years and increase its popular Kohl’s Cash rewards program to 7.5% on purchases up from 5%. Kohl’s also unveiled new strategies to grow online including self-service for pickup orders and returns.

“We’re evolving our position from a department store to a more focused lifestyle concept centered around the active and casual lifestyle” Gass said in a presentation.

But to Duskin at Macellum Advisors the plan was “disappointing.”

He believes the strategy won’t meaningfully change how consumers see Kohl’s — and he says it’s time for a new board and possibly a new CEO. Kohl’s has not fully taken advantage of its stores being located away from traditional malls which are losing foot traffic he said and he questions whether the investment in Sephora is worth the cost.

Kohl’s said last week that it has engaged with more than 20 potential buyers for the company a sign of wide interest. Hudson’s Bay Co. the owner of Saks Fifth Avenue also is considering a bid Axios reported Wednesday.

Kohl’s board has an “ongoing dialogue with potential bidders” and will measure any offers against its own “compelling standalone plan” a spokesperson said.

Duskin expects Kohl’s to accept a buyout offer he said. “This company can easily be turned around.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NhbmRzZW50aW5lbC5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyLzAzL2NvbXBhbnktY2xvc2VzLWRlYWwtdG8tYnV5LW1lbW9yaWFsLWJyaWRnZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Company closes deal to buy Memorial Bridge | News Sports Jobs,"PARKERSBURG — The Memorial Bridge is now owned by a private company although the City of Parkersburg will continue to operate the toll bridge while a $50 million rehabilitation project is under way.

“I’m very pleased that we’ve come to this point” Mayor Tom Joyce said Friday a week after the sale to Parkersburg Bridge Partners officially closed. “It’s not the final stage.”

With the transfer of ownership the company has begun the rehabilitation project to extend the useful life of the 67-year-old bridge by at least 50 years. The span was closed to traffic for an estimated 45 days starting Tuesday. Parkersburg Bridge Partners representatives have said the closure will allow contractors to replace welds that connect the steel grid deck beneath the driving surface to the rest of the superstructure.

Once the bridge reopens traffic is expected to flow with at least one lane open as the project continues through October 2023.

With Kokosing Construction as the lead contractor the work will include a new paint and coating system complete deck removal and replacement replacement of the existing bridge parapet handrail steel superstructure repairs concrete pier and column repairs new LED roadway and decorative lighting and repaved and improved bridge roadway approaches.

As part of the sale agreement approved by Parkersburg City Council in May Parkersburg Bridge Partners a subsidiary of Colorado-based United Bridge Partners will pay the city $4 million and make no claim on approximately $11.8 million the city has allocated over the years for maintenance and the eventual demolition of the bridge.

“I look forward to working with City Council to figure out how to appropriate those funds” Joyce said adding that he hopes to use the money to make a significant tangible improvement to the quality of life for people in the city and region.

Joyce said the city will continue to pay the bridge toll workers during the closure and Parkersburg Bridge Partners will reimburse those funds. The city will operate the bridge during the rehabilitation work with the company providing reimbursements for the expenses.

Once the project is complete the bridge will move to a fully electronic tolling system and the price will rise to at least $1 for a single trip.

The primary detour while the Memorial Bridge is closed directs motorists to the Belpre Bridge in downtown Parkersburg. Police Chief Scott Elliott said officers are monitoring traffic downtown particularly during morning and evening commute times and there have been no major issues.

“It is busier obviously but it is flowing” Elliott said.

A representative for Parkersburg Bridge Partners said the company would have a statement on the closing of the sale next week.

Units in Surfers Paradise emerged as the property type most sought after by investors nationwide last month.

The Glitter Strip suburb famous for its high-rise lifestyle offered investors rental yield of 6.17 per cent. The median unit price for units there was $480000.

Southport was another popular pick for investors chalking up the fourth highest volume of inquiries per listing on www.realestate.com.au REA Group data shows.

The Gold Coast CBD suburb has a median unit price of $442600 and rental yield of 6.17 per cent.

With QLD’s current housing crisis pinned to record interstate migration and now residents displaced by flooding Ray White Surfers Paradise CEO Andrew Bell said low interest rates and higher rents made owning an investment property attractive at any buy-in.

“There is a huge demand from tenants so what has changed dramatically is most landlords have moved from a negative gearing situation to positive cashflow” Mr Bell said.

“My advice for investors is to buy with the dollars and cents in mind not with your heart. You are looking for buildings that give the best yield you don’t necessarily have to buy one that you’d want to live in yourself.

“There is strong demand for all sorts of property — you don’t have to pay premium prices” he said.

The investor sweetspot previously sat about $500000 with a rental yield of 5 per cent but many had been scared off as owner-occupiers became the dominant presence in markets ruled by a lack of supply and buyer FOMO over the last two years.

BuyersBuyers co-founder Pete Wargent said the investor buy-in had soared accordingly.

“For houses $750000 to $1.25 million is the new normal” Mr Wargent said.

“Unit prices have generally increased but less dramatically.”

Latest Ray White data shows investors remain purchase-shy with these buyers making up just 25 per cent of buyers from 406 auctions in January Australia-wide.

Investors showed best confidence in Brisbane accounting for 37 per cent of buyers at Ray White auctions in the QLD capital followed by the Gold Coast with 35 per cent.

Houses in Pimpama were another top choice for investors offering rental yield of 4.87 per cent. The northern suburb has one of the lowest median house prices on the Gold Coast at $572000 and ranked twelfth among suburbs with the highest number of inquiries in February.

First-time investor Mohamed Radwan could have upped the rent on the Pimpama property he purchased in May 2021 by more than $100 a week.

But buying in a renters’ haven meant he could opt instead for a modest increase keep the longterm tenant and still be confident of a strong return.

Mr Radwan a chartered accountant with MAR Advisory purchased a four-bedroom house in the suburb for $485000 from the original owner who had leased it to the same tenant since 2012 for $425 a week.

A rental appraisal showed similar properties were leased for $550 but Mr Radwan only increased the rent to $460 per week.

“This was still way under market return but for me because the tenant is loyal I preferred to have a good tenant and lower rent than a bad tenant with expensive rent” he said.

“The yield in Pimpama overall is good compared with other suburbs so even at $460 I had a good cashflow positive rental return compared to the purchase price especially with low interest rates.

“I was researching in other areas as well and the reason I chose Pimpama was that it was a well-developed area with many amenities like good soccer fields and access to the motorway and everything looks new in the suburb” he said.

Mr Radwan offers tax advice on property development and investment through a division of his firm.

Broadbeach units also ranked highly for units with a median price of $670000 and 4.87 per cent yield.

>>>>>>INVESTOR TOP TIPS<<<<<<

• Don’t buy with your heart. Be ruthless and put the same effort into due diligence for buying an investment property as you would making any business decision.

• Location is key. Remember you want the location and the affordability of the property to appeal to the rental market. Check out vacancy rates and typical rents.

• Buy land. Land in fast-growing areas is the safest and best-performing asset you can invest in. As the population grows so too will the value of your land.

• Make sure there is more than one industry contributing to the local economy. Don’t invest in one horse towns.

• Ensure there is future infrastructure spending which will improve amenities.

• Ensure there is solid future population growth.

Photo: News Corp Australia

JIM STYNES knew a thing or two about life.

The Irish-born footballer who played 264 games in the red and blue was as much of an inspiration off the field as he was on it.

His gutsy spirited performances were matched with a selfless caring and inspiring nature that away from football wanted only to see young people reach their full potential.

It was this vision that led Stynes to co-found the Reach Foundation – a not-for-profit designed to inspire Australian youth which now works with more than 30000 young people every year.

But his work was far-reaching. Stynes had an ability to impact many be it with a nod smile or small gesture.

For Melbourne captain Max Gawn it came in the form of belief.

What started as an appreciation for each other’s quirks quickly became a connection deeper than most and one that transcends Stynes’ tragic passing 10 years ago.

“When I think of what Jim taught me it’s two-fold” Gawn told Melbourne Media.

“As a player I’m lucky enough to wear one of the greatest Demons of all time’s numbers who was a ruckman and an innovator.

“The second part is what he taught me as a person.

“Football is crazy. We are young adults being courageous standing out on the arena and doing our best every week.

Jim reminded me that there’s a whole other life outside of that football field.

“Looking at that number – the No.11 – every time I go out there it just makes me realise that it’s a game of football. It’s just another game of football.

“Jim taught me that balance and values that I’m using now as a captain a husband a brother a son and a dad.”

Their unique bond saw them make many memories and while some were more challenging than others there was one that stands true for Gawn.

It was during a meeting at the club on a Wednesday. Team selection was traditionally announced on a Thursday but a dedicated Stynes wanted to be there to present the No.37 jumper – Stynes wore this number in his debut season – to the youngster he saw potential in.

01:17

“Jim could only make it down on a Wednesday because he had an operation on the Thursday and also wasn’t going to be at the game on the Friday” Gawn recalled.

“Jim came to the front; he had a jumper in his hand. I was sort of catching on because I had played a couple of good VFL games and every ruckman in our team was injured. I had a feeling it was going to be my time.

“When I saw him with the jumper in his hand and he started speaking about how his health was and how much of an effort he made to come down because he really wanted to see me play it was a pretty magical moment.

I was able to get my jumper off my idol and I was able to go and play.

“That’s easily the memory that sticks in my mind the most.”

Sunday marks a decade since the loss of one of the greatest players the game has ever seen.

Having never played AFL when he arrived in Australia as an 18-year-old Stynes went on to claim a Brownlow Medal four club Best and Fairest Awards and two All Australian selections while setting a record of 244 consecutive games.

He added to his incredible contribution as Club President during the late 2000s where he helped Melbourne navigate its way out of financial trouble.

Through all those proud to belong to both the Demons and Reach Stynes’ legacy is one that lives on and lives strong helping young people believe in themselves and get the most out of life.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxlc3RhdGUuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvaW52ZXN0b3ItYmFncy1wb3N0Zmxvb2QtYmFyZ2Fpbi1mb3ItMTAway1sZXNzLXRoYW4tYXNraW5nLXByaWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Investor bags post-flood bargain for $100k less than asking price - realestate.com.au,"JOHN Ruzgani had just signed a contract to buy a home in the Brisbane suburb of Rocklea when devastation struck.

A line showing how high the water rose can still be seen around the 70cm mark on the walls inside the three-bedroom house in Marshall Road.

But while many people would pull out the property investor saw an opportunity.

Despite the flood damage and the risk of it happening again Mr Ruzgani negotiated with the vendor to secure a sweet deal.

“They were asking for offers in the high $600000s when I first went to buy it” Mr Ruzgani said.

“After the floods I said; ‘How much now?’

“I started offering from $490000 and the owner accepted $500000.”

Mr Ruzgani had secured a loan pre-approval and is now waiting for the sale to be unconditional.

“A lot of people are already saying I’ve made a mistake” he said. “But it doesn’t really worry me.

“I think now is a good time to buy. I like the location very close to the city.”

“You can’t stop natural disasters. Flooding happened in high-profile suburbs like Bulimba and Auchenflower as well.”

This will be Mr Ruzgani’s fourth investment property and he is confident it will generate a strong rental income.

He plans to spend some money fixing damage done to the kitchen and bathroom and repainting the property.

“This is something I can handle without a big budget” Mr Ruzgani said. “I’d say it will cost around $20000 to fix.

“Otherwise it’s liveable. Maybe I’ll pay more insurance but in any business you have to take risks. At the end of the day people always forget.”

Nick Bowen of LJ Hooker who negotiated the sale said Mr Ruzgani ended up securing the property for $107000 less than the original contract.

“I think it’s a clever investment and rents have jumped so much” Mr Bowen said.

“Rocklea’s always been affordable in comparison to immediate surrounding suburbs that are flood-free so the yield for rent has always been better.

“I think now people will be getting a smidge of a discount (because of the floods) but I really think (the market) will bounce back quicker than in 2011 because the rest of the market is so active.”

PRD chief economist Dr Diaswati Mardiasmo said home buyers looking to nab a bargain might be hit with high flood insurance premiums.

“More often than not after a flood event buyers and investors become more aware of risks and thus hesitate to purchase in the area” Dr Mardiasmo said.

“This allows for buyers who have been hunting for a property for a period of time to enter the market with the knowledge that they may need to pay for a higher insurance premium.

“In a market where supply is low particularly in certain areas that would normally have high liveability — for example a desirable school catchment close to public transport plenty of green spaces and parks close to shops and amenities — the risk of flood damage can often be mitigated.”"

The comeback of these colorways will be made just in time for the summer season.

The Air Kukini shoes made their debut with Nike in 2000 as part of an Alpha Project featuring designs by Sean McDowell. The kicks caused a storm when they were first released due to their unorthodox looks and an out-of-ordinary silhouette which had intricate details across its uppers.

More about the upcomin Nike Air Kukini Iterations

The Nike Air Kukini is a cult bratz classic shoe which is famous for its distruptive designs which tune out even the unorthodox Air Tuned Max silhouettes. The silhouette was originally released in 2000 then Retro'd again in 2012 but failed to catch the attention of fans and faded into obscurity.

The silhouette was way ahead of time and that could have concluded with its comeback in 2020 with Stussy's interpretation of the model with a Spiridon 2 bottom creating waves and being appreciated by fans. In the latest news Nike is releasing four new colorways for its highly-coveted Nike Air Kukini silhouettes.

The first makeover in the lineage for 2022 is in the summit white-aviator gray colorway. The shoe is covered in TPU cage uppers that are inspired by a tech imprint spyder.

The upper are in a colorway of the Mystic Navy printed in psychedelic patterns with translucent TPU cages all over. Mystic Navy hues contrast with Summit White accents which cover the toebox and heel overlays. As one heads south the midsoles are covered in white and built with exposed air units with Mystic Navy accents.

A release date hasn't been officially announced by Nike for this shoe but it will be launched in 2022 for a retail price of $135 USD on the official site nike.com and a few selected retailers.

The second on-the-way colorway for the Nike Air Kukini is a makeover dressed in leopard print. The tranquil aesthetic of the shoe is of the uppers covered in leopard print contrasted with black spots. The tongue heels and toebox are covered in black while warm-toned base colors are on full-display in between.

The TPU cage in this show is completely transparent with a see-through look. The colorway is priced at $135 and can be availed in a few months on nike.com and a few selected retailers.

The first colorway arrives in a neutral colorway with caramel colored uppers which is neutral-dominant with fixtures in militaristic khaki hues. TPU cages are in an orange-y coral accent blending together for lighter and darker shades of caramel. The orange hue can also be seen on the outsole paying homage to the iconic MA-1 jacket.

The second iteration is in a black and dark green colorway. With most of the uppers taking an olive green color and a darker shade of green/black mixture accenting the pair with TPU cages. The Air Max unit is visible in all black colorways with the toe tips in a dark olive green color."

A week after upsetting Orlando City SC for FC Cincinnati's first-ever win against that club FCC downed Inter Miami CF for the first time in five tries with a convincing 3-1 win Saturday before a crowd of 19365 at TQL Stadium.

The win saw FC Cincinnati improve to 2-2-0 and six points in the Eastern Conference as Brandon Vazquez starred once against for FCC.

Vazquez and left back Ronald Matarrita combined on all three of the club's goals.

After scoring two goals in the Orlando win Vazquez assisted on Matarrita's 19th-minute opener and produced another two-goal outing as he scored in the 24th and 82nd minutes respectively.

Vazquez also drew a foul that resulted in a penalty kick for Cincinnati in the 76th minute although the kick was taken unsuccessfully.

The missed penalty which was quickly followed up by Vazquez's second goal of the match was one of few blights in a comprehensive victory by FC Cincinnati.

""Very pleased with the performance of the group tonight. It was certainly nice to improve our performance from last week (against Orlando) but the same result was the message"" Noonan said. ""It was nice to reward these fans with a good performance and a good win.

""Very proud of the group tonight. I thought in a lot of ways they executed things that we worked on throughout the week in training and played in an aggressive way for 90-plus minutes.""

Making his first start since the Feb. 26 season opener against Austin FC Matarrita returned from injury to open the scoring at 1-0 off a feed from Vazquez.

Matarrita returned the favor to Vazquez by assisting on Vazquez's headed goal for 2-0.

“I think it's not about the one who scores or who made the assists you know? The most important thing is the team is the is the level that that we are trying to get to"" Matarrita said. ""I know that everyone in the team is working really hard to achieve a more wins more games. And we are trying to get it.”

Gonzalo Higuain scored for Inter Miami for 2-1 in the 30th minute but FCC was able to get to halftime with its lead intact.

After gashing FC Cincinnati during the three-game season series in 2021 with three goals and three assists Higuain largely went silent after his score which was his first of 2021.

""Everything that we're experiencing is a 'first"" Noonan said. ""So we get the 2-0 lead. We have a really strong start to the game and then we conceded the (penalty) so we lose momentum for a five-to-10 minute stretch. So how do we react to them being back in the game and us losing momentum? And I thought we closed the half out... in a professional way.

""And with our 'PK' we don't convert. How do we respond? And to be able to go and find a third goal and not concede another goal in the game – that was an important step for our group in managing moments when things aren't going well.""

Luciano Acosta FC Cincinnati's designated penalty taker missed well wide after what looked from a distance to be a conversation among FCC players regarding who would take the penalty.

Noonan said the penalty was Acosta's to take and that ""protocol is let's convert our PK's.""

But Vazquez backed up Acosta with the 82nd minute score.

Miami which remains winless in 2022 on an 0-3-1 record labored for threatening chances the rest of the match.

Cincinnati goalkeeper Alec Kann was forced into action but needed to only make one save to preserve Cincinnati's victory.

After Vazquez benefitted from assists from Acosta and Dominique Badji against Orlando he was quizzed afterward on how the partnership with Matarrita had materialized.

""All week in training me and Mata have been having this connection"" Vazquez said. ""Even going back to last season he's got a golden left foot so his crosses can't be better. He's putting them on a platter for me and I couldn't ask for anything better.""

By the end of Saturday's match Vazquez was the joint-leading scorer in Major League Soccer alongside Columbus Crew's Lucas Zelarayan. Some media members went as far as to prompt Vazquez on the subject of him potentially being called up for the U.S. men's national team.

As far as maintaining his current run of goal-scoring form which has seen him score seven times in the last nine matches dating back to last season Vazquez said he would continue on with his normal practice habits.

""I always want to work for me. I always want to keep improving"" Vazquez said. ""I've got that grind mentality. I've got to put in the extra work. I've got to do everything. I've got to use all the resources the club provides so I'm just gonna keep doing the same things I've been doing weekly and hopefully the results stay the same.""

Another 'first' for Noonan

A week after notching his first win as FC Cincinnati's head coach Noonan won at TQL Stadium for the first time.

It took just two tries for Noonan to secure a home victory – a marked improvement over 2021 when Jaap Stam needed 10 matches to christen TQL Stadium with a home win.

FC Cincinnati's current 2-2-0 record is the club's best start through four matches since 2019 when Alan Koch's side went 2-1-1 with victories against Portland Timbers New England Revolution plus a draw against Atlanta United.

Noonan isn't celebrating yet even as his side has surprised pundits and observers in some respects.

""We still have a long way to go. I'll continue to say that"" Noonan said. ""What you saw tonight were a lot of moments of what we want to become in terms of how we play forward how we can control the tempo with purpose how we defend as a unit and what it looks like when we're able to turn the ball over in good spots and turn those into moments where we're attacking with purpose. I think over the course of the 90 minutes you saw a lot of glimpses of what we want to be about.

""I was really pleased today with the consistency in how we played forward and looked to create so like you said there was an entertainment value but it's not just to entertain. It's to score goals to win games.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM21lbXBoaXMuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRpbmcvb2tsYWhvbWEtdGVlbi1zZWxscy1wcml6ZXdpbm5pbmctaG9nLWZvci0xNy01MDAvYXJ0aWNsZV83MjkwMmQ3YS1jM2ViLTU4YjEtYjYxYi1hZmM4NTk2ZTljZWMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oklahoma teen sells prizewinning hog for $17500 | Trending | fox13memphis.com,A man shot a would-be thief who was spotted trying to steal his car after he left it running in his driveway early Monday according to police and KIRO-TV.

In today’s corporate world maintaining a work-life balance is always a hot topic especially for women who bear children nurse them and are very often the primary caregivers of those children.

Many women have had to sacrifice their careers for their families or defer their career dreams to a time when the kids are older and a bit more independent. So it is noteworthy to see women who have not only balanced their careers and personal lives but have also excelled and got to the height of their careers while being fully involved in caring for their families.

Dupe Olusola the MD/CEO of Transcorp Hilton is one such woman. Described by Venture Africa as a “woman on the rise in business and a stickler for high standards” she is known for her administrative skills and her passion for women leadership both in business and in the corporate world.

She became the second female MD/CEO of Transcorp Hotels on 12th February 2020. Her work-life balance despite her many appointments and high administrative duties makes her a force and an inspiration for women who want to have it all.

NOC,Northrop Grumman,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNndnRyaWJ1bmUuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMTkvbm9ydGhyb3AtZ3J1bW1hbi1henVzYS10by1kZXZlbG9wLW1pc3Npb24tcGF5bG9hZHMtZm9yLWVhcmx5LXdhcm5pbmctbWlzc2lsZS1zeXN0ZW0v0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2d2dHJpYnVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy8xOS9ub3J0aHJvcC1ncnVtbWFuLWF6dXNhLXRvLWRldmVsb3AtbWlzc2lvbi1wYXlsb2Fkcy1mb3ItZWFybHktd2FybmluZy1taXNzaWxlLXN5c3RlbS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Northrop Grumman Azusa to develop mission payloads for early warning missile system,"Officials from Northrop Grumman are excited that the company will design and develop two mission payloads for early warning missile-detection for the U.S. government’s Space Force and the work will happen close to home.

The project — for the U.S. Space Force’s Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared Polar program (NGP) — will take place at Northrop Grumman in Azusa in conjunction with Ball Aerospace.

Northrop Grumman Redondo Beach is the prime contractor entrusted with taking the payloads integrating them onto a spacecraft and doing the mission architecture.

“NGP combines Northrop Grumman’s proven experience in missile warning and defense with Ball Aerospace’s expertise in optical sensors and mission data processing” said Sarah Willoughby vice president overhead persistent infrared and geospatial systems at Northrop Grumman.

“Our team’s solution for NGP will assure continuous coverage of the northern hemisphere – especially the critical Arctic region – to protect against incoming threats.”

Ball Aerospace — from Colorado — will provide the optics focal plane and sensor control electronics. Northrop Grumman Azusa will receive the hardware and integrate it with mission-processing electronics and flight software to build and deliver the missile warning mission payload.

The U.S. Space Force in May 2020 awarded Northrop Grumman a $2.37 billion contract for the first phase of the NGP program. The first satellite launch is expected in 2025.

The two satellites will operate in orbit and will include infrared sensors to detect and track ballistic and hypersonic missiles. They will also carry enhanced communications systems to transmit data to the ground so decision-makers can identify infrared heat signatures of incoming threats. They will also have resiliency features that minimize vulnerabilities to space and cyberattacks.

JP McCord is program director of NextGen OPIR. Based at Northrop Grumman Azusa he spoke in detail this week about the project.

“It’s not just for us. It’s a global missile warning system” he said. “What we’re talking about here is missile warning and missile defense. This is something that the Azusa campus has an extremely proud and long heritage in dating back to the late ’60s so six decades of activity in the missile-warning mission.

“So we’re very intimate with the mission and the importance of it. The NextGen OPIR payload is the next instantiation for the Space Force to continue that mission.”

Important indeed. McCord did not mince words in that regard.

“We’re very concerned about the new threats especially hyper glide vehicles in targets that could exploit going over the North Pole or the polar regions” he said. “And so what’s really exciting about the polar part of this mission is that it has a very unique capability to help plug that gap and watch over the poles so that we don’t get attacked from that area and really protect down.”

The current missile-warning system is called SBIRS (Space-Based Infrared System).

“And the Next Gen is the follow one to that” McCord said.

The U.S. Space Force gets its marching orders from the Department of Defense.

“The DOD has the Space Force the Space Force contracts with Northrop Grumman Redondo Beach and Northrop Grumman Redondo Beach has us Northrop Grumman Azusa as part of strategic force programs to provide the payload” McCord said.

McCord said the “study phase” has been ongoing for some 18 months.

“What we’ve been awarded is the actual production phase” he said. “We have already received authority to proceed on that. So that’s the exciting part; we’re in it now.”

In McCord’s mind the Azusa plant — with about 1000 employees — is just where the development of these payloads belongs.

“This is a really important step for Azusa in terms of our manufacturing and engineering base continuing that capability here that we’ve done like I said since the late 60s” he said.

This will create more jobs.

“Absolutely” McCord said. “And we’re really looking forward to that. It’s added jobs but it’s the opportunity for Azusa to stay current with the emerging technologies.

“We’ve got a really great base of engineering talent here in the San Gabriel Valley and I think it’s great to have another avenue to really utilize that talent base that’s here locally.”

This did not have to go through the Azusa City Council. But Mayor Robert Gonzales is happy to know that such an important project will take place in his city.

“My thoughts are what an honor and a privilege that something that is generated in our hometown is looking to save lives and prevent threats” he said. “That something in space is going to go ahead and do that for our country is just a privilege and an honor.

“I’m proud of Northrop I’m proud of the business community that has enabled us to get that award and put Azusa on the map to help with that.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMjQuY29tL25ld3MyNC9iaS1hcmNoaXZlL3NldmVyYWwtc291dGgtYWZyaWNhbnMtanVzdC1tYWRlLWhpc3RvcnktYXMtYmVpbmctcGFydC1vZi10aGUtZmlyc3Qtb2ZmLXBsYW5ldC1hcnQtZ2FsbGVyeS1tb29uLWdhbGxlcnktMjAyMi0z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Several South Africans just made history as being part of the first off-planet art gallery,"This article forms part of the archives of Business Insider South Africa which was published as a partnership between News24 and Insider Inc between 2018 and 2023.

In February the International Space Station received a one-of-a-kind payload – a small purple 'box' containing the first off-planet art gallery.

Inside were 64 artworks each about the size of thumbnail.

Among the artists were several South Africans that saw their art up in space for the first time.

Here's what their work looks like.

When the Northrop Grumman's NG-17 Cygnus spacecraft took off from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia United States to deliver a payload to the International Space Station (ISS) it carried something truly unique.

Among the equipment was a small purple container just about the size of a lunchbox carrying 64 artifacts each no bigger than one cubic centimetre. While the package may be small for a handful of South Africans as well as international artists it was a big deal cementing their place in space history as being part of the first off-planet art gallery.

The project called the Moon Gallery is all thanks to a specialised research module provided by Nanoracks a Texas-based space services company. Arranged in an eight-by-eight grid the works of art vary in material and format from 2D prints to 3D free-floating objects as well as one AR (augmented-reality) engraving.

For Johannesburg-born artist Marcus Neustetter it symbolised a decade's worth of work looking to the stars for inspiration.

""There was a moment when they were talking about the risks and the number of things that could go wrong… even once it was in orbit it was not yet guaranteed that it was going to meet the ISS. It was a great achievement to see it orbiting and then when it docked with ISS then suddenly it hit. It was amazing.""

His piece titled ""A Letter to SumbandilaSat"" is all about sending a message to what remains of South African micro-Earth observation satellite Sumbandila which launched in 2009 lost contact with Earth in 2011 and finally broke apart in the atmosphere in 2021

""Sumbandila was like a symbol of hope. South Africa sending up a satellite that provides perspective to counter the perspective that we're getting from Google as our own observation satellite. And then Sumbandila was hit by a solar flare and onboard computers were fried. Well that's what we think happened.""

On a piece of folded acrylic plastic Neustetter hand painted images taken by the satellite before it lost contact with Earth as well as etched a new message in morse code reading ""lead the way again""

""It's amazing to think there is something out there [in space] that I've drawn. I'm secretly hoping that whatever is left of Sumbandila will pass the ISS at some point and notice that there's a letter for her and someone will read it out to her so that I can create a new connection once again.""

If it was possible for the remains of Sumbandila to metaphorically read the message it would need to be fast. The Moon Gallery currently is floating around the ISS orbiting the Earth at around 28000 kilometres per hour.

There is more to the project than simply inspiring discussions. The astronauts intend to run tests on the materials to see how they behave in microgravity.

""The lessons we learn from this endeavour about containment material dynamics and enhanced imagery will help in the design of future experiments and in implementation of The Moon Gallery's ultimate goal to establish the first art gallery on the moon"" said Scott Rodriguez vice president of government programs at Nanoracks.

This could be even more surreal thanks to another group of South Africans including Neustetter taking part in the project.

A collaboration piece brought together by a team of artists called the Imaginary Futures submitted ""I Will BE…"" a collection of 23 abstract ""jigsaw"" pieces on a transparent acrylic paper finely cut with a laser.

The pieces will float freely in their 1cm cube constantly creating new sculptural forms.

""The collaboration is really beautiful because it's all of these different voices essentially ideas by this group of participants that's now collectively on the ISS"" says Neustetter.

The Imaginary Futures project was born in Bloemfontein from the idea of gathering stories and giving a voice to creatives. It started off in the form of an interactive planetarium show and eventually grew into an online immersive experience programme connecting unlikely collaborators and unearthing new narratives and speculations around our unknown future.

""My creativity floating into space it's like a dream come true it lights up my eyes like stars aligned with dreams and visions on the horizon. The art of the space I occupy"" says Wendy Menong.

""I guess whoever said the sky is the limit was wrong. My idea is in space"" says Reginald Milanzi.

""This is the most insanely epic imagining… Wow everyone a little bit of us all is orbiting this beautiful universe together"" says Aja Marneweck.

Russia has become the first nation to use its newest Kinzhal hypersonic missile in the Ukraine war while China continues to gather momentum in the technology.

Earlier a new report published claimed that the clouds of small particles in the sky dubbed “twenty-first-century flak” could contribute to the defense against hypersonic threats.

The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) a Washington DC-based think tank has released a white paper advocating that the US government should invest more money in hypersonic weapon defense capabilities and explore unique techniques to counter these emerging risks.

The authors of this report suggest that since most current ballistic missile defense systems are inadequate in countering hypersonic threats new methods are required that “should exploit hypersonic weapons’ unique vulnerabilities and employ new capabilities” to thwart them.

The concept is similar to what US strategic planners proposed during the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Nuclear charges were proposed at the time to be placed around places where US intercontinental ballistic missile silos were positioned. In the event of a nuclear exchange the explosives would detonate minutes before the Soviet nukes struck.

With hundreds of thousands of tonnes of radioactive dust in the air enemy reentry vehicles approaching at high speeds would be disabled by the particles allowing American missiles to be used in retaliation.

The modern-day version would employ the same notion of exposing a fast-moving weapon to a cloud of dust that it was not equipped to endure. “Absent heavy mitigation measures disruption of the hypersonic flow field could lead to progressive deterioration of performance or a mission kill if not outright catastrophic failure” the report said.

The particles will be designed to stay airborne in the thin upper layer of the atmosphere where hypersonic gliders move needing less precision in the countermeasure’s timing. The artificial dust could be metallic pyrotechnic or made of various materials and it could also be launched from a missile or an airborne platform.

“Given the higher speeds earlier in the flight of a hypersonic glider a ‘wall of dust’ would be more effective earlier rather than later in its flight” the report said.

Other options for dealing with hypersonic weapons such as gliders and cruise missiles were examined in the white paper. They included anything from positioning anti-missile capabilities in such a way that enemies would be forced to devise less favorable attack trajectories to unleashing intense microwaves to fry the missile’s electrical components and even attempting to destroy them with laser guns.

The CSIS report recalls many previous tests undertaken by the Space and Missile Systems Organization (now Space Systems Command) that found that when reentry vehicles were approaching at high speeds dust rain and other particles in the atmosphere eliminated large amounts of nose tip material. As a result of this concept adversaries may be forced to utilize more conservatively designed heavier or lower-performance hypersonic systems.

Directed Energy Weapons

The report also provides an overview of directed energy weapons (DEWs) examining how the two most common types lasers and high-powered microwaves may perform in the face of hypersonic weapons.

Compared to “dust defense” or traditional kinetic weapons DEWs have intrinsic benefits. One advantage according to the report is that energy-based systems have virtually unlimited munition and cost per shot can be quantified in cents rather than hundreds of thousands of dollars in some circumstances.

However the CSIS white paper advises that “even the hundred-kilowatt to megawatt-class powers expected of future laser systems may not be adequate for penetrating hypersonic thermal protection systems.”

Instead high-powered microwaves demonstrate more promises. HPM has been researched by both the Navy and the Air Force for a number of defensive purposes. These weapons work by sending out intense microwave bursts that can disrupt or destroy electronics within a vehicle or missile.

HPM systems have a shorter range than lasers thus they may still be used in conjunction with kinetic interceptors which can kill weapons if their guidance and control circuitry is disrupted by microwaves. Nonetheless these devices do not require the advanced targeting systems that lasers do and they are significantly less vulnerable to bad weather.

The CSIS report also mentions “modular payloads” which are interceptors or other platforms that combine numerous payload types into a single rocket system. A single rocket may carry directed energy weapons explosion fragmentation explosives particle “twenty-first-century flak” warheads kinetic interceptors and even extra sensors.

These multi-pronged payloads could provide a tiered system capable of engaging hypersonic threats at several points along their trajectories each with a different method.

America’s Concerns

Chinese and Russian hypersonic missile capabilities have become a key cause of concern for the US. Russia deploys the Avangard which it claims is a functional hypersonic glider. China is also said to have advanced prototypes of hypersonic missiles.

The EurAsian Times previously reported that CEOs from more than two dozen major military businesses were recently asked by US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to accelerate the development of hypersonic weapons. According to two CEOs who participated in the event Austin spoke about the matter in urgent terms portraying China as a threat in the sector.

Top officials from Lockheed Martin Raytheon Technologies Northrop Grumman Boeing Leidos Aerojet Rocketdyne BAE Systems L3Harris and about a half dozen other defense businesses were part of the meeting which was chaired by Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks. With the release of this new report these companies may be able to examine a new dimension of hypersonic missile defense.

That said the idea of “twenty-first-century flak” is still largely academic right now. The development and proper deployment of a space sensor layer and glide phase kinetic interceptor represent the most significant initiatives in this field. These two technologies are currently being developed by the US Missile Defense Agency and other contractors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vZGVmYnJpZWYuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMTkvdXMtbWFyaW5lLW9zcHJleS1jcmFzaGVzLWR1cmluZy1jb2xkLXJlc3BvbnNlLW1hbmV1dmVyLWluLW5vcndheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Marine Osprey crashes during Cold Response maneuver in Norway,"A US Marine Corps’ MV-22B Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft with four personnel on board crashed in Norway while taking part in NATO exercise Cold Response 2022.

According to Norway’s Joint Rescue Coordination Centres (JRCC) the Osprey was first reported missing on March 18 at 18:26 south of Bodø.

The aircraft was heading north towards Bodø with its last known position being the Saltfjellet mountain area in Nordland county. A rescue helicopter from Bodø as well as an Orion aircraft were involved in the search efforts.

The Osprey was located at 21:17 in Gråtådalen in Beiarn but weather conditions prevented any of the search and rescue aircraft from reaching the crash site.

Police and rescue crews eventually reached the crash site by foot. According to a Reuters report the police “found no signs of life” at the crash site.

The US Marine Corps confirmed the mishap adding that the aircraft was assigned to the II Marine Expeditionary Force currently deployed to Norway for the large-scale NATO maneuver Cold Response 2022.

The month-long exercise kicked off last week and is the largest international exercise hosted by Norway in more than 30 years. Around 35000 troops from 28 nations will test how a unified multilateral force would defend Norway and Europe’s northern flank from a modern adversary. Of the 35000 troops 14000 are land forces 13000 are naval forces while 8000 are air forces and headquarters established at various bases.",,,
NCLH,Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydXplbHkuY29tL25jbC1yZW1vdmVzLWxvd2VyLXByaWNlZC1jaGlsZHJlbnMtc29kYS1wYWNrYWdlLWZyb20td2Vic2l0ZS1saW5ldXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NCL Removes Lower-Priced Children's Soda Package From Website Lineup,"It’s a small change but one that parents will want to know as it could cost them a few extra dollars. Checks of Norwegian Cruise Line’s website appear to show an adjustment to the lineup of soda drink packages.

Before NCL offered soda packages at two levels — the “Adult & Teen Soda Program” for passengers 13 and older and the “Children’s Soda Program” for those 12 and under. Prices were $7.95 per day for the adult package and $5.95 per day for the child package (plus 20% gratuity). Both packages offered the same lineup of soda including Pepsi Sierra Mist Ginger Ale and more.

Now the cruise line’s website no longer shows the children’s version of the package available. Instead there is only a single soda package at the higher $7.95 per day cost.

In other words kids 12 and under apparently no longer have the less-expensive package option. Instead there is only one soda package available no matter a passenger’s age.

While the difference is only $2 per day between the previous price of the kid’s package and the soda package now shown that can add up. On a weeklong cruise the extra cost would mean an extra $14 and there is also a 20% gratuity added on to the cost.

As for other drink packages there has been no change there. The Premium Beverage Package which includes most alcohol is still $99 per person per day plus gratuity.

However this change comes on the heels of another recent price increase from NCL.

Just a few days ago we shared that the cruise line is bumping up the price of its onboard service charges. Starting in April the price of gratuities on most cabins is bumping up slightly from $15.50 to $16.00. Rooms in The Haven (NCL’s premium area on the ship) and suites see an increase from $18.50 to $20.00 per person per day.

Slightly Higher Prices Unlikely to Deter Strong Demand

While some people may question anything that potentially increases the cost of cruising — no matter how slight — given the turmoil seen in the industry due to the health crisis there are signs that NCL has pricing power.

During a recent quarterly call with investors Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings CEO Frank Del Rio pointed out that he thinks 2023 could be a record-breaking for the company.

“I believe that 2023 based on the numbers that I have on the books right now — both load factor and pricing — and further based on the assumption that we will not see another major Delta or Omicron-type surge 2023 can get the industry and certainly our company back to pre-pandemic levels” said Del Rio.

“At this stage and again not because I think… I’m giving you what the numbers are showing 2023 could be — assuming that no other major variants arrives on the scene — could be a fabulous year. [It] could be a record year” he later added.

As just one specific example the company’s newest ship Norwegian Prima saw record bookings on its first day and week of sales back in May 2021 months before cruises had even returned.

No doubt that anyone with the ability to take a cruise can handle a small change like removing a kid’s soda package. However between that increased gratuities rising prices on land and strong demand for travel it does make you wonder if higher prices might become a trend in cruising.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9ob2xseXdvb2QtZmxhc2hiYWNrLW1hcmxlZS1tYXRsaW4tbWFkZS0yMDMwMzEzNjMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hollywood Flashback: Marlee Matlin Made Oscar History 35 Years Before 'CODA',"Marlee Matlin was just 21 when she earned an Academy Award for starring opposite William Hurt in the 1986 drama Children of a Lesser God becoming the first deaf person to win an Oscar and the youngest best actress recipient.

Marking her feature debut the film focused on the relationship between a hearing speech teacher (Hurt) at a school for deaf children and a deaf custodian (Matlin) working there. For Matlin the Oscar win was the culmination of a lifelong dream that began at age 8 when she started appearing in children’s theater productions for the International Center on Deafness and the Arts in Northbrook Illinois. Henry Winkler who dealt with undiagnosed dyslexia as a child saw her in a play there and offered encouragement backstage.

More from The Hollywood Reporter

“The win reinforced what Henry Winkler told me when I was 12 that I should never give up doing what I love despite the critics and naysayers” Matlin tells THR. She admits her trip to the podium was a blur and she wasn’t sure what to believe when the category’s presenter Hurt whom she was dating at the time called her name: “I remember thinking at first that he was kidding but then I thought ‘He can’t be kidding on national TV!’ ”

THR noted in its coverage that Matlin was only the fourth actress to win with a first-time screen performance. - Credit: The Hollywood Reporter

The Hollywood Reporter

Her film CODA about the lone hearing member of a deaf family nabbed this year’s SAG Award for best film ensemble and has three Oscar noms including best picture and best supporting actor for Troy Kotsur who could follow in Matlin’s footsteps as the second deaf performer to win.

Thirty-five years after her Oscar moment Matlin remains grateful that Children led her down this path: “It was a timeless love story unlike anything that ever came before it and set the stage for what we see today in CODA.”

NVDA,Nvidia,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vbmV3cy9udmlkaWEtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMzA4MC10aS12cy1ydHgtMzA4MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti vs RTX 3080,"The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti launched almost a year ago now and while there's definitely been plenty of time for it to mature since then the graphics card market has been in kind of a weird place.

If you've been paying attention at all you've probably noticed that actually buying a graphics card has been next to impossible since the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 launched back in September 2020. But now that we're starting to see GPU prices fall a little bit we figured it was time to start talking about which GPU is the best value for gamers once again. After all if things continue the way they are the average gamer might actually be able to afford a graphics card soon – might as well know which is the best for you.

With the RTX 3080 Ti and the RTX 3080 the names can be a little confusing. While the RTX 3080 is no doubt powerful we found that in our testing the RTX 3080 Ti performs a lot like an RTX 3090 just at a relatively lower MSRP. So is that the card worth buying?

(Image credit: Future)

Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti vs RTX 3080: price

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti launched at $1199 / £1049 / AU$1949 for Nvidia's Founders Edition. Prices obviously go up from there especially these days but you should probably expect to spend between $1199 to $1400 on an RTX 3080 Ti when prices finally normalize.

The RTX 3080 however is much more affordable - at least it's supposed to be. At launch Nvidia's flagship GPU was set at $699 (£649 about AU$950) for that Founders Edition. However this is the graphics card that was hit hardest by recent price jumps and it's still seeing very inflated prices. Right now on Amazon we're seeing it between $1200 and $1600 in the US. That makes it about the same price as its big sibling.

In fact even on Amazon at the time of writing you can get the Gigabyte RTX 3080 Ti Gaming OC at $1449 which is basically the same price as an RTX 3080 right now. If it comes down to it and you have to pick between an RTX 3080 and an RTX 3080 Ti that's even like $100 more you should absolutely go for the RTX 3080 Ti. It's just so much faster.

Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti vs RTX 3080: specs

When you first hear the name ""RTX 3080 Ti"" you'd be forgiven for thinking it was just a minor mid-generation spec bump over the original RTX 3080. However Nvidia really cranked up the dials for it.

The original Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 was launched with 10GB of GDDR6X memory on a 320-bit bus. That memory was paired with 8704 CUDA cores and a 1.71GHz boost clock. It was refreshed a little while ago with a 12GB option. That option also comes on a higher 384-bit memory bus along with slightly more CUDA cores at 8960.

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti on the other hand has significantly more CUDA cores coming in at 10240 with a boost clock of 1.67GHz. That means it's significantly more powerful than either version of the RTX 3080. It's actually closer to the RTX 3090 with its 10496 CUDA cores. However it has the same amount of RAM as the refreshed RTX 3080 with 12GB of GDDR6X memory on a 384-bit bus.

That really drives home that the two cards are significantly different from one another. If you're looking to do 4K gaming the RTX 3080 Ti is simply going to be better at it than the original RTX 3080. And that means less compromising on fancy graphics effects like ray tracing.

Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti vs RTX 3080: performance

Specs only mean so much though. Who cares about a bunch of numbers on a sheet when what really matters is how these graphics cards handle the best PC games.

In 4K gaming the RTX 3080 Ti breaks away from the RTX 3080 providing a nearly 10% performance difference. For instance it is able to get 95 fps in Dirt 5 at 4K with all the settings maxed where the original RTX 3080 gets 86 fps. Obviously both cards excel at this resolution and 86 fps is nothing to shake a stick at - but you can't deny that an extra 10 fps helps.

However if you're playing at a lower resolution you're going to see diminishing returns especially at 1080p. Both of these graphics cards will blow any current game away at that resolution so paying more for an RTX 3080 Ti doesn't really make sense.

On the other hand it's totally possible that future games will put the more powerful graphics to the test at this low resolution. And if you're buying this expensive of a graphics card for 1080p gaming it's likely you're the type that wants to buy something that will last a long time anyway.

Either of these graphics cards will be excellent for 1080p gaming at a high frame rate so pro esports players will likely find a lot to love. The RTX 3080 Ti can easily handle a game like Overwatch and hit above 244 fps which is good news for anyone that relies on speed to enhance their reaction speed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAzLzE5L2JldHRlci1idXktbWV0YS1wbGF0Zm9ybXMtdnMtbnZpZGlhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: Meta Platforms vs. Nvidia,"Which tech giant is the better long-term investment today?

Meta Platforms (META 3.04%) and Nvidia (NVDA 3.77%) both seemed like unstoppable growth stocks in 2021. After the initial COVID lockdowns a surge in advertising growth drove Meta's stock to an all-time high of $382.18 last September. Nvidia stock peaked around the same time reaching $333.76 in November 2021 as the chipmaker dazzled investors with robust sales of gaming and data center GPUs.

February brought that growth to a grinding halt for both companies badly burning investors who had chased earlier rallies. After mixed fourth-quarter earnings and weak guidance in the year ahead due to its shifting business model Meta stock now sits near $200. Nvidia stock has similarly stumbled dipping to the mid $240s amid concerns about decelerating growth peaking gross margins and the ongoing chip shortage. Nvidia's plan to buy Arm Holdings and become a chip design powerhouse failed disappointing investors.

Should investors take the contrarian view and jump on opportunities to buy either tech stock at a steep discount? Let's take a fresh look at both companies to decide.

What happened to Meta?

Recent years have been good to Meta. While its advertising business struggled at the onset of the pandemic the company bounced back in the second half of the year with revenue rising 22% to $85.97 billion in 2020. That same year Meta expanded operating margins by four percentage points to 38% and increased earnings per share (EPS) by 57% year over year.

Meta had good fortune in 2021 too: revenue increased 37% to $117.93 billion as businesses continued ramping back up ad spending. Following 2020's trend Meta's operating margin expanded to 40% and EPS jumped 36%.

Those past numbers look fantastic but Meta anticipates a slowdown in 2022. The company expects revenue in the first quarter of 2022 to represent 3% to 11% year-over-year growth. Meta primarily blames this halt on Apple's (AAPL -0.91%) iOS privacy update which enables users to opt-out of data-tracking features. The company also anticipates increased competition from short video apps like ByteDance's TikTok.

To keep pace with TikTok Meta plans to prioritize short video content on Facebook and Instagram Reels. That shift though will throttle near-term revenue and earnings growth as videos are difficult to monetize. Meta also plans to pour more cash into its unprofitable Reality Labs division which focuses on virtual reality and the metaverse. This segment may prove promising in the future but it's currently burning money: in 2021 Reality Labs racked up an operating loss of $10.1 billion while generating just $2.27 billion in revenue.

Investors are spooked by this combination of slow growth and high spending. Meta's sliding stock price reflects analyst expectations that company revenue will grow just 12% this year while earnings slide 10%. The future though isn't all bleak: assuming Meta overcomes near-term challenges analysts expect revenue and earnings alike to rise about 17% in 2023.

What happened to Nvidia?

Pandemic trends proved a boon for Nvidia: in fiscal year 2021 (ended January 2021) revenue surged 53% to $16.68 billion. Sales of gaming GPUs jumped as people played more video games while stuck at home. Demand for cloud services increased as people worked from home streamed media and played video games causing data centers to purchase more high-end GPUs to process AI and machine learning tasks.

It's no surprise then that Nvidia's adjusted gross margin expanded from 62.5% to 65.6% over its 2021 fiscal year with its adjusted EPS soaring 73%.

The following year Nvidia's revenue continued to grow hitting $24.91 billion by the end of January. What's more adjusted gross margin rose to 66.8% and adjusted EPS grew by 78%. Again gaming and data center GPUs did most of the heavy lifting. Competitors could barely keep up: according to JPR during the fourth quarter of 2021 Nvidia controlled 81% of the discrete GPU market while its rival AMD (AMD 3.44%) held a 19% share.

Those growth rates are surely solid but analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and earnings to slow this year as the market's appetite for new gaming and data center GPUs wanes. Predictions have the company growing revenue by 29% and earnings by 26%. Looking ahead to fiscal year 2024 analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and earnings to decelerate further growing just 17% and 20% respectively as the upgrade cycle continues to cool.

Other unpredictable headwinds await on the horizon and could impact growth. Intel (INTC 0.63%) is launching new discrete GPUs to compete against Nvidia and AMD which is sure to bite into both companies' market share. The use of Nvidia's gaming GPUs to mine cryptocurrencies could pin the company's growth on the volatile crypto market. The ongoing chip shortage threatens to cap Nvidia's supply of available chips.

The valuations and verdict

Bearing this in mind which bargain stock is the better buy? Examining valuation offers insight into which company currently offers the most bang for your buck. Meta trades at just 16 times forward earnings making it the cheapest FAANG stock by a wide margin. Despite its recent dip Nvidia is still one of the priciest semiconductor stocks trading at 44 times forward earnings.

Both of these companies are solid long-term investments but I believe that Meta's discount valuation and less cyclical business model make it a more compelling investment than Nvidia. Nvidia is still growing at a healthy clip but its high valuation will hamper possible returns.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpemNoaW5hLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAzLzIwL252aWRpYS1teDU3MC10by1ib2FzdC10aGUtc2FtZS12aWRlby1jb2RlYy1hcy1yeHQtMjA1MC_SAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5naXpjaGluYS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy8yMC9udmlkaWEtbXg1NzAtdG8tYm9hc3QtdGhlLXNhbWUtdmlkZW8tY29kZWMtYXMtcnh0LTIwNTAvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia MX570 to boast the same video codec as RXT 2050,"NVIDIA has just unveiled the NVIDIA MX150 250 350 450 four-generation MX series graphics cards all without NVENC / NVDEC video codec units.

According to the new report from ITHome the NVIDIA MX570 and the RTX 2050 boast the same core as the RTX 3050. Both of which are 2048 CUDA cores. The NVIDIA MX570 comes with a 2 GB 64-bit GDDR6 memory. Meanwhile the RTX 2050 comes with a 4 GB 64-bit GDDR 6 memory. According to NVIDIA’s official introduction the NVIDIA MX570 graphics processors stand as the fastest among NVIDIA MX GPUS.

RTX 2050 and consequently NVIDIA MX570 fall behind the 96 EU Iris Xe GPU

MechRevo a Chinese notebook manufacturer also reveals data on video encoding efficiency on Full HD and Ultra HD screens with the RTX 2050. Interestingly Intel’s integrated graphics the Iris Xe 96 EU GPU has a large advantage over NVIDIA’s dedicated card. Check out:

Let’s see if the NVIDIA MX570 will move the industry as a cost-effective version. NVIDIA still pushes the industry of graphics cards forwards and its hardware is always building hype. For this year we expect the company to disclose the RTX 4000 series. However getting one of these this year may still be a hard task. The graphics cards are still super expensive due to the continuous constraints in the industry of semiconductors. Moreover there is an ever-growing demand due to crypto mining needs. The price of a gaming PC has become way higher than it was in previous years. Even used hardware has become expensive. Worth noting that not even NVIDIA has been free of the tensions during the ongoing conflict.

This year NVIDIA has unveiled the RTX 3050 in a bid to satisfy cost-effective needs.

AMD also has its own range of RX graphics cards to compete with NVIDIA’s standards. But they are still falling shortly behind due to some proprietary technologies like DLSS that make RTX cards stand beyond the competition.

We’ve endured the perfect storm of a once-in-a-generation pandemic combined with a cryptocurrency boom that flattened supply and inflated demand. But there are signs that things may slowly be returning to normality.

While you’ll still struggle to find RTX 3070 restocks at MSRP (unless you’re very quick with the mouse or are prepared to think outside the box) there are signs that things are moving in the right direction — and the drops can be quite jarring too. Take what happened in Australia recently where Nvidia RTX 3080 stock fell from AU$2299 to AU$1499 overnight.

GPU pricing is falling off a cliff right now. Locally the ""ASUS GeForce RTX 3080 TUF Gaming OC"" was $2299 yesterday today a few retailers have slashed it to $1499 AUD. That's 35% off over night.(kick in the capacitors if you bought one yesterday)March 15 2022

But there are also signs that price inflation may be here to stay. The Nvidia RTX 3090 Ti card is coming soon and the leaker @momomo_us claims to have got hold of Canadian pricing which if accurate kills the idea that we’re out of the woods on high graphics card prices.

That comes to a price of a little more than $4150 USD for the ASUS ROG Strix model to save you doing the currency conversion. The TUF one is a touch cheaper mind coming in at ""just"" $3690 or thereabouts.

Although this isn’t the first time we’ve heard such prices mooted it would still be a huge surprise given the non-Ti version of the card has a MSRP of $1500. It’s more likely that these are holding prices rather than the official going rate but these are strange times we live in so never say never.

The waiting game for graphics cards

Either way if you’re able to it’s best to play the waiting game — unless you find yourself in the right place at the right time and are able to buy at MSRP. I was lucky enough to find myself in that position thanks to a stock tracking Telegram group and a freelance lifestyle that means I can drop everything at a moment’s notice. As a result I now have an RTX 3070 in my life.

But not everyone has that kind of freedom and you may want to wait a bit longer for two landmarks on the horizon.

The first is Etherium’s switch to proof-of-stake mining which is currently scheduled for June and should make GPU mining of the cryptocurrency redundant. While there are other currencies that still benefit from a top-end GPU they’re not as obviously profitable especially with energy prices skyrocketing and there’s a real chance we could see demand fall off a cliff this summer as a result.

The second factor is that Nvidia is rumored to be working on the RTX 40 series with release possibly coming before the year is out. While you may not want or need the power (or expense!) that these next-generation cards will inevitably offer it may still make sense to hold off and see what their introduction does to current-gen pricing.

In short if you’ve waited this long for a new GPU it doesn’t hurt to wait a few more months does it?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vbTEtdWx0cmEtdnMtcnR4LTMwOTAtZ3B1LWNvbXBhcmlzb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,M1 Ultra Vs.

Edge computing and 5G networks are transforming the IoT enhancing the capabilities of a wide range of applications across multiple sectors and enabling a plethora of new and emerging ones. In this article we illustrate the power of edge computing by examining three prominent use cases.

Industry 4.0 smart factory

Industry 4.0 offers manufacturers a vision of increased productivity and profitability based on flexible industrial environments that leverage smart technology and require limited human intervention. However this transformation is hampered by the predominance in complex production domains of wired Ethernet networks implemented because of their well-proven time-sensitive networking (TSN) capabilities.

Consider for example a modern assembly line that is no longer linear but adaptively routes work between cells based on capacity or the efficient warehouse that relies on automated guided vehicles (AGVs). These scenarios require the low latency high-reliability wireless network connectivity offered by 5G networks.

By replacing existing hard-wired networks 5G enables wide-ranging flexibility on the factory floor and brings deployment options such as edge computing software-defined networking (SDN) and private networking.

The combination of edge computing and private networking addresses the three overarching requirements of industrial automation – data locality reliability and low latency. With regulators around the world making shared spectrum available at a reasonable cost factory operators no longer need to rely on the cloud and public shared infrastructure to deliver their networking requirements. Sensitive production data can remain local to the factory or plant. Open RAN (O-RAN) and SDN networking functionality enable the cost-effective installation of powerful local 5G radio access networks (RAN). These small-scale RAN networks can be flexibly deployed and configured to meet the latency reliability and availability requirements of the specific industrial process. Existing wired networks that control lower latency applications such as motors drivers and actuators can be integrated with the 5G RAN infrastructure mapping relevant TSN features to 5G figure 1.

Connected automobile In many ways the connected vehicle can be considered as the ultimate IoT edge device combining multiple high-performance edge compute nodes with high-bandwidth networking and dozens of sensors. Sophisticated hardware and software architectures are emerging to replace the multiple electronic control units (ECUs) found in high-end automobiles. These new architectures are based on a centralized compute resource the service-oriented gateway (SoG) based on high power multicore SoC products such as the NXP S32G vehicle network processor. The SoG communicates with the domain controllers which are responsible for the main functionalities within the vehicle figure 2 and provides a secure path to the cloud via the onboard telematics control unit (TCU).

The vehicle edge processing enabled by the power of the SoG is fundamental to the evolution of the connected vehicle. The terabytes of raw data generated each hour by the vehicle’s sensors can be processed locally and decisions can be taken in real-time based on information and anomalies detected by the sensors. Sophisticated machine learning (ML) algorithms can be run at the vehicle edge enabling enhanced levels of intelligence and autonomy by predicting and reacting to a wide range of driving conditions.

The SoG also orchestrates vehicle-wide over-the-air (OTA) updates of software firmware and ML models which continually improve the vehicle’s in-life performance while supporting incremental revenue-generating services for the vehicle OEMs.

The roll-out of 5G is seen as essential to the further development of the autonomous vehicle as its ultra-low latencies combined with multi-access edge computing (MEC) move cloud servers away from the data center closer to the vehicles at the network edge. The resulting reduction in latencies to single-digit milliseconds enables data center levels of processing power with the real-time responsiveness required by the autonomous vehicle.

Wearables

The ever-increasing power and shrinking form factors of electronic devices enable a rapid expansion in the variety and sophistication of use cases for wearables. Wearables can come in the form of implantable devices fitness trackers smart jewelry watches shoes and clothing with emerging applications such as:

Health monitoring with movement and fall detection emergency calling and vitals reporting (for example body temperature oxygen levels and cardiac signs)

Sleep monitoring and therapy

Meal/calorie tracking

Hearing enhancement

Social distancing and contact tracing and tracking

The compute power contained in wearable devices along with the capabilities of peripheral devices and sensors enable them to function as true edge processing devices. These technological advances are driving the convergence of wearables with smart home applications delivering increased levels of convenience to consumers. Smart watches can now be used to control everything from lighting systems to coffee machines and can also control entry and security systems. Smart watch applications are also being integrated with connected car tools enabling user access to controls such as sunroofs seat ventilation temperature and status alerts.

Battery life is critical in wearables; low-power operation is essential with battery sizes restricted by physical space limitations. The modern edge processors within wearables can support a variety of reduced power modes using various low-power design techniques to achieve extended battery lives in both active and sleep modes.

Alongside the increased levels of processing power developments in sensors and peripheral devices enable enhanced functionality in wearables including sophisticated graphics localization voice control and motion sensing. The edge computing capabilities of wearables also ensure the rapid and secure processing of the vast quantities of data generated reducing the need for broadband processing lowering power consumption and hence increasing battery life.

Edge processing is removing the limitations of cloud computing

With the rapid expansion of the IoT the increased numbers of connected devices have exposed the limitations particularly the high latencies of the classic cloud computing model. Although edge computing is not a new concept its application to embedded edge devices has been made possible by the increased processing power and shrinking form factors of the electronics contained in these edge devices. As the power and sophistication of these edge devices continue to increase existing applications will be enhanced and new ones will emerge.

Magdeburg in former East Germany is famous for its towering gothic cathedral and not a lot else. It's now about to play a key role in U.S. and European efforts to tilt the global balance of power.

Intel Corp. unveiled plans on March 15 to build a giant $18.7 billion factory making cutting-edge semiconductors in the city adding to new plants in Arizona and Ohio the company announced over the past six months.

They are part of Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger's plan to wrest control of production from Asia and tackle the global shortage of chips exacerbated during the Covid-19 pandemic and exposed again following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""The situation reinforces why we're doing this project and the need for globally resilient and balanced supply chain"" Gelsinger said after revealing the Magdeburg site.

His ambition is one that the U.S. and European Union are promising to back with a combined $100 billion in a subsidy race to reduce reliance on imports just as China plans to turn itself into a chip powerhouse. Behind closed doors though some people in the industry are getting increasingly concerned that the push to make the West more competitive might backfire.

Their worry is not only that the money will be too little too late but the political strings attached to the aid may complicate global supply chains further. Different parts of the planet will compete to secure supplies while championing domestic plants that can't yet fill the void.

The dearth of semiconductors has brought some car manufacturing to a halt and delayed shipments of game consoles and smartphones waking Washington and Brussels up to the fact that their continents are dependent on a handful of regions for the key parts. The most notable is Taiwan a geopolitical hotspot because of historically tense relations with China and one whose vulnerability is under more scrutiny since Russia's invasion of its smaller neighbor.

Yet however dysfunctional it may look at the moment the supply chain is global and fully integrated. Unpicking it could carry greater risks said Rudi De Winter CEO of German chip maker X-Fab Silicon Foundries.

The semiconductor industry ""is a very global business and it has done well being a global business"" he said. ""This whole trend of trying to make things sovereign in every region and having its own supply chain is rather driven by politics and not by the semiconductor industry.""

Russia which has been sanctioned by the U.S. and Europe now is a clear example of how semiconductors have become increasingly important political tools. The items were some of the first goods that Washington and Brussels targeted to cut Russia off from the global economy and they've continually threatened more action. Manufacturing of cars in Russia for example has already been hit.

On the flip side Russia and Ukraine export palladium and neon used to make semiconductors though chipmakers have downplayed the potential impact.

U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said in an interview on March 9 that if Chinese companies defy U.S. restrictions against exporting to Russia Washington could shut down companies by cutting them off from the American equipment and software they need.

Semiconductors and other high-tech are becoming ""weaponized"" with the current trade wars and supply chain issues said Rafael Laguna de la Vera CEO of SPRIN-D Germany's federal agency for disruptive innovation. ""This is why regions need to invest into high tech to get resilient"" he said.

The U.S. and Europe want to claw back their share of the chip market after collapses in recent decades. The U.S. accounted for nearly 40% of the world's silicon wafer production in the 1990s while the EU accounted for more than 20% according to figures cited by Washington and Brussels. The U.S. is now below 15% and the EU has about 10%.

In an effort to shift production away from Asia President Joe Biden plans to put $52 billion into domestic semiconductor research development and production as part of its broad China competition bill though it is still awaiting approval. The EU's 27 member states meanwhile are only just scrutinizing the European Commission's recent proposal worth $48 billion to build up the bloc's chip capacity.

China has already been spending what could amount to $150 billion by 2030 to jumpstart production. The country is still far behind especially when it comes to advanced chip making but it's catching up quickly.

""We're laser-focused on revitalizing America's semiconductor industry"" Raimondo said at Intel's new site in Ohio in January. ""Semiconductors are the essential building blocks of our modern economy.""

Some members of Congress though want to see the taxpayer funds attached to guardrails that prevent companies from using the money to invest in China while Intel at one point lobbied against the taxpayer funds going to firms headquartered abroad.

In the past things were simple for chip producers said Kurt Sievers CEO of Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors. Companies ""could just choose production locations and R&D locations wherever you wanted"" he said. ""But I think we just have to stay realistic: Maybe these times are over. Now we are dealing with the world as it is going to evolve.""

Intel CEO Gelsinger is a major force behind government investment in new plants. Despite the naysayers he believes public funding could help Intel lower the cost of trying to catch up on cutting-edge chips after falling behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. known as TSMC and South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. It would also make the U.S. and Europe more self-reliant.

""Let's not waste this crisis"" Gelsinger told Bloomberg earlier this year. ""It's good economics but it's also national security."" Intel's new plant in Magdeburg which will start production in 2027 is part of an 80 billion-euro package of investment in Europe by the Californian company.

Whether the numbers stack up remains to be seen. The U.S. and Europe have some serious catching up to do said SPRIN-D's de la Vera. Japan for example is also promising state aid to boost production. New facilities include a $7 billion factory planned by TSMC in conjunction with Sony and Denso Corp.

South Korea also wants to become the world's biggest chip producer with companies and the government pouring a total $450 billion into the industry by 2030.

Achieving economies of scale that can compete with Taiwan's business model is also going to be tough if each region is racing to build its own capacity. TSMC accounts for more than 50% of the global foundry market or the business of purely making chips for other companies. Its customers include Apple Inc. which relies on Taiwanese chips for iPhones.

Indeed the reliance on TSMC is the core concern: an invasion of the island by China would leave the world's most advanced chips in the hands of Beijing. U.S. academic Jared McKinney recently suggested in a U.S. Army journal that Taiwan should protect itself by threatening to destroy chipmaking facilities so that Beijing would see its tech industry ""immobilized"" should it invade. He called it a ""broken nest"" strategy.

TSMC will have a new U.S. location operating in Arizona in two years and is now mulling a potential plant in Germany after European carmakers repeatedly expressed concerns about the impact from the chip shortage. But Taiwanese industry insiders remain skeptical of plans to relocate production back to the West.

""It's not possible to turn back the clock"" TSMC founder Morris Chang told a Taiwanese tech association in October. ""If you want to re-establish a complete semiconductor supply chain in the United States you will not find it to be a possible task even after you spend hundreds of billions of dollars.""

The federal money on the table is just a fraction of what the U.S. industry needs. And some executives are already wary of how governments are asserting themselves by slapping down mergers limiting exports or banning working with industry partners.

The most recent example was Germany's nixing of Taiwanese company GlobalWafer's takeover of German rival Siltronic earlier this year. Industry officials say the move showed the West is turning inward when governments should develop stronger alliances with Asia.

The White House has quietly moved to stop Dutch company ASML Holding NV from exporting its cutting-edge equipment to China. ASML has an effective monopoly on advanced extreme ultraviolet lithography machines used by companies like TSMC.

The Trump administration began pressuring the Dutch government as early as 2018 not to authorize the sale of ASML's EUV machines to China according to people familiar with the talks. That pressure has escalated under Biden with officials considering pushing the Dutch government to put in writing the de-facto export ban according to people familiar with the internal deliberations.

The company has become increasingly frustrated with the intervention of the U.S. which is also debating whether to ask the Dutch to ban ASML from selling its mature deep ultraviolet lithography systems to China. ""Any suggestion by any country to limit the shipment of the production equipment for mature technology to areas of the world where that technology is being produced is not a good idea"" said ASML CEO Peter Wennink. ""We should not do that.""

The U.S. and Europe will discuss their strategies on semiconductors as part of the Trade and Technology Council but there's still a long way to go to figure out if and how to coordinate government aid in the most strategic ways. A U.S. official said they want to avoid a subsidies arms race though a lingering mistrust from the Donald Trump years has made the EU wary.

While American eyes are on China the EU plans to add strings to subsidies that would ensure the bloc has the essential components in times of emergencies. These ideas follow lessons from the pandemic when the U.S. and U.K. had quicker access to vaccines. EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton has said the U.S.'s Defense Production Act was a source of inspiration for the ""security of supply"" proposals.

The plans are not protectionist nor are they seeking to make Europe completely autonomous he said. Instead they give the EU leverage to compete. ""That's the new geopolitics of supply chains"" Breton said.

There's no shortage of skepticism considering the EU tried to double production nearly 10 years ago and failed. Now the overall goal is for Europe to make 20% of the world's semiconductors by 2030. With global demand expected to as much as double in practice that means quadrupling Europe's production within eight years.

This time the EU opened the door to providing public money for production of chips - a massive shift. But many companies in the region question whether the bloc should be placing so much weight on making the next generation of chips rather than the less advanced more ""mature"" chips currently in shortage.

NXP CEO Sievers said the bloc should focus on providing first what the industry needs now. ""Right away leapfrogging to leading edge only I think would be missing the beat of what the European industry needs in the next couple of years"" he said.

Whatever type of chips end up being produced industry insiders expect the U.S. and Europe will always be dependent on Asia for their materials not least because of the global intricacies of supplies.

TSMC Chairman Mark Liu highlighted the connectivity in December saying that some semiconductor chemicals required by Intel are shipped to the U.S. by Taiwanese suppliers. In other words even American-made products rely on the outside world.

That's what makes the plans by Washington and Brussels so unrealistic said Jan-Peter Kleinhans a researcher at the German thinktank Stiftung Neue Verantwortung in Berlin.

There's also the risk of exacerbating shortages if you have politicians telling companies to prioritize certain chips for certain regions Kleinhans said. ""Suddenly it's not up to the market anymore"" he said. Governments aren't chip buyers or chip makers. ""It's really 20th century policy tools applied to a 21st century value chain.""

Bike trails and walking trails will soon start to take shape. Once completed it will be an asset that the entire region will enjoy.

In the Sheridan Road corridor the Village completed relaying water mains from Sixth Place to 17th Street. At the same time all side streets were repaved.

In this same corridor our sewer lining project began in 2021 and will be completed in 2022. The village also completed the rehabilitation of three lift stations along Sheridan Road.

In 2021 the Village completed sewer and water infrastructure in the I-94 corridor between Hwy. E and Hwy. 142. By this summer a new water transfer station and lift station will come online. This $14.5 million project was driven by the Pritzker Archives and Memorial Park Center and has already spurred economic activity in this area.

I-94 corridor growth

The Village’s I-94 corridor is also beginning to take shape. In 2021 the Board approved Phase I of Becknell Industrial’s warehousing/industrial project. Phase I includes a 795000 square foot building on 50 acres. Phase II would include two additional buildings that would add an additional 900000 square feet.

The Board also approved HSA Acquisitions’ warehousing/industrial project. This project will include one building on 65 acres that is expandable up to 905000 square feet. Both projects expect to break ground this spring. Kwik Trip’s 13000 square foot travel center and convenience store is nearing completion and they hope to open for business this summer.

The first ever project in the Somers/Paris growth area was recently approved. Flint Development has been granted conditional approval of three warehouse/industrial buildings totaling 1.8 million square feet on the west side of I-94. Both the Town of Paris and Village of Somers worked cooperatively to bring this approval to fruition.

Somers Market Center continues to be a great success. A new multi-tenant building anchored by Taco Bell recently received occupancy and is open for business. The new Dunkin Donuts and Popeye’s Louisiana Chicken stores should also open in 2022. In April the Plan Commission will review plans to add a Chipotle to Somers Market Center. These stores will only serve to strengthen an already successful Tax Increment Finance District.

House projects

On the housing front several projects that were approved in 2020 and 2021 will begin to take steps forward.

The Savannah at Pike Creek multi-family development located on Hwy. L and Hwy. 1 will break ground soon. This unique project will feature 338 units of single-story apartments and a large clubhouse building with both indoor and outdoor pools.

Diamond Estates was approved by the Board in 2021. This project located on Lake Michigan will be home to 68 market rate multi-family units.

Somersville located on Hwy. E and Hwy. EA was conditionally approved by the Board in 2021. The Village and developer are in the final stages of completing their development agreement. This project will be home to a mix of duplexes townhomes and apartments. Somersville will also include a large clubhouse with a pool game room and fitness room. With all these developments the Board has stressed the importance of quality and livability.

The biggest challenge on the development side continues to be the creation of new single-family housing. The cost of materials land infrastructure and labor remain a major barrier to affordable owner-occupied neighborhoods. The Village remains committed to trying to find innovative ways to bring quality owner-occupied housing to Somers.

The Board has also been committed to providing public safety. Over the past year the Board has authorized additional sheriff’s deputies through our contract with Kenosha County and have added an additional full-time firefighter/EMS position.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tdi12b2ljZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzAzLzIwL2d1ZXN0LW9waW5pb24tYS1jaGlsZC1kaWVkLWF0LWEtZGFuZ2Vyb3VzLW1vdW50YWluLXZpZXctaW50ZXJzZWN0aW9uLWhvdy1sb25nLXdpbGwtaXQtdGFrZS11cy10by1tYWtlLWl0LXNhZmVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Guest opinion: A child died at a dangerous Mountain View intersection. How long will it take us to make it safer?,"Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

On Thursday March 17 a 13-year-old student at Graham Middle School died at the intersection of El Camino Real and Grant Road. He died on the street that has consistently killed and injured the most people in the city for the past decade. The project to add bike lanes on El Camino Real despite being in the works for years did nothing to help him because it is still just a plan. And that plan in the name of avoiding even the slightest inconvenience to car drivers will still not provide concrete separation of the bike lanes along all of El Camino Real because to do so would require encroaching somewhat onto the 6-8 lanes given over to cars.

The El Camino Real/Grant Road intersection has a lot of traffic accidents and particularly dangerous according to the Mountain View report. Photo by Natalia Nazarova

On June 12 2012 William Ware was killed waiting at a bus stop on California Street. The road diet galvanized by his death and multiple other deaths in the preceding years has yet to come to fruition a decade later.

On December 10 2019 the Mountain View City Council passed a Vision Zero policy saying that we would eliminate traffic fatalities in the city by 2030. Thus far that policy has resulted in no direct changes to our streets. The most recent update is that there will be a community meeting on March 24 where presumably the public will have the chance to hear about how safe our streets will be eight years from now and be given the chance to express that indeed we do not wish for ourselves or our children to be killed because Mountain View’s roads are built to give precedence to speeding drivers.

On March 16 2020 Santa Clara County issued a shelter-in-place order in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Just three months later on June 22 2020 Castro Street in downtown Mountain View was shut down to car traffic to help ease the burdens of struggling downtown businesses. This was and remains the right call. However it is a clear indictment of our values as a city that when the bottom line for a few businesses is on the line we are happy to take rapid and drastic action but that when the lives of our children are on the line we subject the slightest improvement to a decade of process.

This deadly perpetuation of the status quo is not inevitable. As in the case of the Castro Street closure it is within the power of the city to make changes quickly. We already know what streets are unsafe — past efforts by the city have even made prioritized lists of what streets to improve. And in 2020 the state legislature reduced legal barriers to building bike lanes for exactly this purpose. If our City Council so wishes it can ask city staff to start working on building out an ad hoc network of protected bike lanes on our streets using whatever tools are available — whether that be concrete barriers planters or even traffic cones. If we want to there is no good reason that we can’t have set up well-protected bike lanes on every major street in the city’s control by the time that school lets out for the summer in June.

Doing this will mean taking a lane away from cars on some multi-lane roads and may make it marginally harder to park in places where we have to remove on-street parking. But if that is the tradeoff required to allow our children to get to school without dying I’ll take it.

NIAGARA FALLS N.Y. — Long-pending lawsuits stemming from toxic waste contamination in Niagara Falls’ notorious Love Canal neighborhood have a new court date in May.

The Buffalo News reported Saturday that a federal appeals court in New York City will hear arguments in May on whether 19 pending lawsuits involving more than 600 people should be heard in state or federal court.

The suits stem from a 2011 incident in which sewer repair crews struck contaminated waste in the area and claim a containment structure built in the 1980s to store toxic waste has leaked.

Direct air capture (DAC) sounds too good to be true. Humanity is threatened by an excess of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere so build a giant DAC machine that can remove it.

By the numbers ▸ 415 ppm 2022 Atmospheric CO 2 concentration in 2022 ▸ 280 ppm Atmospheric CO 2 concentration in 1850 ▸ 1080 Gta CO 2 added to the air since the start of the Industrial Revolution ▸ 36.3 Gt per year Ongoing global greenhouse gas emissions ▸ 1.3–29 Gt per year Estimated hard-to-abate greenhouse gas emissions ▸ 10000 t per year Estimated current direct-air-capture (DAC) capacity ▸ $300 to $400 per metric ton Cost of DAC credits for large corporate buyers Sources: CDR Primer South Pole Carbon Engineering Lux Research International Energy Agency. a gigatons equivalent to a billion metric tons.

And it can be done. Right now in Iceland a plant built by the DAC start-up Climeworks is pulling CO 2 out of the air at a rate of about 4000 metric tons (t) per year and pumping it deep underground. The CO 2 reacts with basalt rock there to form stable carbonate minerals. The plant named Orca runs on low-carbon geothermal electricity and waste heat so it is by all accounts a carbon-negative process.

But DAC is expensive and energy intensive. Critics of DAC say that other forms of carbon removal are cheaper and that reducing emissions in the first place will always be a better investment in the fight against climate change. So the question isn’t if DAC works; it’s if DAC makes economic sense. There’s a lot riding on the answer.

In an influential report in 2018 the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that humanity can keep global warming below 1.5 °C and dodge the worst consequences of climate change if we can reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

The strategies for getting there fall into two buckets: emission reduction and carbon removal. Emission reduction is anything that results in less CO 2 being released including point-source carbon capture improved energy efficiency electrification renewable energy regenerative agriculture and forest management and reengineering of industrial processes. Carbon removal is anything that pulls CO 2 out of the air including nature-based methods such as planting trees and technologies such as DAC.

Though the two approaches sometimes compete for investment and for buyers of the emissions-offset credits they create many experts say both will be needed. Marcius Extavour vice president for energy and climate at the XPrize Foundation says the IPCC report and its follow-ups lay out the need clearly. “If we want to avoid warming beyond 1.5 °C every scenario is going to require some kind of carbon removal in addition to reducing emissions immediately and as fast as possible.”

Even within the area of carbon removal DAC has competition from other methods most of which are lower cost. “In the nature-based solutions community they say ‘It’s a no-brainer. We’re the cheapest or the most abundant’ ” Extavour says. At the same time he adds many people in DAC “think direct air capture is the only thing that’s really scalable.”

Extavour is leading the Carbon Removal XPrize a competition that will award $100 million to groups developing DAC and other carbon removal methods. Eighty million of that will be split between up to four teams that demonstrate systems that remove 1000 t of CO 2 per year and present a clear techno-economic path to expanding to a megaton scale. On April 22 Earth Day XPrize will announce 15 contestants that will receive $1 million each in milestone funding to develop their concepts.

DAC has a lot in common with point-source carbon capture in which CO 2 is scrubbed from the flue gas of power plants or other industrial facilities. But the two address very different markets and needs according to Thomas McDonald the former CEO of Mosaic Materials. Mosaic has developed CO 2 sorbent materials based on metal-organic frameworks for both DAC and point-source carbon capture.

Applied to combustion power plants McDonald says point-source carbon capture can result in clean electricity that competes with renewable and nuclear power. It can also handle process emissions such as the CO 2 produced by yeast during ethanol fermentation or by refineries and chemical plants.

DAC comes into play to deal with CO 2 emissions that are unavoidable and can’t be captured with point-source methods such as those from aviation. It’s also necessary to remediate historical greenhouse gas emissions—the CO 2 the world has been spewing for the past 100-plus years.

Exactly what emissions can and can’t be avoided is the subject of some debate. “There’s going to be a fight across the economy for every sector to be considered hard to abate so they don’t have to change” says John Noël a senior climate campaigner at the environmental nonprofit Greenpeace.

The CDR Primer a digital textbook about carbon dioxide removal published in 2021 by a team from the University of Pennsylvania estimates truly hard-to-abate emissions at 1.5–3.1 gigatons (Gt) of CO 2 per year. That number assumes that the electricity and industrial sectors can be completely decarbonized. It thus includes only some shipping aviation and heating CO 2  along with emissions of nitrous oxide—a greenhouse gas more potent than CO 2 —from agriculture wastewater and landfills.

Other estimates classify some emissions from power and manufacturing as hard to abate including those from the chemical industry. They range from 5 to 29 Gt per year.

According to the International Energy Agency an intergovernmental organization 19 DAC plants including Orca currently operate for a total capacity of roughly 10000 t per year. Most are pilot-scale facilities built to develop the technology rather than to capture a meaningful amount of CO 2 ; several are not even net negative in carbon.

DAC companies are developing two basic business models: sequester the CO 2 underground and sell credits to companies looking to offset their emissions or sell the CO 2 to companies that can use it.

We want to remove our emissions today. And this means we must limit our investment in direct air capture where plants are still under construction. Mario Tuthorn marketing manager Thermo Fischer Scientific inorganic mass spectrometry group

The aviation industry is one hoped-for customer for CO 2 from DAC. Carbon dioxide can be combined with hydrogen to produce hydrocarbons such as kerosene-type jet fuel though that technology is also not yet at commercial scale.

“Direct air capture is an essential step to decarbonization in the sense that it should be in the longer term the only way to produce synthetic kerosene” says Matteo Mirolo sustainable aviation policy officer at the nonprofit Transport and Environment. Flying all European Union–originating flights on such “e-kerosene” would consume 365 million t of captured CO2 per year Mirolo says.

Climeworks is bullish on fuels derived from captured CO 2 . It’s part of a consortium called Norsk e-Fuel that recently announced plans for a plant in Norway that it expects to produce 25 million L of jet fuel per year from DAC CO 2 and renewable electricity.

But critics say better options will be available to decarbonize jet fuel too. Biomass-derived fuels can in principle be carbon negative if plants use waste biomass and are fitted with carbon capture. The biofuel company Gevo for example has aviation fuel partnerships with Archer Daniels Midland Chevron and Delta Air Lines. And Strategic Biofuels is working with regulators on an injection site in Louisiana for a jet fuel project consuming forestry waste.

Other DAC firms are racing to join Climeworks in having steel in the ground. Carbon Engineering is working with Oxy Low Carbon Ventures a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum on megaton-scale DAC plants in Norway and Texas. Carbon Engineering’s system uses a set of calcium-chemistry “loops” to isolate the CO 2 it catches using a potassium hydroxide solution.

The firm’s Norwegian plant will inject its CO 2 underneath the ocean floor. Oxy will use the Texas plant’s CO 2 to push more oil and gas out of depleted wells a practice called enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Global Thermostat with backing from ExxonMobil and the US Department of Energy is working on both EOR and ways to use captured CO 2 as a feedstock for fuels and plastics.

Greenpeace’s Noël calls using captured CO 2 to extract more oil a “joke” and warns that partnering with the oil and gas industry is a dangerous path. “It is a Trojan horse for these companies to maintain their access and influence over climate policy and design and implementation going forward at the state federal and global level” he says.

At the same time EOR operators are willing to pay some of the highest prices for CO 2  and DAC needs customers in order to grow.

Former Carbon Engineering CEO Steve Oldham who left the firm in January says EOR from DAC can be carbon neutral. But the firm is also looking at e-fuels and pure sequestration. “DAC is fundamentally a service” Oldham says. “You and I pay someone to take garbage away from our house. DAC is a model that makes sense for hard-to-decarbonize sectors.”

The market for removing carbon the way we remove the trash is gaining steam McDonald says. “There’s an incredible amount of demand that’s coming to purchase these and there’s actually not enough supply of high-quality additional verifiable credits.”

Despite that need DAC has struggled to catch on because of high prices and limited capacity.

Thermo Fisher Scientific’s experience is instructive. The company launched a line of carbon-neutral mass spectrometers in 2021 using carbon removal credits to offset the emissions created during the instruments’ life cycle. The firm’s inorganic mass spectrometry group calculated that 15 kg of CO 2 is emitted for every 1 kg of spectrometer delivered.

“Emission reduction is obviously the most important long-term goal for decarbonizing the economy” Mario Tuthorn marketing manager for the group said in a presentation on the program. But that’s hard to do in precision manufacturing where performance of the final device is very sensitive to material and design choices he added. “If we want to make a change today the most practical approach is to offset our emissions.”

If we want to avoid warming beyond 1.5 °C every scenario is going to require some kind of carbon removal in addition to reducing emissions immediately and as fast as possible. Marcius Extavour vice president for energy and climate XPrize Foundation

Avoided emissions such as those gained from planting or protecting trees were not good enough in the team’s analysis because they are hard to calculate and track. “Will the forest you paid to protect still be protected in 50 to 100 years’ time?” Tuthorn asked. “A much more rigorous offsetting approach is carbon dioxide removal.”

In a white paper the group detailed how it shopped for carbon removal credits. It emphasized permanent removal of CO 2 that would not have been removed other ways. Priority also went to technologies that have the potential to scale but need investment now to drive down costs.

Though Thermo Fisher sounds like the exact customer DAC firms are courting DAC won only 3%—which went to Carbon Engineering—of the program’s 2021 carbon removal spending. Instead 78% went to construction with sustainable timber and insulation with recycled paper. Biochar and bio-oil projects which heat plant matter to convert it to charcoal or pyrolysis oil that is then buried or injected into old wells shared 19%.

Though Tuthorn described DAC as the gold standard for carbon removal alongside biomass-based energy plants that sequester their CO 2 emissions he said it wasn’t ready and affordable yet. “We want to remove our emissions today” he said “and this means we must limit our investment in direct air capture where plants are still under construction.”

Price was also a concern. Thermo Fisher was willing to spend an average of $80 per metric ton of carbon removed more than most other initiatives want to spend. Market watchers estimate the current price of DAC offsets at about $400 per metric ton. At that price DAC could be only a small part of the pie. Over time Tuthorn said DAC will gain a bigger share of the credits the program buys.

DAC similarly won only a small chunk of Microsoft’s fiscal 2021 carbon removal credit purchases. The software giant bought 1400 t of removal credits from Climeworks 4000 t from biochar and bio-oil projects and 193000 t from soil carbon management. Most of its purchases—1.1 million t—were from forestry projects.

In 2022 Microsoft replaced DAC in its offset portfolio with a project to mineralize CO 2 in old concrete. The company paid an average of $19.40 per metric ton for its 2022 offsets.

Microsoft detailed the problem in its 2022 carbon offset white paper. “High-durability solutions are critical but supply is limited and expensive and many companies cannot yet afford them at scale” it says referring to biochar bio-oil mineralization and DAC. “We need expensive higher durability solutions to become more affordable.” Microsoft says it is both an offset credit customer of Climeworks and an investor in the firm through its Climate Innovation Fund.

“It’s great to have these customers” says Christoph Beuttler head of climate policy at Climeworks. But it’s a chicken-and-egg moment: for prices to come down DAC needs to scale up and to do that DAC needs customers buying carbon offsets. “We are a technology right? So we’re expensive now; we get cheap as—if—we scale up. We need the money now” Beuttler says.

He estimates that DAC needs $100 billion in R&D investment to reduce the price to a point where the technology can really compete.

In a 2021 paper in Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research Klaus Lackner and Habib Azarabadi of Arizona State University were more optimistic. They argue that DAC costs could fall with increased use as solar photovoltaic costs have; it might take only $200 million of carbon credit purchases to bring the cost of DAC down to $100 per metric ton (DOI: 10.1021/acs.iecr.0c04839).

“In just the chemistry there’s still a lot of potential that we can tap into” Beuttler says. “But obviously there’s also a lot to gain from economies of scale. The ones behind me are handmade in Switzerland” he says pointing to a photo of a Climeworks DAC module. That is “probably not the most cost-efficient way to produce them” he adds. “If we continue making them by hand it will remain a luxury product.”

Climeworks is planning to build a plant in 2024 that will be 10 times as large as Orca moving the firm in the right direction on both chemistry advances and economies of scale Beuttler says.

Nearly everyone working in DAC agrees that emission reduction is the low-hanging fruit in fighting climate change and should be harvested as quickly as possible. The importance of carbon removal will grow over time though and DAC may be the most scalable trackable and tradable way to cover the “last mile” of hard-to-abate and historical emissions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3N0YXJ0dXAtY2FyYm9uLWRpb3hpZGUtY2FwdHVyZS1saW1lc3RvbmUtYmlsbC1nYXRlcy0yMDIyMDMxOS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bill Gates backs a carbon-capture start-up that uses dirt cheap material,"In this Jan. 18 2016 file photo an oil pump works at sunset in the desert oil fields of Sakhir Bahrain.

A California-based start-up has found a way to use limestone -- a cheap and widely available material -- to remove carbon dioxide directly from the air potentially overcoming a major hurdle in scaling up the technology needed to avoid catastrophic global warming.

Heirloom Carbon Technologies said Thursday it raised $53 million from investors including Breakthrough Energy Ventures a clean-technology fund led by Bill Gates and the Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund.

As a growing number of companies have set goals to reach net-zero emissions in the coming decades demand has surged for ways to offset their ongoing pollution. However experts warn that cheap credits based on avoiding deforestation or building renewable energy projects tend to exaggerate their climate benefits. Technologies that actually remove carbon from the atmosphere can more credibly back the promise of capturing and storing a set amount of greenhouse gas.

But those technologies are still nascent and often require complex machinery making them tens of times more expensive than carbon credits from projects that plant trees or build wind farms which can cost as little as $3 per ton.

One reason for the high cost is that direct-air capture technology has so far relied on the use of expensive solvents that can separate CO₂ from the air like iron filings to a magnet. Once the gas is bound to the solvent it needs to be heated to a high temperature to release the CO₂ which can be captured compressed and buried deep underground in rock formations similar to those that hold oil and natural gas.

Heirloom uses a similar process without the expensive solvents. The company starts by heating limestone also known as calcium carbonate to more than 600°C in an electric furnace that’s powered by renewable electricity -- the most energy-intensive and expensive step. The process releases CO₂ -- which is captured -- and the leftover calcium oxide is spread out in hundreds of trays that are stacked 20-feet high and exposed to the air.

""It looks like cookies in a baking tray"" said Heirloom Chief Executive Officer Shashank Samala. ""We're trying to simplify as much as possible.""

Over months or years calcium oxide gets converted back to limestone as it absorbs CO₂ from the air. But Heirloom says that by turning the material into a fine powder and carefully placing the trays to maintain the right conditions it can shrink the process down to a week. Once calcium carbonate is created the cycle is repeated 15 times or so before the material isn't able to effectively capture CO₂.

Samala declined to provide more details on the company's approach because some of the tweaks it has made to accelerate the capture process are quite simple and yet to be patented. The engineering work ""could be easily replicated by others even with a couple of clues"" said Julio Friedmann chief scientist at Carbon Direct Capital Management another fund that contributed to Heirloom's latest investment round.

Heirloom has so far only tested the different steps in its process individually. The new money will be used to build a pilot plant by next year that will put them all together and attempt to capture a few tons of CO₂ every day. Unlike some other direct-air capture start-ups Heirloom does not need to overcome basic science challenges such as whether the capture process can actually work quickly said Friedmann. The technology is based on peer-reviewed research published in 2020.

The most advanced direct-air capture companies include Switzerland-based Climeworks which has sold credits to Gates for as much as $600 a ton and Canada-based Carbon Engineering which has been working for a few years with Occidental Petroleum to build a plant that could capture as much as 1 million tons each year.

Even though Heirloom has yet to build a facility of that size technology companies Stripe Shopify Klarna Bank and Wise have already paid for CO₂ it may capture in the future. Stripe said that it paid more than $2000 a ton with the understanding that the cost will come down rapidly as the technology is scaled up. Heirloom aims to eventually lower the cost of its captured carbon to as little as $50 a ton.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhcHBsZXIuY29tL25hdGlvbi9kcml2ZXJzLW5lZ3Jvcy1vY2NpZGVudGFsLXN0YWdlLXN0cmlrZS1oaWdoLWZ1ZWwtcHJpY2VzLW1hcmNoLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Negros Occidental drivers to stage 2-day strike amid high fuel prices,"This is AI generated summarization which may have errors.

While expressing sympathy for the transport sector the city government and the Negros Occidental provincial government says they would provide rides for affected workers to ensure the delivery of services

BACOLOD CITY Philippines — Drivers in Negros Occidental and its capital city Bacolod will stage a two-day transport strike from Monday March 21 to March 22 to protest skyrocketing prices of petroleum products.

Members of the three major transport groups in the province – United Negros Drivers and Operators Center (UNDOC) Federation of Bacolod Drivers Association and Sentrong Samahan ng mga Tsuper at Operators Negros – said they expect to paralyze 100% of the public transport here on Monday and Tuesday during the “People’s Holiday.”

While expressing sympathy for the transport sector the city government and the Negros Occidental provincial government said they would provide rides for affected workers to ensure the delivery of services.

Provincial Administrator Rayfrando Diaz II said that vehicles from the Capitol Cab Service and buses will be made available for its employees.

The office of Mayor Evelio “Bing” Leonardia said it will offer its “Libre Sakay ” program for all Bacolodnons.

The mayor also said it will be “business as usual” at the City Government Center during the strike.

“Your city government commiserates with the transport groups’ sentiments and disappointments. We express our solidarity with you as you call on national agencies to provide some relief to an already difficult situation that is further compounded by the current health crisis” he said.

“I reiterate my call for sobriety. Let us also show respect for other stakeholders who may not join the protest action” Leonardia said.

Diego Malacad secretary-general of UNDOC said Friday March 18 that they will push through with the strike even after Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi said there could be a big-time rollback in fuel prices next week.

He said that 17 rally centers will be set up across the province during the two-day strike as he called on the public to support the protest action and stay in their homes.

The groups are calling on the government to stop the implementation of the value-added tax and the excise tax on fuel and release additional fuel subsidies.

President Rodrigo Duterte earlier approved the proposed P200 monthly subsidy for indigent families for one year to ease the impact of the surging fuel prices.

Local consumer and labor groups as well as the Social Action Center have signified their support for the two-day strike.

City Administrator Edward Joseph Cuansing said the LGU has allocated nine service vehicles that would ply seven point-to-point routes for residents who need rides.

The pickup points will be at the following: Barangay Bata (Bangga Sawmill); Barangay Alangilan (Plaza); Barangay Sum-ag (near the public cemetery); Barangay Mansilingan (Mormons Church); Barangay Handumanan (Police Station 10) via Alijis; Barangay Estefania (Savemore) and Barangay Banago.

All vehicles will take-off at 4 am. The drop-off point will be at the Bacolod City Public Plaza Cuansing added. – Rappler.com",,,

He was 89.

Young died early Sunday in Virginia Beach son Tom Young Jr. told Rutgers University. Young had been hospitalized.

Young is the winningest coach in the history of the Rutgers men’s basketball program. He had a 239-117 record — .671 winning percentage — between 1973-85.

The pinnacle of his career was the 1975-76 season when the Scarlet Knights went 26-0 in the regular season and were 31-0 reaching the Final Four. They finished 31-2.

He led Rutgers to four NCAA Tournament and five National Invitation Tournament appearances.

Young was noted for teaching the center position grooming the careers of Rutgers Hall of Famers James Bailey and Roy Hinson. He also mentored Eddie Jordan and Phil Sellers.

“He was a father figure to me throughout my entire life” Jordan said.

“I said my prayers for Tom last night” Sellers added. “He turned us boys into young men. I give Tom a lot of credit. He took all the guys that Dick Vitale recruited and took us all to the next step. He had no idea what he was getting into but it didn’t take him very long to lead us to success.”

Young was born in Natrona Heights Pennsylvania and attended Maryland where he starred on the basketball team. After graduating Young went on to coach at Catholic University (1958-67) was an assistant at Maryland (1967-69) and coached American University (1969-73) before landing the job with Rutgers.

Following his 12 seasons leading the Scarlet Knights Young became the head coach at ODU (1985-91) and finished his career as an assistant with the Washington Wizards (2003-07) before retiring in 2007. In six years with the Monarchs Young posted a 90-87 mark making the NCAA Tournament in his first season.

Young finished his career with a 524-328 record and was 6-6 in the NCAA Tournament and 4-4 in the NIT.

After last year’s championship-winning campaign Max Verstappen takes to the track today for the inaugural race of the 2022 Formula 1 season in Bahrain where the young Dutchman and his team will be put to the test more than ever before.

The stakes have been raised for the entire sport too. In 2021 F1 had one of its strongest years to date — from both a financial and consumer adoption standpoint — and sponsorship dollars immediately started pouring in for 2022.

The numbers are only getting more impressive:

F1 brought in $787 million in Q4 2021 revenue and $2.14 billion total for the full year.

U.S. viewership has grown to 36 million viewers.

Globally the company said 445 million people watched at least one race in 2021 a 3% uptick year-over-year.

The championship is reportedly close to inking a reported five-year $150 million bumper sponsorship deal with U.S. software behemoth Salesforce.

As seen on Netflix’s megahit F1 docuseries “Drive to Survive” the sport is filled with innumerable characters. The businesses behind many of the teams are equally compelling — and Red Bull is no exception. In February the team formally changed its name to Oracle Red Bull Racing after a reported $500 million naming rights deal with the tech giant.

Beyond F1 Red Bull has extended its reach into several other sports properties ranging from Bundesliga soccer and extreme sports to motosport esports and ice hockey. But how did an energy drink company become such an iconic figure in sports?

Red Bull’s Marketing Engine

You might be surprised — just as I was — to find that Red Bull is essentially a company that makes nothing. Its famed energy drink has long been the staple product in the company’s portfolio but Red Bull has no hand in manufacturing it.

This dates back to the company’s inception when Austrian businessman Dietrich Maesteshictz first became enamored with a Thai energy drink Kratig Daeng the antidote to jet lag incurred by Bangkok travelers.

Upon finding the secret formula for the energy drink Maesteschitz early-partnered with Kratig Daeng founder Chaleo Yoovidhya with one goal in mind — grow the product in Europe.

Rather than manufacturing its core product — carbonated energy drinks which had yet to see any market traction — Red Bull outsourced the process relying on partners like juice producer Rausch to create the product.

With that taken care of Red Bull and Mateschitz were left to deploy capital in the only way they knew how: marketing.

Fast-forward nearly three decades and the company has transformed into a global marketing behemoth with its hands squarely in what feels like several industries — namely sports.

Soccer: RB Leipzig NY Red Bulls Red Bull Salzburg Red Bull Ghana and Red Bull Brazil

RB Leipzig NY Red Bulls Red Bull Salzburg Red Bull Ghana and Red Bull Brazil Formula 1: Oracle Red Bull Racing and Scuderia AlphaTauri

Oracle Red Bull Racing and Scuderia AlphaTauri Esports: OG Dota 2 and Red Bulls

OG Dota 2 and Red Bulls Ice Hockey: EHC Red Bull München

EHC Red Bull München Nascar: Team Red Bull

Team Red Bull Apparel: AlphaTauri

AlphaTauri Travel Agency: Destination Red Bull

Destination Red Bull Media: Red Bull Media House

The story is similar throughout these ventures. Just like Red Bull’s drinks are made by Rausch their travel agency is run by The Travel Birds their apparel is made by Schoeller Switzerland and the engines that power their F1 race cars are built by Honda.

So What Does Red Bull Do?

The short answer is marketing. Although Red Bull is a private company there’s a way to back into their marketing spend.

It was reported that Red Bull’s revenues reached $6.37 billion in 2020. It’s also assumed that the company spends roughly 30% of its revenues on marketing amounting to $1.91 billion. By comparison PepsiCo spent $1.74 billion on marketing in 2020 representing only 2.5% of the company’s $70.37 billion in revenue during the period.

But in many ways what Red Bull does is bigger than marketing. The operation is more akin to a narrative-building machine whose main goal is to buy distribution and reduce customer acquisition costs.

In order to sell their outsourced products — primarily the Red Bull beverage — the company attaches itself to a variety of properties where their large budgets and high-level creative assets are welcome.

A traditional company like PepsiCo will utilize its marketing budget to sponsor an event or produce a commercial. The investment shows up as an expense on their income statement with hopes of a future return on ad spend through exposure.

Instead of simply paying for sponsorship expenses Red Bull invests in the distribution it receives by buying sports teams building media companies and hosting events.

F1’s Return on Investment for Red Bull

The purchase of Red Bull Racing from Jaguar in 2004 represented an investment of $1. That’s right — $1. But the agreement also stipulated that Red Bull would be required to invest $400 million over the subsequent three years.

The investment in F1 was a bet that a Red Bull car would reach enough eyeballs to earn a strong return on investment. From the look of F1’s most recent financials it was a well-placed bet.

Then there’s the truly innovative part: Red Bull has ostensibly turned an expense into a revenue stream. The company is able to charge other sponsors like Tag Heuer Puma and Tezos for distribution. The ultimate flywheel.

As for reducing customer acquisition costs? Take for example the famed Stratos project where an Austrian skydiver jumped from 24 miles above the Earth’s surface — the first-ever instance of a human breaking the sound barrier without the assistance of an engine.

The stunt cost Red Bull seven years of R&D and $50 million. The result? In the six months following the stunt Red Bull saw its sales increase 7% resulting in $1.6 billion in sales in the U.S. alone. The original video still provides the company with earned media to this day.

In a sense the same strategy is being employed with Red Bull Racing. So when you see their cars on the track this weekend remember that they’re more than just extraordinary feats of engineering — they’re integral cogs in the distribution machine Red Bull has built.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A $49.1M overseas frame (down 46% versus last session) brings the international box office cume on the Matt Reeves-directed pic to $298M with global standing at $598.1M through Sunday.

Gotham’s vigilante hero is eyeing an ultimate worldwide total north of $750M and that will be without a significant boost from China where The Batman bowed this weekend. The opening there took the No. 1 slot with an estimated RMB 76.7M ($12.1M) including $2M from IMAX. This is the best PRC opening for Hollywood in 2022 but is not a number that incites excitement. However as we have noted since last Sunday and beyond the launch was expected to be inauspicious amid a Covid spike that has increasingly hit the market. Approximately 43% of cinemas are now temporarily closed including in Shanghai and Shenzhen among the top areas for imported films.

As we also noted coming into the weekend the movie has strong social mojo in China with a 9 on ticketing platform Maoyan — a figure that did not shift across the frame. However Maoyan has reduced its prediction for the full run to RMB 166.7M ($26.2M).

Given the lukewarm reception to Hollywood movies in China over the past several months it would have been nice to see how The Batman performed had the market been firing on all cylinders. But even without a China boost The Batman will be just fine. To wit: in like-for-likes at today’s rates the overseas total is tracking ahead of Justice League by 9% (a title that did over $106M in China) 22% above Wonder Woman (which did $90M+ in China) and 54% over Godzilla Vs Kong (which did $189M in China). Each of those movies also had substantially shorter runtimes.

Week-on-week holds are still very strong in many markets including Germany (-28%) France (-32%) Brazil (-40%) Australia (-43%) and Mexico (-45%). The Top 5 markets to date are the UK ($43.7M) Mexico ($24.7M) Australia ($21.3M) Brazil ($18.2M) and France ($17.3M).

IMAX deserves a special shout-out this weekend for topping $10B worldwide from narrative non-documentary feature releases. On The Batman it’s at nearly $50M global.

Sony’s Uncharted also hit a new milestone crossing $200M overseas with a $19M sixth weekend lifting the cume to $211.4M for $337.3M global. The biggest play this frame was China where the Tom Holland/Mark Wahlberg-starrer opened last Monday (March 14). The debut was $10.4M; as noted above 43% of cinemas are now closed due to a Covid surge. The Top 5 markets overall are the UK ($30.6M) France ($17.8M) Germany ($12.2M) Australia ($12M) and Spain ($12M).

Universal Meanwhile there was some new action offshore even in in early release. Universal/DreamWorks’ animated The Bad Guys started off in 25 markets as Easter breaks begin and bagged $8.5M. Spain had a particularly strong bow with $1.7M to knock The Batman off his No. 1 perch and tying Encanto for the best animated start of the pandemic.

Arena in line for $105 million in upgrades

Populous has been selected by Oklahoma City to develop a master plan for renovations at the 20-year-old Paycom Center home of the NBA Oklahoma City Thunder.

Paycom Center is in line for $105 million in taxpayer-approved funding for improvements and renovations.

Construction work at the ASM Global-run venue will start later this year beginning with new 300-level seating and elevators and continue in 2023 with new seating a new scoreboard improved 300-level concessions and a bar along with other tech and infrastructure improvements.

Work should be complete by 2028 a timeline that will allow the Thunder to continue to play home games and other events to take place at Paycom Center which opened in 2002 as construction proceeds.

Populous teamed with Oklahoma City architect GSB in designing the $288 million Oklahoma City Convention Center which opened in January of 2021 as the replacement for the Cox Convention Center.

The Thunder and Paycom announced a 15-year naming rights partnership for the former Chesapeake Energy Arena in July.

It was a bold move slotting one of the most enduring rock anthems of the 1980s in the third spot on the set list. But it's a testament to the Rock and Roll Hall of Famers' impressive catalog that they had huge hits to spare for the March 17 show.

Mix in the seasoned musicians' consummate showmanship top-notch lighting and video designs and a shared joy of experiencing a massive concert again after two years of pandemic living and Journey easily kept the all-ages audience — which ranged from grade-schoolers to Baby Boomers — shouting wailing and dancing along for the full hour-and-45-minute set.

Here are five highlights of Journey's March 17 OKC show:

1. Neal Schon's homecoming

Born on Tinker Air Force Base guitarist and founding Journey member Neal Schon clearly digs his Oklahoma roots and his Sooner state fans have happily returned his affections.

""I was born about 15 minutes from here"" Schon told the cheering crowd just after admirably keeping the midnight train of ""Don't Stop Believin'"" ebulliently chugging.

""The last time I played in OKC it was just after my mother died so it's a special place for me.""

Removing his dark sunglasses the 2013 Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame inductee requested that the crowd light up their cellphones for an ardent rendition of ""Lights"" creating a truly dazzling moment.

Schon has been making music professionally for 50 years — he played in Santana before co-founding Journey in 1973 — and both his passion and his prowess are unabated. He frequently wowed the crowd with his sizzling solos.

Grinning broadly around the pick clamped between his teeth Schon elicited howls of approval with his extended intro for the epic ""Wheel in the Sky.""

2. Arnel Pineda's energy

Journey lead singer Arnel Pineda is 15 years into his Cinderella story — Schon famously discovered the Filipino vocalist on YouTube and in 2007 the band flew Pineda then a lounge singer to the U.S. so they could hire him — but he still seems utterly enchanted with his gig fronting the arena rock giants.

Affectionately dubbed the ""Thrilla from Manila"" by his bandmates Pineda 54 lives up to the nickname; he worked so hard he had to change shirts twice during the show.

He continually dashed around the mammoth stage leaped into the air with rock star style and waved his arms like a conductor as the fans belted along — all while delivering the impassioned high tenor vocals the Journey discography demands.

3. Deep cuts

Although the rockers could have slammed out their radio hits and called it a night they kept the set list interesting by mixing in some deep cuts. Even better they used those less-familiar numbers to showcase each highly capable musician on the current Journey lineup.

Deen Castronovo was a thrill to behold as he did dynamic double duty on drums and vocals for the dramatic ode ""Mother Father."" Keyboardist and singer Jason Derlatka also played on while spelling Pineda on the yearning ballad ""Suzanne.""

Jonathan Cain showed off skills every bit as flashy as his red piano not only on his traditional pre-""Open Arms"" solo but also on the story song ""Dead or Alive.""

4. Hit parades

When they did roll out their signature songs Journey cannily lined them up in high-octane hit parades zipping through two or three smashes with hardly a pause in between. Although it's practically impossible to beat the one-two punch of ""Don't Stop Believin'"" and ""Lights"" Pineda's playful performance on ""Lovin' Touchin' Squeezin'"" provided a fun contrast to an emotional rendition of ""Faithfully"" which the band dedicated to U.S. military servicemen and women that was followed by the fervent love song ""Open Arms.""

The band opted to skip the usual false formality of an encore instead sending the crowd home on the strength of a fiery version of ""Separate Ways"" the upbeat live staple ""Be Good to Yourself"" and the irresistible crowd-pleasing closer ""Anyway You Want It."" Along with a veritable downpour of confetti the band members seemed to relish showering the fans with guitar picks drumsticks and free T-shirts.

5. Toto showcases OKC musician

Fellow hitmakers Toto warmed up the crowd with a surprisingly eclectic set including the longing love song ""Roseanna"" the percussive power ballad ""Hold the Line"" and an extended version of their lasting ode to ""Africa.""

Keyboardist Dominique ""Xavier"" Taplin who grew up in OKC got an extra share of the spotlight for his hometown show and he shined on his bluesy arrangement of ""Georgy Porgy.""",,,,,,,,,

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration

Cybercriminals are the order of the day waiting for someone to fall into their scam networks that include PayPal. Clearly the company has nothing to do with it since its transactions are secure unfortunately people use it to defraud in a transaction that appears to be legitimate.

The cybersecurity company Kapersky points out that there are different scams: one of them is “payment in advance” to defraud PayPal users. Victims receive notification that they are owed a certain amount of money which could be due to an inheritance lottery or some other compensation.

Whatever the story the victim must first make a small advance (via PayPal although it may be another means) and perhaps fill out a form with personal data to receive the money. Of course the sender of the message disappears and any personal data revealed ends up in a database that may be sold on the dark web.

How to avoid this scam: Do not transfer money or reveal personal information to strangers. Most of these types of messages present many red flags: too generous earnings or compensation misspellings the address of a sender that seems more appropriate to a robot than a person etc.

Another scam is alleged “problems with the PayPal account”. Initially the fraudster sends an email stating that he is from the company and that something is wrong with the recipient's account; to resolve it he only asks to click on a link and log in.

Although it seems simple it is one of the most common scams and is known as phishing where they pose as real and reliable entities to deceive victims. By providing the login details attackers can use them at their leisure to make expenses on behalf of the victim.

How to avoid the scam: Look for errors in the message and the differences between the address that appears and that of the official website. Always remember that PayPal would not report this type of problem with bad wording; it applies to other sites such as Twitter Facebook and more.

The third scam is “overpayment refund” or overpayment in which a buyer makes the payment to the seller but sends an amount greater than the selling price. The buyer claims that this is an error and requests a refund of the difference but immediately upon receipt cancels the original transaction.

How to avoid the scam: In the event of a real mistake it is safer for both parties to cancel the erroneous transaction and allow the payer to start over resending the correct amount and thoroughly reviewing the figure. If they refuse you should contact PayPal support immediately.

The following scam pointed out by Kapersky is related to “delivery and cancellation of payment”. In this tactic the scammers who pose as buyers and ask a seller to ship the goods using their favorite delivery service. The criminals change the delivery address and then file a complaint saying that the goods never arrived.

Another possible form of scam could be that the parcel company was a front allowing a dishonest buyer to recover their money using existing legitimate mechanisms for goods shipped in good faith.

Finally this type of scam can be perpetrated by replacing the address: the buyer provides a false address and after several failed delivery attempts the company asks him where his purchase should be delivered. That way they receive the package but file a complaint against the seller claiming they didn't receive anything. Given the numerous reports of failed delivery PayPal may believe the scammer.

How to avoid the scam: Use only delivery services that trusted people have previously tried. Never send anything before receiving payment and be sure to keep all receipts.

By Kim Hyun-bin



LG Electronics has suspended all shipments of goods to Russia following Samsung Electronics' decision to do so due to the disruption in global maritime logistics that has worsened in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.



""LG Electronics is suspending all shipments to Russia and will continue to keep a close watch on the situation as it unfolds"" LG Electronics said through its global newsroom. ""We are deeply concerned for the health and safety of all people and LG remains committed to supporting humanitarian relief efforts.""



The company says the suspension of shipments to Russia came in response to global maritime logistics disruptions.



Global shipping companies such as Germany's Hapag-Lloyd Denmark's Musk and Switzerland's MSC have suspended shipping to Russia due to their participation in sanctions against Russia.



Earlier this month Samsung Electronics announced that all shipments to Russia had been suspended due to logistics disruptions.



However neither company has declared a total boycott of sales to the Russian market. Nevertheless analysts believe the companies have taken a position that satisfies the international community on sanctions against Russia.



After Russia invaded Ukraine last month global companies such as Starbucks Coca-Cola Nike Apple GM PayPal FedEx Boeing and Tesla have been taking part in the boycott of Russia.



Although public opinion on the international sanctions is strong local companies are hesitant to take part in the boycott prematurely as their large investments and leading sales in the Russian market could make them lose ground to pro-Russian countries such as China. This situation is why the companies have chosen to suspend their shipments to Russia instead of taking part in the boycott directly.



LG Electronics operates a home appliance and TV production plant at a factory outside of Moscow. Products produced at this plant are sold to Russia and the neighboring Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).



Although LG Electronics' Russian plant is currently in operation disruptions are inevitable if the suspension prolongs and their stock of key parts is exhausted.



According to LG Electronics' business report last year's sales in Russia and the neighboring region totaled 2.033 trillion won ($1.68 billion).

In the present day flood irrigation methods are used to bring water to 85 percent of all irrigated crops worldwide an area roughly totaling 600 million acres. However this practice is wasteful as 70 percent of the water that is used in the process is ultimately lost but the expensive costs of alternatives to flood irrigation have prevented many struggling farmers from making a switch.

To alleviate this obstacle N-Drip’s high-pressure irrigation system delivers water to all types of crops using gravity which cuts maintenance demands and reduces energy requirements by a whopping 70 percent making it more of an accessible alternative for all types of farmers. N-Drip deployed its irrigation system in 2019 and is currently operating in 17 countries with India Australia and the southwestern United States being its primary business hubs.

Farmers using N-Drip routinely achieve up to 70 percent water savings and see 33 percent increases in crop yields among its other benefits. Plus carbon (CO2) emissions associated with flood irrigation can be slashed by as much as 83 percent and methane emissions by as much as 78 percent by transitioning to N-Drip’s gravity irrigation system.

“We’re thrilled to partner with PepsiCo with the goal of removing barriers to access introducing and implementing N-Drip to farmers around the world” said Eran Pollak CEO of N-Drip. “As PepsiCo sources crops from farms of all types and sizes N-Drip’s proprietary technology allows our partnership to make precise irrigation accessible to all types of farmers from those with massive farms to those with one-acre plots.”

PepsiCo sources over 25 crops across 60 countries and scales the adoption of regenerative farming practices under its PepsiCo Positive initiative pep+. This effort will contribute to its pep+ agriculture goals of “improving direct agricultural supply chain water use efficiency by 15% by 2025 (compared to 2015 levels) in areas of high-water-risk spreading regenerative agriculture practices across 7 million acres of farmland and strengthening the livelihoods of more than 250000 people in its agricultural supply chain.”

“To date we’ve implemented N-Drip’s technology with farmers in India Vietnam and the U.S. and saw improved crop yields reduced fertilizer usage and 50% less water consumed compared to flood irrigation” said Rob Meyers VP Sustainable Agriculture PepsiCo. “We’re thrilled to grow our partnership further by scaling N-Drip’s technology to make an even bigger impact across our agricultural footprint.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vcGVwc2ljby1zcGFya3MtZnVyeS1kZWFsLWV4cG9ydC1zY290dGlzaC1zZWVkLXBvdGF0b2VzLXJ1c3NpYS0yMDIyLTPSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL3BlcHNpY28tc3BhcmtzLWZ1cnktZGVhbC1leHBvcnQtc2NvdHRpc2gtc2VlZC1wb3RhdG9lcy1ydXNzaWEtMjAyMi0zP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pepsi sparks anger over deal to send Scottish seed potatoes to Russia,"The potatoes will be sent to Russia in the next few days. Photo by Philipp Schulze/picture alliance via Getty Image

PepsiCo has come under fire for agreeing to send 2000 tonnes of Scottish seed potatoes to Russia.

The export deal is thought to be worth nearly $800000 per The Times.

The morality of the deal has angered traders and Ukrainians given Russia's invasion of the country.

PepsiCo has drawn criticism after signing a deal to export Scottish seed potatoes to Russia amid its invasion of Ukraine.

The Times of London reported that the deal with Aberdeen-based seed potato growers Saltire Seed came with the approval of the Scottish government. A government spokesperson denied this and told The Times that it did not approve export deals.

According to the outlet 2000 tonnes of seed potatoes will be sent to Russia in coming days. The deal is estimated to be worth around $800000 (£600000).

One trader told The Times that the deal was immoral given Russia's unprecedented invasion of Ukraine which has affected the lives of many Ukrainians. ""Don't they understand the offence they're causing?"" he said. ""I hope public opinion will force them to reconsider"" he said.

PepsiCo did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment made outside of normal working hours.

The deal comes at a time when several major corporations have cut trade ties with Russia in recent weeks. PepsiCo recently announced it had suspended select beverage sales capital investments and all advertising in Russia.

According to a statement to The Times however PepsiCo's CEO Ramon Laguarta said it would continue selling ""other products in Russia including daily essentials such as milk and other dairy offerings baby formula and baby food.""

A PepsiCo spokesperson told the outlet that as a food and beverage company it ""must stay true to the humanitarian aspect"" of the business. ""We are continuing to support the livelihoods of the 40000 Russian agricultural workers in our supply chain as they face significant challenges and uncertainty ahead"" they said.

Per The Times Iryna Terlecky head of the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain also took a jab at the Scottish government over the deal and questioned its morality.

After last year’s championship-winning campaign Max Verstappen takes to the track today for the inaugural race of the 2022 Formula 1 season in Bahrain where the young Dutchman and his team will be put to the test more than ever before.

The stakes have been raised for the entire sport too. In 2021 F1 had one of its strongest years to date — from both a financial and consumer adoption standpoint — and sponsorship dollars immediately started pouring in for 2022.

The numbers are only getting more impressive:

F1 brought in $787 million in Q4 2021 revenue and $2.14 billion total for the full year.

U.S. viewership has grown to 36 million viewers.

Globally the company said 445 million people watched at least one race in 2021 a 3% uptick year-over-year.

The championship is reportedly close to inking a reported five-year $150 million bumper sponsorship deal with U.S. software behemoth Salesforce.

As seen on Netflix’s megahit F1 docuseries “Drive to Survive” the sport is filled with innumerable characters. The businesses behind many of the teams are equally compelling — and Red Bull is no exception. In February the team formally changed its name to Oracle Red Bull Racing after a reported $500 million naming rights deal with the tech giant.

Beyond F1 Red Bull has extended its reach into several other sports properties ranging from Bundesliga soccer and extreme sports to motosport esports and ice hockey. But how did an energy drink company become such an iconic figure in sports?

Red Bull’s Marketing Engine

You might be surprised — just as I was — to find that Red Bull is essentially a company that makes nothing. Its famed energy drink has long been the staple product in the company’s portfolio but Red Bull has no hand in manufacturing it.

This dates back to the company’s inception when Austrian businessman Dietrich Maesteshictz first became enamored with a Thai energy drink Kratig Daeng the antidote to jet lag incurred by Bangkok travelers.

Upon finding the secret formula for the energy drink Maesteschitz early-partnered with Kratig Daeng founder Chaleo Yoovidhya with one goal in mind — grow the product in Europe.

Rather than manufacturing its core product — carbonated energy drinks which had yet to see any market traction — Red Bull outsourced the process relying on partners like juice producer Rausch to create the product.

With that taken care of Red Bull and Mateschitz were left to deploy capital in the only way they knew how: marketing.

Fast-forward nearly three decades and the company has transformed into a global marketing behemoth with its hands squarely in what feels like several industries — namely sports.

OG Dota 2 and Red Bulls Ice Hockey: EHC Red Bull München

EHC Red Bull München Nascar: Team Red Bull

Team Red Bull Apparel: AlphaTauri

AlphaTauri Travel Agency: Destination Red Bull

Destination Red Bull Media: Red Bull Media House

The story is similar throughout these ventures. Just like Red Bull’s drinks are made by Rausch their travel agency is run by The Travel Birds their apparel is made by Schoeller Switzerland and the engines that power their F1 race cars are built by Honda.

So What Does Red Bull Do?

The short answer is marketing. Although Red Bull is a private company there’s a way to back into their marketing spend.

It was reported that Red Bull’s revenues reached $6.37 billion in 2020. It’s also assumed that the company spends roughly 30% of its revenues on marketing amounting to $1.91 billion. By comparison PepsiCo spent $1.74 billion on marketing in 2020 representing only 2.5% of the company’s $70.37 billion in revenue during the period.

But in many ways what Red Bull does is bigger than marketing. The operation is more akin to a narrative-building machine whose main goal is to buy distribution and reduce customer acquisition costs.

In order to sell their outsourced products — primarily the Red Bull beverage — the company attaches itself to a variety of properties where their large budgets and high-level creative assets are welcome.

A traditional company like PepsiCo will utilize its marketing budget to sponsor an event or produce a commercial. The investment shows up as an expense on their income statement with hopes of a future return on ad spend through exposure.

Instead of simply paying for sponsorship expenses Red Bull invests in the distribution it receives by buying sports teams building media companies and hosting events.

F1’s Return on Investment for Red Bull

The purchase of Red Bull Racing from Jaguar in 2004 represented an investment of $1. That’s right — $1. But the agreement also stipulated that Red Bull would be required to invest $400 million over the subsequent three years.

The investment in F1 was a bet that a Red Bull car would reach enough eyeballs to earn a strong return on investment. From the look of F1’s most recent financials it was a well-placed bet.

Then there’s the truly innovative part: Red Bull has ostensibly turned an expense into a revenue stream. The company is able to charge other sponsors like Tag Heuer Puma and Tezos for distribution. The ultimate flywheel.

As for reducing customer acquisition costs? Take for example the famed Stratos project where an Austrian skydiver jumped from 24 miles above the Earth’s surface — the first-ever instance of a human breaking the sound barrier without the assistance of an engine.

The stunt cost Red Bull seven years of R&D and $50 million. The result? In the six months following the stunt Red Bull saw its sales increase 7% resulting in $1.6 billion in sales in the U.S. alone. The original video still provides the company with earned media to this day.

In a sense the same strategy is being employed with Red Bull Racing. So when you see their cars on the track this weekend remember that they’re more than just extraordinary feats of engineering — they’re integral cogs in the distribution machine Red Bull has built.",,,
PFE,Pfizer,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAzLzIwL3dpbGwtcGZpemVyLWJlLWEtdHJpbGxpb24tZG9sbGFyLXN0b2NrLWJ5LTIwNDAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will Pfizer Be a Trillion-Dollar Stock by 2040?,"It may not be probable but it's definitely possible.

Home to the likes of tech heavyweights like Apple and Alphabet the club of companies worth more than $1 trillion in market cap is quite exclusive. So far no single enterprise in the healthcare sector has been able to join the cadre -- but could Pfizer (PFE 1.26%) eventually be the first?

Right now Pfizer's market cap is about $303 billion. Could it grow to reach somewhere near $1 trillion in the next 18 years? Let's do a few calculations and compare what we find to its core business model and past performance to see how realistic that might be. I think the answer may surprise you.

Setting the stage

As we all know Pfizer is a pharma company that's responsible for developing and selling medicines.

The company's trailing-12-month revenue is approximately $81.2 billion though management expects to bring in roughly $100 billion this year. Therefore I'll be using that figure as my starting point and projecting its inflows forward by 17 years instead of 18 to compensate.

Assuming that Pfizer meets its estimates for 2022 its total revenue will grow by around 23% year over year. That burst of growth is all but guaranteed to be temporary and perhaps even untenable in the long run. In short sales of the company's coronavirus vaccine Comirnaty and its coronavirus antiviral pill Paxlovid are the major drivers for such a large jump in income. Paxlovid is anticipated to earn $22 billion and for Comirnaty $32 billion. In fact without these two wonder medicines the business admits that it would have only grown by around 6% in 2021.

Still it seems likely that the world will continue to need a steady supply of medicines combating the coronavirus as it's unlikely to leave us fully anytime soon. In 2022's revenue mix Comirnaty and Paxlovid will likely account for $54 billion which is equal to 54% of the year's expected total.

Let's assume there will be some ongoing demand for these products for the duration of our projection but that there won't be an explosion of growth like there was in 2021 and 2022. After all developed markets are likely saturated with coronavirus jabs and it isn't the only company making effective vaccines or antivirals to fight the pandemic. And remember that Pfizer's base of revenue was expanding slightly even without these two products.

So for the purposes of the projection I'll assume it can continue to grow its annual revenue by at least 8% each year for the next 17 years. That's not an unsustainably fast pace for a mature company but it does bake in another set of assumptions namely that the pharma will continue to be effective at discovering developing and commercializing new medicines.

Will it join the trillion-dollar club?

Now that we've pinned down an estimate of Pfizer's future growth rate it's time to get down to valuation. The company's trailing 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is currently around 3.5 which is on the lower side of its normal range over the past decade. Let's say that its valuation won't be changing much over time since it's unlikely that there will be another event like the pandemic that could massively shake up the market's price sensitivity and ideas of the stock's value.

Given everything outlined above we can now take an educated guess at whether the stock will be worth $1 trillion by 2040. If it can increase its revenue at a rate of 8% per year the company will be making a grand total of $300.4 billion per year by our deadline. If we multiply that value by the P/S ratio we get a market cap of (drumroll please) just over $1 trillion!

Of course it's important not to read too much into this result.

Though in principle it's possible for Pfizer to be worth $1 trillion by 2040 if it maintains the conditions I specified it has gone through entire decades where growth was hard to come by. For example between 2009 and 2019 its compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for sales was just over 0.3% per year. Past performance doesn't imply future performance but it does demonstrate that it's (really) hard for massive businesses to keep expanding at a consistent rate over time.

Then again that period wasn't during a global pandemic where it was making two of the most effective and widely distributed tools to protect human health.

In closing it's highly probable that Pfizer will experience quite a bit of growth in the next few years though it's also highly probable that the pace of that growth will start to ebb simply because it's tough to maintain such momentum. If you're looking for a long-term investment to hold for years and years this stock could easily be it -- just don't expect it to beat the market when sales of coronavirus medicines reach their peak.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy8yMC9oZWFsdGgvam9obnNvbi1hbmQtam9obnNvbi1jb3ZpZC0xOS12YWNjaW5lL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAU5odHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIyLzAzLzIwL2hlYWx0aC9qb2huc29uLWFuZC1qb2huc29uLWNvdmlkLTE5LXZhY2NpbmU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Reassuring' data suggests Johnson & Johnson vaccine may still have a role to play against Covid-19,"CNN —

The US public and even some health experts may have underestimated the Covid-19 vaccine made by Janssen a division of Johnson & Johnson new data shows. And there’s emerging evidence that it could still play an important role ahead.

A study published Thursday in the medical journal JAMA Network Open found that the J&J vaccine remains durable and effective even through the surge of cases caused by the Delta variant. It was 76% effective overall in preventing Covid-19 infections and 81% effective in preventing Covid-related hospitalizations. The study also showed that it provided lasting immunity at least six months after the shots.

And a CNN analysis of information collected by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed the J&J vaccine had the lowest breakthrough infection rate of all the vaccines since the week ending December 25 the latest five weeks of available data.

In January during the Omicron surge breakthrough infections were highest among those who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine followed by those who got Moderna. Those vaccinated with the Johnson & Johnson shot had the lowest incidence of breakthrough infections.

As of the week ending January 22 there were 650 infections per 100000 people with the J&J vaccine. With Moderna there were 757 per 100000 and with Pfizer the rate was 862 per 100000.

Unvaccinated people were particularly vulnerable to getting sick during the Omicron and Delta surges just as they were with the original version of the coronavirus. They were 3.2 times as likely to get sick as people who had the J&J vaccine. The unvaccinated were 2.8 times as likely to become infected than those who got Moderna and 2.4 times as likely as those who got Pfizer.

“What we saw in the summertime and the fall during the Delta surge is that all three vaccines protected very very well. But breakthrough rates in August September of last year with the Janssen vaccine were slightly higher than Pfizer and Moderna was slightly lower. But those differences were relatively small” said Dr. Dan Barouch director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. He helped to develop and study the J&J vaccine.

“But what we saw over time is that those differences then narrowed” he said. “And by the first week of December what we saw in the data is that the lines cross” with incidence rates for the J&J/Janssen vaccine becoming lower than the others.

‘Reassuring’ data for J&J recipients

In March 2021 the J&J vaccine was the third to be authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration and the initial response was more muted than the milestone authorizations of the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.

The vaccines work differently. The mRNA vaccines deliver blueprints essentially that train your body trains to fight that particular infection and any similar infection down the road. Adenovirus-vector vaccines like J&J’s use a virus that can act like a Trojan horse. But instead of soldiers jumping out the adenovirus releases genes that encode the coronavirus’ spike protein.

The J&J vaccine stood out for other reasons too: It came as a convenient single dose and didn’t require special refrigeration whereas the mRNA vaccines required two doses and Pfizer’s needed special cold storage. The flexibility was appealing for people who were afraid of shots or didn’t have the time to get two shots. It was also better for countries without a solid health care infrastructure.

But its performance tempered some of the enthusiasm around it especially from the public.

Whereas the mRNA vaccines were hailed for “astonishing” efficacy of more than 90% the news that J&J was 65% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 among clinical trial volunteers underwhelmed some.

From the start the J&J vaccine supply was more limited. After after the vaccine was authorized the federal government briefly paused its use due to safety concerns around rare blood clotting events. Even once vaccinations resumed the pace of J&J vaccinations never recovered.

In December the CDC changed its recommendations to say shots made by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech are preferred over J&J’s. It also urges people who got the J&J shot to get a booster of one of the mRNA vaccines two months later.

The protection that the Covid-19 vaccines offered has waned over time and none of them works as well against the variants that have popped up since the original coronavirus surfaced. But the science is starting to show that people who got the J&J Covid-19 vaccine may have some advantage.

Barouch told CNN that he “wasn’t surprised at all” to see that the durability of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine appears to be last longer than that of the mRNA vaccines – Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna – based on the incidence of breakthrough infections.

The mRNA vaccine technology has been shown to quickly elicit a potent and robust immune response after vaccination but that can wane over time. Johnson & Johnson’s virus-vector platform may not spark as powerful of an immune response in the short term but it is known to have strong durability.

“Over time the efficacy of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines goes down the efficacy of the J&J vaccines remains stable and so it is exactly as you would predict: that they will converge and they will then cross” Barouch said.

The J&J vaccine also might have “a particular edge” he said.

“The immune system is actually made of two arms: the antibodies side and the T cells. And the type of T cells that are critical for prevention of serious illness are called CD8 T cells” Barouch said. “The J&J vaccine raises better CD8 T cells than the Pfizer and other mRNA vaccines so the J&J vaccine might have a particular edge for variants like Omicron that largely escaped from antibody responses.”

Overall Barouch called this data “very reassuring” for recipients of the J&J vaccine.

“They should be reassured that they received a vaccine that gives very good protection for a long period of time” Barouch said. “And I think the second message is that I think people should learn about these new data in terms of considering booster shots as well.”

Prospects as a booster?

David Montefiori a virologist at Duke University Medical Center said “the J&J vaccine has kind of gotten a bad rap because of the efficacy but the stability of the response is intriguing.”

The antibody level went down with every vaccine during the Omicron surge and that could mean people need an additional booster. More research is needed to find out.

A yet-unpublished study by the National Institutes of Health looking at a mix-and-match vaccine strategy saw good results when J&J was included Montefiori said.

“In people who got the Pfizer vaccine initially and then a boosted with the J&J vaccine those people made pretty high levels of neutralizing antibodies to Omicron: 10 times higher than people who got two shots with just the J&J vaccine” he said. “So the J&J vaccine might be a good booster for people who got an mRNA vaccine initially.”

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine can be used for primary doses or as a booster but the CDC says the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are recommended in most situations because of the risk of serious adverse events with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

The J&J vaccine has been linked to rare cases of blood clots with low platelets known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome or TTS. “It occurs at a rate of about 3.83 cases per million Janssen doses and has resulted in deaths” the CDC says.

Dr. Angela Branche an infectious disease specialist and associate professor of medicine at the University of Rochester said the side effect profile of the J&J vaccine “remains something that’s of concern for some groups where that risk is high.” Women ages 30 to 49 years are at increased risk of this rare adverse event the CDC says.

But if that research pans out the J&J vaccine may be useful as a booster for only certain populations.

“For some groups where that risk of developing serious blood clots is not very high like older adults this may be a good strategy” Branche said.

Montefiori said the vaccine deserves more study.

“I think there might still be a place for the J&J vaccine in the long-term picture of this pandemic” Montefiori said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZXJrc2hpcmVlYWdsZS5jb20vYXAvZmFjdGNoZWNrL3BmaXplci1zLXN0b2NrLWhhcy1ub3QtYmVlbi1yZW1vdmVkLWZyb20tdGhlLW55c2UvYXJ0aWNsZV8zOGU4YTA4OC1hNmRhLTExZWMtODJlYS1lMzYwMzE2YzI2YjQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer's stock has not been removed from the NYSE,This April 6 2016 file photo shows the Pfizer logo appearing on a screen above its trading post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

Bangladesh’s Beximco Pharma has got a sub-licence from the United Nations-backed Medicines Patent Pool to produce a generic version of Paxlovid Pfizer's oral treatment for Covid-19.

Beximco will manufacture this drug – a combination of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir – in Bangladesh following successful technology transfer and manufacturing regulatory approvals.

Nirmatrelvir is a novel main protease inhibitor that specifically blocks the activity of the enzyme needed for SARS-CoV2 viral replication.

Ritonavir is a strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitor and pharmacokinetic boosting agent for nirmatrelvir.

Paxlovid got the emergency use authorisation from the US Food and Drug Administration in December 2021 for the treatment of mild-to-moderate Covid in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older).

The sub-licence was granted under a voluntary licencing agreement between Pfizer and Medicines Patent Pool to facilitate broader global access to this antiviral combination.

On 20 January 2022 Beximco got a sublicence from Medicines Patent Pool to produce another Covid drug molnupiravir which was developed by MSD and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics.

United Nations-backed Medicines Patent Pool has granted Beximco Pharmaceuticals a sub-licence to produce a generic version of Pfizer’s Paxlovid an antiviral drug to be used in Covid-19 treatment.

Under the agreement Beximco will manufacture this drug in Bangladesh following successful technology transfer and manufacturing regulatory approvals said Beximco in a statement on Friday.

The sub-licence was granted under a voluntary licencing agreement between Pfizer and MPP to facilitate broader global access to this antiviral combination.

Paxlovid is a combination of Pfizer’s investigational antiviral PF-07321332 and a low dose of ritonavir an antiretroviral medication traditionally used to treat HIV. It is administered orally.

Earlier in December 2021 the drug was granted for emergency use authorised by the US Food and Drug Administration. It was approved for the treatment of mild-to-moderate Covid-19 in adults and paediatric patients (12 years of age and older) who are at high risk for progression to severe Covid-19.

“We are delighted that MPP has granted Beximco Pharma a sub-licence to produce Pfizer’s breakthrough Covid-19 treatment” Beximco Pharma Managing Director Nazmul Hassan commented.

“This further collaboration with MPP proves our commitment to providing a broad selection of affordable treatments to combat Covid-19 in low- and middle-income countries as well as our strong reputation as a producer of high-quality generic medicines” he added.

On 20 January 2022 Beximco was granted a sub-licence by MPP to produce another Covid-19 drug Molnupiravir which was developed by MSD and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics."

Point guard Deivon Smith is transferring to St. John's from Utah giving Hall of Fame coach Rick Pitino a veteran replacement for Daniss Jenkins next season.

A fifth-year senior Smith ranked sixth in the country with 7.1 assists per game last season. He averaged 13.3 points and 6.3 rebounds for the Utes compiling five triple-doubles -- second most during a single season in NCAA history and the most by any Pac-12 player.

In a St. John's news release Monday Pitino said the 6-foot Smith reminds him of Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier a standout player for Pitino at Louisville.

""Super excited to have Deivon Smith joining the Johnnies"" Pitino said. ""Total dog who rebounds creates and scores.""

Smith from Decatur Georgia played his freshman season at Mississippi State and then spent two years with Georgia Tech. He shot a career-high 46.7% from the field in 28 games during his only season at Utah.

Two of his triple-doubles came during Utah's run to the NIT semifinals and he scored a career-best 28 points against tournament runner-up Indiana State on April 2.

Smith becomes the third notable transfer the Red Storm have landed this offseason joining 7-foot-1 center Vincent Iwuchukwu from USC and 6-foot-7 forward Aaron Scott from North Texas. They both committed last month.

At point guard St. John's also returns sophomore Simeon Wilcher a touted recruit who began to show marked improvement late last season in his limited role as a freshman. Wilcher averaged 2.8 points and 9.1 minutes in 28 games as Jenkins' understudy.

Jenkins followed Pitino from Iona to St. John's for his senior season and propelled the Red Storm to a 20-13 record including 11-9 in conference play for their most Big East wins in 14 years. They reached the Big East tournament semifinals for the first time since 2000 losing 95-90 to eventual NCAA champion UConn.

Jenkins led the team in scoring (14.9 points per game) assists (5.4) steals (1.6) and minutes (30.7) earning second-team All-Big East honors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9uYmEvamF6ei9uZXdzL2VuZC1zZWFzb24tZ3JhZGVzLWV2YWx1YXRpbmctamF6ei1rZXlvbnRlLWdlb3JnZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,End of Season Grades: Evaluating Jazz PG Keyonte George,"Despite the Utah Jazz going just 31-51 on the year there were plenty of memorable and enjoyable pieces to the season. One of the brightest was Keyonte George the rookie out of Baylor who burst onto the scene from day one and seized the Jazz starting point guard role.

It’s hard to expect any more from the 20-year-old who was taken with the 16th pick in last summer's draft. George averaged 13.0 points 4.4 assists and 2.8 rebounds per game for the Jazz. Those numbers were good for fourth in scoring and second in total assists amongst all rookies this year. The passing in particular was a lot better than advertised after not being asked to do much of that while at Baylor.

George’s scoring remains the most intriguing piece of his game. He recorded three games in which he scored over 30 points and went over 20 points in nine others. When he’s playing confidently he can get buckets from all three levels and has plenty of juice from long-range. On February 15 George etched his name into the record books when he knocked down nine three-pointers which tied him for the rookie record and put him all alone for Jazz rookies.

An underrated storyline from the season was the leadership role the rookie took on as the season progressed. Jazz head coach Will Hardy thrust him into the starting point guard role early on and along with this came added responsibility- a responsibility that George seemed comfortable with. Heading into his first full offseason George will have even more of an opportunity to be a leader for this Jazz team that is looking to improve.

Despite all the positives it wasn’t a perfect season for George. He like the Jazz's other guards struggled with efficiency. There was a point in the middle of March where George seemed to have figured out how to get to his spots and score more efficiently but those numbers dipped as his teammates missed games and his name became more prominent on opposing scouting reports. Judging by his end-of-season comments he’s not worried about the misses. George said getting stronger and in better shape would result in the shots falling at a higher clip.

Defensively George is still a work in progress. Although his length stands out there's still plenty of room to grow. He has enough size to play either backcourt position which he used to showcase some nice individual defensive sequences. His off-ball awareness needs to improve as does his general focus on that end but he certainly has the potential to be a fine defender in this league.

One area where George can improve is in his words emotional intelligence. He’s immensely talented but he needs to keep his head up when he misses a shot or makes a silly turnover. He’s young though and there’s so much good that it’s hard to dwell on the bad.

Overall it was a very promising season for George. He’ll head into a big offseason with a lot to learn but a great foundation of skills & intelligence to build on. In a postgame press conference Hardy said that Keyonte could become the future of the Jazz program. That is high praise from his head coach but it is certainly a quote that should make you feel good as a Jazz fan.

McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

T.J. McConnell slices through the defense and gets to the hoop for two 💨 pic.twitter.com/DzNx7AAHj5 — Indiana Pacers (@Pacers) May 7 2024

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

As a member of the Class of 2023 Blocker was a four-star recruit out of Little Rock (Ark.) Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”"

STILLWATER – Jacie Hoyt was introduced as the head coach of Oklahoma State women's basketball on March 20 2022. She came to OSU after serving as head coach at Kansas City from 2017-22.



Her roots in Big 12 country run deep. Her mother Shelly Hoyt is a Kansas High School coaching legend and Jacie who played for her mother in high school went on to play collegiately at Wichita State. In addition to leading the Kansas City program Hoyt's coaching career includes stops at Fort Hays State Nevada and Kansas State.



""There are a million reasons to be excited about Oklahoma State"" Hoyt said. ""First and foremost it's the people and the leadership there. Everyone I've had conversations with at OSU aligns with the beliefs and characteristics that lead to success. It's the community as well. OSU has a fan base that supports the program and we are passionate about giving them something to proud of.""



Her work at Kansas City was transformational. In her five seasons at the helm of the Roos she compiled an 81-65 overall record (55.5 percent) and a 48-31 mark in conference play (60.8 percent). For perspective the six Kansas City coaches before her combined to go 242-437 overall (35.6 percent) and 144-215 in conference play (40.1 percent). In 2021-22 she coached the Roos to their first postseason appearance in a decade.



Hoyt led the Roos to the 2020 Western Athletic Conference regular season championship – the first in program history – and more than 20 wins in two of her final three seasons.



She was honored as the 2020 WAC Coach of the Year to become the first Kansas City coach to ever receive such an honor and her top player Ericka Mattingly was named WAC Player of the Year.



Despite moving to the more difficult Summit League in 2020-21 the Roos finished two spots better than predicted during their first year in the league and placed third in their second year.



In 2018-19 the Roos led the WAC and ranked 24th nationally by averaging 76.0 points per game. Making that even more remarkable is that Hoyt inherited a Kansas City program that finished seventh eighth and fifth in the WAC in scoring offense in the three years prior to her arrival. Twice during Hoyt's tenure did Kansas City finish among the top 50 nationally in scoring offense (2018-19 and 2021-22).



""When we started the search for the next head coach of OSU Cowgirl Basketball we were looking for a program builder someone with high integrity and energy a role model for our student-athletes and a recruiter with experience attracting Big 12 caliber players"" OSU Athletic Director Chad Weiberg said. ""We believe we have found that in Jacie and I look forward to our players and fans getting to know her.""



A consistent trait the Roos displayed during Hoyt's time as head coach was the ability to shoot.



Her 2021-22 squad ranked in the top 30 nationally in both three-point field goal percentage and free throw percentage and her 2020-21 squad finished 17th nationally in three-point field goals made per game. Kansas City ranked 62nd or better nationally in three-point field goals made in four of her five years as head coach and in her final two seasons ranked 37th and 28th respectively in three-point field goal percentage.



Another signature trait of Hoyt's Kansas City teams was sharing the ball. In four of her five seasons the Roos ranked either first or second in the conference in assists per game leading the league in 2018-19 and 2020-21.



She took the reins of the Kansas City program after gaining three years of Big 12 experience as an assistant coach under Jeff Mittie at Kansas State from 2014-17. Hoyt helped the Wildcats to NCAA Tournament victories in back-to-back seasons. The 2016-17 squad won 22 games overall and 11 in Big 12 play which marked the highest totals for the program in nine seasons.



Hoyt recruited and coached seven All-Big 12 student-athletes including two All-Defensive Team and two All-Freshman Team selections headlined by Breanna Lewis the 23rd pick in the 2017 WNBA Draft by the Dallas Wings.



She assisted in all facets of recruiting scouting game planning and on-court coaching for the Wildcats. Hoyt also coordinated and managed all areas of the elite overnight and day camps in addition to the High School Coaching Academy. She was a Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA) 30 Under 30 honoree in 2017.



Prior to her time in Manhattan Hoyt's first full-time Division I coaching job came at Nevada where she was an assistant under her college coach Jane Albright from 2011-14.



During her time there Nevada achieved the program's first winning season in three years in 2013-14 and set a program record with 12 victories in Mountain West Conference play. She recruited and coached four all-conference players including Mimi Mungedi the 2013-14 Mountain West Co-Defensive Player of the Year and 25th selection in the 2015 WNBA Draft by the Tulsa Shock.



Hoyt was a graduate assistant coach at Fort Hays State during the 2010-11 season where she recruited and coached two All-MIAA selections. She earned a Master of Science in Communication from FHSU.



As a student-athlete at Wichita State from 2006-09 Hoyt was a team captain for Albright and started every game at point guard during her final two seasons. In 2008-09 she ranked fourth in the Missouri Valley Conference in assists. She earned the 2009 Iron Shocker Award. Hoyt was also a standout in the classroom earning a spot on the Missouri Valley Conference WSU Athletic Director and WSU Dean's Honor Rolls. She graduated Cum Laude with a bachelor's degree in 2009.



During her high school years Hoyt enjoyed one of the most prolific scoring careers in Kansas prep history finishing with 2016 points in only three seasons at Hoxie (Kan.) HS. Her career average of 26.6 points per game ranks sixth in state history. As a senior she averaged 28.4 points 7.4 assists 6.3 rebounds and 6.1 steals per game. She was a three-time all-state performer in basketball and volleyball and was also a state champion in multiple track events.



Hoyt comes from a family of educators. She is the daughter of Kansas high school coaching legend Shelly Hoyt who at one point led Hoxie HS to a state record 107 straight wins and four consecutive state titles. Her mother is currently the head coach at Eureka (Kan.) HS. Her father Scott is the superintendent in Eureka and two of her sisters Tabitha and Corinna are teachers. A third sister Terran served as a graduate assistant on Jacie's staff at Kansas City.



She is married to Daniel Heflin.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzAzLzE5L3doeS1nYXMtcHJpY2VzLWFyZS1zcGlraW5nLWV2ZW4tdGhvdWdoLXVzLWhhcy1lbm91Z2gtZW5lcmd5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Ukraine is spiking gas prices — even though the US has enough energy,"After decades of trying America is finally energy independent.

At least on paper.

We’re currently the world’s top producer of crude oil gasoline’s raw ingredient and generate more crude than we consume. We also sell more of it overseas than we buy from foreign companies.

Yet we still rely heavily on imported oil.

That’s because our wells are located far from the Northeast and West Coast where most of our gasoline is consumed and we don’t have the pipelines to transport it.

“It’s not in all the right places” said Andy Lipow president of Lipow Oil Associates a consulting company in Houston.

Despite the US producing about 11.6 million barrels of crude per day — No. 1 in the world followed by Saudi Arabia’s 10 million and Russia’s 10 million — almost all of the drilling occurs in the Midwest and Southwest with Texas accounting for five million barrels daily and New Mexico producing one million Lipow said.

“Then you have lesser amounts coming from Oklahoma Colorado and Wyoming” Lipow said. Alaska which produced two million barrels a day in 1988 is now at 450000.

The challenge of moving oil thousands of miles across the country means that it’s sometimes cheaper and easier to buy it from other countries.

“We’re lucky to be located in between two friendly oil-producing nations — Canada and Mexico. They provide the vast majority of our energy imports” said Jim Meigs former editor-in-chief of Popular Mechanics who writes about energy issues.

This also means the US is part of a global energy market. Though we don’t rely much on Russian energy Europe is dependent on it. So when Russia invaded Ukraine a sizable part of the global petroleum supply was cut off pushing the price of oil and gas from other sources up. That all leads to Americans paying more at the pump.

“The United States is connected to the world oil market” said Lipow. “The invasion has led to sanctions and a de facto ban of some Russian oil. It might be produced but it isn’t being sold so the market is looking for alternatives.”

Once crude oil is drilled from the ground it goes to refineries to be processed into fuel for our cars and trucks. But most of these refineries are located in the Gulf Coast where 54 percent of our gasoline gets made. Lesser quantities come from California Indiana Ohio and Colorado.

There’s only one refinery in the tri-state area — Bayway owned by Phillips 66 in Linden NJ — and none in New England. “You have two outside of Philadelphia and then zero not a single one until you get to Florida” said Lipow.

“New England is a major importer of gasoline and fuel because there aren’t enough refineries.”

Sky-high gas prices also result from Uncle Sam having no control over the energy markets where prices are determined by a vast array of private companies responding to industry ups and downs.

One answer to weaning ourselves off of foreign oil and price hikes is the electric vehicle some experts say. Despite costing more to buy than regular vehicles hybrid and electric cars are selling well hitting record figures last year Reuters reported.

And “we don’t burn oil to make electricity” said Lipow.

The juice needed to power these cars and trucks comes via natural gas which is cheap and we have in abundance as well as renewable sources — wind solar and hydro — along with nuclear power coal and bio fuels. The nuke industry though struggling financially due to aging plants and low prices for natural gas offers high capacity reactors which are both carbon-free and by far the most efficient way to produce electricity.

But there are challenges. “No one wants a nuke in their backyard” Lipow said nor a giant wind farm near their home or a natural gas pipeline in their town.

The ultimate solution is that Americans need to start embracing the full range of fossil fuel alternatives.

“Nuclear solar wind bio fuels coal. There’s something for everyone to hate. When you go to the supermarket and have 10 different brands to buy you feel like you’ve got options” Lipow said. “We have a list of things we’re unwilling to do rather than wanting to do a lot of things.”

But as a Celebrity Doctor He Raised Significant Concerns,"When Dr. Mehmet Oz appeared as a guest on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show nine days ago to give his thoughts about the worsening humanitarian crisis in Ukraine the celebrity doctor covered expected ground discussing the plight of civilian victims of the war and the “dwindling” supplies of food water and medicine in the country. But the conversation ended with Oz expressing his full support for fracking in Pennsylvania.

Oz spoke from a town hall meeting in Hershey Pennsylvania where he is campaigning as a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate. Flanked by an American flag and the blue state flag of Pennsylvania with a handful of supporters sitting behind him their faces blurred out of focus Oz talked about the grim reality of the war and the toll it’s taken on children in Ukraine.

At one point Hannity asked Oz about the possibility of a covert NATO or American-led military operation to halt the Russian assault on Kyiv and Oz veered away from the tactical aspects of the war and toward another topic entirely: natural gas extraction in Pennsylvania.

“I’m here in Pennsylvania where there’s natural gas under my feet that could address our domestic issues…and more importantly help our allies in Europe wean themselves off their dependence on Russian natural gas” he said. “These folks are livid” he said of Pennsylvanians he has met on his campaign who he says are angry about rising gasoline prices and what lower natural gas production means for national security.

“The state of Pennsylvania has been smart” Hannity said. “They’ve been fracking.”

The recent “Hannity” appearance isn’t the only time that Oz has brought up energy independence and natural gas in an effort to boost his candidacy in a state that is second only to Texas when it comes to natural gas production in the U.S.

But Oz hasn’t always expressed such unreserved support for fracking short for hydraulic fracturing the technique used to extract natural gas from Pennsaylvania’s Marcellus Shale and from shale in numerous other states.

In a syndicated newspaper column he began co-writing in 2007 with Dr. Mike Roizen now the emeritus chief wellness officer at the Cleveland Clinic the two physicians cited the environmental and health risks associated with fracking on several occasions and in one column warned expecting mothers who live near natural gas wells against drinking the water and counseled them to keep three kilometers away from fracking fields.

Now Oz’s campaign website declares that he “will work to overturn” the “heavy-handed regulations that are hurting Pennsylvania jobs” which he says are the result of an “attack” on the energy industry by the Biden administration. Oz reiterated his support for natural gas extraction and for fracking specifically on Newsmax just a few days ago. “Back off Biden” he told host Eric Bolling. “Give us the freedom we need to frack.”

On Hannity’s show he also claimed that there are no pipelines “anywhere in this commonwealth” for shipping gas to other states which isn’t true; pipelines in Pennsylvania connect to New Jersey New York and other surrounding states.

Brittany Yanick communications director for Oz’s campaign said Oz has consistently supported fracking. “Dr. Oz has always supported hydraulic fracturing and a strong domestic energy industry especially in Pennsylvania where we have clean natural gas right under our feet that will guarantee high paying skilled jobs and deliver energy security” she said in a statement that described Oz’s plan for “America’s energy security.”

Fracking has long been seen as a critical issue in Pennsylvania politics one that doesn’t necessarily cut cleanly along party lines. In the 2020 presidential election Joe Biden declined to endorse a fracking ban; he may have been reluctant to come out completely against fracking in part because of concerns about how it would affect voters in this crucial swing state.

Oz’s potential Democratic rivals in the Senate race U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb and Lt. Gov. John Fetterman both oppose a fracking ban. But like his Pennsylvania residency status Oz’s unconditional pro-fracking stance seems to be relatively new.

Dr. Oz’s campaign website places his experience as a doctor front and center using medical metaphors to explain the state of the country (“America’s heartbeat is in a code red”) and his approach to politics (“The Right Medicine”). He says that his career as a surgeon taught him the “emotional fortitude” necessary “to soothe the anxious looks of trusting relatives seeking safety for their loved ones.”

His time as a “health expert” on the Oprah Winfrey Show he writes gave him an ability to “communicate tough stuff to the public.”

“We need to bravely make accurate diagnoses” he writes “and take bold sometimes unpopular steps before we can heal.”

In 2007 in his previous life as a talk show host and celebrity doctor Dr. Oz launched the syndicated newspaper column he co-authored with Roizen which provided expert responses to people’s health questions through King Features Syndicate.

In October 2014 Roizen and Oz responded to a reader who had a question about fracking and health. “I keep hearing that hydraulic fracturing (or fracking) is polluting our air and groundwater and causing serious health problems” Richard F. of Dayton Ohio wrote. “Is that true?”

“We wonder how eager the leaders of the natural gas industry would be to drink well water from a farm next to one of their drilling sites” the doctors answered.

They went on to describe reported air and water pollution “possibly” from fracking in Pennsylvania which has caused symptoms in residents like breathing problems headaches nosebleeds and nausea and they endorsed a policy in New York state that halted fracking until its health effects could be fully studied.

“Better safe than irreversibly sorry” they wrote.

The article concluded with a nod to the oil and gas industry which they said should “welcome” more testing and regulation. The doctors said they were for fracking but only if it doesn’t “cause deadly disease and irreversibly pollute the air and water aquifers.”

A 2015 response tackled a similar fracking question from a reader in Ohio in more definitive terms pointing to the “long-term far-reaching effects” that fracking has on the people living near extraction sites and citing a University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University study of northwest Pennsylvania that showed a connection between living near fracking wells and higher rates of hospitalization.

The doctors quoted the Ohio Environmental Council which called state regulations on fracking “woefully inadequate” considering the environmental and health risks associated with the practice.

In another article from September 2016 a reader named George F. of Williamsport Pennsylvania wrote in with a question about chronic sinus pain and a stuffy nose. “In your area of Pennsylvania there’s extensive fracking going on” the doctors responded citing a Johns Hopkins study that found 24 percent of people with high levels of exposure to active fracking wells suffered from chronic rhinosinusitis migraines and fatigue.

One article from January 2018 detailed the results of a Pennsylvania study that focused on the risks that fracking wells pose to expecting mothers. The study analyzed 1.1 million Pennsylvania birth records from 2004 to 2013 and concluded that babies born to women living within three kilometers of a fracking site suffered higher rates of negative health effects and infants born to mothers who lived within one kilometer of a fracking site were 25 percent more likely to have low birth weights. Low birth weight is linked to a higher risk of infant mortality and is used in public health as an indicator of maternal health nutrition and poverty.

The article recommended that pregnant women living near fracking wells shouldn’t drink the water should use air filters inside and should “try to keep more than 3 kilometers away from the fracking field.”

Staying away from fracking in some regions of Pennsylvania is easier said than done: in 2015 FracTracker estimated that almost 2 million Pennsylvanians lived within one kilometer of an active oil or gas well and more fracking and drilling in the state would put an even larger number of families at risk.

In parsing the co-written column Yanick the Oz campaign’s communications director said that Oz and Roisen “have very different positions on energy policy and fracking.”

Yanick said that Roizen took over “sole management” of the column in 2009 when Dr. Oz’s television show began. “When they disagreed on views he was supposed to clearly specify he felt a different way than Dr. Oz” she said.

Yanick also provided a signed letter from Dr. Roizen about his 20-year partnership with Oz and their work on the columns. “If we disagreed on an editorial direction I would specify that ‘Dr. Roizen’ felt a certain way” he wrote. “We have found several columns where this process was not followed.”

Many of the columns reviewed for this article were written in the voice of both doctors speaking as “we”; none of the columns that dealt with fracking indicated a difference of opinion between the two authors.

Oz may not have managed the column after 2009 but his work on the column with Roizen was included in a profile that appeared in the New York Times in 2010 and Roizen’s professional biography continues to include mention of the column as a joint co-written effort.

David Masur the Executive Director of PennEnvironment a Pennsylvania-focused environmental advocacy organization sees Dr. Oz’s stance on fracking as part of the broader trend toward polarization in American politics which pushes candidates to move toward more extreme viewpoints in order to appeal to voters in their party’s primary.

In Pennsylvania attack ads are already attempting to brand Dr. Oz as a “R.I.N.O.” or “Republican in name only” a liberal outsider with ties to Hollywood. “I think it’s more about a defensive posture” Masur said describing Oz’s recent outspoken support for fracking as a way to respond to Republican opponents’ criticism that he’s not conservative enough.

Whether Oz’s support for fracking will help or hurt him in the general election—or in his long-term political future in Pennsylvania—is a different question. As fracking has spread in Pennsylvania its effects have spread too.

Masur points to the 2020 spill in Marsh Creek State Park which resulted in the release of thousands of gallons of drilling mud into a lake as one example of fracking’s growing negative effects on people living all over the state including in the politically important Southeast. “That’s bigger than partisanship” Masur said. “It doesn’t matter if you’re a Democrat or Republican or an Independent we love our public lands. We love our state parks.”

When fracking was first pitched to the people of Pennsylvania Masur said it was framed as offering a host of advantages—clean energy energy independence good jobs—with no downside. But it’s become clear in the years since as outlined in Dr. Oz’s and Dr. Roizen’s columns that the consequences of unchecked fracking are numerous and Masur believes that knowledge of those consequences is fueling a shift in opinion in the state.

“They over-promised and under-delivered” Masur said of fracking proponents. “The public is smart they see that and go ‘Oh you’re a little bit of a snake oil salesman and you tried to sell me a bill of goods that’s not real.’”

Wetzel’s Pretzels was co-founded by Pasadenan Rick Wetzel. He and his wife Elise are co-founders of Blaze Pizza. Wetzel’s headquarters is on Hugus Alley in Old Pasadena.

“2021’s unprecedented sales speak to the health of this fun-loving brand” Jennifer Schuler Wetzel’s Pretzels CEO said in a statement. “Wetzel’s has so many major accomplishments and milestones from 2021. 2022 is proving to be another great year.”

The brand made history this 2022 with its debut in the Rose Parade.

Wetzel’s Pretzels is pushing ahead with plans to open more than 40 new stores. Beyond conventional locations Wetzel’s continues to expand its non-traditional presence through big-box retailers convenience stores and mobile food trucks.

It also recently announced a partnership with Macy’s starting with its first store-within-a-Macy’s at South Coast Plaza and with more soon to follow.

Last year the brand aligned with the Phillips 66 family of brands in order to “bring pretzels to the people” and to generate additional revenue streams for Phillips 66 convenience stores.

Wetzel’s is also accelerating its food truck rollout the company said.

The statement said the company is setting its sights on reaching their 400th store in 2023.

“Wetzel’s has historically been known as the classic mall treat. While we still believe in the mall and traditional growth methods we’re ecstatic about the innovative and non-traditional models that are ripe for franchisee investment” Jon Fischer Wetzel’s Pretzels Chief Development Officer said.

Recently the company started a military veterans’ franchise program called “From Force to Franchise” which aims to assist qualified individuals who are interested in purchasing a franchise at a discount. It’s one way to say “thank you” for the veterans’ service and to provide them a platform to achieve their dreams of owning a business.

The company is also starting a new diversity initiative – the Wetzel’s Pretzels Access to Equity Program – which supports franchise ownership opportunities for women and minorities."

However which of her Mom’s three previous suitors is her father? To find out she invites them all to her wedding.

For its 99th season at Community Players in Bloomington the much-loved jukebox musical ""Mamma Mia!"" takes you on Sophie’s as well as her Mom’s journey of self-discovery with songs like ""Dancing Queen"" and ""Knowing Me Knowing You"" and ""Thank You for the Music"" from ABBA as the guide.

And while speaking with Director Kinsey Peotter and Assistant Director Missy Freese there is a lot of excitement with bringing this musical to the Community Players stage.

Peotter touched on the theme of self-discovery that happens with Sophie.

""It’s this really empowering feeling especially as a woman just to say that you can go after what you want and whatever it is that you want you can take your time to find and you don’t have to let the world … define what that is for you"" Peotter said.

And Freese connected with that point in saying that her takeaway is that “it is OK to change your mind.”

No doubt when you go to a musical like this get ready for sing-a-long and walkaway humming some of your favorite ABBA tunes.

""Mamma Mia!"" at Community Players is running the weekends of March 18-20 and again March 25-27.

Newgarden rocketed his No. 2 PPG Team Penske Chevrolet past the No. 3 XPEL Team Penske Chevrolet of teammate Scott McLaughlin on the outside of Turn 4 on the final lap and won a drag race to the checkered flag hanging on for victory by .0669 of a second in the first oval race of the NTT INDYCAR SERIES season.

The win was Team Penske’s 600th across all racing disciplines and team owner Roger Penske was ecstatic to lay six crisp $100 bills on Newgarden’s palm in Victory Lane as a special bonus. Newgarden led just three of the 248 laps while a dominant McLaughlin led 186 trips around the high-banked 1.5-mile oval.

SEE: Race Results | Race Highlights

“Unbelievable” Newgarden said. “I think Scott led 95 percent of the laps. I hate doing that to a teammate but I was going for it just like he was.

“Man I was loose; I was driving the thing sideways off (Turns) 3 and 4. I was trying to get a win. I’m just so pleased for everybody. Last lap last corner – that’s what it’s all about at Texas.”

Marcus Ericsson finished third in the No. 8 Huski Chocolate Chip Ganassi Racing Honda 1.3537 seconds behind Newgarden. It was Ericsson’s career-best finish on an oval.

Will Power finished fourth in the No. 12 Verizon Team Penske Chevrolet as Penske drivers earned three of the top four spots in the race. Team Penske also has won both races this season as series points leader McLaughlin triumphed Feb. 27 in the Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg presented by RP Funding.

Six-time series champion and five-time Texas winner Scott Dixon finished fifth in the No. 9 PNC Bank Chip Ganassi Racing Honda.

Seven-time NASCAR Cup Series champion Jimmie Johnson achieved a career-best finish with ease by placing sixth in his first NTT INDYCAR SERIES oval race after starting 18th in the No. 48 Carvana Chip Ganassi Racing Honda. Johnson’s previous best finish was 17th last year as a rookie when he only raced on road and street courses.

“I hoped to qualify in the top 10 and race in the top 10” Johnson said. “Missed the qualifying mark a bit but once we hit the halfway point of the race I really could sense and feel the car. It became second nature and off I went. We knew going oval racing would help and today got us into the competitive mix.”

McLaughlin who started second next to pole sitter Felix Rosenqvist grabbed the lead on Lap 206 when rookie Callum Ilott pitted from the lead after trying to stretch fuel well beyond the normal pit cycles in his No. 77 Juncos Hollinger Racing Chevrolet. McLaughlin put himself into position to inherit the lead a lap earlier by passing Rinus VeeKay’s No. 21 SONAX Chevrolet for second in Turn 1.

Newgarden who started seventh drove to second and pulled to within .462 of a second of McLaughlin with 25 laps to go. McLaughlin expanded that lead to .914 of a second with five laps remaining as both drivers diced through lapped traffic.

New Zealand native McLaughlin tried to manage the gap between his car and the slower cars ahead of Ilott and fellow rookie David Malukas as the final laps ticked down and Newgarden pounced. The gap between the top two was .315 of a second at the white flag.

As McLaughlin slowed slightly with Malukas’ car ahead Newgarden moved up half a lane in Turns 3 and 4 and pulled outside of and even with McLaughlin exiting Turn 4. The slingshot-like whip around the final corner gave Newgarden the momentum he needed to win the drag race to the finish line.

“I was livid in the car because we had all this traffic and it wasn’t helping me and then right when I needed it to help me it helped me” Newgarden said. “Literally last corner last lap the traffic helped me out.”

Said McLaughlin: “Second is a great day but unfortunately we made a little lapse and at the end of the day lost. If you’re going to lose to anyone your teammate is the guy you want to lose it to. Gutted I couldn’t get it done for XPEL and Chevy. But at the end of the day we’re there and I learned a lot in the race that going to help us going in May to the Speedway.

“But I’m gutted. It still hurt. It’s how it is. But I’m pretty proud of how we’re running. My car wasn’t probably as good as it had been in traffic as it had been the whole race. I knew I was building push I was building tightness. Once he (Newgarden) got on the outside there I couldn’t come up above the line. I was stuck. I thought about going outside on Malukas there but I was worried I would push up into the gray and into the fence. You’re damned if you do damned if you don’t.”

Newgarden averaged 165.467 mph in a race slowed by four cautions for 52 laps.

Two-time NTT INDYCAR SERIES champion Newgarden also gained a leg up on the PeopleReady Force for Good Challenge with his victory. The challenge offered by the industrial staffing giant is a bonus of $1 million to be awarded to the first NTT INDYCAR SERIES driver who can win on all three unique styles of tracks – street circuits road courses and ovals – this season. The reward if earned will be divided with $500000 shared by the driver and his team and $500000 presented to their chosen charity.

Mike Zabel Upper Darby Mayor Barbarann Keffer State Sen. Tim Kearney and Shop Rite CEO Patrick Burns.

The redevelopment of the Drexeline Shopping Center now known as the Drexeline Town Center officially kicked off Wednesday with a groundbreaking ceremony writes Pete Bannan for the Daily Times.

The work brings a 50% bigger ShopRite with wider aisles and up-to-date selections. It is slated to open in the fall of 2023. The current store will stay open during construction.

Joining it is a new Wawa 172 market-rate apartments the return of PNC Bank 20000 square feet of other retail and a 120000 square-foot self-storage facility.

“This groundbreaking is a new phase in a very extended effort to turn this project into a first-class town center a mixed-use development” said Developer David Bramble co-founder and Managing Partner of MCB Real Estate. “This community deserves that development. This is a really important gateway to Upper Darby and we are going to try to bring a really sexy first-class project here.”

The project reduces stormwater runoff while increasing square-footage from 260000 square feet to 320000. It includes a multi-use trail and access to a SEPTA trolley station on site.

The renovations bring the promise of new jobs shopping opportunities and tax revenue says Upper Darby Mayor Barbarann Keffer.

Simbe Robotics

Automation and robotics are typically associated with multi-million budgets at multi-billion dollar companies. But as the cost of technology has come down it's become more affordable to smaller companies — even small businesses. Outside of Atlanta in Jonesboro Georgia THAT Burger Spot! a burger and wings joint with four locations got tired of being slowed down by phone orders. There's beef burgers turkey Impossible black bean fish chicken and more. Then there's the matter of how many patties sauces and other customizations. Given all the choices a single phone order took an average of seven to eight minutes. And that's only if there was staff on hand to take those orders. ""Our menu is a little complex there's a lot of options"" said Cedric Pool president of THAT Burger Spot Franchising Inc. ""Staffing . . .it was a problem and continues to be a problem"" Pool said. ""We figured we will be able to automate the process of order taking we wouldn't have to pay somebody to do it."" After a search they found a solution in Grubbrr which sells free-standing kiosks that can take in-store orders and integrate those with online orders and a point-of-sale system. Pool started with two kiosks in just one location costing $14400 which is about how much the company would pay someone over the course of a year to take orders by phone. After easing customers into using the kiosk and online ordering the restaurant's average ticket order increased from around $19 to over $21. Average sales per labor hour moved up from the high $50 range to $85 Pool said.

""Restaurants have been notorious laggards when it comes to technology. And they've done this predominantly because they've had access to extremely low labor costs"" said Sam Zietz chief executive officer of Grubbrr. According to a recent report by the National Restaurant Association seven in 10 restaurant operators said they currently don't have enough employees to support customer demand. The restaurant industry added 1.7 million jobs in 2021 but many restaurants are still severely understaffed and expect labor shortages will continue to constrain growth. In the most recent CNBC|SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey for Q1 17% of respondents in the accommodation and food services industries cited labor shortage as the biggest risk to their business.

Dirk Izzo president and general manager of NCR Hospitality a technology provider for restaurants said in cities including Denver and Jacksonville Florida customers cite costs for kitchen and front-of-house staff that are running 20%-40% higher than a year ago. ""If you're taking on those costs anything you can do to automate things is a big saving"" Izzo said. One example of technology that's become common and affordable for restaurants is contactless ordering and paying. More restaurants use QR codes at the table that push customers to order and pay from their phones. This is a time saver for staff who would otherwise need to take the order and then enter it manually into the point-of-sale system.

Technology is getting cheaper

The cost of robotics is being driven down by broader investments from the global smartphone industry and the self-driving car industry. ""The cost of this technology has come down quite drastically"" said Brad Bogolea co-founder and chief executive of Simbe which provides an autonomous robot that uses computer vision to track inventory in a grocery store drug store or hypermarket. For now Simbe primarily works with large retailers but Bogolea said the company also works with smaller retailers with 50 to 100 stores. Simbe's robotic inventory taker can check an entire store's inventory three to four times a day and place orders directly when items start to run low. ""It's not humanly possible to scan at that frequency or fidelity with human labor in these environments"" Bogolea said. Retailers traditionally spend anywhere from 30 to 100 hours per store per week on inventory. In many cases technology providers are offering automation as a service. Instead of being saddled with large upfront costs for equipment companies pay a monthly fee. GreenSeed Contract Packaging located outside of Chicago implemented robotics to automate some particularly repetitive packaging functions such as packing baby snacks into a box or moving packed boxes off the line onto a pallet. The company is billed monthly based on the number of hours the robot is working. ""Instead of using an agency to get a temp worker you can get a robot in"" said David Gray chief executive of GreenSeed. Depending on the structure of the contract the cost of the robotics is 40% to 50% of what he would pay to hire a person which costs at least $17 or $18 an hour not including benefits or the costs to a temp agency. ""So you can really reduce your costs and get better consistency"" Gray said. While the cost of technology has come down smaller companies — lacking economies of scale — still need to spend more as a percentage of their revenue than their larger counterparts. Outside of the food sector one telling example comes from the world of accounting. According to a recent survey by Ernst & Young 70% of large companies with $30 billion or more in revenue plan to spend between $2 million to $6 million on tax automation technology. By comparison 81% of smaller companies with less than $1 billion in revenue plan to spend between $1 million to $3.99 million — less but not that much less. ""That's a pressure on the smaller companies where they're almost spending as much"" said David Helmer global tax and finance operate leader at Ernst & Young.

Inflation and small business economics

Inflation is impacting how small businesses look at the cost of automation relative to rising costs in other core areas of their business. San Francisco-based Nana Joes Granola has been facing higher costs of raw goods and labor and is trying to figure out how to bring the costs of its premium granola down as consumers look more closely at pocketbook decisions. Michelle Pusateri owner of Nana Joes Granola said options include reducing the volume in bags by a few ounces or reformulating the recipe to cut down on ingredients costs or figuring out how to use automation for its production process and equipment that can make it easier to pump out more volume. The company which has Whole Foods among its retail partners is facing a highly competitive market and while it was able to pass along some costs to customers in 2021 as sale boomed being a higher-cost granola during inflation is more challenging Pusateri said. The company received a Covid EIDL loan which mostly went to stocking up on ingredients which have risen in price an inflationary factor that required it to buy in higher volumes to secure better deals. But Nana Joes Granola has also set a small portion of that loan aside for automation on the packaging side of production and it might also need to take out business loans for equipment. ""I don't think inflation is going away any time soon. We will be stuck in this and having more volume to pump out with same staff and same overhead is what we are looking at now"" Pusateri said. Pusateri who said she supports the higher wages workers are receiving across the economy adds that investing in automation wouldn't mean downsizing staff. ""The women working for us since 2016 are doing the same things over and over again and there is fatigue in that"" she said. —CNBC's Eric Rosenbaum contributed additional reporting.

Dan McKee is moving ahead with a plan to ramp up Rhode Island’s supply of power from offshore wind farms that would be developed off the coast of Southern New England.

Legislation introduced in the General Assembly at the request of the McKee administration would require that a request for proposals be issued this summer for another 600 megawatts of offshore wind energy.

The plan comes despite uncertainty over the sale of National Grid’s electric and natural gas operations in Rhode Island. The transaction with Pennsylvania-based PPL Corp. is on hold pending court appeals from the attorneys general in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Any new contracts for offshore wind would have to be signed by whichever company owns the utility business.

Rhode Island is already home to the first offshore wind farm in the nation — a 30-megawatt demonstration project near Block Island that went online five years ago — and National Grid has signed a contract to buy another 400 megawatts of capacity from the Revolution Wind project that is awaiting federal permission to begin construction in Rhode Island Sound.

If the new procurement goes forward as planned it would mean that more than 80% of Rhode Island’s electricity would be renewable putting the state within reach of a proposed target of getting all of its power from wind solar and other non-fossil fuel sources by the end of this decade.

Offshore wind is key to making that goal as well as to a more ambitious objective of reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors of the economy including heating and transportation by 2050. In small and densely populated Rhode Island there are no other in-state renewable energy options that would be able to deliver the same amount of power.

How the increase in offshore wind supplies could affect rates is unclear but judging by recent contracts in Rhode Island and other Northeastern states it could potentially save consumers money in the long run.

Even though Rhode Islanders are paying hundreds of millions of dollars in above-market costs for the Block Island Wind Farm the Revolution project by displacing oil-burning power plants and other more expensive generators is expected to yield net savings of $90 million — or about 50 cents a month for the typical ratepayer. And contracts for larger projects in Massachusetts have come in with even lower prices than the Revolution agreement.

Plan for more offshore wind first announced in 2020

It was McKee’s predecessor in the governor’s office Gina Raimondo who put forward the 100% target a year and a half ago describing it as the most aggressive renewables initiative in the nation. Not long before Raimondo left Rhode Island to become U.S. secretary of commerce she announced the plan for the 600-megawatt RFP (request for proposals).

But between McKee’s transition from the lieutenant governor’s office the COVID crisis and the proposed sale between National Grid and PPL the procurement stalled.

The delay didn’t sit well with some in the environmental community who believe the state needs to act with more urgency to move away from fossil fuels and ensure that the state can comply with the emissions-reduction mandates put in place with the enactment last year of the Act on Climate.

“We have been dismayed that we haven't heard anything” Kai Salem policy coordinator at the Green Energy Consumers Alliance said at a meeting last fall of the state Executive Climate Change Coordinating Council that was attended by McKee. “We understand there's been a lot of upheaval ... but we have to get that RFP out as soon as possible because we know that offshore wind is crucial in achieving our goals.”

State energy commissioner Nicholas Ucci vice chair of the climate council said the administration was aware of the frustration and that “the governor wanted to push this forward.”

“These procurements let alone the obligation of taking on a contract of this size is significant for a utility whether you’re National Grid or PPL or anyone else” Ucci said. “These are massive commitments on utilities’ parts and that created some challenges.”

The legislation requires the procurement process to start by Aug. 15. Any contracts negotiated as a result would go before the state Public Utilities Commission for approval.

National Grid says it’s still reviewing the legislation and has yet to take a position. But in general the company “is committed to helping Rhode Island and the region meet its clean energy goals and we believe off-shore wind is an integral path to help meet those aspirations” spokesman Ted Kresse said.

PPL says it’s supportive of the procurement included in the legislation.

“PPL looks forward to completing any offshore wind and other renewable energy initiatives that transition from National Grid or arise in the future” spokesman Mark Miller said.

Should the utility be compensated for offshore wind contracts?

One point of contention in discussions surrounding the procurement was whether National Grid — or if the sale goes through PPL — would be compensated for signing any new offshore wind contracts.

The legislation proposes awarding the utility an incentive equal to 2% of the total value of the contract. Over time the payments would total tens of millions of dollars all coming from ratepayers.

It’s the practice in Massachusetts where utilities get a 2.75% incentive. But it’s not the standard in Rhode Island.

National Grid was awarded a 2.75% bonus payment for the Block Island Wind Farm in 2009 to help secure its support for the state law that paved the way for the project. The company isn’t allowed to mark up the price of power from other sources but it was given permission to do so for certain long-term renewable energy contracts. For the Block Island project payments to the company are expected to total more than $19 million over the 20-year contract.

The rationale for the bonus in regard to offshore wind was that National Grid was taking on additional risk by committing to an energy source that was new to the United States at the time. That level of risk could cause a downgrade of the company’s ratings from agencies like Moody’s and lead to an increase in borrowing costs.

But the Revolution contract was awarded under a different state statute that made no mention of bonus payments. And by the time that contract came before the Public Utilities Commission in 2019 there was some evidence about whether National Grid’s fears about the risks associated with offshore wind contracts had panned out.

So when National Grid asked for an incentive that would have totaled $88 million over the contract term the commission ordered proof to justify the request.

After reviewing the evidence the commission determined that no payments were justified citing testimony that Orsted the Danish company planning the project with utility Eversource will bear the development risk and that ratepayers will assume any cost risk. Then-PUC chair Margaret Curran described National Grid’s testimony in support of remuneration as “not credible.”

In their written decision she and the other commissioners said utilities can be mandated to purchase energy and that no incentive is required.

“The PUC sets rates based on law economics and evidence” they said. “It does not hand out a ‘gratuity’ or tip a utility because of its cooperation in signing a contract that poses no risk to the utility to advance state policy.”

The commission made a similar ruling when it later approved a contract National Grid signed to deliver power to Rhode Island from a Connecticut solar farm.

Nevertheless National Grid maintains its position that an incentive is merited in part because of the long lead time in getting offshore wind farms in the water.

Ucci agrees saying that some level of remuneration is reasonable. But he said the legislation which is an amendment to the statute under which the Revolution contract was awarded does have a sunset provision. It cuts off utility incentives for contracts approved in 2027 and beyond. Payments can also be reduced if the utility’s returns in any given year are higher than allowed.

The 2% figure is not set in stone said Rep. Arthur Handy who introduced the bill in the House. He said there may be room to lower the incentive as the bill works its way through the legislative process.

Bill aims to address fisheries impacts and other issues

The legislation also aims to address other areas of controversy and head off conflicts over individual offshore wind proposals before they may arise.

Recent projects planned for the ocean waters off Rhode Island and Massachusetts have run into opposition from commercial fishermen who complain that siting what could eventually be hundreds of turbines in valuable fishing grounds will interfere with their livelihoods.

The bill would require developers to provide information on turbine layouts and locations during the procurement process. And they would have to submit a fisheries mitigation plan. That information has typically been released once contracts have been approved.

“A lot of that material becomes public” Ucci said. “It gives the public an opportunity to see and comment.”

Handy says he hopes the measure will push the procurement process through and help Rhode Island boost its supplies of renewable energy.

“Too often we just let things languish” the Cranston Democrat said. “Making sure we have some harder deadlines will help. Hopefully this will move us forward to get more of this type of energy into the grid.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYnVuZS5jb20ucGsvc3RvcnkvMjM0ODg3Ni9yZWtvLWRpcS10by1saWJlcmF0ZS1wYWtpc3Rhbi1mcm9tLWNyaXBwbGluZy1kZWJ0LXNheXMtcG0taW1yYW7SAWpodHRwczovL3RyaWJ1bmUuY29tLnBrL3N0b3J5LzIzNDg4NzYvcmVrby1kaXEtdG8tbGliZXJhdGUtcGFraXN0YW4tZnJvbS1jcmlwcGxpbmctZGVidC1zYXlzLXBtLWltcmFuP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Reko Diq to liberate Pakistan from 'crippling debt' says PM Imran,"Empty trailers for housing workers at the site of the gold and copper mine exploration project of Tethyan Copper Company (TCC) are seen in this undated photo in Reko Diq in Balochistan Pakistan.

Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday said that $10 billion is being invested in Balochistan for the Reko Diq project which will create 8000 jobs.

The premier took to his official Twitter handle to congratulate the nation and the people of Balochistan on a “successful agreement” with Barrick Gold – a mining company – for the development of the Reko Diq mine.

According to PM Imran the agreement came after 10 years of legal battles and negotiations.

“[A] penalty of $11 billion is offset” he said.

I congratulate the nation & ppl of Balochistan on successful agreement with Barrick Gold for development of RekoDiq mine after 10 years of legal battles & negotiations.

According to sources a new agreement was signed by representatives of the federal government and Balochistan with a delegation of Barrick Gold led by Chief Executive Dr Mark Bristow. As per the terms of the new agreement the Reko Diq project shall be revived and developed by Barrick Gold in partnership with Pakistani entities.

50% of the new project’s shares will be owned by Barrick Gold while the remaining shares shall be owned by Pakistan divided equally between the federal government and the provincial government of Balochistan.

The federal government’s shares of 25% shall be divided equally amongst three state-owned entities (SOE) namely Oil & Gas Development Corporation Limited (OGDCL) Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) and Government Holdings Pakistan Limited (GHPL).

The Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) office especially International Disputes Unit Head Additional Attorney-General (AAG) Ahmed Irfan Aslam mainly negotiated the Reko Diq deal.

Earlier today it was reported that an out-of-court settlement of the project in the Chagai district of the province had been finalised. Pakistan is actively engaged with Australia's Tethyan Copper Company (TCC) to reach the settlement as the country was threatened with facing a penalty of $6 billion due to its decision to deny a mining lease with the latter.

In the latest development the governments of Pakistan and Balochistan Antofagasta plc and Barrick Gold Corporation agreed in principle to a framework to reconstitute the project as well as to a pathway for Antofagasta to exit the project.

Addressing a hurriedly called press conference along with Energy Minister Hammad Azhar and Chief Minister Balochistan Mir Abdul Quddus Bizenjo in Islamabad Tarin said some $10 billion would be invested under this project which would create 8000 new jobs for the locals.

He added that as per the new agreement Barric Gold would retain 50 per cent share while government of Balochistan would get 25 per cent share and the rest 25 per cent share would be attributed to the state-owned enterprises – Oil and Gas Development Company (OGDCL) Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) and Government Holdings Pakistan (GHPL).

He apprised media persons that an agreement was signed in 2006 among a Canadian Company Barrick Gold a Chilean company Antofagasta plc and the governments of Pakistan and Balochistan to extract gold and copper from the Reko Diq reserve.

As per the old agreement 37.5 per cent share each was given to the two foreign companies whereas 25 per cent share was given to the provincial government.

The agreement was suspended in 2011 due to a dispute over the legality of its licensing process. As a result the International Court of Arbitration leveled $6.4 billion award on government of Pakistan while on the same time the London Court of Arbitration also imposed another $4 billion fine on Pakistan.

The minister further said that soon after taking the charge Prime Minister Imran Khan actively pursued the case and directed to draw a suitable solution as early as possible.

Subsequently Antofagasta decided not to participate in the reconstituted project and withdrew from its claim of $3.9 billion in place of $900 million.

Tarin informed the newsmen that $900 million would be paid by the three state-owned enterprise (SOEs) and in return they would get 25 per cent share of the project.

Had the PM not taken his personal interest in the case Pakistan would have to pay the huge amount of $11 billion as a penalty he maintained.

Tarin also said Pakistan and Balochistan would benefit from the project for more than 100 years and the total worth is estimated to be over $100 billion.

Terming the new agreement a landmark achievement Hammad Azhar said it was a historic day. He added that according to the Barrick Gold Reko Diq was the only one part with such huge gold and copper reserves.

ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan congratulated the nation and residents of Balochistan province over a successful agreement for the development of Reko Diq mine.

In a series of tweets the prime minister expressed that Reko Diq mine would be potentially the largest gold and copper mine in the world and liberate the country from the crippling debt ushering in a new era of development.

He further informed that a successful agreement was made with Barrick Gold for the development of Reko Diq. This has been achieved by setting an investment of $10 billion and creation of 8000 new jobs.

“I congratulate the nation & ppl of Balochistan on successful agreement with Barrick Gold for development of RekoDiq mine after 10 years of legal battles & negotiations. Penalty of approx (approximately) $ 11 bn is off set $10 bn will be invested in Balochistan creating 8000 new jobs” the prime minister posted on his Twitter handle.

“RD will potentially be the largest gold & copper mine in the world. It will liberate us from crippling debt & usher in a new era of development & prosperity” he added in a related tweet.

New Agreement

Pakistan has reached an out-of-court settlement of the Reko Diq project withAustralia’s Tethyan Copper Company (TCC) as the country was threatened with facing a penalty of $6 billion due to its decision to deny a mining lease.

The Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) office especially International Disputes Unit Head Additional Attorney-General (AAG) Ahmed Irfan Aslam mainly negotiated the Reko Diq deal.

A new agreement was signed by representatives of the federal government and Balochistan with a delegation of Barrick Gold led by Chief Executive Dr Mark Bristow. As per the terms of the new agreement the Reko Diq project shall be revived and developed by Barrick Gold in partnership with Pakistani companies.

According to the agreement 50 per cent of the new project’s shares will be owned by Barrick Gold while the remaining shares shall be owned by Pakistan divided equally between the federal government and the provincial government of Balochistan.

The federal government’s shares of 25% shall be divided equally amongst three state-owned entities (SOE) namely Oil & Gas Development Corporation Limited (OGDCL) Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) and Government Holdings Pakistan Limited (GHPL).

Balochistan’s shares shall be held by a company wholly-owned and controlled by the Government of Balochistan.

Earlier the lawmakers of Balochistan expressed their satisfaction with the terms of the proposed deal after senior federal government officials addressed concerns on the out-of-court settlement for the Reko Diq project.

A senior official in the AGP’s office along with additional secretaries of petroleum and finance provided an eight-hour briefing to the members of the Balochistan Assembly in December 2021.

A day earlier the Balochistan cabinet approved the proposed agreement and settlement regarding the Reko Diq project during a special cabinet meeting chaired by Balochistan Chief Minister Abdul Quddus Bizenjo.

“The cabinet thoroughly reviewed all aspects and points of the agreement” an official handout said. The provincial cabinet expressed satisfaction over the stance of the Balochistan government regarding the multibillion-dollar copper and gold project.

Reko Diq project would guarantee an end to the prevailing sense of deprivation and backwardness of Balochistan the statement stated. “It would be a game-changer” it mentioned. Secretary minerals briefed the cabinet about the benefits of implementing the proposed agreement and project for Balochistan and its people.

$6 billion fine

In July 2019 an international arbitration tribunal of the ICSID struck a penalty of $6 billion on Pakistan for its 2011 decision to deny the mining lease to the TCC – a 50-50 joint venture of Barrick Gold Corporation of Australia and Antofagasta PLC of Chile.

The tribunal chaired by Germany’s Klaus Sachs and Bulgarian arbitrator Stanimir Alexandrov and UK’s Lord Hoffmann had ordered Pakistan to pay over $4 billion in damages to TCC in addition to $1.7 billion in pre-award interest.

The tribunal had found that Pakistan had unlawfully denied the TCC a lease to mine copper and gold deposits at the Reko Diq mine. It had held that the state had committed an unlawful expropriation under the Australia-Pakistan bilateral investment treaty. Later the TCC had approached courts in five different countries for the enforcement of the penalty imposed on Pakistan.",,,

Toto WOLFF (Mercedes) Frédéric VASSEUR (Alfa Romeo) Laurent ROSSI (Alpine)

Q: Laurent first of all congratulations on victory over night at Sebring but let’s talk Formula 1. Fernando Alonso said after practice yesterday that he was surprised by the car’s competitiveness. Were you?

Laurent Rossi: Well I guess he was pleasantly surprised versus the last report from two weeks ago. At the same time we have been working towards that so I am not that surprised. And then again the two cars are in a slightly different position at the moment. So let’s see tonight how it reads out.

Q: What is the mood in the camp at Alpine at the minute as we come into this new season?

LR: Everyone is very excited. It’s a very good mood on the back of a good season last year. Everyone is motivated. They know that the cars are going to be reshuffled. We had decent tests and indeed the first runs here are rather promising so everyone is working hard but with a big smile so hopefully we keep that and we continue the victory rings that we had in Sebring even though it’s going to be hard to get those top positions.

Q: Just before we move on quick word on Otmar Szafnauer who’s been with the team for just over a week now. How is he settling in? Has he made any suggestions of how you can improve things?

LR: Oh yeah. He already made suggestions on the day he arrived because he was observing us already last year so there’s a couple of things that he could see that he could bring in and then now he knows the team a bit better he’s been already instrumental in helping us prioritising a couple of things operationally speaking fixing a lot of things as well and also planning for the long term. So I’m very happy Otmar is making a difference already.

Q: Fred Valtteri in particular was very positive about the car after practice yesterday. How encouraged were you?

Fred Vasseur: Yeah we did a good FP2 yesterday but the FP1 was much more difficult for us. But you know the most important is to be there on quali and for the race not in FP1 or FP2 and so far everybody is a World Champion and we just have to be there when it will be the money time and not before.

Q: It is still the winter world championship but just how encouraged are you by the potential of your car.

FV: For sure it is much better to be there in FP2 than not – and I’m quite pleased with the result of the first sessions and the test last week but nobody knows exactly in which condition the others are running the car and we will see tonight. I think that tonight everybody will push on the engine everybody will run with Soft and with low fuel data.

Q: So much is new at Alfa Romeo this year. Are you impressed with how quickly everyone is settling in?

FV: You are speaking about the drivers? The rest of the team is the same. For sure we have a new line-up but Valtteri is well-known and I think Zhou is a very good guy that is very easy to work with and the collaboration started very well. Now that you know that it is quite easy to be in a good mood before the results and it is not my first season in motorsport and we will see after the first races where we are.

Q: Toto are you surprised by what the timesheets have thrown up so far this weekend?

TW: Well surprised? In a way yes because you set your expectations and so far we couldn’t reach them – but I guess you just need to understand and learn from there on. As I always say every season the points go to zero and particularly in a season where the regs have changed considerably you have no entitlement whatsoever to performance. Now that we have to understand better. Like Fred said in qualifying and in the race tomorrow we don’t really know where we stand and if it’s not good enough then this team will prove that we can just grind ourselves out of non-performance.

Q: Do you think you can challenge for victory this weekend?

TW: Well as it stands when we make our assumptions based on the free practice sessions no. I think Red Bull is in a league of their own and then then there is a bunch of teams that are within a corridor of fuel weight and engine modes – but even there it’s great to see that teams like Fred’s and Laurent’s are right there in the free practice sessions. And also this is what I said the regulations were made in order to bunch the field up and that’s what’s going to happen.

Q: What is the mood in the camp? How is everybody dealing with what’s been a difficult pre-season?

TW: You know we’d rather be a second quicker than everybody else and disappear into the sunset but that’s not the case now. We started the season well in Barcelona and then went backwards from there on. So now it’s about really understanding. Whatever we do now is in a way a process. We can do things quickly and we can do more sophisticated and profound changes over the mid-term – and this is what we are aiming to do.

QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR

Q: (Luke Smith – Autosport) To all three Andreas Seidl and McLaren have been talking a lot this week about the relationship between A and B teams and the benefits to both sides. McLaren have suggested that there needs to be tighter runs in terms of what transfer there is between teams said yesterday it should just be engine and gearbox and nothing more. What are your views on that. I know you’re in three very different positions and particularly for Toto being an A team what do you get from customer teams?

TW: I think we haven’t even started the season. We have seen a certain pecking order in free practice and in the test sessions and obviously there are some teams including ourselves that haven’t met our own expectations and others have over-performed. But you need to give credit to the ones that have been fast and the once we can see what the real order is then we can actually try to first find performance within ourselves and then see what we can do long term in the way that the regulations can be shaped. I can tell you from our side with Aston Martin we’re sharing a tunnel but that’s pretty much it: there are no conversations no exchanges not anything else.

FV: At the other end you have a regulation the regulation is monitored by the FIA and I think so far the FIA have nothing to do on this. The rule is clear and we have to just follow the rule that on our side we are working with Ferrari we have the cassette and the engine and this is it. I’m OK.

LR: Clearly no A-B-team game for us. We are looking at what’s happening out there but so far the rules are being respected as far as I can tell so it’s good. In the interests of sports obviously I think Andreas was talking about the fact that we want to avoid too many pairings because at the end of the day we want to have ten teams racing and not like five duos. I guess that’s what Andreas was pointing out – but so far so good.

Q: (Claire Cottingham – Racefans.net) Toto Lewis has obviously been speaking about how unhappy he is with how the car’s feeling George sort-of mentioned it yesterday in the press conference as well. What conversations are you having with your drivers to reassure them that things might change in the future – and how are you managing to lift the spirits? I know it’s really early days but how are you managing to lift the spirits of the team to know that there is more positivity in the future.

TW: Well the conversations are happening in the team and in the team means also between the drivers. It’s the first thing we do in the morning; we pick up the phone and we chat about things. We have won and it’s not to say it in an arrogant way we’ve won eight Constructors’ Championships in a row so this team has done well in the past we didn't always have the easiest of times we climbed our way back to a championship against a big engine performance of our competitor and even last year where we felt that we started much worse off we still were able to take it all the way to the last race. And if it were the case that we’re on the back foot we all know that we’ve done it before and in a way it’s a challenging situation but you need to see the positives. Whatever we learn now will make us strong in the future. The regulations are meant to stay for a long time so let’s go for it.

Q: (Phil Duncan – PA) Toto you’ve said here that Mercedes won’t be able to win and Lewis said the same thing last night. Do you think you’ll be in this position for one two three four races? Do you think you’ll not be in a winning position for a little while yet? And do you think then that means you won’t be able to challenge for the title? I know it’s early days of course but…

TW: Again purely based on assumptions that we’ve seen in terms of pace I don’t think we can match the leaders’ performance at the moment. I personally believe there are simple solutions to get the performance back that start to crystalise and it’s 23 races. Even if you lose a race or two or you end-up outside of the podium nobody is protected against DNFs or crashes in a way. And we’ve seen last year that they played a big role so we will give it whatever we can bring updates as quickly as we can and understand the car more and try to find performance.

Q: (Adam Cooper – Motorsport.com) It’s clear that COVID protocols have been relaxed in the paddock and in the world generally. Are you more nervous this year about your team members and especially drivers testing positive than you were last year – and how have your own internal protocols changed? Are you doing less testing than before or is it the same?

LR: Well we definitely do a bit less technically speaking but we still self-impose the test before coming and a test every other day a healthy measure to make sure we don’t spread it around. Nothing more.

FV: We are following the protocols in place in each country. Now to be nervous it’s more for the racing side because it’s also a bit less dangerous. And for the team I think that we are less nervous because we know that the risk is a bit less. You have always a risk on the drivers as we saw last week with Daniel or this could happen or this week with Seb. I’m not sure that we can be fully protected for this.

TW: I think wherever we go the jurisdictions provide us with the law what you have to apply to. And we’re still being diligent within the factory but I think we need to have a common strategy all the teams and FIA FOM and for everybody in the paddock in order for how we’re relaxing the rules. And you can see in the UK and other countries that’s pretty much going to be relaxed completely and COVID is going to be seen as a flu that you can judge yourself whether you want to go to work or not. So I believe in the next few weeks we are going to see a pattern that Formula 1 will follow.

Q: (Scott Mitchell – The Race) To Toto but also to the other two please. Since the second test Ferrari in particular have been challenging or wanting the FIA to clarify whether or not what Mercedes have done with the wing mirrors is in line with the spirit of the regulations whether they should be manipulating aero performance that kind of thing. Where do you see that debate? Is that something that’s going to be allowed for this season could it be stopped for next season? And how do you think that should be resolved? Thank you.

TW: I think absolutely fair enough that a team questions stuff that’s on another car so that’s business as usual. We tried to be as diligent as we can be particularly in an age of new regulations you want to have the FIA involved in every step you take and that’s what we have done. Not to take any risks.

FV: Yes honestly it’s business as usual as Toto said before. Because each week you have a request to the FIA coming from a team on a technical point just to get a clarification. And now that it’s up to the FIA to take a decision and for me it’s business-as-usual but this time the request came to the journalist – but no big difference for us.

LR: Well I mean I’m the most shocked of anyone but it’s the most healthy. This is how the sport has been growing over time by having very clever engineers trying to find optimisation in what the regulations leave us in terms of interpretation. I think the FIA is here to decide whether it has been pushed too far or not the interpretation of the rules and they apply the corrections when needed. I mean the flexi-wings if you really go back in time for instance wings will always be flexible it depends on the amount of effort you put on it. It’s just a natural evolution of the sport.

Q: (Dieter Rencken – Racing News 365) To all three how hopeful are you that the FIA report into the events of Abu Dhabi will be released in full and should it be released in full?

TW: So far what I have seen from the new regime within the FIA is that transparency is well understood in a day and age where everything is almost crystal clear because you guys are doing a thorough and the web is just being able to distribute things quickly there is no other way than being transparent and Mohammed Ben Sulayem has so far done all that. I don’t know what the outcome of the World Motor Sport Council is going to be but I don’t believe that they have anything to hide personally.

FV: I think it will be disclosed today the transparency is important as Toto said but on the other hand at one stage we have to turn the page and be focused on the current season. I can perfectly understand the consequences of what happened last year but I think now we are on the first race of 2022 and we have to move ahead.

TW: And I completely agree with Fred by the way. We need to turn the page. It’s done now. After the World Motor Sport Council has come together and issued the investigation it’s in nobody’s interest and not in our interest to continue the discussion about Abu Dhabi.

LR: Yeah well I mean the most important thing is that governing bodies have taken steps the VAR and all. This is good and will prevent such situations to occur again and then this Abu Dhabi is so 2021. For me the same thing. We turn the page new season let’s go.

Q: (Christian Nimmervoll – Motorsport.com) Toto Christian Horner recently gave an interview where he described you as finance guy who may leave F1 on his superyacht at some point living in a fancy Monaco tax exile apartment which we could all see on Netflix. Is there anything you would like to respond to Christian?

TW: No. And not to Laurent either.

Q: (Luke Smith – Autosport) We have had the first trial of the three-day weekend format condensing everything. What are your thoughts on it so far? Did it really make a change on Thursday? I know it’s early days but some of the feeling is that Thursday was still quite busy. What kind of impact has it had on your team so far?

LR: On the principle I think it’s going to be much because indeed it is less days spent at the track. In reality at the moment it’s a bit hard on the teams because we all discover the cars and have reliability issues so it’s a bit of a drain on the teams to put everything together. Just for us for instance nothing has happened smoothly neither at Barcelona Bahrain tests or today. We have had our share of problems and that puts the team under duress but I think in the long term yes it’s better.

FV: We clearly have to go into this direction. If we want to do more races we have to also spend less days on track per events. As Laurent said at the first event of the season it’s always a bit chaotic and it’s not the easiest one but at one stage you have to go and I’m OK with this.

TW: I’m confused. I haven’t seen any difference to the previous weekend format. I think the press conference is earlier on a Saturday. If we are in a European time zone we are meeting at what is it 9 o’clock two and a half hours before the session so that’s clearly not good. But apart from that I haven’t seen any difference.

Q: (Ian Parkes – New York Times) Initial question to Toto. Toto can you explain the exact technical issues the problems with your car? You said there are simple solutions. Can you expand on that as well. Does that lend itself to suggest that a solution will be found sooner rather than later? And a question to Fred. Fred George Russell said last night after practice that he felt Mercedes was actually slower than Alfa Romeo. If you’d been told this yesterday morning that a Mercedes driver would be saying that at the end of the day how surprised would you have been?

FV: First we’ll have the discussion with Russell tonight. I was confident on the fact that we will have a good pace but nothing is done and let’s wait for the quali and the race. It’s even difficult to make some comments the right comments after the sessions sometimes so after the quali I don’t do it before.

TW: My opinion first of all to that question is that the Alfa Romeo/Sauber entity have a great track record stable strong shareholding and Fred has all the pedigree in all the other series and now they have a driver who they can benchmark easily against someone like Lewis. The regulations have been done a in a way that the team that were further back in the classification had a tiny bit more aero time. From where I stand Sauber has done a really strong job and also having a car that ticks many boxes and whether they are ahead or not you just have to show respect to any other team and this is not only because Fred is my mate but also because you see where the Haas is driving around and everybody else. It’s what I said before: it could be completely different. Don’t think that the pecking order of 2021 or before will be the pecking order at the beginning of 2022. We are seeing that so let’s just get used to it. And as for the simple solutions with us I think probably its simpler to say what works. It’s less items. We need to look at every single area on the car be it aero be it the weight be it the power unit all of that. In Formula 1 there is never one solution but I think there is low-hanging fruit that we need to tackle for the next races which will improve our overall performance and then there are more complex things and we’re tackling each of those.

Q: (Dieter Rencken – Racing News 365) If we look at the current regulations even making allowances for COVID it took four years to frame them. We are now four years away from the next set of regulations. So at which stage should we be starting and conceptualising them? And given the fact that there are suspicions that the ship that caught fire in the Atlantic the VW ship that that was sparked by a lithium ion fault or fire is it the right way to go for a sport that travels so much to actually want to increase the battery power by 300%?

TW: I think that in a way what’s happening in the world may change or will have an influence on what our preconceptions were before. I wasn’t aware that the fire was caused by a faulty battery on the cargo ship but it’s changing whether there is a going to be a larger percentage of vehicles that are going to stay with conventional combustion. I think Formula 1 has done the right thing to develop fuels that will be able to propel these cars. I think that’s a good step. I think we need to be able to justify that whatever we do in terms in of fuel can really be something that is available on the pump station and therefore give a good sustainable solution for every road car that is out there. And I believe that with the 50/50 solution we have for 2026 we should be in the right ballpark considering what is happening right now.

Q: Do we need to start formulating these regulations now?

TW: I think the regulations are being formulated. The fuel groups work together in defining what the formula should be and we are not far away from engine regulations to be done. I think we need the commitment from the newcomers so the whole package is ready to go and everybody can start to develop solutions.

FW: I think that the F1 we don’t have to be shy with what we are doing that the engine suppliers they invested a fortune over the last 10 years on the hybrid system and we have probably the most efficient engine of the world today. We just have to communicate3 on this. I think it is the most important thing to show to the world that it is not just about plastic bottles. OK we can pay attention to this but that are spending a fortune to develop these kinds of engine. I think sometime we are missing the most important thing.

LR: We’ve been indeed discussing a lot the future regulations extensive last year in particular so we are not far away from converging as Toto said. I think it is there or thereabout. It is also the right time to potentially think about the next set of regulations and again as Fred was saying we are on top of the technology game so we might as well stay there and be proposing offering solutions. In our case for instance we are advocating for a potential other avenues such as hydrogen as a fuel. It is worth investigating. It is difficult to put in place but it is worth investigating. So as long as the sport is continuing to be like spearheading advances it is healthy.

Q: (Jon Noble – Motosport.com) Two questions the first for Laurent. Did you find an answer for Esteban’s sidepod problem yesterday and will a new part be flown out ahead of today? And for Toto is the critical performance factor still that balance between chasing downforce performance with the ride height versus ‘porpoising’ and how much of a concern is it going forward that we are going to venues where you won’t have three days’ of testing to dial it out? We’re straight into race weekends at high speed and bumpy tracks.

LR: Yeah it looks like we are angling towards a possibly defective prototype part. The problem is that the piece we suspect is defective we didn’t recover it. It’s somewhere on the track. We’re pretty sure it’s the problem. There’s a new part coming but it won’t be here in time for this afternoon so we will have it tomorrow. If we have a red flag perhaps we will fit it in. Otherwise we will carry on the way it is.

TW: Yeah it’s one of the factors because obviously many if not most teams have developed the car with a very low ride height and the porpoising made it impossible to run the car out there. I think there are various solutions that teams have deployed some more successful some less and we are probably on the less successful side. It is now really about clarifying where it is we want to go. But it is just one of five or six issues where we believe there is big performance to gain.

Q: (Adam Cooper – Motorsport.com) For Toto and Laurent. How much effort was required to adapt to the E10 over the winter and what sort of impact has it had or has it been fairly neutral in terms of how you run the power units?

TW: It’s very simple because every fuel supplier had to add 10% Ethanol. Ethanol is one formula there is nothing you can change. And then it’s the normal development steps on the 90% remaining fuel; how much performance can you actually add from one year to the other in the conventional part of the fuel. Some will have done a good job some a neutral one some less good.

LR: It’s pretty straightforward indeed. We know that more alcohol changes the way you set your engine in terms of ignition timing and all those things to adapt it and then you try to recoup what you lose on the one hand. That’s what we have been chasing. It’s pretty straightforward.

Q: (Luke Smith – Autosport) Toto you gave a very open interview to The Times lately when you are at Harvard talking about mental health. You’ve talked about mental health in the past but it did seem to be another step forward in terms of your stories and what you were sharing. What kind of reaction have you seen both from the Mercedes team and the F1 paddock and how important is it to breaking the stigma around mental health in motorsport to be so open and honest?

TW: I was always someone that has been open with his close environment. For example Fred know all about it and it’s not like the flavour of the month to talk about your own suffering in terms of mental health but it is time now that people aren’t perceived in having it all the Formula 1 lifestyle all smiley winning a few races and championships. And I remember when I was younger I saw these people and I thought ‘well they are not having those issues to battle’ and what I want to do is… there has been a big community around professional sports people that have come out to show that us as business people and entrepreneurs are no different to everybody else. What I want to do is to encourage people and give hope to seek help and to work on it and not see it as a stigma of being a dysfunctionality or not feeling adequate but on the contrary it is a superpower and it is no different than diabetes or any other illness that is not the stigma as it is.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. An earlier version misstated a figure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzNWNsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vbmV3cy9wb2xpdGljcy9vaGlvLXBvbGl0aWNzL3Byb2N0ZXItYW5kLWdhbWJsZS1oZWlyZXNzLXByb3Bvc2VzLWJpbGwtdG8tc3RvcC10aGUtdHlwZS1vZi1hbmltYWwtdGVzdGluZy1wLWctaGFzLWRvbmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Procter and Gamble heiress proposes bill to stop type of animal testing,"COLUMBUS Ohio — The heiress of Procter and Gamble a multi-billion dollar consumer goods company is proposing legislation in the Ohio House to stop cosmetics testing on animals. P&G although saying they are mainly cruelty-free now continues experimenting on animals.

Plenty of makeup is tested on animals like rodents — and dogs and cats — something state Rep. Sara Carruthers (R-Hamilton) wants to change.

""Some of this stuff is just inhumane sick and unnecessary"" Carruthers said. ""A lethal dose test involves forcing rats to swallow large amounts of chemicals until the subject dies so that you can determine the dose that causes death.""

She and state Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney (D-Cleveland) introduced House Bill 495 which would stop the majority of animal testing for cosmetics sold in Ohio.

Not only would this save animals but it would also help the economy — since consumers want cruelty-free products Carruthers said.

The vegan cosmetic market is growing exponentially in part because of Generation Z's interest in ""ethically sourced products"" according to UNiDAYS a popular student shopping app that conducts market research.

But Carruthers' background is what made her interested in animal rights.

""My great great grandfather did it — they did use animal testing"" she said.

Carruthers is a descendant of Cincinnati-based company Procter and Gamble and she wants companies like hers to stop animal experimentation. Although her family still has some influence they no longer have a vote in the company policies and have no position on the board. She says her family no longer owns any part of the corporate giant but their Procter-side of the family continues to be a fixture in the Cincinnati area.

I reached out to P&G whose spokesperson said in a statement that their PETA cruelty-free brands are not tested on animals. However that is a small percentage. They have 79 brands and only 13 are on the PETA-certified list.

""P&G has invested over $480 million in non-animal test method development over decades and is partnering with groups like PETA and the Humane Society International & US working closely with governments to end animal testing globally"" the company said.

Some countries still mandate testing on animals they added.

A significant portion of their products are made in China according to 2018 testimony given to the U.S. Trade Representative and Chinese regulations require testing on products like toothpaste hair treatments and anything with sunscreen in it like a moisturizer or foundation.

I asked for a multitude of clarifications on their ""cruelty-free"" policy including data backing up their statements of being anti-animal testing. They were not addressed in their short statement.

It isn't just the United States and China that they have plants. They have factories on all continents minus Antarctica. Some locations have rules against animal testing some require it and others have other types of restraints — such as Japan which holds each ""institution responsible for self-regulation"" according to researchers.

""Let's go for made in America right?"" Carruthers said. ""We have modern testing methods like human cell-based tests sophisticated computer models.""

But bioethics expert and law professor at Case Western Reserve University Sharona Hoffman says the change could be a huge blow to medical advancements.

""Computer modeling is not a substitute for all animal studies — and also you have to worry about the expense"" Hoffman said.

Carruthers responded that data has shown that animal alternatives are actually cheaper but Hoffman is doubtful.

""Growing tissue in labs is quite expensive"" the professor said.

The bill language is broad and it could seemingly impact research to help burn victims or patients who want reconstruction surgeries after cancer or trauma.

""If you're talking about lipstick or blush I would probably agree that you don't need to use animals"" Hoffman said acknowledging that makeup isn't the true concern of hers. ""But for other treatments we have to remember 'cosmetic' is very very broad.""

The National Association for Biomedical Research is also concerned stating that the bill may have a negative impact on ""new compounds and molecules that are being developed for dual — cosmetic and medical — application.""

NABR's full statement from spokesperson Eva Maciejewski:

""Measuring the safety and efficacy of a new molecule or compound usually involves preclinical testing with animals and adjunct methods and then phased human clinical trials. Scientists and regulators strive to reduce the number of animals used. They also prioritize the development and adoption of refinement methods. However scientists cannot observe the combined effects of a new molecule or compound on the body’s interconnected systems over time by relying exclusively on artificial intelligence organ chips and other non-animal methods. They also need to use animals to determine if the new molecule or compound is safe enough to begin human clinical trials. It is therefore unclear whether the proposed state bill HB 495 could have a negative impact on new compounds and molecules that are being developed for dual - cosmetic and medical - application.""

""Animal studies do not proceed without any oversight"" Hoffman added. ""This isn't just some scientist collecting rats in the garage and then experimenting on them.""

Carruthers argued there are exceptions such as when there is no non-animal method available.

""This is a no-brainer"" the lawmaker said.

This bill will likely be heard in the coming months. She also introduced another bipartisan bill to crack down and try to prevent puppy mills which she said she talked to P&G about.

IT’S THAT TIME of year when we gardeners are shopping shopping shopping often in hot pursuit of just the right plant that will make the design of a bed or the larger landscape hang together—that elusive missing ingredient. But what if the answer isn’t a plant sometimes but a pot or a sculpture or some other non-living elements strategically placed?

Stephen Procter a ceramist specializing in art for the garden has walked through many a landscape with prospective clients helping to figure out the roles such pieces could play.

Stephen who is Vermont-based has for about 20 years has created monumental stoneware vessels that live in the landscape all four seasons. His work has been displayed at public gardens such as Blithewold in Rhode Island and The Mount Edith Wharton’s home in the Berkshires of Massachusetts. He helped me think about what else besides plants can help the garden hang together and how.

sculptural pots in the garden with stephen procter

Margaret Roach: Hi Stephen. I first got to know of your work thanks to the Instagram algorithm [view his account].

Stephen Procter: Thank goodness for Instagram.

Margaret: I know whatever. Because many of my virtual colleagues or whatever friends and garden designer friends and other keen gardener friends follow you there. And so I kept getting shown your posts of your vessels your pots and then so I contacted you and we worked together on a “New York Times” garden column together recently. And since those conversations we had for that story I keep looking around my garden with a different eye I have to say thanks to you. So: thanks to you.

Stephen: [Laughter.] I’m so happy to hear that.

Margaret: Yeah. So your pots are not just flower pots neither in scale nor in purpose. Tell us how big they range and what the intention what their intention initially … [Laughter.] How did this happen? You started making these big pots for gardens didn’t you? About 20 years ago.

Stephen: I sometimes wonder that myself. So so many questions you asked all at once there. I’ll try to take them up one at a time. My zone is sort of 3 to 5-1/2 feet tall for finished pieces the upward limitation being my tolerance for risk and the height of my custom-built kiln. And it’s funny I’ve been to several pottery events recently and I don’t really feel like a potter even though I work in clay.

People say potter or pottery and their mind conjures something quite different from what I do. So I think of myself more as a sculptor who works in clay. My approach is essentially sculptural. When I sit down at the wheel I am thinking about a rough sense of scale and form and it unfolds over several days as I’m throwing. Once in a while I’m working with a jig if I want to replicate a form that I’ve loved before. And I wound up putting them in gardens because they’re too big for most homes.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah they are. They are. So again I said they’re not flower pots. We don’t put soil and plants in them although they do have a hole a drainage hole in the bottom. But neither in scale nor purpose is that what they’re for. But they’re functional. And I know that when we did the “Times” story you were explaining to me that in the world of ceramics there is this sort of we’ll say discussion but it might be a little tenser than that at times [laughter] about functional ceramics functional pottery versus I don’t know what the other end of it is whether it’s art or not.

Stephen: Versus nonfunctional or decorative.

Margaret: Yeah decorative. So yours are decorative but it’s not that they’re not functional. Correct?

Stephen: I think of them as functional in that they inspire people they define spaces they announce significance. I think of them as functional on a quasi-spiritual level if you will. It that’s not too big a claim.

Margaret: Well but I think the garden is I mean to me what else are we doing out there? It’s not just outdoor decorating is it? I mean hopefully it elevates us and the space.

Stephen: Absolutely. And I feel like a piece like this can really focus and amplify that effect in a certain way. The way especially it in a certain sense reorganizes the energy around it in an interesting way and certainly reorganizes the visual field when something like this enters the garden.

Margaret: Yeah. Well when we did the “Times” story you cited a poem which by Wallace Stevens whose work I’d read but I didn’t know the poem “Anecdote of the Jar.” I don’t know if you want to tell us about it but it was beautiful.

Stephen: Sadly I can’t recite the poem. I haven’t read it that recently. But he talks about placing a jar on a hill and what that does to the surrounding landscape. The line I particularly love is “It made the slovenly wilderness surround that hill.” And he talks about how it reorganizes all the relationships of the things surrounding it.

Margaret: Right. And so from that I wrote down one line I remember “The wilderness rose up to it and sprawled around it no longer wild.”

Stephen: Oh I love that line.

Margaret: And so there’s that sort of there’s the thing that’s man-made in the wild space and the two of them are changed a little bit from the relationship yeah?

Stephen: I feel like they enter a conversation of sorts between the man-made and the natural. And one instance of that that’s maybe even a little more intense than the garden which is already cultivated is when clients choose to site a piece of mine in relation to a large stone or a large rock where there’s this huge sort of primal presence of the stone conversing with the tamed stone of the stoneware vessel. It becomes a very interesting conversation to my mind.

Margaret: Right. Now I said in the introduction that yours because they’re this very high-fired stoneware they can stay outside all four seasons. And clearly a lot of… We’re sort of trying to inspire people in this conversation we’re having today on the podcast just to consider sculptural elements in the garden that can do the jobs we’re going to talk about. But some of them aren’t going to be four-season because they’re not going to be weatherproof so to speak. And so that has to be taken into consideration not just the placement and the scale and so forth but also the durability. And yours can do that.

Stephen: Yes. I use what potters call high-fire stoneware for exactly that reason. It’s completely impervious to moisture. To help people understand the difference I sometimes use the comparison of think of the material your dinnerware is made of as opposed to the material a terracotta pot is made of. This is more like the dinnerware. And I often like to go on and joke that added advantage it’s also microwavable and dishwasher-safe.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah if you can haul the 250 pounds of clay into the house and shove it in the microwave. But in other words what I’m trying to say is that this could be a sculptural element a non-plant element of another substance but you’d have to consider its durability and its being weatherproof (or lack of being weatherproof). So that’s just to be kept in mind. So besides the wilderness rising up to it and being changed and it changing the wilderness people kind of rise up to it too when they see one of these don’t they [laughter]?

Stephen: I love watching people interact with these pots. I think of the pots as creatures of sorts and apparently other people do too. They approach them and they stroke them or they pet them or they hug them. There’s a lot of physical interaction that’s very unselfconscious and I see that happening and I always feel like oh the pots work; whatever its mysterious work is is happening in this interaction.

Margaret: So let’s talk about some of the work and some of the roles that a sculptural element like one of your large vessels can play and how do we figure it out where to place such a statement.

So if someone contacts you and says so I’m thinking I want something but I don’t know what or where you sometimes go and go on a walk with them I guess or do it photographically or whatever. But I mean what’s the beginning of that process of that exploration process?

I mean I always say one of the most important things about garden design and I’m no garden designer I just only know some basic principles is don’t forget besides walking around outside don’t forget to go inside and look out the window. Because I also want to have the sense of the outdoors from indoors because I’m indoors a lot right? So I don’t know if you take that into consideration like the placement not just from the outdoor experience but from key views within the living space.

Stephen: Absolutely I do. And it can make a big impact oddly to an indoor room almost as much as to an outdoor space the way it’s framed by a window or beckons someone to go outdoors and be in its presence. It’s a wonderful thing. And particularly for people I just heard recently from a garden designer who lives up in Central Vermont Judith Irven who was talking about she and her husband in the winter sit in their sunroom that faces the hillside where they placed a pot of mine. So they enjoy it all year round from indoors in the winter and it’s a long winter in the mountains where they are and watch how it plays with the snow as it comes and goes and the wind.

Margaret: And I think some of this people may think oh right I’ve used sometimes a pair of well-placed chairs is that type of thing. Even in the winter I leave out certain things and I have one pair that’s way up on the hill at the edge of a meadow and especially in the snow there’s just something so it’s like “Ooh someday I’ll be going back up there and sitting there in the fairer days.” Do you know what I mean? There’s just that.

Stephen: Yes exactly.

Margaret: Yeah that come hither kind of but not right now kind of conversation that I’m having looking out the window at it [laughter]. So let’s talk about some of the things. So someone says I think I want something but I don’t know what and I need your advice. And so what are some of the roles you go wander around or whatever with people? What are some of the things that this type of a statement can do this kind of a vessel or sculpture can do in a garden?

Stephen: I’ll start with some of the more obvious things it can do. And that is to reinforce the structure of the garden that’s already there. The visual destination at the end of a straight path. Or the sort of I think of “greeter function” as you move from one room or area of the garden to another almost like some people might use a granite fence post or something like that. That is a very interesting way to announce that articulation of the structure.

At the inside bend of a path along a garden pathway is another interesting way to create of an arm to swing around [laughter] if you will as you’re moving down the path. So some of those ways that are I think of as classically reinforcing the bones of the garden already.

And then there are more interesting and I think more arguably subtle ways of using them. An organic form that’s partially occluded by a large bush or something like that and reveals only part of itself creates this sense of mystery and intrigue and what is that? And a different way of drawing somebody to it sort of by being coy as opposed to by being so fully present.

Margaret: So it’s not like in a formal garden like in a parterre or a boxwood four-square kind of planting where there’s a pad with a plinth in the middle and it’s this perfect geometry and this vessel is fully exposed in the midst of all this other formality and geometry. It’s not like that. You’re saying it could actually kind of be nestled in and not fully exposed and that’s almost more exciting in some ways.

Stephen: Well exciting in a different way. And both work beautifully. I just had a conversation yesterday with someone who has exactly that very highly structured it’s a very geometric herb garden and she’s looking for a tall vessel to sort of anchor the center of that and looking for a more organic form to put near an exotic Japanese maple which I think would be a really interesting … I mean it’s a very different mood that’s called for in the second place. And she’s talking about a very different kind of pot to enhance that.

Margaret: You were just mentioning two pots and you didn’t necessarily say that they’d be where they’d both be seen at the same time. But when we talked for the “Times” story you talked to me about how sometimes if there is more than one such element it’s almost like they’re having a conversation. That the two vessels almost are speaking to each other and that we connect them even if they’re not literally next to each other or anything.

Stephen: The mind and eye very strongly draw lines between them. It’s so interesting and it’s not just my own experience but people I work with and when we place pieces in the garden it creates this other level of structure. And in some cases this has been a surprising discovery for me a very relatively small piece say a globe of 24 inches tall maybe even a little shorter if it relates to a larger vessel it can hold its own in a large space because it somehow rides the larger energy of the big piece. So a piece that would by itself feel lost if it has a big brother [laughter] it can tag along.

Margaret: So as we’re looking around our gardens and I think this is a good time I don’t know rather than when it’s in full swing. I feel like right now it’s the bones that I’m looking out at and I feel like before I get distracted by oh those colorful flowers over there that are coming in six weeks or whatever. I feel like it’s a good time to think about things like that. And so it’s not just looking for that one moment always. It could be more than one spot and thinking about the relationship between them. And I love I guess because of the nature of the place where I live—and it’s not huge; it’s a couple of acres. But where the house is positioned and the fact that there are woods around it at the perimeter so it feels bigger than it is. And so I love that sort placing things at a distant view creating almost axial endpoints like “Ooh look up there.”

And I know that’s one of the more obvious things that such a sculpture could do but I also love that. I love the sense of not just right here in the immediate distance but let’s look out there too.

Stephen: Yes. And often one placed in the near and one placed far in a sense amplifies the sense of distance. It dramatizes the distance to the far view in a very interesting way.

Margaret: Well and it’s interesting that you say that because when garden-designer friends have come and tried to teach me [laughter] about garden design over the years one of the things they’ve told me when I was like “Oh well I think I want to put a gold-leaf shrub way way in the distance so that it screams to me from across the yard out the window from across the yard.” And they’re like “Yes that’s a great idea. But along the way maybe on the left and right of that sort of axis not a literal path but a visual path maybe you want to have one or a couple of other elements spots of gold to help you travel there.”

So that sort of duet again or it might be a trio [laughter] of pots or plants. So some of the same design ideas I guess is what I’m saying come into play with thinking about these sculptures as opposed just as they do with designing with plants.

Stephen: In a sense they become visual guideposts that take the eye from one point to another to another to another to a destination. In a certain way it reminds me of the way a skillful painter will choreograph how your eye moves over the painting. And I think you can use elements such as this or as you mentioned a particular palette of plant you’re using to accomplish a similar thing.

Margaret: You just said choreograph and you’re giving yourself away because you had a career in music before you became a ceramic artist. Yes?

Stephen: Yes I did. And I was not looking to get involved in clay. It was a sort of surprising midlife seduction. Not one I regret. And strangely I found the transition from music to clay at the meta level very seamless. It felt like working with many of the same elements and working with the same impulses. I sometimes say what I had been doing in sound and time I was now doing with material and space. The common thread being looking to find the line that’s revelatory.

Margaret: Hmmm. So you’re also teaching now. You’re teaching people to make these to create these large vessels. Yes? That’s another that you’ve sort of branched out into that and you’re teaching not only I think at your place but elsewhere including I think in Europe this year for the first time maybe?

Stephen: I am. I have a lovely invitation from two studios in Amsterdam and they’ve put together four days of teaching for me in early June which I’m really looking forward to.

I want to qualify slightly what you said there Margaret. I’m teaching people that technique that I use to build pieces sectionally and I’m hoping that people won’t be building my pots [laughter]. I have discovered over the years against my better judgment I sometimes allow my students to use tools that I have designed and developed specifically to achieve the curves that I’m after. And not surprisingly I discover “Oh my gosh your pot is just like mine. Give me back those tools.” [Laughter.]

Margaret: Right. But you’re teaching the method.

Stephen: I’m teaching the technique that I’ve developed. It’s a little bit distinctive. It’s drawing on bits and pieces from here and there and putting them together in a way that suits my personality and my physique and the way I like to do things. And it’s also very accessible for people. As someone who is in clay self-taught and I’ll say that with an asterisk because we all rely on millennia of experimentation by previous potters. But as someone who’s not formally trained in pottery and just figured out how to do this stuff I feel like what I do and the way I do it is going to be accessible to an intermediate-level potter.

Margaret: I didn’t ask you yet but I have to ask you: your own home garden. Now I know that it’s smallish and I think you told me that your wife maybe had issued a proclamation [laughter] about some changes this spring summer. She said there are going to be some redos of some areas or is there so updates ahead?

Stephen: Instead of being a repository for my firing disasters [laughter] she’d like to get a first. We have the shoemaker’s children phenomenon going on here. So yeah I’ll be bringing home a perfect pot to grace our little postage-stamp garden soon.

Margaret: And is there any new planting going to go on or what all … Is it ornamental stuff or vegetables or both or what?

Stephen: It’s ornamental. We have this tiny little lot that we share with our duplex neighbors and it’s ornamental. My sister had a very brief flirtation with trying to start a garden-design business after she retired from a career as an educator. And she has a talent for it and put in a garden for us. And our main specifications were color all season long and low maintenance. Because the studio consumes me 120 percent and my wife is also involved in clay and runs her own community clay studio. So sadly we don’t have a lot of time to spend in the garden ourselves. So those two requirements suit us well.

Margaret: And now a third requirement which is a pot that isn’t second-handed. No cracks please. No cracks. O.K. [Laughter.]

Well I’m so glad to talk to you again and as I said I hope that this will just some of these thoughts from your experience working with your type of vessels with clients and so forth will be inspirational for people as they think about enhancements to their own garden this year whatever material or vessels or whatever they plan to use. Because I think it’s an important part of the overall design hanging together. And I was so glad to meet you and talk to you. So thank you Stephen.

Stephen: Thank you so much. It’s been a pleasure.

Former president Donald Trump appeared to mock Sen. Lindsey Graham at an event at Mar-a-Lago.

Trump called Graham a ""progressive senator from South Carolina"" in a speech on Friday night.

""He's a progressive but he's our progressive"" Trump was heard saying at a dinner at Mar-a-Lago.

Former President Donald Trump mocked Sen. Lindsey Graham during a speech at Mar-a-Lago calling him a ""progressive.""

""There are a couple of senators. And we have our progressive senator from South Carolina Lindsey Graham"" Trump said at the Lincoln Day fundraising dinner held by the Palm Beach County GOP at Mar-a-Lago.

""He's a progressive but he's our progressive"" Trump added.

Trump's mocking of Graham came a day after news broke that Graham may have threatened to seek to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office during the Capitol riot.

This was according to excerpts Axios published from ""This Will Not Pass"" a new book by New York Times reporters Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns. Martin and Burns wrote that Graham made a furious call to White House counsel Pat Cipollone during the riot where he made that threat.

Graham has broken with Trump on several issues in recent months. In January he criticized Trump for floating the possibility of pardons for Capitol rioters calling Trump's idea ""inappropriate.""

This prompted Trump to call Graham a RINO or ""Republican-in-name-only"" a term usually reserved for Trump adversaries like Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger.

Graham however is known for being a staunch Trump ally and took credit in January for being the one to talk Trump out of doing a press conference on the anniversary of the Capitol riot. Graham also continued to voice his public support for Trump this year even saying in January that he would not back Mitch McConnell for Senate GOP leader unless McConnell had a ""working relationship"" with Trump.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN5Y2xlbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjItdGV4YXMtaGFsZi1taWxlLWFtZXJpY2FuLWZsYXQtdHJhY2stcmVzdWx0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 Texas Half-Mile American Flat Track Results,"| March 19 2022

Progressive American Flat Track defending champion Jared Mees (No. 1 Indian Motorcycle/Progressive Insurance FTR750) rebounded like the champion he is with a convincing victory in Saturday night’s Mission Texas Half-Mile presented by Roof Systems at the Dirt Track at Texas Motor Speedway.

Jared Mees bounced back and won the Texas Half-Mile. He’s now just one point out of the Championship lead.

Few expected Mees to kick off his Mission SuperTwins presented by S&S Cycle title defense as a relative non-factor running in fifth in last weekend’s season opener at Volusia Speedway Park. That muted performance made this weekend’s showdown all that more important and given a second chance Mees made clear the path to the #1 plate still goes through him.

Mees looked virtually unbeatable all night long a trend he continued once he dove underneath a quick-starting JD Beach (No. 95 Estenson Racing Yamaha MT-07 DT) to take control of the Main Event while still in its opening stages.

The defending champ pulled clear and cruised to the checkered flag only suffering a minor scare when Beach and his Estenson teammate Dallas Daniels (No. 32 Estenson Racing Yamaha MT-07 DT) used traffic and their own battle for second to reduce the gap to back under a second over the race’s final two laps.

“It felt really good” Mees said. “Last weekend we were a little off for sure but it felt good to rebound. That Main Event was really hectic with all the lappers but the Indian Motorcycle backed by Progressive Insurance worked awesome tonight. It was so hooked up. My guys are all working so hard.

“I really wanted to come in and have a good result today with the break we have coming up. Last week didn’t sit well… I wanted this one bad.”

The Yamaha 2-3 was another sign that the series’ attempts to balance the field are working as hoped while also providing positive feedback for Estenson Racing in regards to their offseason MT-07 DT upgrades.

It also underlined the potency of the talented Beach-Daniels tandem. That was made especially clear when Mission SuperTwins rookie Daniels not only diced with two-time class champion Briar Bauman (No. 3 Indian Motorcycle/Progressive Insurance FTR750) but got the better of him.

A bobble on Bauman’s part put him out of podium contention but he was well clear of the pack behind and finished alone in a safe fourth. Some five seconds back Jarod Vanderkooi (No. 20 Mission Roof Systems Indian FTR750) won out over teammate Brandon Robinson (No. 44 Mission Roof Systems Indian FTR750) in their scrap for fifth.

Meanwhile Davis Fisher (No. 67 Bob Lanphere’s BMC Racing Indian FTR750) Bronson Bauman (No. 37 Latus Motors Racing Harley-Davidson XG750R) and Brandon Price (No. 92 Briggsauto.com/Martin Trucking Indian FTR750) came home seventh through ninth respectively while Ben Lowe (No. 25 Helipower Racing/Mission Foods Harley-Davidson XG750R) turned his Mission Production Twins Challenge entry into a top-ten premier-class finish.

Mission Production Twins presented by Vance & Hines

While reigning Mission Production Twins presented by Vance & Hines champion Cory Texter (No. 1 G&G Racing/Yamaha Racing Yamaha MT-07) got his own title defense off to a bit of a quiet start last weekend all it took was a return to the scene of his maiden class victory in 2019 to remind the paddock of the pecking order he’s worked so hard to maintain ever since. That and a lot of perseverance.

Texter was in control throughout the Main Event despite the numerous potential pitfalls thrown his way. Moments after he claimed the initial holeshot Chad Cose (No. 49 DPC Racing/Voodoo Ranger Harley-Davidson XG750R) crashed after coming together with Jesse Janisch (No. 33 Vance & Hines Harley-Davidson XG750R) bringing out an early red.

Then after getting a second holeshot and opening up a healthy advantage Texter was forced to do it a third time when a second red flag was shown following a Jeffery Lowery (No. 223 Lowery Racing/Gray Hogs Yamaha MT-07) fall. Make that a fourth time as Billy Ross (No. 109 Pro 1 Industries/Campbells Services Kawasaki 650 Ninja) was the next to crash and cause another stoppage.

Texter then had to set the pace and avoid any mistakes of his own on an extremely tricky dry surface before at last securing his first win of the young 2022 season.

Cory Texter got back to his winning ways in Production Twins.

“You don’t like to see red flags when you’re leading” Texter said. “When you have a gap it’s like ‘Man…’ But I’ve been in that situation before so I just stayed calm had confidence in my starts and trusted my instincts. The boys said to keep doing what I was doing so at that point you just don’t want to mess up.

“This is such an emotional win for me. The last time we were here and I won I gave my mechanic Jon (Reid) the victory lap and he passed away at the end of the season. So I really wanted to win this one for him. This one means a lot.”

Ben Lowe (No. 25 Helipower Racing/Mission Foods Harley-Davidson XG750R) kept Texter honest in the final leg of the Main and was well-positioned to capitalize on any mistake. While that mistake never came Lowe did finish as the runner-up earning a strong result at his primary sponsors’ home round.

The still-mending Kolby Carlile (No. 36 KC36 Las Vegas Harley-Davidson XG750R) rounded out the podium. He did so only after fending off last weekend’s surprise winner Nick Armstrong (No. 60 Competitive Racing Frames/Lessley Brothers Yamaha MT-07) who proved that his opening-weekend performance was no fluke with a close fourth.

New class contender Cole Zabala (No. 51 Memphis Shades/Corbin/Vinson Yamaha MT-07) made a late move around Johnny Lewis (No. 10 Moto Anatomy X Powered by Royal Enfield Twins FT) to complete the top five.

Parts Unlimited AFT Singles presented by KICKER

Best known for epic come-from-behind rides exploiting the high line Morgen Mischler (No. 13 American Honda/Progressive Insurance CRF450R) won in the complete opposite fashion on Saturday night. After beating polesitter Max Whale (No. 18 Red Bull KTM Factory Racing 450 SX-FFE) into the opening corner Mischler immediately set about what would ultimately prove to be a race-long defense of the low line.

It was actually Trevor Brunner (No. 21 Estenson Racing Yamaha YZ450F) who was the rider on the move in the early stages blasting his way up from the third row and into third place on a track where no one else seemed to have much success overtaking.

However the reason for that was made evident with the manner in which Brunner’s charge ended. His aggressive attempts to overhaul Whale for second concluded with the Yamaha pilot on the dirt. Making matters worse Tanner Dean (No. 38 Waters Autobody Racing KTM 450 SX-F) had nowhere to go but over top of Brunner’s downed machine the incident provoking a red-flag stoppage.

Mischler resumed the lead at the restart but Whale lost another spot off the line. This time it was teammate Kody Kopp (No. 12 Red Bull KTM Factory Racing 450 SX-FFE) who displaced him diving into second to take over the pursuit for the lead.

Morgen Mischler (13) held off last week’s Singles winner Kody Kopp (12) for the win.

The three then raced in close formation for the remainder of the race. Despite Kopp sizing Mischler up for a final-lap attack he thought better of it and accepted second rather than risk disaster.

Race-winner Mischer said “Our team has a lot of great pieces that pull this whole program together. The whole Turner Factory Honda team is amazing and they have a wealth of knowledge. I felt really bad because in practice I wadded one of these bikes up pretty bad. This is actually my ‘B bike’ but she got the job done today. Those guys put in a ton of work and I wouldn’t be here without them.”

Mischler’s teammate Dalton Gauthier (No. 79 American Honda/Progressive Insurance CRF450R) put in a relatively lonely ride to fourth followed by Michael Inderbitzin (No. 54 1st Impressions Services of Florida Honda CRF450R) and Trent Lowe (No. 48 Mission Foods/Al Lamb’s Dallas Honda CRF450R). CN

More from a press release issued by American Flat Track (AFT):

Mees Strikes Back at Texas Half-Mile

DAYTONA BEACH Fla. (March 19 2022) – Progressive American Flat Track superstar Jared Mees (No. 1 Indian Motorcycle/Progressive Insurance FTR750) rebounded like a champion with a convincing victory in Saturday night’s Mission Texas Half-Mile presented by Roof Systems at the Dirt Track at Texas Motor Speedway.

Few expected Mees to kick off his Mission SuperTwins presented by S&S Cycle title defense as a relative non-factor running in fifth in last weekend’s season opener at Volusia Speedway Park. That muted performance made this weekend’s showdown all that more important and given a second chance Mees made clear the path to the #1 plate still goes through him.

Mees looked virtually unbeatable all night long a trend he continued once he dove underneath a quick-starting JD Beach (No. 95 Estenson Racing Yamaha MT-07 DT) to take control of the Main Event while still in its opening stages.

The defending champ pulled clear and cruised to the checkered flag only suffering a minor scare when Beach and his Estenson teammate Dallas Daniels (No. 32 Estenson Racing Yamaha MT-07 DT) used traffic and their own battle for second to reduce the gap to back under a second over the race’s final two laps.

“It felt really good” Mees said. “Last weekend we were a little off for sure but it felt good to rebound. That Main Event was really hectic with all the lappers but the Indian Motorcycle backed by Progressive Insurance worked awesome tonight. It was so hooked up. My guys are all working so hard.

“I really wanted to come in and have a good result today with the break we have coming up. Last week didn’t sit well… I wanted this one bad.”

The Yamaha 2-3 was another sign that the series’ attempts to balance the field are working as hoped while also providing positive feedback for Estenson Racing in regards to their offseason MT-07 DT upgrades.

It also underlined the potency of the talented Beach-Daniels tandem. That was made especially clear when Mission SuperTwins rookie Daniels not only diced with two-time class champion Briar Bauman (No. 3 Indian Motorcycle/Progressive Insurance FTR750) but got the better of him.

A bobble on Bauman’s part put him out of podium contention but he was well clear of the pack behind and finished alone in a safe fourth. Some five seconds back Jarod Vanderkooi (No. 20 Mission Roof Systems Indian FTR750) won out over teammate Brandon Robinson (No. 44 Mission Roof Systems Indian FTR750) in their scrap for fifth.

Meanwhile Davis Fisher (No. 67 Bob Lanphere’s BMC Racing Indian FTR750) Bronson Bauman (No. 37 Latus Motors Racing Harley-Davidson XG750R) and Brandon Price (No. 92 Briggsauto.com/Martin Trucking Indian FTR750) came home seventh through ninth respectively while Ben Lowe (No. 25 Helipower Racing/Mission Foods Harley-Davidson XG750R) turned his Mission Production Twins Challenge entry into a top-ten premier-class finish.

Mission Production Twins presented by Vance & Hines

While reigning Mission Production Twins presented by Vance & Hines champion Cory Texter (No. 1 G&G Racing/Yamaha Racing Yamaha MT-07) got his own title defense off to a bit of a quiet start last weekend all it took was a return to the scene of his maiden class victory in 2019 to remind the paddock of the pecking order he’s worked so hard to maintain ever since. That and a lot of perseverance.

Texter was in control throughout the Main Event despite the numerous potential pitfalls thrown his way. Moments after he claimed the initial holeshot Chad Cose (No. 49 DPC Racing/Voodoo Ranger Harley-Davidson XG750R) crashed after coming together with Jesse Janisch (No. 33 Vance & Hines Harley-Davidson XG750R) bringing out an early red.

Then after getting a second holeshot and opening up a healthy advantage Texter was forced to do it a third time when a second red flag was shown following a Jeffery Lowery (No. 223 Lowery Racing/Gray Hogs Yamaha MT-07) fall. Make that a fourth time as Billy Ross (No. 109 Pro 1 Industries/Campbells Services Kawasaki 650 Ninja) was the next to crash and cause another stoppage.

Texter then had to set the pace and avoid any mistakes of his own on an extremely tricky dry surface before at last securing his first win of the young 2022 season.

“You don’t like to see red flags when you’re leading” Texter said. “When you have a gap it’s like ‘Man…’ But I’ve been in that situation before so I just stayed calm had confidence in my starts and trusted my instincts. The boys said to keep doing what I was doing so at that point you just don’t want to mess up.

“This is such an emotional win for me. The last time we were here and I won I gave my mechanic Jon (Reid) the victory lap and he passed away at the end of the season. So I really wanted to win this one for him. This one means a lot.”

Ben Lowe (No. 25 Helipower Racing/Mission Foods Harley-Davidson XG750R) kept Texter honest in the final leg of the Main and was well positioned to capitalize on any mistake. While that mistake never came Lowe did finish as the runner-up earning a strong result at his primary sponsors’ home round.

The still-mending Kolby Carlile (No. 36 KC36 Las Vegas Harley-Davidson XG750R) rounded out the podium. He did so only after fending off last weekend’s surprise winner Nick Armstrong (No. 60 Competitive Racing Frames/Lessley Brothers Yamaha MT-07) who proved that his opening-weekend performance was no fluke with a close fourth.

New class contender Cole Zabala (No. 51 Memphis Shades/Corbin/Vinson Yamaha MT-07) made a late move around Johnny Lewis (No. 10 Moto Anatomy X Powered by Royal Enfield Twins FT) to complete the top five.

Parts Unlimited AFT Singles presented by KICKER

Best known for epic come-from-behind rides exploiting the high line Morgen Mischler (No. 13 American Honda/Progressive Insurance CRF450R) won in the complete opposite fashion on Saturday night. After beating polesitter Max Whale (No. 18 Red Bull KTM Factory Racing 450 SX-FFE) into the opening corner Mischler immediately set about what would ultimately prove to be a race-long defense of the low line.

It was actually Trevor Brunner (No. 21 Estenson Racing Yamaha YZ450F) who was the rider on the move in the early stages blasting his way up from the third row and into third place on a track where no one else seemed to have much success overtaking.

However the reason for that was made evident with the manner in which Brunner’s charge ended. His aggressive attempts to overhaul Whale for second concluded with the Yamaha pilot on the dirt. Making matters worse Tanner Dean (No. 38 Waters Autobody Racing KTM 450 SX-F) had nowhere to go but over top of Brunner’s downed machine the incident provoking a red-flag stoppage.

Mischler resumed the lead at the restart but Whale lost another spot off the line. This time it was teammate Kody Kopp (No. 12 Red Bull KTM Factory Racing 450 SX-FFE) who displaced him diving into second to take over the pursuit for the lead.

The three then raced in close formation for the remainder of the race. Despite Kopp sizing Mischler up for a final-lap attack he thought better of it and accepted second rather than risk disaster.

Race-winner Mischer said “Our team has a lot of great pieces that pull this whole program together. The whole Turner Factory Honda team is amazing and they have a wealth of knowledge. I felt really bad because in practice I wadded one of these bikes up pretty bad. This is actually my ‘B bike’ but she got the job done today. Those guys put in a ton of work and I wouldn’t be here without them.”

Mischler’s teammate Dalton Gauthier (No. 79 American Honda/Progressive Insurance CRF450R) put in a relatively lonely ride to fourth followed by Michael Inderbitzin (No. 54 1st Impressions Services of Florida Honda CRF450R) and Trent Lowe (No. 48 Mission Foods/Al Lamb’s Dallas Honda CRF450R).

Much of the plant had been torn down but the portion that remained was in rough shape. Trees were growing inside the building and pieces of the roof were falling in.

More:Joint venture — Foam companies to operate out of same plant in Gnadenhutten

Despite that Eadon executive director of what was then known as the Tuscarawas County Port Authority showed the plant to the acting president and chairman of the board of Wisconsin-based Plymouth Foam. They wore hardhats because of the dangers from the roof.

Eadon recalled that the acting president did not like what he saw.

The chairman of the board however had a different view.

""The fellow that was chairman of the board turned around and he said you know what I can see it. I can see a manufacturing plant here"" Eadon recalled. ""I said I can too. I said I think we fix the roof we get rid of the trees that are growing inside the building we put in new HVAC new electric feed.

""The chairman asked if we were willing to lease it to them and I said absolutely. We would renovate it.""

The port authority borrowed money from the county commissioners and the state and made about $2.4 million in renovations to the dilapidated factory building.

Within two years Plymouth Foam bought the building for $3.2 million.

When the port authority bought the plant in 2005 no one was working there. Now it is occupied by Plymouth Foam and Progressive Foam Technologies and about 150 people are working there.

Eadon who will be retiring on March 28 from what is now known as the Tuscarawas Economic Development Corp. sat down recently with The T-R to look back on his 20-year career with the agency.

How Harry Eadon got started

Eadon and his family first came to Tuscarawas County in 1994 when he got a job at the old Handy & Harmon plant in Dover (now Meteor Sealing Systems). When the plant closed he had the opportunity to go to work for Handy & Harmon in Indiana but his family wanted to stay in Dover. He found other work.

In 2002 he was offered the chance to become the first executive director of the Tuscarawas County Port Authority. The organization was given the task of developing a golf course/hotel/conference center near Dundee but that project soon fell through.

The agency then shifted its focus to the old Reeves Mill in Dover which closed in the 1990s.

More:Three things to know about the Reeves Mill Chimney renovation

When Eadon took a tour of the facility he recalled that only four people were employed there four security guards. It was also home to lots of pigeons. The plant was owned by AK Steel which was asking $4.8 million for the property.

""When we took a tour I talked with the person that was in charge of real estate for AK Steel and I talked with him about the price. He said well you know what just make us an offer"" Eadon said.

Eadon offered the man $1.4 million and he agreed.

They closed on the deal on Dec. 31 2002 and the port authority had a lease agreement by mid-January 2003 with Owens-Corning which leased 252500 square feet in the building for five years. The rent the company paid the port authority paid for all renovations at the plant now known as the Reeves Mill Business Park.

Later Deflecto moved in. When Owen-Corning moved out Deflecto was in the process of expanding. It now leases almost 300000 square feet of the building. Extreme Trailers occupies much of the rest of the building.

About 225 people now work at the Reeves Mill Business Park.

Bringing change to Gnadenhutten

Eadon next turned his attention to the old Alsco plant in Gnadenhutten.

The plant was built in 1948 and housed Alsco-Anaconda for about 50 years until the company closed in 1997. About 6.7 acres at the site was listed as a Super Fund site in 1986 by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The area was cleaned up and delisted in 2001.

When Eadon first visited the plant it was owned by BP.

He toured the abandoned facility with the mayor of Gnadenhutten and a representative from BP.

""We talked about what we might be able to do to help them market it and they said we're terrible at this. We buy property. We're terrible at selling it. How about if we sell it to you?"" Eadon recalled.

""I said I have a dollar in my pocket. I could pay you a dollar for it. No we'd probably have to have more than that. I said how much more?""

BP wanted a couple of million dollars.

""I said it would be a hard sell. We went back and forth for five or six months. They finally came back to me and said we liked what you did at the Reeves Mill. We think you would be the right partner to do something with. So they sold it to us for $1.""

Soon after some executives from Plymouth Foam came from Wisconsin. They shared a facility with Progressive Foam in Beach City but they needed a place of their own. Eadon took them to Newcomerstown where one of their competitors Pacemaker Plastics was located.

He also took them to the Alsco plant but they weren't interested.

Two months later Plymouth Foam bought Pacemaker Plastics. Pacemaker had two plants in Newcomerstown but Plymouth officials knew they needed to be consolidated into one location. They were looking for 100000 square feet of space but none was available in Tuscarawas County.

In the winter of 2005 Plymouth executives called Eadon to set up another tour. But on their way to Ohio their plane crashed killing the two brothers who owned the company.

It was several months later when Eadon met with the acting president and chairman of the board.

""We looked around Newcomerstown"" he said. ""There was nothing nothing that big. And they didn't want to build because they didn't have time to build. So I took them to Gnadenhutten.""

And the deal was made.

Helping out with ODOT ... and more

Eadon was also involved in redeveloping the old Ohio Department of Transportation property on W. High Avenue in New Philadelphia. With a $700000 Clean Ohio grant his agency was able to tear down the buildings and abate the asbestos. Buffalo Wild Wings and a car wash are now located there.

The economic development corporation is now working on redeveloping the old Howden Buffalo plant in New Philadelphia. The plant closed in June 2014 and in 2020 Howden donated it to the agency.

Eadon and his successor Marla Akridge envision it as a mixed commercial and residential area.

He said three developers have already expressed interest in it.

Eadon is now looking forward to retirement.

He will be 69 in a couple of months. He and his wife Lorrie would like to spend more time with their three grandson and do some boating. Eadon said he will also have more time to umpire softball and referee football games which he enjoys.

He credits God for his success in economic development.

""The things that we've done some of them almost seem accidentally as I look back on the last 20 years"" Eadon said. ""They really do seem sort of accidentally but it's not. It's all the Lord that's been driving this and opening doors.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMTkvY2xpbWF0ZS9lbmVyZ3ktdHJhbnNpdGlvbi1jbGltYXRlLWNoYW5nZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,There's a Messaging Battle Right Now Over America's Energy Future (Published 2022),"Climate scientists oil executives progressives and conservatives all agree on one thing these days: The energy transition is upon us.

The uninhibited burning of fossil fuels for more than a century has already warmed the planet significantly and cleaner and more sustainable sources of power are urgently needed in order to avoid further catastrophic changes to the environment.

But even as longtime adversaries use the same terminology calling in unison for an “energy transition” they are often talking about starkly different scenarios.

According to the scientific consensus the energy transition requires a rapid phasing out of fossil fuels and the immediate scaling up of cleaner energy sources like wind solar and nuclear."

The company Arkansas' largest electric utility has asked the state Public Service Commission to approve the rate increase which would raise monthly bills for the average residential customer by $8.27. Average usage is considered 1000 kilowatt hours per month and that monthly bill currently is $110.76 Entergy said in its filing.

The rate increase would automatically show up on bills in April unless an objection is filed to challenge the rate calculations Entergy filed with the PSC on Wednesday.

In the filing Entergy says it is paying more for fuel used to generate electricity and wholesale prices paid for additional electricity. The increase would appear as a fuel and purchased power line item on monthly bills.

""The total increase that customers could see on their bill will vary based on their individual energy usage and the kilowatt-hours consumed at their home"" Ventrell Thompson acting vice president of customer service for Entergy said in a statement Friday.

Under PSC rules Entergy's cost-recovery rider says the company must file an evaluation of its energy costs by March 15 every year. The utility is required to file working papers that outline the reasoning and costs related to the request -- regardless of whether it is a decrease or increase.

Rate adjustments go into effect automatically unless the commission's staff or other intervening parties challenge the company's calculations.

""Staff is reviewing this information now"" Donna Gray the commission's executive director said Friday. ""Absent staff or other parties raising any issue with regard to the calculation the rider provides that the new rate will go into effect for bills rendered on and after the first billing cycle of April. A procedural schedule or commission order is not required under the terms of the approved rider.""

Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge's office was non-committal when asked to comment Friday on whether it would challenge the rate change. ""The attorney general is reviewing this large increase as part of Entergy's filing"" spokeswoman Amanda Priest said.

A business consumer group is reviewing the request as well and also says it's too early to decide whether to oppose the request.

The Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers which represents large industrial and agricultural businesses is ""scrutinizing the filing to see whether there is any aspect of the requested increase that it can challenge"" Jordan Tinsley a Little Rock attorney for the group said Friday. ""Since our experts have not finished their scrutiny of the filing yet it is difficult for me to offer a prediction about what AEEC will advocate with regard to [Entergy's] filing.""

Tinsley noted that the rate increase is related to the severe weather Arkansas experienced in February 2021 when much of the state was covered in up to two feet of snow for weeks.

Entergy however said in its filing the request is primarily related to ""a large under-recovery balance as a result of higher natural gas prices in 2021 particularly in the fourth quarter.""

The company said total energy costs for 2021 spiked to $313 million a 17.4% or $46.5 million increase from 2020. That increase was ""driven by higher fuel and energy prices"" the filing said.

Gas prices escalated as the February 2021 winter storm ravaged much of the United States the company said adding that spot gas prices jumped up during the storm and remained volatile for the rest of the year.

Entergy is seeking to increase fuel recovery costs from just below 1 cent per kilowatt hour to 1.8 cents. That rate would be effective through March 2023. The utility says energy cost recovery accounts for about 9% of a residential customer's monthly bill.

Rates were lowered over the past two years the company said noting the current rate is the lowest in more than 10 years. Company officials noted the utility's efforts to bolster its energy supply through investments in areas such as nuclear power and other diversified sources has helped customers.

""At Entergy Arkansas we carefully plan and invest our resources to provide reliable power and keep rates as low as possible"" Kurt Castleberry director of resource planning and market operations said in a statement.

""Last year our nuclear generation sources set a record"" Castleberry added.. ""Low cost emission free power provides about 70% of the electricity our customers consume to help insulate them from the cost swings of natural gas. This kept the ECR [Energy Cost Recovery] rate from going even higher.""

The utility which is owned by Entergy Corp. of New Orleans serves residential business and commercial customers in 63 Arkansas counties.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Not only the album rich in lyrics and sound but the songs also manage to sound fresh which is a rarity in this day and age. Hana Vu is the real deal when it comes to someone who can be commanding yet also creative and it was a real treat to see these stellar songs performed live.

Hana Vu was also quite grateful for her packed audience at Schubas Tavern after her original tour date was moved because of the pandemic. She thanked the audience several times for their gushing applause and talked about how much it meant to her to have such a warn showing of adoration on the first night of her tour. Though Vu performs with a drummer guitarist and bassist (while she herself plays mainly guitar and occasionally bass without missing a beat) it is hard to deny that her presence alone is what makes the magic. Even when she laughed and when prompted by the audience said she guessed her favorite food was soup you really felt you were in the presence of someone special and deserving of all the accolades.

Live the main difference within her 45 minute set was that the songs came off a little more raw and edgy with the vocals vs. the smoothed over luscious vocals found on the album. Though there are pedal effects to emphasize the presence of some chord progressions one gets a slightly more stripped down sense of the power she has when she belts out her lyrics. There’s still a great deal of strength in the way the songs evolve into fruition both live and on album. For example the way “My House” begins with a mood like a lullaby only to knock you over the head with the powerful guitar rifts as she sings about the end of the world. “World’s Worst” and “Keeper” were also fantastic to hear live especially after listening to them so long as the recorded album versions. The way the intensity was built up really brought to home the fact that Hana Vu is hopefully on the verge of what is to be a long and artistic career and is as genuine as they come.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tdXNrb2dlZXBob2VuaXguY29tL25ld3MvbGlmZXN0eWxlcy9va2llLWZyb20tbXVza29nZWUtZmFtaWx5LWZhaXRoLWtlZXAtY29idXJuLXNwZWlyLWFjdGl2ZS9hcnRpY2xlX2EyOTYxZmQxLWU3MDItNWMyNy04ZWY1LTQ0N2ViMTQ0MTFiNC5odG1s0gGeAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm11c2tvZ2VlcGhvZW5peC5jb20vbmV3cy9saWZlc3R5bGVzL29raWUtZnJvbS1tdXNrb2dlZS1mYW1pbHktZmFpdGgta2VlcC1jb2J1cm4tc3BlaXItYWN0aXZlL2FydGljbGVfYTI5NjFmZDEtZTcwMi01YzI3LThlZjUtNDQ3ZWIxNDQxMWI0LmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Okie from Muskogee: Family faith keep Coburn-Speir active,"Muskogee OK (74401)

The proposed ordinance prohibits overnight sleeping and leaving unattended belongings on county-owned or county-leased property.

The rule would apply to the New Hanover County Public Library in downtown Wilmington where some of the city's homeless spend their days and nights. The county owns the entire library block bounded by Grace and Chestnut streets and Second and Third streets.

The proposed ordinance change is set to go before the New Hanover County Board of Commissioners for a vote on Monday. It's currently included on the board's consent agenda which means the change could be approved along with several other agenda items in a single vote.

A summary of the proposed changes indicates New Hanover County has seen ""significant issues of concern"" with the downtown homeless population despite outreach efforts from the city of Wilmington nonprofits and other county departments.

Last fall Wilmington Downtown Incorporated added a downtown street outreach specialist to help connect the homeless in downtown Wilmington with housing services. The pilot program was added to address panhandling littering and other issues that sometimes stem from the unsheltered population.

More:Addressing the 'housing crisis': Market Street hotel could become new efficiency apartments

But in recent months there have been several alleged assaults from unsheltered individuals multiple instances of disruption inside the library and the use of outdoor areas as bathroom facilities according to the board of commissioners' agenda summary.

""This amendment is in hopes of addressing some of these matters and making it a safe place for all"" wrote Alex Riley New Hanover County's communications and outreach coordinator in an email to the StarNews.

The area has long been a place where the unsheltered sleep and store belongings. It's also been used as a distribution site for local groups that provide food and other resources to the unsheltered.

The ordinance prohibits sleeping on all county-owned property between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. It also makes it illegal for people to ""occupy camp ... or place erect or utilize any tents cooking equipment or bedding"" during that time period.

Items left unattended for more than two hours will be considered abandoned and disposed of at the discretion of New Hanover County.

Anyone who violates the ordinance could be fined $50 removed by law enforcement and considered a trespasser. Those removed from county property could be civilly or criminally prosecuted.

If the ordinance is adopted community outreach will help inform anyone who could be impacted by the changes so they can comply with the rule and while it can be enforced by law enforcement that's intended to be ""a last resort"" according to Riley.

Still those who help serve New Hanover County's homeless have concerns about the long-term impacts of the proposed changes.

“It is a slippery slope to choose the path of criminalizing homelessness when you do not have a solution to no longer be homeless” said Lee Anna Stoker the executive director of First Fruit Ministries.

First Fruit Ministries has worked to serve the homeless in Wilmington for more than 20 years and currently distributes food twice a week to the homeless downtown. Stoker said she understands the pressure to balance multiple interests including downtown business owners residents tourists and the homeless but said the ordinance could put up another barrier to housing the unsheltered.

“Adding restrictions and fines just further sinks people into a hole of debt and obstacles to self-sufficiency” she said.

The proposed changes surprised some local service providers said Judy Herring Continuum of Care director with the Tri-County Homeless Interagency Council.

“This being on the agenda was a bit of a surprise to us” she said. “I had not heard anything about it and it was not on our radar.”

That highlights a need for better and more frequent communication between local government staff and organizations working with the homeless population she said.

Herring also called the change ""a little premature"" because recent efforts like WDI's addition of a downtown street outreach specialist and the re-introduced Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness or PATH program haven't had time they need to make a difference.

“It takes time for these programs to work” she said.

By prohibiting sleeping on county-owned property the ordinance could force the homeless onto private land and into neighborhoods and other areas where they feel safe spending the night. That could scatter unsheltered individuals making it more difficult for organizations to locate them and provide services.

“I hope that I'm wrong"" she said ""but I foresee unintended consequences.”

When the greatest archive of the ancient world the Library of Alexandria was destroyed all its precious resources disappeared.

That’s certainly the way most people think of the vandalization that ravaged the world-renowned collection in 391 A.D. The truth however is more complicated with echoes that reverberate from the days when “data storage” was on papyrus scrolls to the multiterabyte cosmos of the cloud.

See if this sounds familiar. By the time the Alexandria library was set ablaze the institution had been in decline for centuries victimized by anti-intellectual purges administrative infighting and resignations lack of funding falling membership and the need for more secure storage space. As a result by the time the fatal fire was lit the majority of the Alexandria Library collection had already been dispersed (probably sold off) to other institutions around the Mediterranean.

The ancient library at Alexandria

Technology has not made the problem any easier. Modern digital storage is still expensive and data and audio/video can be lost when older websites are no longer technologically supported when links become corrupted when budgets run out when new technology renders older storage systems obsolete and much more. Our information and cultural history may not be as secure as we believe it to be.

To understand the issues facing archivists today I spoke with several experts on the subject: Charles Amirkhanian long-time producer for Pacifica Radio station KPFA and co-founder (with Jim Newman) in 1993 of the new and experimental music organization Other Minds; Indian music scholar and performer Jody Cormack archive assistant for the World Music Archives at Wesleyan University in Middletown Connecticut; and Robert Chehoski manager of the Media Management Archive for Bay Area educational television station KQED and KQED FM.

Their stories victories and laments proved amazingly similar as they face the challenge of storing editing and cataloging vast collections of recorded material on disintegrating reel-to-reel magnetic audio and video tape vinyl records audio cassettes VHS and Betamax video and reels and reels of 16 mm film. And even as their efforts to preserve these materials makes progress the state-of-the-art data storage program they are using today could be out of date in a month. Remember the days when 10K of RAM was considered a wonder? They also face the dilemma of determining what should be saved or lost; how to maintain funding and secure storage while weathering administrative changes.

When I was employed at KQED (from 1969–1974) the station believed it was more cost-effective to reuse tape than store and catalog it. I personally watched reel after reel of 2-inch videotape filled with culturally significant programs placed on a massive magnet and erased. Decades of music dance opera art and cultural criticism programs were consigned to oblivion.

The loyal opposition at the station the producers resorted to clandestine midnight raids to rescue their programs. One such mission resulted in the liberation of the master reels for the 1970 music special An Hour with Pink Floyd (which I co-produced with John Coney). Recently remastered the show is now part of the archive at the Getty Research Institute Library in Los Angeles. It is also safely stored at KQED and appears on Pink Floyd’s The Early Years 1968–1972 legacy box-set.

The Archive or the Dumpster?

I asked Charles Amirkhanian if KPFA was archiving programing in 1969 when he went to work for the Berkeley radio station.

“No” he answered simply. “The station was so short of tape supply there was a crisis every time an important person showed up for an interview. If our tape allotment for the month had run out we had to erase a tape and lose whatever was on it. I eventually began setting aside a box of 12 reels and kept them in a locked cabinet for emergencies.”

“To give you an idea of the amount of audio tape the station required” Amirkhanian said “When we would record the entire Cabrillo Music Festival it required six cases of tapes.”

Charles Amirkhanian

A tragic loss to KPFA’s archive of interviews and performances took place in 1988 Amirkhanian recalls.

The plan was to move 1000 reels of labeled and edited tapes to Pacifica’s KPFK facility in North Hollywood. I assumed it was all going into storage forever. But instead of being taken to KPFK’s building someone put them all in a self-storage unit. Every month a bill would show up at the station and nobody knew what it was for. Finally a new manager came in and said to just stop paying it. They did and eventually the contents of the unit were sold at auction. In 2015 tapes began showing up on eBay with my handwriting on the boxes! They’d be asking $200 for a tape of Pauline Oliveros. Some showed up in China. I bought as many back as I could. I even had an alert on my computer. Years of performances entire Cabrillo Festivals in-depth programs on composers produced by Charles Shere and Alan Rich were entirely lost. We have no idea where they went.”

A similar tragedy says Amirkhanian was narrowly avoided in 1999.

“I got a call from KPFA’s manager Jim Bennett. He said they had a whole room filled with tapes of classical and new music. ‘We don’t have room for them’ he told me. ‘We were going to put them out in the alley and let them get picked up. Would you like them?’

“The question was where to take them? Ultimately the savior of the tapes was Bay Area art-storage specialist Scott Atthowe who offered an available space (recently vacated by Bay Area artist William Wiley) to store the tapes.”

“We rented a van and the 4000 tapes were saved” Amirkhanian recalls. “Later with the aid of a $160000 matching grant from the NEA we were able to digitize the tapes. They are now stored on Brewster Kale’s massive digital repository internetarchive.org.”

Saving a World of World Music

Jody Cormack arrived at Wesleyan University in 1991 with an extensive background in Indian music and performance with a degree in ethnomusicology from the University of Washington and advanced studies in the World Music department at California Institute of the Arts in Valencia (CAL ARTS).

“When Jennifer Hadley and I were hired the university had just gotten a two-year NEH grant to process all the recordings that the World Music Department had inventoried” Cormack explained. “Jennifer’s specialty is Indonesia. Mine is India. We had thousands of open-reel tapes to go through and we worked with a team of graduate students from the music department. A lot of the magnetic tapes were shedding. Some had mold and had to be baked to extract the information.

Jody Cormack at Wesleyan University's World Music Archives

“There were reels of film and early videotape recordings of performances I had done in India. There was also a collection of film footage of performances by South India’s most famous artists from the 1950s. Everything needed to be cataloged restored and eventually digitized first to CDs and DAT. Then when electronic files came in we had to transfer them again and store them on a server. But even that technology has gone through four generations of storage systems since we started and each time requires a whole new learning curve. Now we’re using Google Drive and R-Store but that’s about to change too” Cormack said with a visible note of frustration.

“What we really need to do is get a grant to go back to the beginning and digitize everything from the originals up to the point where we began using digital files. That’s a huge task. Funding is a constant issue and we’re at the mercy of the University. It’s always about a space tech support quality control and budgeting.”

But as Cormack observes even when things seem to be secure something can go disastrously wrong.

“It’s best to have the originals stored safely and a preservation copy off site. The idea is if something does go wrong there’s another copy. But there’s no funding for that. Look what happened from the fire at Universal Studios.”

On June 1 2008 between 40000 to 50000 archived videos digital and film copies and 118000 to 175000 master audiotapes belonging to the Universal Music Group were destroyed.

“We’re storing performances on the cloud” Cormack explains. “But uploading performances takes up an amazing amount of data storage space hundreds of terabytes. We like to think the cloud is secure. But is it?”

“I Can’t Stand the Cloud!”

“I have a unique position at KQED” explains Robert Chehoski. “I was hired in July 2011 to manage and inventory the station’s archive in association with WGBH (Boston) the American Archive of Public Broadcasting and the Library of Congress. The project’s goal is to compile all the PBS station archives into one database.”

When Chehoski first went to work for KQED however he found the condition of the station’s archive in a state of chaos.

“At that point KQED no longer had a chief librarian” he points out. “Producers were taking tapes out of the library and making copies. The archives were upside down. It was an unbelievable mess. Tapes were stored everywhere — boxes stashed in broom closets under people’s desks in the machine room off the garage. When I started asking questions no one knew anything.”

Sorting it all out was a laborious process but Chehoski (an experienced archivist) got it done.

“We had to go through it all tape by tape. In some cases there were five copies of the same show: There was the one-inch master the 3/4-inch dub three versions of the VHS. There was so much duplication it ended up filling up dumpsters. There were things that the rights had run out on that no one had gotten rid of — ancient copies of British Antiques Roadshow. It took six months to compile it on a single database. There were also reel and reels of 16 mm film that are now archived and stored at San Francisco State University.”

The popular thinking of the moment Chehoski emphasizes is that data storage on massive cloud servers represents the ultimate way to preserve content. He disagrees. Strongly.

“This is an issue I have fought over. I can’t stand the cloud. People have an idea of what it is. But the reason I don’t like it is because I don’t think the technology and the right business model is here yet.”

The way Chehoski sees it “When a media organization decides to store everything on the cloud what that means is your media data is being held hostage by providers like Amazon. When you start to upload 4K video to the cloud (which takes forever) you get nickel-and-dimed for everything. When you need to download the high-resolution version you get nickel-and-dimed [again]. And if you decide you hate the service and say I’m done with it you have to pay so much money to get your media material back it’s like ransom.”

Chehoski recommends the use of a tiered storage system using disks that hold up to 2 1/2 terabytes on a 3-inch square the thickness of a hockey puck. But he says he has no doubt the storage capacity will soon increase making it possible to store enormous data sets safely in less space making it possible to bypass the cloud entirely.

These are just the observations and experiences of three professional archivists. Imagine how many archive/libraries there are in the Bay Area the state the nation the world. Looking back I’m sure the keepers of the Alexandria Library imagined their data-storage system was state-of-the-art their security system topnotch. They were probably certain the collective knowledge of the known world they had amassed was secure against whatever was to come.",,,

The chip was included in Counterpoint's list of the volume share for Application Processors (AP) used by Android phones last year broken down by the price range for the handsets supplied.





For example with Android phones considered to be in the premium-flagship tier priced at $900 and up Qualcomm's Snapdragon chipsets had the leading market share of chips powering phones in that price bracket. For Android handsets priced in the range of $500-$699 and $800 to $900 and higher Qualcomm was still the leading supplier. Samsung was second with its Exynos AP chips although it did surpass Qualcomm and supplied more chips to mid-range Android phones in the $700-799 range.

Huawei still had some Kirin chipsets left in inventory







MediaTek finished third in the premium/flagship segment followed quite surprisingly by Huawei's HiSilicon brand. In 2020 the U.S. changed its export rules blocking foundries using American technology from shipping chips to Huawei  even those chips that Huawei designed itself. The Hi-Silicon chipsets that Huawei used last year for its own devices most likely used up the last of the company's inventory and led to its inclusion in the chart.







Huawei has been using 4G LTE versions of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 888 chipset on its new flagship models. There has been speculation that the company will manufacture a phone case that will allow the P50 series to connect to 5G networks







Google Tensor Google's first homegrown chipset made for the Pixel 6 series had a very small slice of the Android chipset pie for phones priced above $900 (which probably includes most configurations of the Pixel 6 Pro ) Android handsets priced in the range of $500-$799 ( Pixel 6 purchases).





Qualcomm still had the lead in supplying chips to high-mid-range models priced in the $300-$499 tier. Its top AP chips in that sector included the Snapdragon 870 720G 750G and 778G. In that price band MediaTek's Dimensity SoCs had the second largest market share with Samsung dropping off to third and Huawei a close fourth.





In the low-mid-range category MediaTek and its Dimensity chipsets had the lead last year with Qualcomm second Samsung third Huawei fourth and Unisoc fifth. For low-end handsets priced at $99 and less MediaTek had the vast majority of the market with Qualcomm second Samsung third and Unisoc fourth.





Counterpoint says that to alleviate chip shortages in the future Qualcomm could rely on dual-sourcing from both TSMC and Samsung. When it comes to its designs the research firm says that ""Qualcomm is generations ahead of its competition when it comes to premium experiences in a chipset whether it is compute (CPU DSP GPU) AI (NPU) connectivity (4G 5G sub-6GHz 5G mmWave Wi-Fi6/6E) security or gaming capabilities.""

As for MediaTek Counterpoint points out that most of MediaTek's growth came from smartphones priced wholesale at $299 and less. The research firm says that most of the shortages in the chip market were for SoCs destined for 4G LTE handsets.



As expected MediaTek dominated the low-end of the smartphone market







MediaTek is going after Qualcomm and Samsung's flagship business with the Dimensity 9000. Most of the smartphone manufacturers in China such as OPPO vivo Xiaomi and HONOR will release phones powered by the Dimensity 9000 this year. And Counterpoint says that MediaTek could end up supplying chips to as much as 10% of the premium Android market this year.

Samsung suffered declines in market share for its chipsets across most price points. Big changes were seen in the low-mid segment ($100-$299) where Sammy's market share declined from 17% in 2020 to 7% last year. Samsung outsourced its phones belonging to its mid-high segment where its share decreased from 13% in 2020 to 6% in 2021.





Samsung Mobile handed off the design and manufacturing chores for many of its high-mid-range handsets including models in the A F and M series. These third-party design firms mostly employed AP chips designed by Qualcomm MediaTek or Unisoc instead of using Samsung's own Exynos chipsets.

While the recordings are convincing they are characterized by very strong colors in the default settings. Particularly objects in the background appear very sharp. In portrait mode this doesn't happen and you can optionally either blur the background using a Bokeh mode or replace it in other ways.

However the showpiece is the main camera which consists of a total of four sensors a phase and a contrast autofocus. The primary sensor is a 50-MP True Chroma camera which is able to use an optical image stabilizer (OIS). It is accompanied by an additional 40-MP monochrome camera which is even more light sensitive. In addition there is also an ultrawide angle lens with 13 MP as well as a 64-MP telephoto lens with OIS. The latter allows for 3.5x optical zoom 10x hybrid zoom and 100x max digital zoom. The stabilization of such powerful zoom levels succeeds fairly well but there is a slight delay with movements. It is always better to support your hand holding the phone. Up to a 30x zoom level we like the pictures fairly well and they are still usable depending on the purpose. However often some intermediate levels such as 5x zoom are not calibrated optimally and the autofocus seems to have some problems in setting the optimal focus point. The images are characterized by a strong contrast and the algorithms sharpen the edges very strongly. Higher zoom levels are more of a gimmick.

The main sensor benefits from the new Huawei XD lens as well as the XD Fusion Pro image engine. With its double lens Huawei again achieves a powerful low-light performance but isn't in a class by itself anymore. In daylight the photos are also characterized by a large dynamic range crisp contrasts and vibrant colors. You can record videos using both the front and main camera in Ultra HD at up to 60 FPS.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRwb2xpY2UuY29tL2lxb28tOS1wcm8tZmluZ2VycHJpbnQtc2Vuc29yL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The iQOO 9 Pro has the best in-display fingerprint scanner yet and now I want it in every phone,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRwb2xpY2UuY29tL2lxb28tOS1wcm8tZmluZ2VycHJpbnQtc2Vuc29yL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

A California man took his proselytizing to New York flooding mailboxes with unsolicited copies of his 85-page self-published book.

The purple envelopes which appeared in several Manhattan neighborhoods this month contain “Changed” by Tom Cantor detailing his path from a Jewish upbringing to embracing Jesus Christ.

Upper East Side resident Sarah Feinmark who is Jewish said the book made her feel “both irritated and uncomfortable.”

“When you get something delivered to your home it feels like a line has been crossed” she said. “Of course we get junk mail all the time but in this day and age a time of rampant hate it immediately felt like an act of anti-Semitism.”

Gramercy Park resident Suzanne Fenech-Pascocello got five copies and took them to her building’s recycling room where she saw a stack of others.

Tom Cantor says he considers himself a Jew who believes in Jesus Christ and wrote the book when he was diagnosed with cancer over a decade ago. friendshipwithgod.org

“I think it was ridiculous” she said.

Cantor 71 told The Post he didn’t care if recipients tossed the tome.

“There’s going to be some that are going to embrace it and they’re going to say “I love this book it speaks to my heart’ ” he said. “I’m out for those people.”

Cantor said he considers himself a Jew who believes in Jesus Christ and that he wrote the book when he was diagnosed with cancer in 2010.

“I want them to find what I found” he said. “I found the cure for spiritual cancer.”

Cantor would not say how many copies he distributed or how he targets the recipients. He’s mailed them to other cities in the last few years including Detroit St. Louis and Portland Ore.

Cantor founded the Scantibodies Laboratory. Evelyn Cordon/NY Post

Cantor is the founder of Scantibodies Laboratory — a Santee Calif. biotech company. His bio on the company website says “When Tom was 19 he had a life changing experience by discovering the great happiness and joy the Bible can bring. Because of that experience he offers hope and security by reaching out to Jewish people.”

In 2009 Cantor won a $45 million award as part of a federal whistleblower lawsuit filed in Brooklyn against Quest Diagnostics and a subsidiary over allegations that some of their tests were unreliable and inaccurate.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVwbG9hZHZyLmNvbS9xdWVzdC0yLWFpci1saW5rLWZyYW1lcmF0ZS1pbnN1cmFuY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AFI 'Framerate Insurance' Smooths Quest 2 Air Link Connection Drops,"Air Link Framerate Insurance (AFI) is a new experimental feature which fakes dropped frames reducing judder caused by WiFi connection issues.

Air Link is a Quest feature which lets the device act as a wireless PC VR headset via your WiFi network. It was shipped as a software update in early 2021 but third party alternatives like Virtual Desktop and ALVR have been available since the release of the original Quest headset in mid-2019.

Using your home WiFi network rather than a dedicated transmitter isn’t exactly ideal though. The signal can be degraded by obstacles like solid walls or interference from nearby networks. And worse frames can be dropped or delivered late if too many other devices are congesting the network.

Air Link and its alternatives use dynamic bitrate to adjust for connection speed reduction caused by signal degradation. But when a frame is received too late or never the previous frame has to be repeated even though your head has moved since then. The result is judder. This looks bad and can even make you feel sick.

That’s where the new AFI comes in according to Meta. When a new frame isn’t received on time AFI generates a synthetic new frame by analyzing the motion between previous frames to plausibly extrapolate this motion forward. Motion extrapolation isn’t perfect but it’s preferable to your entire view juddering.

Don’t confuse AFI with the recently released Application SpaceWarp. AppSW extrapolates motion too but it’s a feature for native apps running on Quest enabled by the developer. It generates every other frame synthetically so the app only has to run at half frame rate freeing up performance.

AFI is intended to help with occasional network issues but it’s not a magic bullet. Meta says AFI won’t compensate for WiFi connections so bad that multiple frames are dropped in a row since the plausibility of the synthetic frame would get worse the longer it’s been since a real frame was received.

AFI is currently disabled by default. You need to manually enable it in the Oculus Debug Tool (ODT). That’s found in the oculus-diagnostics folder in the Support folder of your Oculus software directory – C:\Program Files\Oculus\Support\oculus-diagnostics by default.

Meta warns AFI at 120 Hz refresh rate has glitches and isn’t currently supported  so make sure your Air Link is set to 90 Hz or lower.",,,,,,,,,

He’s the eternal Titan the first player to win the Super Bowl at age 43. But what’s fascinating regarding Brady’s persistent supremacy in the NFL seems to be that unlike some of the other elite athletes he’s open about just how he keeps his maximum prowess.

He attributes his effectiveness to the TB12 Method a five-pillar ultra-specific fitness regimen titled after his initials and shirt number. Although it appears to be straightforward maintaining the dietary pattern is rather difficult. Brady accomplishes it in a meta-human-like manner.

Is Tom Brady a flexitarian?

Brady’s diet is focusing on 80 percent plant-based food like grains and legumes and 20 percent organically lean protein like wild-caught fisheries or pasture-raised poultry according to TB12 Sports.

Many of the health benefits associated with veganism are available through this method including reformed gut health reduced inflammation and a reduced risk of certain diseases. However it provides just enough meat to be a reliable source of lean protein. Tom’s meals comprise about 80% plant-based foods and 20% animal-based foods. In his tenure with the Patriots that 80 percent might rise to 90 or 95 percent due to the harsh New England winter.

Tom Brady also debunks the fallacies about his veganism despite the fact that he eats meat. “When people ask if I’m a vegan or a vegetarian I tell them no decidedly not.”

However the athlete avoids nightshade vegetables like tomatoes mushrooms peppers and aubergines. It also includes liquor added sugars refined carbs processed meat fried foods and ketchup as he believes they develop inflammation. Tom also refuses to eat strawberries but only because he dislikes the fragrance.

What’s more in the TB12 method? What led this to exist?

Alex Guerrero Tom Brady’s friend personal trainer and godfather to one of his sons with his wife Gisele Bundchen helped Brady develop his diet and training plan. In Massachusetts they created the first TB12 Performance and Recovery Center in 2013 and Brady published the TB12 Method in 2017.

The pillars of the TB12 approach are “muscle pliability” a pseudoscientific term that encompasses an abundance of deep tissue massage from his body doctor. Hydration nourishment cognitive fitness operational and physical conditioning and a good old winner’s outlook. This also includes a comprehensive sleep pattern wearing bio-ceramic-infused sleepwear made by Under Armour. Moreover his dessert has a sour note to it.

Even Bruce Wayne takes a day off now and then. Brady agrees that if he has a hankering for pizza bacon or even chocolates he will not deny himself. However it must be excellent.

If you've been paying attention at all you've probably noticed that actually buying a graphics card has been next to impossible since the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 launched back in September 2020. But now that we're starting to see GPU prices fall a little bit we figured it was time to start talking about which GPU is the best value for gamers once again. After all if things continue the way they are the average gamer might actually be able to afford a graphics card soon – might as well know which is the best for you.

With the RTX 3080 Ti and the RTX 3080 the names can be a little confusing. While the RTX 3080 is no doubt powerful we found that in our testing the RTX 3080 Ti performs a lot like an RTX 3090 just at a relatively lower MSRP. So is that the card worth buying?

Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti vs RTX 3080: price

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti launched at $1199 / £1049 / AU$1949 for Nvidia's Founders Edition. Prices obviously go up from there especially these days but you should probably expect to spend between $1199 to $1400 on an RTX 3080 Ti when prices finally normalize.

The RTX 3080 however is much more affordable - at least it's supposed to be. At launch Nvidia's flagship GPU was set at $699 (£649 about AU$950) for that Founders Edition. However this is the graphics card that was hit hardest by recent price jumps and it's still seeing very inflated prices. Right now on Amazon we're seeing it between $1200 and $1600 in the US. That makes it about the same price as its big sibling.

In fact even on Amazon at the time of writing you can get the Gigabyte RTX 3080 Ti Gaming OC at $1449 which is basically the same price as an RTX 3080 right now. If it comes down to it and you have to pick between an RTX 3080 and an RTX 3080 Ti that's even like $100 more you should absolutely go for the RTX 3080 Ti. It's just so much faster.

Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti vs RTX 3080: specs

When you first hear the name ""RTX 3080 Ti"" you'd be forgiven for thinking it was just a minor mid-generation spec bump over the original RTX 3080. However Nvidia really cranked up the dials for it.

The original Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 was launched with 10GB of GDDR6X memory on a 320-bit bus. That memory was paired with 8704 CUDA cores and a 1.71GHz boost clock. It was refreshed a little while ago with a 12GB option. That option also comes on a higher 384-bit memory bus along with slightly more CUDA cores at 8960.

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti on the other hand has significantly more CUDA cores coming in at 10240 with a boost clock of 1.67GHz. That means it's significantly more powerful than either version of the RTX 3080. It's actually closer to the RTX 3090 with its 10496 CUDA cores. However it has the same amount of RAM as the refreshed RTX 3080 with 12GB of GDDR6X memory on a 384-bit bus.

That really drives home that the two cards are significantly different from one another. If you're looking to do 4K gaming the RTX 3080 Ti is simply going to be better at it than the original RTX 3080. And that means less compromising on fancy graphics effects like ray tracing.

Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti vs RTX 3080: performance

Specs only mean so much though. Who cares about a bunch of numbers on a sheet when what really matters is how these graphics cards handle the best PC games.

In 4K gaming the RTX 3080 Ti breaks away from the RTX 3080 providing a nearly 10% performance difference. For instance it is able to get 95 fps in Dirt 5 at 4K with all the settings maxed where the original RTX 3080 gets 86 fps. Obviously both cards excel at this resolution and 86 fps is nothing to shake a stick at - but you can't deny that an extra 10 fps helps.

However if you're playing at a lower resolution you're going to see diminishing returns especially at 1080p. Both of these graphics cards will blow any current game away at that resolution so paying more for an RTX 3080 Ti doesn't really make sense.

On the other hand it's totally possible that future games will put the more powerful graphics to the test at this low resolution. And if you're buying this expensive of a graphics card for 1080p gaming it's likely you're the type that wants to buy something that will last a long time anyway.

Either of these graphics cards will be excellent for 1080p gaming at a high frame rate so pro esports players will likely find a lot to love. The RTX 3080 Ti can easily handle a game like Overwatch and hit above 244 fps which is good news for anyone that relies on speed to enhance their reaction speed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9hcHBsZS1tMS11bHRyYS1ydHgtMzA5MC1iZW5jaG1hcmtz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple M1 Ultra's 64-Core GPU Fails to Dethrone the Mighty RTX 3090,"When Apple first announced its new M1 Ultra last week the company was full of bluster boasting about the chip's performance credentials. The company claimed that the M1 Ultra could offer greater performance than the Intel Core i9-12900K while consuming 100 fewer watts at load. But the most outrageous claim was likely the assertion that the M1 Ultra's 64-core GPU offered better performance than the flagship NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 while undercutting it by 200 watts in power consumption.



Those parts rank among the best CPUs and best graphics cards and many people were rightfully skeptical about these claims especially after Apple's GPU performance projections for the M1 Pro and M1 Max didn't quite mesh with real-world performance. To test Apple's claims the folks at the Verge got their hands on a maxed-out Mac Studio configured with the most potent M1 Ultra SoC (20-core CPU 64-core GPU) paired with 128GB of unified memory.

The most problematic aspects of Apple's benchmarks from last week were that it provided no frame of reference for its figures didn't properly label them and didn't even tell us which apps were being tested. This is typical Apple behavior so it shouldn't be too surprising. However the Verge's testing showed that its test rig with a Core i9-10900 and 64GB of RAM put up a Geekbench 5 Compute score of 215034 compared to 83121 for the Mac Studio with M1 Ultra (102156 when using Metal).



Not everyone puts a lot of stock in synthetic benchmarks like Geekbench so the Verge also fired up Shadow of the Tomb Raider and the RTX 3090 easily mopped the floor with the M1 Ultra delivering 142 fps at 1440p and 114 fps at 4K. Unfortunately the Mac Studio could only muster 108 fps and 96 fps respectively. Those aren't horrible numbers but we expected more from an alleged RTX 3090 killer.

Perhaps more important is that the publication's $6199 Mac Studio provided nearly as much grunt as its previous generation $14000 Mac Pro test system in a much smaller package. Arguably that's a more impressive feat for Apple than picking a fight with dedicated graphics cards like the RTX 3090.



Why does Apple even bother with these fanciful benchmark graphs to tout superiority over processors and GPUs from the PC sphere? Even with its 5nm process node Apple can only push the 64-core M1 Ultra GPU so far in a 60-watt envelope. On the other hand the RTX 3090 can take full advantage of its 350-watt TDP to deliver blazing fast and consistent performance in a wide variety of scenarios. Sure there might be a few specific benchmarks where the M1 Ultra's GPU might come out ahead on the performance-per-watt scale but if we're talking all-out performance we have to side with the RTX 3090.



Are the M1 Ultra's 20 CPU cores and 64 GPU cores impressive? Yes most definitely. However should Nvidia GPU and Intel CPU engineers be hanging their heads in shame over the mere arrival of the M1 Ultra? Absolutely not.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpemNoaW5hLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAzLzIwL252aWRpYS1teDU3MC10by1ib2FzdC10aGUtc2FtZS12aWRlby1jb2RlYy1hcy1yeHQtMjA1MC_SAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5naXpjaGluYS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy8yMC9udmlkaWEtbXg1NzAtdG8tYm9hc3QtdGhlLXNhbWUtdmlkZW8tY29kZWMtYXMtcnh0LTIwNTAvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia MX570 to boast the same video codec as RXT 2050,"NVIDIA has just unveiled the NVIDIA MX150 250 350 450 four-generation MX series graphics cards all without NVENC / NVDEC video codec units. The info comes straight from industry insiders “Golden Pig Upgrade Package”. A new report suggests that the upcoming NVIDIA MX570 will have the same NVENC / NVDEC video codec unit as the RTX 2050.

According to the new report from ITHome the NVIDIA MX570 and the RTX 2050 boast the same core as the RTX 3050. Both of which are 2048 CUDA cores. The NVIDIA MX570 comes with a 2 GB 64-bit GDDR6 memory. Meanwhile the RTX 2050 comes with a 4 GB 64-bit GDDR 6 memory. According to NVIDIA’s official introduction the NVIDIA MX570 graphics processors stand as the fastest among NVIDIA MX GPUS.

The NVIDIA MX570 graphics card stands as the fastest graphics processor among the newest NVIDIA MX GPUs. It can accelerate the work and the entertainment experience of Notebook computers. The graphics cards feature more efficient CUDA cores and faster video memory than previous MX GPUs the MX570 delivers faster photo editing video editing and gaming than the latest integrated graphics.

It can be seen that the upcoming NVIDIA MX 570 mobile GPU will also pack good performance in video encoding and decoding. Whether the NVIDIA MX550 with the previous generation GTX 1650 core. It will feature the NVENC / NVDEC video codec unit is unclear.

RTX 2050 and consequently NVIDIA MX570 fall behind the 96 EU Iris Xe GPU

MechRevo a Chinese notebook manufacturer also reveals data on video encoding efficiency on Full HD and Ultra HD screens with the RTX 2050. Interestingly Intel’s integrated graphics the Iris Xe 96 EU GPU has a large advantage over NVIDIA’s dedicated card. Check out:

Let’s see if the NVIDIA MX570 will move the industry as a cost-effective version. NVIDIA still pushes the industry of graphics cards forwards and its hardware is always building hype. For this year we expect the company to disclose the RTX 4000 series. However getting one of these this year may still be a hard task. The graphics cards are still super expensive due to the continuous constraints in the industry of semiconductors. Moreover there is an ever-growing demand due to crypto mining needs. The price of a gaming PC has become way higher than it was in previous years. Even used hardware has become expensive. Worth noting that not even NVIDIA has been free of the tensions during the ongoing conflict.

This year NVIDIA has unveiled the RTX 3050 in a bid to satisfy cost-effective needs.

AMD also has its own range of RX graphics cards to compete with NVIDIA’s standards. But they are still falling shortly behind due to some proprietary technologies like DLSS that make RTX cards stand beyond the competition.

NVIDIA is soon expected to launch its most powerful graphics card ever -- RTX 3090 Ti. The company recently launched some budget and mid-range graphics cards and at the end of the presentation the brand officially teased the RTX 3090 Ti which is the biggest and the most powerful graphics card from the company to date.

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti will not just be a powerful graphics card but it will also be one of the most expensive graphics cards from NVIDIA. According to a Canadian retail listing the RTX 3090 Ti is said to cost $5439.93 for the Asus ROG Strix LC RTX 3090 Ti graphics card. Do note that there is also a different variant of the RTX 3090 Ti with TUF branding which costs $4649.19.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Specifications

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti will be one of the first mainstream gaming-class graphics cards with 24GB of GDDR6x video memory. The graphics card will come with a GA102 chip with 10752 CUDA cores and should even handle 8K gaming with ease. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti is expected to have a TDP of around 450W and one might have to use at least 800/900W PSU.

The memory is said to offer 21Gbps of bandwidth and in terms of performance it will offer up to 40TFLOPs of top performance. The RTX 3090 Ti will offer better performance than the RTX 3090. The RTX 3090 Ti will have better gaming performance and should be one of the go-to graphics cards for those who want to play games at 4K and 8K resolution.

How Much Will RTX 3090 Ti Cost In India?

Kardashian has been romantically linked to Davidson since they were spotted holding hands on a rollercoaster last October at Knott's Scary Farm in Buena Park Calif. They also shared an onscreen kiss earlier that month on SNL when she made her hosting debut.

The SKIMS mogul finally made their relationship Instagram official last week and she revealed Wednesday on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that Davidson has gotten ""a few tattoos"" in tribute to her as well as a ""branding"" of her name.

She previously revealed that her family's new flagship Hulu reality series The Kardashians will include ""the details that everyone wants to know"" about their relationship although she noted: ""I have not filmed with him. And I'm not opposed to it. It's just not what he does.""

Lawmakers fear China could access classified information The Wall Street Journal reported.

Utah's Chris Stewart said ""anyone would be concerned if there are financial entanglements with China.""

Elon Musk's business connections to China are at the center of conversations among lawmakers in Washington.

The Wall Street Journal reported that while SpaceX may not have direct ties to China some Republican lawmakers are concerned China could gain access to classified information through the firm's foreign suppliers which may have ties to Beijing.

Human rights issues are also a concern. In January Tesla was under scrutiny for opening a showroom in China's controversial region Xinjiang where the government has been accused of committing crimes against humanity.

The showroom opened a few weeks after President Biden signed a bill approved by Congress to ensure any imported products from Xinjiang weren't manufactured with forced labor.

Utah's Rep. Chris Stewart told the WSJ that despite being a fan of Musk and SpaceX ""anyone would be concerned if there are financial entanglements with China.""

Musk's lawyer Alex Spiro Tesla and SpaceX did not respond to Insider's requests for comment.

Insider's columnist Linette Lopez previously wrote in an analysis that while Musk hasn't broken any US laws by ""launching Xinjiang on its electric journey"" it was as though he was spitting in the face of Washington by selling cars to the people who are profiting from the suffering of Uyghurs.

The president of the Alliance of American Manufacturing industry body Scott Paul told BBC in January: ""Any company doing business in Xinjiang is complicit in the cultural genocide taking place there. But Tesla's actions are especially despicable.""

In 2019 Musk acquired cheap land in Shanghai. It has now become a Gigafactory where half of Tesla's global deliveries in 2021 came from Insider's Huileng Tan previously reported.

Florida's Senator Marco Rubio told the WSJ in a statement that ""any company operating in China is going to be pressured and exploited by the Chinese Communist Party.""

In December Rubio urged his Senate colleagues to support his American Financial Markets Integrity and Security Act. If passed it would prohibit US investment in Chinese companies that pose threats to America's national security.

While Tesla owns its factory China still owns the land on which it is built and its contract requires the company to generate a certain amount of tax revenue in order to stay on the land Insider previously reported.

Meanwhile Tesla opened its first European plant in Germany last year which had been built under a series of provisional permits.

Michael McKean and Annette O'Toole are spreading the cutest couple vibes for their 23rd wedding anniversary.

The pair marked their silver plate anniversary on Sunday with some sweet tributes to each other as McKean 74 shared a candid photo of his wife 69. ""23 years ago I married my best friend and it is working out beautifully. Thanks for saying yes @creamofwool"" he wrote.

""I'll say. 23 years ago today"" O'Toole added in quote tweet sharing a photo from their 1999 wedding day.

They previously started the day with some cute online banter. ""Dear @MJMcKean. Happy Silver Plate Anniversary. Lub LMM"" she wrote to which McKean responded: ""Um…the silver plate store was closed so I owe you. Free for dinner?""

Some of their celebrity friends were feeling the love and helped them celebrate in the replies. ""Hooray!!"" wrote Patricia Arquette. ""Happy anniversary you crazy kids"" Seth Green responded. ""Awwww. Beautiful. Happy happy anniversary"" Meredith Salenger commented.

Salenger's husband Patton Oswalt also marked the occasion. ""'Honey! Uhhhhh… did you know that the traditional 23rd wedding anniversary gift is a used VHS tape of CLUE?'"" he wrote referencing McKean's role as Mr. Green in the 1985 comedy.

O'Toole and McKean were friends since the late '70s often running into each other at parties hosted by Rob Reiner and Ed Begley Jr. Their romance only started after filming their 1998 TV movie Final Justice which they recalled in a 2018 video for TheaterMania.

The Smallville actress remembered McKean calling her one night after he finished watching ER while she was in bed with her sick kids (she shares two daughters with ex-husband Bill Geisslinger).

Sarah Michelle Gellar will always be Buffy in our hearts. We all wanted to be her (and nothing’s changed on that) and learn everything we can about the hit series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. In a recent interview for Evan Ross Katz’s new book Into Every Generation a Slayer Is Born: How Buffy Staked Our Hearts Gellar revealed that she had a few “heated moments” with Buffy co-star and on-screen BFF Alyson Hannigan.

She said “Look we worked really hard hours. We were young we had ups and downs. Everybody had arguments.” Gellar added that another co-star David Boreanaz was reportedly a handful as well. “There were times where David [Boreanaz] could be a handful. He never really was to me but I’m sure [he was]. And I’m sure I was the same way to people also right? It wasn’t rosy. Nobody gets along all the time. And Alyson [Hannigan] and I had moments. There’s no question. But you’re young.”

Gellar added she attributes the ongoing heated set atmosphere to be a byproduct of director Joss Whedon who many past Buffy stars like Charisma Carpenter Emma Caulfield Julie Benz and Danny Strong (according to HollywoodLife) has said made the work environment pretty toxic and even abusive. “I think that unfortunately the set we were on and the world we were in was pitting us against each other. I think it would have been different if it was today. It would have been a very different relationship. But we have a great relationship now.”

Gellar also added that she’s “not excusing” herself either. “There are times where I wish I could have done things differently but I didn’t know how to handle the stress that I was under. I was really young and I didn’t have any outside life. I was the one that was always working and sometimes I would be resentful of the fact that they didn’t have to work all the time. It ebbs and flows and anyone that tells you they get along with everyone all the time it’s just not true.”

Buffy the Vampire Slayer was at one point everyone’s favorite show as it followed a girl named Buffy Summers and her friends who have to fight the evil monsters of the world. The show went on for seven years garnering a cult-like fanbase (including us.)

Friday March 18 2022 || By Michael Romain || @maywoodnews

Roy Strohm the waste disposal company at 1201 Greenwood Ave. in Maywood has been based in the village for some six decades. Starting April 1 the company will finally be able to do business there too.

Maywood’s Board of Trustees decided to go with the hometown company for residential waste hauling services after a 5-year waste hauling contract with Republic Services expired.

Roy Strohm was sold to Morton Grove-based Lakeshore Recycling Systems (LRS) in January 2021. The merger with LRS finally allowed Roy Strohm to do business with Maywood Maywood Mayor Nathaniel George Booker said. The village entered into a five-year contract with LRS that runs from April through March 31 2027.

“Lakeshore is right here in the village of Maywood” Booker said during a meeting on March 1. “They had been wanting for years to get business with Maywood but at the time they weren’t large enough to do so. With them expanding and becoming part of Lakeshore they now have the capability of providing full service for Maywood.”

Booker touted the benefits of switching to LRS which he said include savings of roughly $100000 a year new waste carts recycling containers that are “three times the size” of Republic’s the company’s e-waste program and bulk pickup each week at no additional charge among other benefits.

“We would also have extra carts at $3 a month where we currently pay $15 a month” the mayor said. “They have also prodded us a $3000 a year portable toilet allowance and they will be sponsoring three different community events.”

Maywood Trustee Aaron Peppers who co-chairs the board’s Infrastructure and Sustainability Committee lauded the company’s presentation during a committee meeting in February .

“Their presentation was excellent” Peppers said. “We’re going to save plenty of money in the village and we’re bringing back one of our own.”

“It’s important to realize they pay taxes here” said Trustee Antonio Sanchez adding that the company pays “a lot of money to be here.”

Last year Booker said despite the acquisition the Strom family is still active in the village. The firm recently expanded its footprint acquiring property south of the company’s Greenwood Avenue offices where First Student buses used to be parked.

During the March 1 meeting George Strohm the vice president of municipal services with LRS said residents now see red and blue trucks around town — red being the color of Strohm trucks before the firm was sold and blue being the color of LRS trucks.

“I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in front of you and hopefully partner with you for the long term” Strohm said. “I did feel like the opportunity to provide a larger recycling bin for residents would be really helpful and provide the similar services of your surrounding municipalities.”

Trustee Isiah Brandon said he didn’t like the process by which the village secured LRS’s business arguing that it “appeared to be behind closed doors. This board did not give direction to really go after any company. We had no dialogue of what we were going to do in regards to this.”

Booker and Peppers both pushed back against Brandon’s assertion arguing that the process for vetting and evaluating LRS had been happening since the board learned in August that Republic’s contract was up for renewal.

Peppers said that John West the village’s public works director and financial staffers were consulted a public committee meeting was held at which both LRS and Republic presented competing proposals and all of the trustees had access to the proposed contracts.

“As far as doing our due diligence and doing it properly behind the home rule of Maywood we did do our due diligence” Peppers said.

“Presentations have been made it went through committees we did tours we had transparent conversations with Republic and LRS” Booker said before adding that Brandon as co-chair of the Financial Accountability and Government Transparency Committee never brought his concerns up before the March 1 meeting.

“Nobody on this board except for you and [Trustee Miguel] Jones the agenda [for that committee]” Booker said. “So if you wanted it on your agenda the only two people who would have made that happen are the two of you.”

As part of the transition to LRS Maywood residents will see a change in service days LRS officials said on the company’s website.

Revived in 2008 after a two-decade hiatus the BFGoodrich Tires Mint 400 earned its place in pop culture as a setting in Hunter S. Thompson's novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. In real life “The Great American Off-Road Race” is less hallucinogenic but possibly even dustier than described with roars of crate LS3 engines taking over every conscious thought.

If you were to venture out into the Mojave Desert near the course about a week before the event you would have seen junked cars riddled with bullet holes from target practice abandoned camp sites food wrappers and other pieces of trash littering the landscape. After the race you’d find the entire area cleaner than it was before and the organizers of the Mint 400 have everything to do with that: this year during its Desert Cleanup day dozens of volunteers worked with Republic Services to collect and haul away an astonishing 16.41 tons of trash.

BFGoodrich Tires Mint 400

CEO Matt Martelli told me on site that sustainability efforts have become an essential part of his team’s planning. He works closely with the Bureau of Land Management to ensure both the legacy of the race and the enjoyment of these public lands for generations to come.

“We have a fantastic relationship with the Bureau of Land Management” Martelli said. “Before we got involved there was a large area that was going to be shut down and taken away from us. What we found out is that they just wanted people to be responsible; this is such a beautiful and important area. If you go right behind these mountains there are herds of big horn sheep coyotes mountain lions; it’s really such a diverse ecological area.”

Permitting costs top out at about $150000 for a 48-hour closure plus prep and cleanup time and Martelli believes the investment into maintaining the desert and ecological awareness is well worth it.

“It’s fun to race on a course that is beautiful and challenging” he said. “There’s an area near San Diego that is way overused called Plaster City and it just sucks to go in there; it’s like the surface of the moon; all the vegetation is dead. We want to make sure this area never turns into that.”

The BFGoodrich Tires Mint 400 and Republic Services first partnered in 2017 with the Dash for Trash during which volunteers collected and removed 14.54 tons of trash from the desert. That partnership became the Mint 400 Desert Cleanup in 2018 and the numbers of volunteers and trash removed continues to grow.

At the same time Martelli and his leadership team research the flora and fauna of the area to figure out how they can keep the land from experiencing the effects of overuse. Even though the Mint 400 only lasts a few days and individual off-roaders have a much bigger impact during the rest of the year Martelli wants to leverage his organization for good as much as he can.

“The idea of being an off-roader is to go off road” he said. “It’s to get away from the city and away from human beings and get into nature the same as a hiker would. I don’t want to get out in the middle of nowhere and see garbage so we pick up other people’s trash. The trash ruins the experience.”

The Mint 400 site says the majority of trash left behind in the area is a result of illegal dumping and recreational shooters use the trash for target practice which creates toxic micro-waste. Martelli and his volunteers can’t stop that but they can help clear away what they can and hopefully encourage others to be more responsible.

“We’re tree huggers at heart” Martelli told me. “There has always been this stereotype of off-roaders being damagers of the environment and that’s not us.”

After attending the BFG Mint 400 for the first time this year I can't wait to go back! Sign me up to collect trash too; it's a noble initiative and one I hope more people pay attention to when they go off-roading on their own.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vdm9pY2VvZnNhbmRpZWdvLm9yZy8yMDIyLzAzLzIwLzUtdGhpbmdzLXdlLWxlYXJuZWQtYWJvdXQtdGhlLWNvc3Qtb2YtbGl2aW5nLWluLXNhbi1kaWVnby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Things We Learned About the Cost of Living in San Diego,"Chances are you know that San Diego is an expensive place to live. Rents across the region rose almost 30 percent last year and if you’re lucky enough to be able to afford a home good luck finding one. The number of homes on the market has decreased by as much as 80 percent since 2018 according to some counts.

But that’s not all. The cost of utilities childcare food and other basic necessities are all on the rise. Our team at Voice of San Diego dedicated this week to exploring the specific ways these burdens are impacting residents. We heard from families across the county about their bills and what it takes to survive here.

Here’s what we learned.

The Numbers Are Stacked Against San Diegans

While San Diego’s home prices are among the top three in the United States by most measures median income is not. San Diego’s median household income — at $85507 per year — is below that of many other metro areas.

We spoke to four individuals who agreed to break down their family’s monthly spending to get a picture of how they’re making it work.

“You have to roll with the punches” said Christopher LeFall a father of two and a full-time student who lives in Chula Vista. “You have to put one foot in front of the next and just keep moving.”

Of the families we spoke with all told a similar story: Getting by comfortably in San Diego is becoming more and more a luxury that only the ultra-wealthy can afford.

Read more about the families we spoke with and see their budget breakdowns here.

Section 8 Is Not the ‘Golden Ticket’ It Once Was

Lisa Halverstadt spoke with North Park resident Daniel Palmer who received a Section 8 voucher eight years ago after more than a decade of waiting. He moved from his car into a one-bedroom apartment but now risks losing his home.

“I’m heading toward homelessness” Palmer said.

The 61-year-old was notified earlier this year that his rent would increase by 90 percent — from $1025 to $1950 come April 1. The San Diego Housing Commission signed off on the rent increase after a formal request from his landlord. He’s now bracing for an eviction notice.

In her story Halverstadt explains why a regional housing shortage that spawned those surging rents and home prices has also spawned booming demand for rental assistance and subsidized affordable housing. Even San Diegans who receive Section 8 assistance or live in affordable housing — two much-wanted resources sometimes considered golden tickets — are feeling the pinch she writes.

Read more about why housing subsidies can’t keep pace with surging rents here.

Transportation Costs Are Often Overlooked

Housing costs and transportation costs go hand-in-hand. And together writes Andrew Keatts they make an already-unaffordable housing situation even worse.

This week Keatts documented the difficult decision tens of thousands of San Diegans make to move out of the county and commute back for work. But money spent on cars and driving isn’t always the biggest cost facing those fleeing local housing prices.

“More than that it’s my family” said Dohney Castillo a sanitation worker who commutes from Murrieta to Chula Vista every day missing out on time with his girlfriend 4-month-old daughter and stepdaughter who just started high school. “Those two to three hours on the road every day without them it’s changed my mind. I’m looking for something in the area.”

According to researchers the typical household in San Diego spends 57 percent of its income on housing and transportation alone — the fifth highest of any region in the country.

Read more about the stats and the overlooked cost of transportation here.

We’re Paying More for Water Even as We Use Less

Yes you read that right. San Diegans are using less water but the costs we pay continue to rise.

That’s because it takes a lot of infrastructure to get water from the Colorado River and we pay for that infrastructure based on how much the region sells to San Diegans that use it.

Except San Diegans are using less water than they used to. That means the cost of maintaining the infrastructure is going up while the money the region makes from selling the water is going down.

MacKenzie Elmer explains it best in a story about why costs have crept up and what some in the region think San Diego should do to alleviate the growing burden of water costs on the local ratepayer.

Related: If you’re interested in learning more about utility costs Elmer also broke down every charge on your gas and electric bill and explained why your bill is likely higher these days. Read that here.

Childcare is Hard to Come by

Finally we looked at childcare availability in San Diego. For an infant and toddler full-time care can cost an average of between $16000 and $20000 per year but finding a spot isn’t easy.

Scott Lewis found that San Diego only had enough licensed care to serve about 40 percent of working parents before the pandemic. About 10 percent of those options have since closed and many more have yet to re-open.

“We’re seeing intense burnout for moms for families who are struggling with stress every day” said Kim McDougal executive director of the YMCA Childcare Resource Service. “That kind of chronic stress can lead to negative outcomes for mental and emotional wellbeing. That kind of stress can impact children their whole lives.”

Of all the parts of San Diego’s cost-of-living crisis the access to and affordability of childcare seems like the one we could most easily address writes Lewis. But so far policy solutions are falling short and some of them may make the situation worse.

“I don’t understand how utilities for a condo could be $439. I charge an electric car and my highest SDG&E bill has been like $140 and water is like $120 every two months.” – danhansmoleman “It’s doable! My utility bill is on average anywhere from $200-500 in a single bedroom apartment. I am disabled and my medical devices require a lotttt of extra energy. Unfortunately $439 for a condo with two kids isn’t that absurd. Those types of bills happen.” – littlemopeep1



“I would love to read a story on all the massive luxury apartment developments in Mission Valley and the wasted opportunity given the prime location to make them at least partially affordable. Instead they are mini-resorts with prices to match. Whatever happened to regular garden-style apartments with a small pool and a gym? Basic middle-income housing.” – Catherine MacRae Hockmuth

In India 81 percent agreed that poor sleeping habits can have a negative impact on one's quality of life and that getting enough sleep is critical for maintaining one's immunity; 53 percent attempted to get more sleep to address this. Those who struggled with sleep also reported mood swings (24 percent ) as well as difficulty concentrating during the day (21 percent).

""We conducted this survey to investigate the importance of a good night's sleep and its impact on one's wellbeing"" said Carlos Montiel ResMed's Vice President of Latin America and South Asia. ""The findings show that people struggle to sleep at night and are interested in learning more about their sleep habits and sleep quality.""

People are seeking ways to improve sleep habits

• 72 percent of respondents surveyed said that insufficient sleep or poor quality of sleep had worsened their emotional state.

• People in India are willing to take action to improve their sleep health to prevent it from further affecting their quality of life with as many as 81 percent saying bad sleeping habits can affect their quality of life.

• 34 percent were also aware that snoring was a sign of a poor night's sleep resulting in 51 percent of respondents using sleep trackers to keep records of sleep patterns and 35 percent expressing interest in keeping track of their health during sleep.

Despite these sleep challenges only 21 percent of those polled sought help from a general practitioner or a healthcare specialist. Furthermore 59 percent believe that snoring is a sign of a good night's sleep emphasising the importance of raising awareness about sleep health. Many people are also unaware that the symptoms they experience while sleeping could be indicators of a sleep disorder such as Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).

Mood changes such as irritability or depression morning headaches and excessive daytime sleepiness are the top three symptoms cited by both males and females surveyed in relation to their sleep. Despite this 32 percent of those polled said they had never heard of OSA.

Over 80 percent of adults worldwide with sleep apnea are undiagnosed and unaware of their condition. Common signs and symptoms of OSA include excess weight high blood pressure and diabetes.

The ResMed-commissioned study claims that in India around 55 of adults face trouble sleeping at least three nights a week. Survey adds that 65 per cent of people in India fear that reopening of work from office will disrupt their sleep more.

The study called ResMed Asia and Latin America Sleep Health looked at the overall sleep habits and their impact on the well-being of respondents across the region. The survey conducted online by Atomik Research across India (5004) Brazil China Japan Korea and Mexico found that the majority of the respondents around 17040 surveyed suffered from insufficient sleep or poor sleep quality with only 21 percent of total respondents waking up feeling refreshed in the morning.

As per the survey 81 per cent people in India agreed that bad sleeping habits can affect quality of life and said that getting enough sleep was important for keeping their immunity strong; 53 per cent tried to get more sleep to address this. Those struggling with sleep also cited mood changes (24 per cent) and difficulty concentrating through the day (21 per cent) as challenges.

“We embarked on this survey to investigate the importance of a good night’s sleep and its impact on one’s wellbeing” said Carlos Montiel Vice President Latin America and South Asia ResMed. “The findings show us that people struggle to sleep at night and are looking to understand their sleep habits and sleep quality.”

Of the total surveyed people 72 per cent of respondents said that insufficient sleep or poor quality of sleep had worsened their emotional state. The survey claimed that people in India are willing to take action to improve their sleep health to prevent it from further affecting their quality of life with as many as 81 per cent saying bad sleeping habits can affect their quality of life.

Lack of awareness of sleep disorder

Only 34 per cent people who are surveyed were aware that snoring was a sign of a poor night’s sleep resulting in 51 per cent of respondents using sleep trackers to keep records of sleep patterns and 35 percent expressing interest in keeping track of their health during sleep.

Spotlighting the need for awareness about sleep health the survey highlighted that moreover 59 per cent believe that snoring was a sign of a good night’s sleep Many also continue to be unaware that the symptoms they face in relation to sleep could be signs of potential sleep disorders like Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). “The top three symptoms cited by both males and females surveyed in relation to their sleep include mood changes such as irritability or depression morning headaches and excessive daytime sleepiness. Yet amongst all surveyed 32 per cent stated they have never heard of OSA” added the survey. Alarmingly only 21 per cent of respondents surveyed have sought help from a general practitioner or a healthcare specialist.

The survey reports claim that over 80 percent of adults globally who have sleep apnea are undiagnosed and unaware that they suffer from sleep apnea . Common signs and symptoms such as excess weight high blood pressure and diabetes can also alert you for OSA.

“Our goal at ResMed is to help people sleep breathe and live healthier high-quality lives through better access to treatments and innovative solutions said Carlos Montiel vice president Latin America and South Asia ResMed.

He added “The insights from this survey underline the factors impacting sleep and highlight the need for more awareness around sleep disorders so that people struggling with insufficient sleep or poor sleep quality can get diagnosed and seek the right treatment if needed. By enabling better care we can improve sleep habits and reduce the impact of chronic diseases.”

Tom Brady may have been feted as the NFL’s greatest of all time when he announced his retirement a little more than a month ago. But that didn’t stop him from deciding he was having more fun on the gridiron than off.

Schultz meanwhile slides back into the CEO role where he’s been twice before hinting at brewing up some big changes while a new permanent chief executive is sought.

They are among the most prominent would-be retirees who would rather toil in familiar jobs rather than idle away their days.

The idea of going back on the job as a boomerang employee is becoming easier to accept as COVID-19 at least for the moment is in retreat making it safer to return to workplaces.

LinkedIn the job search and networking website found that 4.5% of newly hired employees among the companies on its site were returning workers in 2021 up from 3.9% in 2019.

“It’s always easier to go back to somewhere where you were comfortable” said Michelle Reisdorf a senior regional director for recruiting firm Robert Half. “It’s such an easy transition back into the workplace.”

Back to what's familiar

For freshly minted retirees those who decide to go back to work reflects a rebound from The Great Resignation the name given to the phenomenon of large numbers employees ditching their jobs during the pandemic. They could quit knowing that with the latest unemployment rate standing at a mere 3.8% last month employers remain anxious to fill empty positions and there are still plenty of opportunities to go around.

He certainly doesn't need a job but Schultz will be hoping his third time back as Starbucks’ CEO is a charm. He was CEO from 1987 to 2000 then returned in 2008 and stayed in the role until 2017. He tested the waters for a possible presidential run in 2020.

Starbucks had 11 stores when he began. Today it has 28000.

This time Schultz is stepping in temporarily upon the retirement of CEO Kevin Johnson and will work for $1 a year. But Schultz indicates that he won’t just be warming the chair. Rather he’s already sounding like a change agent.

“Although I did not plan to return to Starbucks I know the company must transform once again to meet a new and exciting future where all of our stakeholders mutually flourish” the company quoted Schultz 68 as saying in making the announcement.

'My place is still on the field'

Like many boomerang employees Brady paints his return as a labor of love returning to the workplace that he cares about the most.

""These past two months I’ve realized my place is still on the field and not in the stands. That time will come. But it’s not now” he tweeted in making his announcement.

He’s reveled in so much glory over 22 NFL seasons that there’s not much more he could do to burnish his legacy. Brady won the Super Bowl seven times was the Super Bowl MVP five times in addition to being named MVP for the regular season three times.

Yet forestalling retirement or returning isn’t a particularly new phenomenon in sports. As Mike Jones in USA TODAY Sports recently pointed out Brady joins a list that includes Michael Jordan Brett Favre George Foreman Michael Phelps Roger Clemens Mario Lemieux and Floyd Mayweather to name a few.

It’s much the same for some other CEOs in the business world. Steve Jobs returned to Apple taking the company to new heights and Jack Dorsey boomeranged as CEO of Twitter. (Then departed the post again in November.)

Michael Bloomberg came back as CEO at Bloomberg and Michael Dell at Dell Technologies as noted in a list compiled by Inc.

Apparently there’s an extra incentive to retake your place when the company bears your name.

Tight end Robert Tonyan is reportedly set to return for a fifth season with the Green Bay Packers.

According to Tom Silverstein of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel the Packers are bringing back the 27-year-old on a one-year contract. Tonyan has spent his entire four-year playing career in Green Bay.

Retaining Tonyan was a significant move for the Packers after they traded star wide receiver Davante Adams to the Las Vegas Raiders on Friday. With quarterback Aaron Rodgers returning for an 18th season in 2022 it's important for Green Bay to keep weapons he's comfortable with.

Tonyan emerged as Rodgers' favorite red-zone target during the 2020 season when he enjoyed a breakout year and tied for the NFL lead in receiving touchdowns by a tight end with 11. He also recorded career highs of 52 receptions and 586 yards that year.

Tonyan's 2021 season was cut short by a torn ACL which he suffered in Week 8 against the Arizona Cardinals. He finished the year with 18 catches for 204 yards and two scores.

Ryan Wood of the Green Bay Press-Gazette pointed out that Tonyan's injury likely impacted his market in free agency paving the way for the Packers to bring him back on a team-friendly deal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9jb21tZW50aXNmcmVlLzIwMjIvbWFyLzIwL2JpZy1vaWwtZ2FzLXByaWNlcy13aW5kZmFsbC10YXgtcnVzc2lhLXVrcmFpbmXSAWRodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vY29tbWVudGlzZnJlZS8yMDIyL21hci8yMC9iaWctb2lsLWdhcy1wcmljZXMtd2luZGZhbGwtdGF4LXJ1c3NpYS11a3JhaW5l?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Big oil could bring US gas prices down but won’t – so hit it with a windfall tax,"This morning I filled my car with gas costing almost six dollars a gallon. My car is a Mini Cooper I bought years ago partly because it wasn’t a gas-guzzler. Now it’s guzzling dollars.

When I consider what’s happening in Ukraine I say what the hell. It’s a small sacrifice.

Yet guess who’s making no sacrifice at all – in fact who’s reaping a giant windfall from this crisis?

Big oil has hit a gusher. Even before Vladimir Putin’s war oil prices had begun to rise due to the recovery in global demand and tight inventories.

Last year when Americans were already struggling to pay their heating bills and fill up their gas tanks the biggest oil companies (Shell Chevron BP and Exxon) posted profits totaling $75bn. This year courtesy of Putin big oil is on the way to a far bigger bonanza.

How are the oil companies using this windfall? I can assure you they’re not investing in renewables. They’re not even increasing oil production.

As Chevron’s top executive Mike Wirth said in September “We could afford to invest more” but “the equity market is not sending a signal that says they think we ought to be doing that.”

Translated: Wall Street says the way to maximize profits is to limit supply and push up prices instead.

So they’re buying back their own stock in order to give their stock prices even more of a boost. Last year they spent $38bn on stock buybacks – their biggest buyback spending spree since 2008. This year thanks largely to Putin the oil giants are planning to buy back at least $22bn more.

Republicans will balk at any tax increase on big oil of course

Make no mistake. This is a direct redistribution from consumers who are paying through the nose at the gas pump to big oil’s investors and top executives (whose compensation packages are larded with shares of stock and stock options).

Though it’s seldom discussed in the media lower-income earners and their families bear the brunt of the burden of higher gas prices. Not only are lower-income people less likely to be able to work from home they’re also more likely to commute for longer distances between work and home in order to afford less expensive housing.

Big oil companies could absorb the higher costs of crude oil. The reason they’re not is because they’re so big they don’t have to. They don’t worry about losing market share to competitors. So they’re passing on the higher costs to consumers in the form of higher prices and pocketing record profits.

It’s the same old story in this country: when crisis strikes the poor and working class are on the frontlines while the biggest corporations and their investors and top brass rake it in.

What to do? Hit big oil with a windfall profits tax.

The European Union recently advised its members to seek a windfall profits tax on oil companies taking advantage of this very grave emergency to raise their prices.

Democrats just introduced similar legislation here in the US. The bill would tax the largest oil companies which are recording their biggest profits in years and use the money to provide quarterly checks to Americans facing sticker shock as inflation continues to soar.

It would require oil companies producing or importing at least 300000 barrels of oil per day to pay a per-barrel tax equal to half the difference between the current price of a barrel and the average price from the years 2015 to 2019.

This is hardly confiscatory. Those were years when energy companies were already recording large profits. Quarterly rebates to consumers would phase out for individuals earning more than $75000 or couples earning $150000.

Republicans will balk at any tax increase on big oil of course. They and the coal-industry senator Joe Manchin even tanked the nomination of Sarah Bloom Raskin to the Fed because she had the temerity to speak out about the systemic risks that climate change poses to our economy.

But a windfall profits tax on big oil is exactly what Democrats must do to help average working people through this fuel crisis. It’s good policy it’s good politics and it’s the right thing to do.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9zcG9ydC5jb20vZm9vdGJhbGwvYnVuZGVzbGlnYS8yMDIxLTIwMjIvYnVuZGVzbGlnYS1saXZlLWJheWVybi1tdW5pY2gtdi11bmlvbi1iZXJsaW5fc3RvODg0OTU1OC9zdG9yeS5zaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert Lewandowski nets twice to equal Gerd Muller mark as Bayern Munich get back on track with win over Union Berlin,"Bayern Munich’s Bundesliga title charge got back up and running as they beat Union Berlin 4-0 at the Allianz Arena.

Bayern Munich have not had the best league results of late but that did not stop them from beating a Union Berlin side fighting for a European spot leaving them seven points clear at the top of the Bundesliga table.

The win now puts pressure on Borussia Dortmund who have a game in hand and face Cologne on Sunday.

Despite some early chances from Union Berlin who were able to force errors from Bayern’s backline the hosts had one thing the visitors did not: the ability to finish.

The first goal was a fantastic shot from left-winger Kingsley Coman who was able to beat Andreas Luthe by cutting inside from the left and whipping a shot into the top corner for his fifth goal of the season in the league.

Bayern’s second came from a corner. Union Berlin were lacking defensively which allowed Tanguy Nianzou to tower over everyone and score a fantastic header for his first Bundesliga goal in only his second start.

The third came on the brink of half-time with Robert Lewandowski scoring from the spot after being brought down in the box by Luthe after Paul Jackel’s header was mistimed.

The Polish striker scored a simple tap-in for Bayern’s fourth with a pass across the box from Jamal Musiala right after half-time.

The brace means that Lewandowski has now scored 31 league goals this season as he continues to cement himself as an all-time Bundesliga great.

Bayern Munich’s next match will be away to SC Freiburg before they travel to Spain to take on Villarreal in the Champions League quarter-finals.

Union Berlin who are now in eighth will hope to bounce back against Cologne who sit in seventh only a point separating the two as the fight for Europe continues.

TALKING POINT: BAYERN BACK ON TRACK

Things were looking a bit shaky for Bayern after back-to-back draws in the league. A strong performance was needed to ensure that their lead over Borussia Dortmund still remained strong.

Despite struggling at times this performance was an improvement on the matches against 1899 Hoffenheim and Bayer 04 Leverkusen. Julian Nagelsmann will take pleasure in the fact that his side were able to get the job done despite playing a back four (a deviation on their regular back three) and quite early through the match meaning he was able to rest a few key players in the second half.

PLAYER OF THE MATCH: KINGSLEY COMAN

Lewandowski may have scored a brace but Coman’s overall play just edged it. The winger’s strike came at a perfect time for Bayern with the visitors forcing mistakes out of the hosts' backline as it eased the pressure a bit. He was involved in most of Bayern’s attacking play and once again proved why he’s one of the best wingers in the world.

MATCH HIGHLIGHTS

16’ - GOAL! BAYERN MUNICH 1-0 UNION BERLIN: Bayern’s efforts of winning the ball back is rewarded as Coman puts the hosts in front. His goal is a classic ‘cut inside and shoot’ from just outside the box. Lots of pace on the ball means that Luthe can't get to it in time.

25’ - GOAL! BAYERN MUNICH 2-0 UNION BERLIN: The quality always comes through and Bayern are just different class. Unlike their opponents they can actually take their chances. It's Nianzou who scores a header from a corner. He towers over the defender and it's a great finish. This is his first goal in the Bundesliga in only his second start.

45+1’ - GOAL! BAYERN MUNICH 3-0 UNION BERLIN: Jackel's header falls short leaving Lewa one on one with Luche who collides with the striker. The ref almost immediately points to the spot and Fischer's head is in his hands as Lewa scores Bayern’s third just on the brink of half-time. Lewa has just scored his 30th league goal of the season and it's going to take a miracle for the visitors to get back into this.

47’ - GOAL! BAYERN MUNICH 4-0 UNION BERLIN: Bayern are absolutely ruthless. They score a fourth moments after the second half starts and who else but Lewandowski? Muller makes a direct vertical pass to Musiala who plays it across the box for a simple tap in giving Lewa a brace and his 31st goal of the season.

KEY STATS

Robert Lewandowski becomes only the second player after Gerd Muller to score 30 goals in a single Bundesliga season for the fifth time."

""The teacher's are always in need of additional supplies for students"" Sloan said.

While the North Lakeland store is about 44000 square feet Clark said the footprint of the Merchants Walk location is about half the size representing a trend with the retailer toward smaller retail space compared to earlier models.

""I wouldn't be surprised if we see another store opening in Polk County"" Clark said.

She added the company's rapid expansion offers upward mobility opportunities for employees interested in management position. The entry level wage is $10.25 per hour. Part-time employees can accrue paid time off and medical benefits with enough time on the job she said.

Hihn’s construction of the Santa Cruz Railroad began in 1874 achieving its first 5 miles of track south of the San Lorenzo River by December before even determining its route through town. On Feb. 3 1875 the town council approved a train route entering Santa Cruz across the mouth of the San Lorenzo River then along Main Beach and through “the Slot” between Beach Hill and Blackburn Terrace then up Chestnut Street with a depot at the foot of Green Street.

The same day the franchise for a Street Railway (horse-trolley) was also granted to the Santa Cruz Railroad directors. It would run from the Lower Plaza to Mission Street Vine (North Cedar) Cherry (East Chestnut) then take Chestnut to the Dolphin Bath House (Boardwalk). Chinese workmen built both the railroad and the trolley lines. Since the Chestnut-Cherry Street corridor was noted for its cherry orchards Hihn’s trolleys were painted red and became known as the “Red Line.” The franchise restricted fares to no more than 6¼ cents.

The line became independent of the railroad in January 1877 when it was incorporated as the “City Railroad Company.” Hihn incorporated a second line that August called the “Front Street Railroad Company.” In October 1877 James Pierce’s Santa Cruz-Felton Railway opened the Pacific Avenue trolley or “Yellow Line” organized by Charlie Silent (who’d established the west’s first trolley line in San Jose in 1868). The trolley line ended at the river mouth and had a spur on the Railroad Wharf. The line suffered the first winter from having not laid wooden planks between the rails thereby leaving the horses mired in mud and unable to work.

In September 1878 Hihn extended the Red Line to Wood’s Lagoon. Then in September 1879 the Yellow Line extended its service up Mission Street. Some of the Yellow Line’s tracks nearly duplicated Hihn’s Red Line which went into decline after the Yellow Line dropped its prices to a nickel a ride or 25 tickets for a dollar. Hihn’s railroad was also teetering on the financial brink and when the San Lorenzo River bridge collapsed both train and Red Line trolley went broke in 1881 lacking funds for repairs. Both were sold to the Southern Pacific who named Charles Crocker head of the Red Line trolley then pulled up its tracks and folded.

The Yellow Line took over the Mission branch with sidings encouraged in front of John Warner and William Effey’s stores but were forced to remove one in front of the Sentinel offices. When Southern Pacific rebuilt its newly purchased Santa Cruz Railroad line to broad gauge in 1883 it also removed the competitor Yellow Line tracks along Beach Street and promised-but-forgot to replace them. Ridership sagged and Yellow Line improvements were abandoned. Pierce sold the Yellow Line in 1887 to Elias Swift and Thomas Cole. Swift ran three hotels along this line upgrading the service in a year with a franchise to extend his trolley to the Fair Street’s Bay View Racetrack and Garfield Park and he hoped to make it the first electric trolley in the west. Swift’s sudden death in 1889 at age 41 brought a shocking end to this dream.

East Side trolley

William Ely was part of a competing group attempting to get a franchise out to Garfield Park circles. But he found East Side property owners more anxious for a trolley during an Eastside building boom. So Ely established a line running down Front Street and out Soquel Avenue to Arana Gulch with a side line running down Cayuga and Seabright then taking East Cliff to Twin Lakes. The two branches met at his trolley barn at Soda Junction (named for Lodtman’s soda works) where Lodtman Hall served as community center and hospital.

The Eastside Trolley opened May Day 1888 and while highly popular the track was above the grade of the road making it difficult for vehicles to cross. So on orders from county officials Ely raised the level of the road to meet the track bed creating a steep arch in the middle of the road that is still notable in spots today. The Cayuga Branch to Twin Lakes was opened in 1889. One knew the trolley was coming because Ely’s horses wore bells.

Electric trolley

Fred Swanton brought electricity to Santa Cruz and in 1891 hoped to establish an electric trolley on Pacific Avenue. However San Jose started the west’s first electric trolley which turned out to be an expensive failure in 1890. The Santa Cruz City Council refused to allow an “experimental” trolley on Pacific Avenue. When Swanton insisted it would work they granted him permission to electrify the Mission Street line if he finished an abandoned plan to complete the line out to Garfield Park (ending at today’s West Cliff and Woodrow).

Swanton did and its success convinced the city council to give Swanton permission for an electric line on Pacific Avenue. In the meantime to stimulate ridership on his demonstration line out to remote West Cliff he built a trolley park at the end of the line which included a museum Cliff House observatory casino ballroom and a ball park where the trolley-sponsored team “The Electrics” played baseball. This trolley park was the forerunner for Swanton’s boardwalk development a decade later. Swanton’s electric blue trolleys flew red flags if they only went as far as the Pope House (now Mission Hill School grounds) and flew blue flag if they went clear to West Cliff and sometimes the flag announced “Game Today.” The line gave free rides to policemen and officials on city business. Swanton electrified the Yellow Line in 1893.

Trying to keep up the Eastside Line introduced a steam trolley in 1895 named in honor of “William Ely.” But four months later the contraption was declared a public nuisance and limited to two runs a day so horse service came back for the rest of the runs. Ely retired his steam trolley in 1897 and service plummeted.

Swanton bought the Eastside line in 1902 and electrified it the following year. With it came the franchise to extend the trolley line to Capitola. This was organized as a separate line reaching Opal Cliffs by 1904. Swanton’s daughter Pearl served as conductor for a library fundraising excursion raising the most money through appeals and silly fees. The route ran on a low trestle over Twin Lakes Beach and served as a school bus. Students remembered winter storms when the beach disappeared under choppy ocean waters and occasional waves splashed the side of the trolley.

Union Traction Co.

Meanwhile the old Blue Line changed hands in 1904 and incorporated as “The Union Traction Company.” A new car-barn was built at the corner of Pacific and Sycamore and the West Cliff trolley park was sold to Norris & Rowe Circus in 1905 for their winter quarters. The Union Traction Co. was briefly sold to the Ocean Shore Railroad which intended to build an electric railroad from San Francisco to Santa Cruz along the coast. But the Ocean Shore stopped making payments after the 1906 earthquake and the trolley company reverted to its former owners. The trolley line suffered only a few twisted rails and disconnected wires which were quickly repaired.

The Union Traction Co. was purchased by John Martin co-founder of PG&E and Swanton’s chief backer in rebuilding the boardwalk grander than ever after a fire destroyed the 1904 casino. They upgraded the line changing their tracks to broad-gauge with double lines on a street so the trolley could follow the direction of traffic. The trolley company’s business offices were moved to San Francisco and expanded to run a wider trolley network. The new trolleys came from their Sacramento line.

Santa Cruz’s Union Depot included a trolley depot in 1907 extending a line up to De Laveaga Park in 1908. But thanks to a stock market crash that year the line opened as the last horse trolley in the county. It was finally electrified in 1910. The 1911 Casa Del Rey Hotel opposite the boardwalk had its own trolley spur up Cliff Street to the front door. By 1912 the local trolley was carrying about a million passengers a year on three lines: Capitola West Cliff and De Laveaga Park. This figure was 1.3 million by 1914. The Water Street trolley bridge constructed in 1914 was so beautiful the utilitarian Water Street carriage bridge was demolished and replaced with an identical copy of the trolley bridge.

‘Improvements’ disaster

What started out as a 1922 upgrade to Birney safety coaches ended up costing the company more from increased maintenance. On top of that the city hoped to improve the roads for a growing car population required the trolley company to pave between its tracks and two-feet on each side. These increasing costs lead the company to gain permission from the State Railroad Commission in 1924 to abandon their Eastside De Laveaga and Capitola lines and replace them with bus service. The irony was that buses could not be compelled to pave or maintain the roads as the trolley company’s had. The West Cliff line was dismantled in 1925 and Pacific Avenue in 1926.

The last straw was when Union Traction Co. now sought to abandon its Capitola bus line. The city council protested and the bus system was taken over briefly by Auto Transit then by the Southern Pacific’s bus company called Pickwick Stages. A former Pickwick driver Ralph Heple bought the operation in 1930 which became the Santa Cruz Transit Co. After the 1955 flood tourism and local businesses took a major hit with a number of downtown companies and the private bus service collapsing. After various bus rescue programs the Santa Cruz Metropolitan Transit District was formed in 1968.

I never have been and I don't think I ever will be. So perhaps it's not totally surprising that I failed miserably when I attempted to go surfing on a cruise ship recently.

That said I have done it successfully on two prior voyages each several years ago. So what changed apart from my age (and if I'm completely honest my level of physical fitness)?

Here's a look at what's required of passengers wishing to try Royal Caribbean's FlowRider surf simulator and why it's trickier to master than ever before.

What is the FlowRider surf simulator on Royal Caribbean ships?

In 2006 Royal Caribbean put its first FlowRider on a vessel Freedom of the Seas allowing passengers to boogie board and surf on a cruise. Now the line has them installed on nearly its entire fleet — specifically its Freedom- Oasis- and Quantum-class ships.

The FlowRider began as a land-based way to simulate waves required for surfing. It has a semi-enclosed padded (like a wrestling mat) incline. High-powered jets spray water up the incline with enough force to allow riders to surf or boogie board.

There are dedicated times for each activity noted daily on the Cruise Compass schedule and the Royal Caribbean app.

If you choose to give it a whirl be prepared: There are bleachers at the bottom of the ride where people often gather to watch participants wipe out. Because spills are common before you can try boogie boarding or surfing you must sign a waiver and receive a wristband.

How did my first two attempts go?

My first encounter with the FlowRider was in 2009 during my first assignment as a cruise editor (for Cruise Critic which owns the first two videos) on the first sailing of Oasis of the Seas then the largest and most innovative vessel in the world. Notably Oasis of the Seas was the first ship to boast two of the simulators.

As the youngest member of the team at the time I was volunteered to try my hand at surfing. I signed a waiver waited my turn and received a bit of instruction from one of the attendants who had to hold my hand for quite a while until I was brave enough to let go.

I stayed upright briefly but it didn't end well when I fell hit my head and swallowed half of the pool. I learned two things that day: You have only a 50% chance of keeping your bikini top on (so wear actual clothes) and freshly dyed red hair will ruin a cruise ship's brand-new white towels. (Sorry Royal Caribbean.)

My second try came seven years later when I sailed on Freedom of the Seas in 2016. I wanted to improve on my original performance so I decided to give it a shot and astounded myself by actually pulling it off.

With assistance from one of the attendants I was able to stay on the board for much longer than the first time around. My analysis is that I was in better physical shape for the second go and I also approached the task with a level of confidence I certainly wasn't able to muster for my third attempt.

How and why did I fail the third time?

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ashley Kosciolek (@slyjabroni)

On the first revenue sailing of Wonder of the Seas Royal Caribbean's newest and largest ship I wrote an article about cramming as many activities as possible into two days on board. One of the items on the list was the FlowRider.

The older I get the more I become aware of the fact that I'm not as fit or flexible as I once was and I think a lot more about injuries. In addition Royal Caribbean has changed some of its requirements for the attraction which means it's quite a bit more difficult to surf successfully.

As I mentioned I had to sign a waiver and procure a wristband from a desk near the FlowRider. As part of the line's new rules I also had to watch an instructional safety video and perform various stretches in front of an attendant to verify my mobility — steps that aim to cut down on injuries crew members told me.

From there I waited in what was a rather short line (which perhaps indicates why Wonder of the Seas has only one FlowRider instead of two). When it was my turn an attendant helped me hold my board in place. However attendants are no longer allowed to offer physical assistance to passengers by holding their hands or arms until they move into position and acclimate to the proper posture.

Instead passengers must put themselves on the board and push it away from the wall and into the jets on their own while maintaining their balance.

Because that's the most difficult part of the whole thing it's easy to fail right from the start as I did. I couldn't get the board far enough back from the wall to reach the spray without it sticking to the mat.

Two attempts later I was cut off denied a second wristband that would have allowed me to surf for the remainder of the voyage and told to try again the next day. I didn't fall but I was still dejected and I didn't have any desire to go back the day after.

What does this mean for cruisers?

Reasons various crew members gave me for the protocol change included passenger safety and COVID-19 social distancing. However it's a policy that's both silly and discouraging and it limits new surfers' ability to give the free FlowRider experience a fair shake.

Royal Caribbean does offer instruction and assistance for passengers who pay to rent out the FlowRider for private lessons (four to eight people and two instructors) at considerable cost. If you want to master this fun pastime as a beginner your only real option is to pay to play.

The world's BIGGEST EVER cruise ship has just completed its maiden voyage - and it was quite the journey. See for yourself here:

I've never thought about going on a cruise. Why would I?

Advert

But when presented with the opportunity to be on board the first ever sailing of the world's biggest cruise ship - which carries enough beer to fill all 19 pools twice over - it was a no-brainer.

If there was ever a place to start it was on this record-breaking luxury floating town.

One historic mega cruise please.

Had to do it.

Yes I lost my cruise virginity to Royal Caribbean's Wonder of the Seas which is a bit like losing your curry virginity to a vindaloo – or your actual virginity at a swingers' party.

Advert

The ship is 1188 feet long making it longer than the Eiffel Tower is tall or exactly the same length as 1188 Subway footlongs.

It set sail from Miami embarking on a week-long cruise through the Caribbean stopping in Haiti Puerto Rico and the Bahamas – one day in the spring-breaker-riddled capital of Nassau another on the island of CocoCay which is used exclusively by Royal Caribbean.

It's massive. Twice the size of my massive head in fact.

But before I continue I thought I might reel off the answers to some of the burning questions I had before losing my cruise V on Wonder of the Seas:

Advert

. Just how big is it then?

As previously mentioned it is the equivalent of 1188 Subway footlongs in length and is 210 feet wide (or 210 Subways footlongs to you and I). Its gross tonnage is 236857 (I'm not sure what that is in footlongs).

. How many people fit on it?

The ship can hold more than 9000 people – 6988 guests and 2300 crew. On this maiden cruise however there were only 4200 guests but the full complement of 2300 staff. As such on this cruise at least there wasn't any of the buffet and deck chair congestion I'd anticipated and the service was superb.

Royal Caribbean

. Can you feel the ship moving as you cruise?

Advert

Yes you can a bit more so near the front at the top in the Solarium which is a fantastic space in which you can sit in a jacuzzi with panoramic views of the sea. However Royal Caribbean informed me the rockiness was due to a warm front in the Bahamas and was 'really unusual' for this time of year.

. How much booze is on there and can you get draught pints?

There's enough beer in the storeroom to fill all 19 onboard pools twice over and yes in some bars you can get draught beers – though they don't serve them in pints.

. Are cruisers all...old?

Advert

No they are not. There is definitely an elderly contingent but there are also lots of families (though fewer children than I'd expected) as well as young couples and groups of friends.

. How much did it cost to build and how long did it take?

The ship cost more than £1billion ($1.31 billion) to build and the process began in France in 2016 lasting 30 months in total.

. So is it like really really big?

Yes. Yes it is.

I thought this might illustrate scale.

. Is it expensive?

Not necessarily as much as you would expect though there are ample opportunities to increase your bill. Prices start from around £750 ($985) a head (if two of you share a room) but this goes up depending on just how fancy a room you fancy.

An impressive range of food options is included within that cost but you have to pay extra for certain restaurants. Then of course there are the drinks you'll be wanting.

I had the deluxe drinks package which costs between $63 (£48) and $89 (£68) a day and entitles you to unlimited drinks. On top of that at each stop there are plenty of enticing activities and excursions – such as a water slide park zip-lining and swimming with pigs – which will set you back further.

. How many lettuces are on the ship?

I'm afraid I never got to the bottom of this but I'd estimate somewhere between 100 and 100000.

Royal Caribbean

Anyway like pretty much everything the cruise industry has been hit hard by Covid – particularly hard in fact given it is essentially a combination of the worst-affected industries: tourism entertainment and hospitality.

But literally within seconds of completing all of the onboarding vaccine passport-checking and negative test-showing it became apparent we'd be leaving all of that tedious misery behind as a raucous Caribbean band and glasses of prosecco greeted us as we crossed the threshold into our new massive floating home.

I assure you it honestly is massive. I'm just standing much nearer the camera creating the illusion I'm holding it in my hand.

Indeed it was hard not to feel at home as every single passing member of staff warmly welcomed us. They'd be like this all week it turned out. Always friendly always tidying up your cabin and turning your towels into towel animals. Always eager to serve you a tipple; two waiters said ‘Well you’re not driving’ which was definitely for the best.

Deluxe drinks package advised.

The 'cruiser community' was also extremely welcoming. Every lift ride between the 16 accessible decks (there are 18 in total) was riddled with fleeting meet-and-greets before the doors opened and we parted ways. On occasion these elevator soirées would escalate with the unexpected appearance of the 'stowaway pianist' who would rattle through an Elton classic as passengers elected to take a little detour up and down the ship as they sang along.

Among this cruise community there is an obvious diehard division. The ones who wear their complimentary 'Wonder of the Seas' caps without any sense of irony who decorate their cabin doors with stickers that say things like 'Life is good but it’s better on a cruise' the ones who tell you as they disembark that they wished they’d 'doubled-up' – meaning they wished they paid to stay on the ship another week and do the same cruise all over again (the ship has already embarked on its second sailing now and it will relentlessly continue this week-long cycle for months and months).

I was wearing the cap ironically I swear.

While doubling up may seem a tad extreme there simply isn't enough time to do everything in a week. The ship is designed to cater for whatever you desire: pools shops live music bars restaurants slides theatre productions rock climbing comedy surf simulators karaoke saunas parties peace. And that's just the tip of the iceberg – to use a rather unfortunate idiom.

In fact many of the aforementioned hardcore cruisers actually prefer to forgo the white sands of the Bahamas and the Piña Coladas of Puerto Rico in order to maximise their ship time.

Lots of people did this.

You see while most of us say we like travelling it usually isn't true. What we actually like is seeing different places – travelling is just the price we pay. But with a cruise or at least a cruise on Wonder of the Seas the chore that is travel has been made so luxurious and hassle-free that some people actually prefer the sail days. In this case it's about the journey rather than the destination.

So if you just want to switch off for a week and have everything handed to you on a plate (sometimes literally) a cruise is a great option. You don't have to worry about where you're going what you're doing or tidying your room it's all done for you.

Paradoxically though while this may sound like the pinnacle of relaxation it can actually be quite exhausting. Perhaps because of the sheer amount of things there is to do you can't help but feel fatigued by all the excitement combined with an ever-present sense of FOMO (fear of missing out for the laymen among you) when you look at the extremely handy app which informs you of all the things you're missing out on at any given moment.

There is always great food to be had.

The app also helps you navigate the ship which I anticipated would be an issue pre-cruise but everything is very well formatted and ergonomic so you soon get some sort of bearings.

Indeed the overwhelming impression is one of a highly complex procedure mastered through trial error and feedback.

Mark Tamis the senior vice-president of hotel operations at Royal Caribbean said the crew had undertaken 50000 hours of training ahead of the first sailing and you could tell.

You know when you host a house party and you realise afterwards you should have bought more tonic or provided a broader selection of chips and dips and then next time you do and the party is better? Well it's like that but on a massive scale with every detail covered.

A sign just as you're getting disorientated a fresh towel pile just where and when you need it speakers on the gangway as you're feeling slightly unstimulated for the first time in four days.

Room with a view.

One elderly couple I met opted to play dominos before riding the carousel which melted my heart a little bit. Conversely on the Monday I started my day at the apparent home of piña coladas in San Juan and ended it by doing the worm on the ship's nightclub dancefloor just before a YouTuber-cum-breakdancer decided to brutally upstage me.

The stops aren't bad either.

On the Tuesday I met a guy who I'd apparently met the night before who told me my worm-based humiliation was nothing to feel regretful about – he went on to splash $3000 (£2284) in the casino (which you can smoke in by the way).

In fact he told me there's no such thing as embarrassment on a cruise; a statement that was verified on International Women's Day which was celebrated with a 'World's Sexiest Man' competition on the top deck during which competitors we were warned not to touch the female judges while the judges were encouraged to touch the competitors as much as they pleased (though they didn't please much).

As I watched on with bemusement I came to the conclusion that the hottest male specimen on the planet was almost definitely not among the few thousand on the Wonder of the Seas.

If you are the sort of person who likes to keep in shape though you needn't worry – the ship caters to the fitness focused. It has a gym and classes neither of which I managed to attend because of that deluxe drinks package I mentioned.

I did make it to the running track on deck five however completing seven laps of the ship which is equivalent to just shy of 5km. Puerto Rico was the sun the ship was the Earth and I was the taco-filled Moon struggling to complete my orbit.

Quite.

As well as pondering galactic cruise jog analogies I also noticed it was the quietest part of the ship which was understandable given there was always copious amounts of delicious and enticing food and drink available elsewhere.

I only managed one run but I lapped the bars and buffets on countless occasions which says it all really.

Now I'm back on UK soil and my scales don't recognise me. I miss morning margaritas pocket croissants and pre-bed pizza. And I've got the post-cruise blues.

Didn't even know you could put on 9lbs in a week.

While a cruise may sound restrictive to some it is actually surprisingly liberating.

To relax on a normal holiday you need to research where you're going to go find your accommodation factor in timings worry about costs try not to get lost and figure out if you're going to get charged for using the loungers.

On Wonder of the Seas you can forget about all of that knowing the biggest ship in the world and its army of staff have got it all covered for you.

It's like spending a week in a shopping centre except instead of being horrific it's lovely. You're not in a rush you're not surrounded by frowns and phone shops you're not sweating under your puffer coat; you're strolling around with a mojito in hand surrounded by smiles and slides sun on your skin and sea breeze in your hair (if you have it).

Get on the surf simulator BEFORE you get on the cocktails.

Like Groundhog Day but you're reliving the best day over and over making small adjustments as you see fit. Like putting on sun cream in my case.

Wake up head to a breakfast buffet or have it delivered to your room look out at the sea for a bit choose a pool to bathe by grab your first margarita or piña colada of the day have a go on the surf simulator resolve to definitely go on the surf simulator before the cocktails tomorrow get off at whatever island you've arrived at snorkel or zipline continue getting value on that deluxe drinks package have a shower or go to the jacuzzi dress up however fancy you like for the evening pick a cuisine keep drinking watch a show or the wannabe performers at the karaoke contemplate getting an early one have another cocktail do the worm go to the casino.

Wake up and repeat. Maybe I should have doubled up after all.

But when ""roast master"" Jeff Ross said a joke about New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft Brady seemed quick to shut it down.

During Ross’s joke presentation he mentioned Brady being taken 199th overall in the NFL Draft and he said he walked into Kraft’s office to tell him something.

""’I’m the best decision your organization has ever made’"" Ross said.

But Ross wasn’t done.

""’Would you like a massage?’"" he said.

WARNING: VIDEO BELOW CONTAINS EXPLICIT LANGUAGE

The Los Angeles Forum was a mixture of laughs and groans as Ross poked fun at a serious charge that Kraft had faced in early 2019.

In February 2019 Kraft was charged in a multicounty investigation of massage parlors that included a secret video recording in the spas’ lobbies and rooms. Police said the recordings showed Kraft and other men engaging in sex acts with women and paying them.

Kraft would plead not guilty to the charge issued a public apology in March 2019 and would be cleared of a soliciting sex charge in 2020.

Brady turned toward Ross once the joke was said and as Ross looked over at Kraft in the crowd Brady came into frame and tried to whisper something to Ross. But it was caught by a microphone.

""Don’t say that s--- again"" he said quickly to Ross who acknowledged it with a laugh.

Brady likely knew there were going to be some things said that he might not like but he seemed to want the subject of the jokes to stay with him not his former owner.

One Saturday last month several dozen members of the Alaskan Independence Party a small largely unknown political group whose primary goal is to put Alaskan secession from the United States to a vote gathered in Fairbanks for their biennial convention.

Among the topics of conversation: whether to nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for president.

The party ultimately rejected Kennedy who is running as an independent after a few outspoken members said they did not want him atop their 2024 ticket according to John Howe the party's chairman who was involved in the discussions.

""There was serious consideration"" Howe a machine shop owner told ABC News.

The decision to pass on Kennedy was seen as a blow to the candidate -- ""They wanted us to put him on the ballot"" Howe said -- as Kennedy works to overcome the biggest obstacle to his plans to run as a major outside candidate in November: getting on the ballot across the country.

Typically independent candidates must undergo the painstaking expensive process of gathering thousands of signatures from registered voters in each state in order to qualify for ballot access.

But a candidate can bypass those requirements if a political party that already has ballot access in a given state nominates them to lead their ticket there.

Kennedy has successfully employed that strategy in Michigan and California where he will technically appear on the ballot as the nominee for the Natural Law Party of Michigan and the American Independent Party of California.

What's more his campaign has been in contact with minor parties in at least six other states too ABC News has learned through conversations with leaders in more than a dozen minor parties across the country. (The Kennedy campaign did not return requests for comment for this story or respond to the details that the party leaders provided.)

""As the campaign sees and recognizes that these are very convenient vessels out there it's a clever move and it's not a surprise they do it"" Derek Muller a University of Notre Dame professor specializing in election law told ABC News.

Early polling of the 2024 race suggests Kennedy could take a notable amount of support in a close race between Donald Trump and Joe Biden the two leading candidates -- if Kennedy makes it on the ballot. A new ABC News/Ipsos survey of adults found Kennedy with 12% in a hypothetical five-way election with Trump Biden and two other candidates Cornel West and Jill Stein.

Kennedy's campaign claims to have made it on the ballot in 10 states so far including the battlegrounds of Michigan Nevada and North Carolina. Elections offices in three states have confirmed to ABC News that Kennedy is on the ballot. In other states officials have said they can't yet confirm his candidacy.

Kennedy's strategy of linking with minor parties has encountered both challenges and success. In some cases like Alaska the parties have rejected him while in others they are actively speaking with his campaign about nominating him.

His campaign tried and failed to earn the nomination of the Unity Party of Colorado which chose instead to back West another independent candidate Tijani Cole the party's chairman told ABC News in an email.

The Alliance Party a national group with ballot access in South Carolina has been more receptive.

""National Alliance Party leadership has begun early conversations with the campaign for potential mutual support"" Phil Feuhrer the party's national co-vice chair told ABC News in an email.

Besides nominating Kennedy to lead the party’s ticket in South Carolina Feuhrer said the party is discussing helping the Kennedy campaign gather signatures across Minnesota to appear as an independent candidate there.

""If we reach full agreement with the campaign and our internal statewide leadership teams it would include placement onto the South Carolina ballot as well as the Minnesota Independence-Alliance taking lead on placing the campaign onto the Minnesota ballot"" Feuhrer added using the official name of Minnesota's branch of the party.

""Those conversations are young and still ongoing"" he said.

Kennedy's camp is also in talks with the Reform Party which has ballot access in Florida and Mississippi according to party leaders.

Jenniffer Desatoff the party's Florida chair told ABC News they are ""continuing communication with the Kennedy campaign at this time."" (Kennedy's campaign also contacted the Ecology Party of Florida but was informed the party does not have a ballot line in the presidential race the party's chair Cara Campbell told ABC News.)

Elsewhere the Kennedy campaign twice reached out to representatives of the Constitution Party which has ballot access in nearly a dozen states but the party and the campaign were never able to connect Donna Ivanovich a spokeswoman for the party told ABC News.

Meanwhile Kennedy has formed a party of its own We the People to secure ballot access in several states including in Delaware Hawaii and North Carolina. In those states the signature threshold to make the ballot is lower for candidates aligned with a party than for independent candidates.

Although other independent candidates ally with minor parties for ballot access -- like West is also doing in the 2024 race -- the breadth and ""coordination"" of Kennedy's effort stands out said Muller the Notre Dame election law expert.

""You usually don't see this kind of coordination and effort because the candidacies are usually not serious enough to make the outreach to all these parties in all these different states"" he told ABC News.

But by aligning himself with small often niche parties Kennedy risks absorbing the burden of their sometimes checkered history some observers warned.

The American Independent Party of California which nominated Kennedy last month had backed George Wallace the former Alabama governor and notorious segregationist in the 1960s.

In a video announcing his nomination Kennedy acknowledged the party's past support for Wallace but said it ""has had its own rebirth even before I came along.""

""It's been reborn as a party that represents not bigotry and hatred but rather compassion unity idealism and common sense"" he said.

Another problem with wooing minor parties is that Kennedy's beliefs sometimes don't align with theirs.

The members of the Alaskan Independence Party who rejected Kennedy as the party's nominee were wary he would agree with them on their view that government-owned land should be given back to Alaskans Howe the party chairman told ABC News.

But Kennedy's chances at winning the nomination may have sunk days before the convention when he failed to win over the previous chair of the Alaskan Independence Party Bob Bird in a radio interview with Bird.

""The AIP will not be placing RFK on the ballot"" Bird wrote in a column after the interview casting Kennedy as an outsider.

""Our liberty and prosperity must come from within ourselves"" Bird wrote ""not from a knight galloping in from the Lower 48.""

“I made a boo-boo” Jeffrey S. McConney admitted when describing the erroneous math he scribbled on “TRUMP” corporate letterhead.

The former Trump Organization controller testified about the notes he took during a January 2017 meeting that laid out how the family real estate company was going to surreptitiously reimburse attorney Michael Cohen for fronting the $130000 that silenced the porn star Stormy Daniels. That payment kept her from going public about her decade-old one-night stand with Trump in the days before the 2016 presidential election.

The farce was laid out in black and white with handwritten notes explaining the fuzzy math at play.

Cohen would be paid $180000 which was doubled on paper so that it would make up for the roughly 50 percent taxes the Midtown Manhattan resident would have to pay in federal state and city taxes. McConney wrote “180000 x 2 for taxes” in black pen on the bright white paper. On the witness stand he admitted the company was fine having it “grossed up” to ensure Cohen got his proper share.

The sham continued when tallying up Cohen’s bonus. Initially $50000 was marked as “paid to Red Finch for tech services” but that seemed to morph instead to mean $60000 for Cohen himself.

“Michael was complaining that his bonus wasn’t large enough. This was to make up for whatever he thought he was owed” McConney testified.

The total $420000 was then divided by 12 so that Cohen would get $35000 each month for a year. McConney’s notes of that meeting included a mention that stated “Mike to invoice us” the genesis of what prosecutors say would later be Cohen invoices for fake legal work that Trump gladly paid to keep the hush money deal under wraps.

Monday’s testimony also connected Trump directly to the process a major step forward in the case. Prosecutors showed jurors a copy of a March 28 2017 email in which McConney wrote “I’ll check status tomorrow. DJT needs to sign check.”

On the stand McConney explained that authorizing the money transfers would require having someone actually go to the White House have the then-president of the United States approve the payment himself—while he was president.

But in an instance that exemplifies the lack of intellectual rigor involved in this operation at least one of those checks disappeared on its way back north from Washington to New York City.

After three monthly payments to Cohen in January February and March McConney asked an employee in the Trump Organization accounting department Deborah Tarasoff to cancel a check cut in April that didn’t return.

“It looks like we never got a check back from the White House. It got lost somebody couldn’t find it. I guess it’s the same as lost” he testified.

Paperwork showed that after $105000 was paid by The Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust the bean counters back in Manhattan realized it would be easier to run the next $315000 in payments through Trump’s personal accounts for the rest of the year.

Matt Colangelo a prosecutor with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office meticulously went through each of Cohen’s 12 invoices. Every month in 2017 Cohen would email Allen Weisselberg a disgraced accountant who was then the Trump Organization’s chief financial officer but has since been convicted of tax fraud and spent three months at New York’s dreaded Rikers Island jail. Cohen would deliver a curt greeting—mentioning some summer fun a hurricane hitting Weisselberg’s Florida home Thanksgiving the winter holidays—then get right down to business.

“Pursuant to the retainer agreement kindly remit payment for services rendered” Cohen would email Weisselberg each time proudly signing his emails: “Michael D. Cohen Esq. Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump.”

One by one Colangelo went over every monthly email attached invoice forwarded Weisselberg email and McConney’s copy over to Tarasoff. By the time they got to September McConney was starting to wear down.

“$35000” he said sounding increasingly tired of answering why he knew how much to pay despite there not being any dollar figure on the invoice for supposed legal work. The answer was always the same: that first meeting in January 2017.

“It’s an invoice from Michael Cohen” he groaned when discussing the October paperwork.

When Colangelo asked him to read the email McConney let out a mild whine. “The whole thing?” he asked.

“Why don’t we just do the body this time” Colangelo acquiesced.

The internal Trump corporate emails showed how invoices made their way from Cohen to Weisselberg to McConney to Tarasoff. And the chain would generally end the same way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9zZi9hcnRpY2xlL3MtZi12YWxlbmNpYS1zdHJlZXQtYmljeWNsZS1sYW5lLTE5NDQyMjcyLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,S.F.'s Valencia Street merchants endorse replacing center bikeway with protected side-running lanes,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/s-f-valencia-street-bicycle-lane-19442272.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9zZi9hcnRpY2xlL3MtZi12YWxlbmNpYS1zdHJlZXQtYmljeWNsZS1sYW5lLTE5NDQyMjcyLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDYvYXJ0cy9kZXNpZ24vaGFtbWVyLW11c2V1bS1hbm4tcGhpbGJpbi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Who's Who of L.A.'s Art World Bids Farewell to a Champion,"The actor Owen Wilson chatted with the artist Ed Ruscha.

Richard Carson/Reuters

Oilfield services companies Halliburton and Schlumberger are suspending operations in Russia.

The two companies announced the decision on Friday saying it would take immediate effect.

Several other energy companies previously announced plans to exit their operations in Russia.

Two of the world's largest oilfield service companies have suspended their operations in Russia in response to US sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine.

Reuters and other outlets first reported the story.

Schlumberger and Halliburton respectively announced their decision in news releases on Friday saying it would take immediate effect.

According to Oil Industry Insight Schlumberger is the world's largest oilfield company service and Halliburton ranks third after Baker Hughes.

Olivier Le Peuch the chief executive officer for Schlumberger said in the news release it was suspending new investment and technology deployment to the company's operations in Russia. The company plans to fulfil any existing activity in full compliance with international laws and sanctions.

""Safety and security are at the core of who we are as a company and we urge a cessation of the conflict and a restoration of safety and security in the region"" Le Peuch added.

In its news release Halliburton said while the company had halted all shipments of specific sanctioned parts and products to Russia several weeks ago it has immediately suspended future business in compliance with sanctions that prohibit transactions and work.

Its chairman president and CEO Jeff Miller said: ""The war in Ukraine deeply saddens us.""

He added: ""We have employees in both Ukraine and Russia and the conflict greatly impacts our people their families and loved ones throughout the region. Since the start of this conflict we prioritized employee safety and compliance with all relevant sanctions.""

Baker Hughes did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment made outside of normal working hours.

Major companies such as ExxonMobil BP and Shell have pulled out of Russia while McDonald's which said it would close all stores have been unable to do so.

Halliburton announced Friday that it suspended future business in the country as the company complies with sanctions that prohibit transactions and work including for certain state-owned Russian customers. Halliburton said it will prioritize safety and reliability as it winds down its remaining operations in Russia.

Haliburton said it halted all shipments of specific sanctioned parts and products to Russia several weeks ago. Halliburton said it has no active joint ventures there.

Schlumberger said Friday that it immediately suspended investment and technology deployment to its Russia operations. It said it will continue to actively monitor this “dynamic” situation.

“Safety and security are at the core of who we are as a company and we urge a cessation of the conflict and a restoration of safety and security in the region” Schlumberger CEO Olivier Le Peuch said in a statement.

As the war continues and the deadly violence and humanitarian crisis worsens companies that remain are under increasing pressure to leave.

More than 400 U.S. and other multinational firms have pulled out of Russia either permanently or temporarily according to Jeffrey Sonnenfeld senior associate dean for Executive Programs at Yale University’s School of Management who has publicized a list of corporate actions in Russia.

Oil companies ExxonMobil Shell and BP along with some major tech companies like Dell and Facebook were among the first to announce their withdrawal or suspension of operations. Many others including McDonald’s Starbucks and Estee Lauder followed. Roughly 30 companies remain.

Even for PCs specifically laptops you have only so many USB ports to connect to and use other accessories. That’s where Seagate’s Firecuda Gaming Dock comes in to play and it has been a huge help in a world of creators that are ever growing. How worth it is this beast? Here’s our Seagate Firecuda Gaming Dock review:

Seagate Firecuda 4TB Gaming Dock

Manufacturer: Seagate

MSRP: $369.99 USD

From initial unboxing for the Seagate Firecuda Gaming Dock it’s much larger than one might expect. It’s about the size of the Xbox Series S console which makes this hefty and larger than you might want to lug around. Inside however there are many pieces of technology that are helpful as well as a 4TB hard disk drive for less used files or games you may not care to use on an SSD.

You can connect many different devices to this and the only real requirement is using the Thunderbolt 3 port that connect everything but also transfers files amazingly fast. There are a total of five USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports one ethernet port for direct connection internet two Thunderbolt 3 ports (one for host like your laptop and one for peripherals) and audio in and out on the front.

The biggest feature that works for laptops that makes this great for gaming is the DisplayPort 1.4 port to connect to a monitor. With that alone I was able to use three monitors on my laptop (the other was from the built-in HDMI port on the laptop).

Another great positive to gamers is that it does work with RGB via Razer Chroma using the Synapse program. Customizing the colors to breathe or stay static adds another layer to make it yours even if limited to what you set it to.

One huge feature that’s on board is the ability to add more storage via the detachable section where RGB is that is held together by magnets. You can add your own m.2 NVMe SSD for more storage and for faster speeds like if you want to store games that you may want to run and take with you to another PC.

Obviously there are some drawbacks to this otherwise extremely helpful device. For one it’s a bit pricey – if you look at it from the view of just storage alone.

You could easily get 4 terabytes of storage for exponentially cheaper but it won’t have the same features as the Seagate Firecuda Gaming Dock. It’s very a niche product for those that are in need of higher levels of versatility and productivity.

This dock does require its own power supply which means you will need an open outlet on your wall. Additionally this will not charge your laptop; there is a way to charge smaller devices because it does give at most 15W of power of but it’s recommended to power your laptop on it’s own.

It detracts from the ability to move this already huge console-like device and isn’t particularly meant for traveling with but as a stationary device to be a hub.

You might be wondering “Who is this for?” It’s focused on what I mentioned before gamers and content creators. Imagine going to a convention and you take a lot of videos and need a place to store everything that you might need to share or save because there’s no room anywhere else.

Its storage is great for gamers that want to keep games saved without downloading them over and over again especially when you’re not connected to the internet. This is perfect for those conditions. For the price you would be paying you could get more storage but you’d be lacking in connectivity for devices and other USB things you own.

I find myself using it more than I think and also using it with my laptop and hopefully soon my pre-ordered Steam Deck. You can pick this up from Seagate directly (and probably cheaper) here and look over some more finer details.

We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

The PlayStation 5 (PS5) is one of the best game consoles available right now. Capable of playing the latest games at stunning resolutions and frame rates the PS5 shows users what next-gen gaming has to offer.

Unfortunately it also shows how much storage space next-gen games need with popular titles like Red Dead Redemption II and NBA 2K21 taking up at least 100GB of storage space. While the PS5’s 667GB of usable internal storage may sound like a lot a handful of these big new titles can easily take up all of its storage space.

Luckily there are a few options to expand your PS5 storage space. One of the simplest methods is with a great external hard drive.

What to Consider

When picking the best external storage drive for your PS5 it’s best to keep a few things in mind.

First the PS5 cannot play PS5 games that are stored on an external storage drive. While external drives work great for storage any PS5 game you want to actively play needs to be stored on the internal storage drive. The PS5 can however play PS4 games stored on an external drive.

Second there are a ton of different kinds of external storage drives to choose from but we highly recommend using a solid state drive (SSD). Especially if you plan on playing PS4 games stored on your external drive a fast SSD will offer a much better playing experience than older cheaper hard disk drives (HDD).

Snowflake partners including systems integrators ISVs technology partners and third-party data providers are expected to leverage the capabilities of the new Snowflake Healthcare & Life Sciences Data Cloud.

Snowflake has unveiled a new data cloud service targeting the healthcare and life sciences space making good on the company’s stated strategy to increase its focus on specific vertical industries to maintain its rapid growth.

The new Healthcare & Life Sciences Data Cloud unveiled this week will provide healthcare and life sciences solutions for partners and enable them to develop their own solutions – both leveraging the interoperability and data sharing capabilities of the Snowflake platform.

The Snowflake announcement is indicative of efforts by leading IT vendors including Databricks and ServiceNow to build on their core systems with applications and services for vertical markets – creating opportunities for channel partners along the way.

The new Healthcare & Life Sciences Data Cloud centralizes integrates and exchanges high volumes of cross-cloud data at scale while ensuring high levels of data security and governance said Todd Crosslin healthcare and life sciences industry principal at Snowflake in an interview with CRN.

The new service is expected to attract healthcare providers seeking ways to leverage healthcare data including unstructured data such as clinical documents DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) files and radiology images to improve healthcare delivery and patient outcomes and enhance clinical and operational decision making.

Life sciences companies including pharmaceutical companies can use the service to integrate and analyze healthcare and clinical trial data for drug development purposes.

“There’s just tons and tons of unstructured data in our ecosystem” Crosslin said pointing to the healthcare and life science companies and organizations that Snowflake already works with including Anthem IQVIA Komodo Health Novartis Siemens Healthineers and Spectrum Health.

Snowflake sees vertical industries including healthcare and life sciences as key to helping the data cloud company maintain its rapid rate of growth. During a second quarter earnings call in August 2021 CEO Frank Slootman said Snowflake was putting increased emphasis on developing data services for clients in vertical industries such as financial services retail and consumer packaged goods manufacturing public sector education and advertising/media/entertainment.

Snowflake isn’t alone in targeting the healthcare space. Data lakehouse platform developer Databricks launched its Databricks Lakehouse for Healthcare and Life Sciences on March 9 targeting data management analytics and advanced AI use cases for disease prediction medical image classification biomarker discovery and other tasks according to the company.

That announcement was the latest of Databricks’ own growing portfolio of vertical industry-focused services following the debut of Databricks Lakehouse for Retail in January and Databricks Lakehouse for Financial Services in February.

Beyond the data management arena ServiceNow unveiled a strategy in 2020 to develop workflow solutions on its core Now Platform for specific industries including telecommunications banking and manufacturing.

In addition to tapping into the data sharing and collaboration capabilities of the Snowflake platform the Healthcare & Life Science Data Cloud leverages the Snowpark developer framework that developers data engineers and data scientists use to create data applications and manage pipeline and machine learning workflows.

“This is applying the workload capabilities of Snowflake to healthcare and life sciences” Crosslin said. “For our partners it’s really taking advantage of Snowpark and building solutions that are native to Snowflake. It’s a huge deal for our partners.”

The new service supports industry data governance and security requirements and standards including HIPAA and HITRUST and GxP compatibility audits. It supports the OHDSI OMOP data model and ecosystem according to Snowflake and can process and run HL7/FHIR messages.

Solutions and services developed and delivered by partners are a critical element of the Healthcare & Life Science Data Cloud Crosslin said. That includes systems integrators and consulting service partners such as Cognizant Deloitte Infosys and NTT Data who are already building solutions for their clients on the new platform.

Also benefiting from the new offering are ISVs and application developers in the vendor’s Powered by Snowflake program including Health Catalyst Strata and IQVIA who are building software – including analytics-as-a-service applications – that run on the Healthcare & Life Science Data Cloud.

The Healthcare & Life Science Data Cloud also enables third-party healthcare and life sciences data providers in the Snowflake Data Marketplace including Compile Equifax Invitae and SameSky Health who can market data without the need for data copying and data movement. And Snowflake’s technology partners including machine learning technology providers Dataiku and H2o.ai and data analytics tool supplier ThoughtSpot also work with data provided through the new cloud service.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Maybe a diner,"Michael Hernandez a father of three was one of the many township residents who responded with ideas. He was validated when he saw that his hopes for the area coincided with many of his neighbors’.

“These are the things that people are commonly wanting across the community” said Hernandez. “It’s diners. It’s not big chains it’s local healthy it’s something different. A lot of those things are services that we would have to go out of our township or community to go find. There would be a lot of pride and I think that there would be a lot of success if it was somehow offered right within our township as well.”

Linda Charles who has lived in Flourtown for 20 years posted on NextDoor to express her concerns about a seventh bank coming to town. In response she received an outpouring of confusion surprise and similar complaints from other residents.

Charles would like to see more spaces for neighbors to connect with one another.

“There would be so much more community interaction if we did have something that brought people together more where people could meet each other or their kids can meet each other” said Charles.

That feeling resonates with Stephanie Flood a mother of two who has lived in Flourtown for over 16 years. “… not another bank” Flood said in a Facebook comment. “There are too many to count.”

Her 14-year-old daughter will sometimes meet her friends at Flourtown’s Starbucks. But usually Flood will drive her to a friend’s house so they can hang out in a park.

“She doesn’t have friends come over here because there’s nothing for them to do here” said Flood.

Richard Metz a retired high school art teacher also pointed to the lack of parks in Flourtown.

When asked about what he would prefer in the former Sherwin Williams space the Chase Bank branch is taking over he said “Nothing.”

“I’d rather something beautiful like trees and bushes and benches” said Metz. “More and more of these open spaces are disappearing and that’s what I miss.”

Metz and a group of community members are in a battle to save a wooded area along Haws Lane in Flourtown from development. That process and the township’s approval of Flourtown’s seventh bank has left him with questions.

“The more that I get involved with Springfield Township politics the more I realize how little I know how decisions are made” said Metz.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiI2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhdnkuY29tL25ld3MvbmFvbWktaXJpb24v0gEnaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWF2eS5jb20vbmV3cy9uYW9taS1pcmlvbi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Naomi Irion Missing: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know,"Naomi Irion is a missing 18-year-old Nevada woman who police fear was kidnapped from a parking lot in Fernley. She was possibly taken on Saturday March 12 2022. Police believe she was taken in her own car. The vehicle was found abandoned in a parking lot on Tuesday but Irion has not been located.

The Lyon County Sheriff’s Office released surveillance photos showing Irion and a potential suspect on March 16. Irion was last seen in the parking lot of a Walmart on Newlands Drive in Fernely according to the sheriff’s office. She works for Panasonic in Reno and was waiting for a shuttle to take her to work her family said.

The sheriff’s office said in an update on Wednesday March 16 that the suspect could be driving a dark 2020 or newer Chevrolet 2500 High Country 4-Door pickup truck. “The forensic evidence discovered to date continues to lead Lyon County investigators to believe Naomi’s disappearance is suspicious in nature and that the driver of the above vehicle has a direct connection to her disappearance and whereabouts” the sheriff’s office said.

Authorities said Irion is 5’11” and has dyed black hair and green eyes. She also has a septum piercing in her nose. She was last seen wearing a blue Panasonic T-shirt a gray cardigan sweater gray pants and brown boots. She was carrying a black purse. The possible suspect was wearing a gray hoodie and blue jeans or pants.

Irion’s brother Casey Valley wrote in a Facebook group set up to help in the search “I just want everyone to know that I’m doing everything I can.

During an interview with the “All American Dream Chaser” on YouTube Naomi Irion’s mother Diane Irion said “She’s such an amazing person. She’s very strong she’s very intelligent. She’s kind and compassionate. She is generous and giving. She’s one of the most amazing young women. She’s lived all over the world.”

Her mother said that there was evidence of “suspicious activity or violence inside the car.” She said her daughter followed a routine and someone could have been planning to attack her because they knew when she would be in the parking lot.

Diane Irion said tearfully during the YouTube interview “Hopefully law enforcement can find something anything that will distinguish this person this monster from other people. What kind of person does that? Takes an 18-year-old girl. Someone’s daughter sister from their family hurts them. What kind of monster does that? It’s evil. It’s wrong.”

3. Naomi Irion a Houston-Area Native Whose Father Works for the U.S. State Department Recently Moved to Nevada From South Africa to Live With Her Brother for a Gap Year Her Mother Says

Naomi Irion recently graduated from the American International School Johannesburg in South Africa where her parents live her mother told the All American Dream Chaser. She said they were living in South Africa because Naomi’s father works for the U.S. Department of State in the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria. Naomi Iron was born and raised in the Houston area before starting her journey around the world with her family when she was about 13 her family said. Diane Irion said her daughter decided to take a gap year before starting university and moved to Nevada to live with her 32-year-old brother in Fernley.

Naomi Irion moved to Fernley in August 2022 to spend some time “figuring out her life” her mother said during the YouTube interview. She was working at Panasonic and was recently promoted and “tapped for leadership positions.” Her mother said their family has also lived in Russia France Ukraine and Germany.

Her mother says Naomi has three young adopted brothers who are from Irpin Ukraine near Kyiv. Naomi’s father Herve Irion was traveling to the U.S. to help in the search while her mother was staying in South Africa. “I’m here with them now” she said of Naomi’s siblings. “Trying to shield them.”

Diane Irion said during the YouTube interview that her daughter had only recently learned to drive because when she was living overseas she wasn’t able to get a license because she wasn’t a citizen. “She was so excited to get her license and have a car and do all the things that all the American kids get to do she’s never gotten to do” her mother said.

4. Irion’s Mother Says Her Daughter ‘Freezes Up When She’s Scared … That’s Probably What Happened’

Diane Irion told All American Dream Chaser that her daughter’s normal routine was to take her car to the Walmart parking lot and then she would take a shuttle to work at Panasonic in Reno. Her mother said her daughter’s apparent abduction was then caught on video.

“She was sitting in the driver’s seat of the car getting ready to get out she probably had her door partially opened or unlocked she was getting ready to get out of the car and go to the bus” her mother said during the interview. “And an unknown male opened the driver’s door said or did something to make her slide over to the passenger seat and then he got into the driver’s seat and took off with her.”

She added that police initially didn’t think it was an abduction “because she just slid over in the seat and didn’t resist. But I spoke to several of her friends who had been chatting with her on Snapchat minutes before this happened and they said she had no plans to meet anyone. She was just going to work. My daughter is not very good in a crisis or an emergency. What she tends to do is freeze up and just comply. She’s not a fighter. She’s a lovey sweet person and she doesn’t fight. She freezes up when she’s scared. That’s probably what happened. … That’s the last time anyone saw or heard from her.”

5. Irion’s Family Has Started a GoFundMe to Help With Costs Related to the Search

Irion’s family has started a GoFundMe campaign to help with the costs related to the search and to help her parents and siblings travel to Nevada. “Our family will be using the money from this fundraiser to assist with the airplane flights of family members (I live in Texas and our parents live in South Africa) and any other costs associated with the search for Naomi” her sister Tamara Cartwright wrote on the fundraiser. “Thank you so much for any help you can provide even if it is just sharing the link to this fundraiser. Every dollar and minute of your time counts towards finding our daughter sister and friend.”

Irion’s mother asked that her daughter’s friends or anyone she has been talking to on social media who may know who else she has been recently communicating with or who could possibly want to harm or take her to contact the sheriff’s office. She said any information even if it may seem little or insignificant could be important.

The Lyon County Sheriff’s Office said in a press release “The Lyon County Sheriff’s Office is seeking any information regarding the disappearance and whereabouts of Naomi Irion the Chevrolet pickup vehicle and/or information concerning possible contacts that persons may have had with Naomi. If you have information regarding this investigation please contact Detective Erik Kusmerz regarding case number 22LY01068 at 775-577-5206 ext 2 or email detective@lyon-county.org or Secret Witness of Northern Nevada at 775-322-4900.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9zYW50YW1hcmlhdGltZXMvbmFtZS93YWx0ZXItZmFzb2xkLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMzNzA1MDA50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walter Fasold Obituary (1951 - 2022) - Lompoc CA - Santa Maria Times,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/santamariatimes/name/walter-fasold-obituary?id=33705009 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9zYW50YW1hcmlhdGltZXMvbmFtZS93YWx0ZXItZmFzb2xkLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMzNzA1MDA50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

Back to 2021 the country's public broadcaster was forced to withdraw as a result of the conflict with Azerbaijan that caused delays and shortness of time to prepare for the contest.

Regardless the country is determined to make a comeback this year and clearly hoping it will be as successful as their return to the Junior Eurovision Song Contest where Maléna won scoring Armenia's second victory in the contest.

Last week AMPTV announced that Rosa Linn was the selected artist for Turin and now has released her song ""Snap"".

Armenia 2022: Rosa Linn – ""Snap""

""Snap"" is written by Rosa Linn Larzz Principato Jeremy Dusoulet Allie Crystal Tamar Kaprelian & Courtney Harrell.

Rosa Linn

Rosa Kostandyan is a 21 years-old singer-songwriter and producer. She was born and raised in Vanadzor Armenia.

Rosa is part of the US-based record label Nvak Collective and her style is characterized as a mix of 80s and 90s alternative indie pop. Her latest single is “KING” which is a collaboration with electro-pop singer KIIARA.

Rosa says:

– From the outside looking in the odds seemed like they were against me: An unknown girl from a small town in Armenia. But the power of manifestation is real when it is combined with hard work persistence and just putting oneself out there.

– I’m excited to let people into my inner-world through my music. And I’m beyond honoured to be able to represent my beloved country on the biggest stage in Europe.

Sam Heughan has shared a new Jamie Fraser snap on his Instagram page and fans could not get enough.

As season six of Outlander is well under way fans of the show are loving seeing content from when the new series was filmed last year and since Sam's character Jamie is in a full kilt it really sent them wild.

Sharing the snap with his 3.5million followers Sam wrote: "" Kilt-fishing. How else would you spend your weekend!? Oh and watching @outlander_starz!! (And the @f1 @sixnationsrugby @ufc and Thor V Hall!).

Sam posed with what appears to be fishing rod and his full Highlander get-up.

And his followers quickly flocked to the comments.

One wrote: ""All hail The Kilt!!""

Another added: ""Jammf in kilt is a aye for me over and over again.""

While one said: ""I’d love to spend my weekend with Jamie Fraser.""

And another wrote: ""Ai ai! Jamie Fraser! My Scottish love!!!""

Earlier this week on social media Sam Heughan and Caitriona Balfe revealed who their top pick for a celebrity cameo in Outlander would be.

Sam 41 and Caitriona 42 play married couple Jamie and Claire Fraser in the on-screen adaptation of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series and said who else they'd like to join them in a Q&A with fans.

The Dumfries -born actor admitted his first choice would be pop music superstar Dua Lipa while Caitriona announced she'd like to do some scenes with Susan Sarandon.

She said: ""Well Susan Sarandon has said she's a big fan. I'd vote for her to come on.""

""That would be amazing"" Sam agreed.

""Playing whatever she wants"" the Irish actress joked.

Sam responded: ""It would be good to have a singer wouldn't it?""

Catriona referring to Sam's recent project Text 4 U with Celine Dion then asked: ""Would you call up Celine and ask?""

""I could do. I wouldn't mind calling up Dua Lipa but I suppose that's not allowed"" Sam quipped.

Caitriona also revealed her top pick for an actress to play old Claire would be Mamma Mia actress Julie Walters and Sam agreed adding: ""Oh she would be good"".

And The Truman Show's Ed Harris would be her choice for an older Jamie.

MOLLY Mae Hague inadvertently may have exposed boyfriend Tommy Fury's cheeky sleeping habits in her latest Instagram post.

The Filter tan brand founder 22 who recently returned from her company's latest campaign shoot in Tulum has reunited with the boxer also 22 after four weeks apart.

After a weekend spent catching up Molly documented a relaxed Sunday which saw Tommy and their two cats snoozing on the sofa.

She captured her man sprawled back wearing a pale hoodie and grey trousers and cuddled around a cushion.

He looked completely at peace as he slept with the sunshine streaming through the window with Molly commenting in the caption: ""It's a snoozy Sunday apparently.""

Yet some fans spotted how Tommy was in dream land with one hand down his trousers.

The camera angle could have been deceptive and his hand in fact in his pocket instead.

'SOULMATE REUNION'

The funny snap came as through the weekend the influencer shared snaps of her and her fella holding hands in the car as Tommy drove.

She captioned one image: ""Reunited after nearly 4 weeks. We've become masters at this long time apart thing now.""

She then shared a video of the two of them in the car quietly enjoying each other's company and wrote ""soulmates"" on the footage.

Finally the pair cosied up for a romantic selfie both grinning from ear to ear.

Molly looked so happy she closed her eyes in contentment and rested her hand on her face.

The pair have been separated for four weeks as Tommy has been away training in Dubai for his boxing while Molly-Mae has been on a work trip to Mexico.

Tommy was away from his girlfriend's side when she was 'struck down' with an 'intense' sickness bug while overseas.

Columnist

Ronda Rich is the best-selling author of ""What Southern Women Know (That Every Woman Should)."" Visit www.rondarich.com to sign up for her free weekly newsletter.

A decade ago I launched a new book with a tour that with three exceptions took me to large Southern cities and three small Mississippi towns.

The exhaustive two-week tour included Los Angeles New York City and the marvelous independent Rainy Day Books in Kansas City.

After an early morning show in New York I stopped to have breakfast at a Jewish-owned delicatessen one of my favorite places. Eyeing the menu I was jolted by an item.

“Grits!” I exclaimed to the waiter. “You have grits?”

He nodded. “People like grits.”

“I’ll have a bowl. I want to know how New York City grits taste.”

“We’re sold out. Every morning he makes a big pot of grits and they go fast.”

It took four more trips before I had a bowl of New York City grits. They were watery and half-cooked. An imitation.

More from Ronda Rich:A break from the city a breath of fresh air at home

For truly perfect grits visit The Lodge or The Cloister on Sea Island. They make their grits with real cream and they’re purely scrumptious. They’re also in Georgia. The location where Southern food is being served makes a difference.

In Nashville I stayed in a nice hotel near Vanderbilt. I returned to my room after doing early morning radio and television and ordered room service. Since the grits episode in New York I decided to order Southern delicacies at every stop and judge.

I ordered “Southern Buttermilk” biscuits with sausage gravy. It may have been the worst Southern food I ever tasted. The gravy was pasty and tasted close to the Elmer’s Glue that I tried when I was seven. The biscuits were dry dusty and barely chewable.

Down to the restaurant manager I called. “Sir these are the worst biscuits and gravy I’ve ever had.”

He sighed. “I know.”

“Please tell me that there isn’t a Southern woman in your kitchen who makes buttermilk biscuits like this. It has to be a man or a Yankee.”

He inhaled deeply. “It’s a young man. From Argentina. He’s trying his best to go by a recipe.”

“Argentina?” I exclaimed. “You have one of the top hotels in one of the South’s best cities and you’re letting someone from Argentina make your biscuits and gravy? Let me talk to him.”

More from Ronda Rich:Being like Brenda Gantt is a Southern country woman's dream come true

The young man came to the phone and as best I could I gave him advice.

“You’re usin’ too much flour in both the gravy and the biscuits.” I told him how to cut in the shortening and to work the dough quickly. He responded gratefully. He had been under fire.

The manager came back to the phone and expressed his appreciation. “We’ve had so many complaints that we were going to take them off the menu.”

“What flour do you use?”

“Something generic.”

“White Lily” I said firmly. “And it’s brand born in Tennessee.”

In Birmingham I found impressive biscuits and gravy at a family-owned diner in Homewood which sadly has closed. In Clarksdale Mississippi at the blues club Ground Zero co-founded by actor Morgan Freeman I discovered the yummiest “sammich’ made with Southern favorites: pimento cheese bacon and fried green tomatoes.

A delicious version of this sandwich used to be on the menu at EP’s Bar and Grill at The Guest House at Graceland (be careful not to drop “The” or “Graceland"" or you will get a note of chastisement from Graceland’s unpleasant public relations company).

Several weeks ago I was in Memphis and craving that sandwich. I made a special trip to EP’s only to be told “We have a shortened menu now. I don’t know why that was taken off because a lot of people ask for it.”

I think Elvis Presley would be unhappy about that. He believed in giving the people what they wanted - not what he thought they should have wanted.

As for the biscuits and gravy in Nashville I learned this: Imitation is not always the highest form of flattery.

Sometimes it’s just imitation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzMvMjAvaG91dGhpcy1sYXVuY2gtYXR0YWNrcy1vbi1zYXVkaS1lbmVyZ3ktZGVzYWxpbmF0aW9uLWZhY2lsaXRpZXPSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMy8yMC9ob3V0aGlzLWxhdW5jaC1hdHRhY2tzLW9uLXNhdWRpLWVuZXJneS1kZXNhbGluYXRpb24tZmFjaWxpdGllcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Houthis launch multiple strikes on Saudi sites,"The Saudi-led coalition says the barrage of drone and missile attacks by the Yemeni rebel group did not cause any casualties.

Yemen’s Houthi rebels have unleashed a barrage of drone and missile attacks on Saudi Arabia targeting a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant water desalination plant oil facility and power station Saudi state-run media reported.

The attacks early on Sunday did not cause casualties the Saudi-led military coalition fighting in Yemen said but damaged civilian vehicles and homes in the area.

Later on Sunday the military coalition said an aerial attack struck an oil facility in the Saudi port city of Jeddah sparking a fire.

The coalition said that firefighters were dealing with a “limited” fire that erupted in one of the tanks at a petroleum distribution centre. It said the fire at the Saudi Arabian Oil Co. facility caused no casualties.

The salvo marked the latest escalation in Houthi cross-border attacks on Saudi Arabia as peace talks remain stalled. The conflict has caused a humanitarian crisis in Yemen.

Yehia Sarie a spokesman for Iran-backed Houthi rebels said the group had launched “a wide and large military operation into the depth of Saudi Arabia” without immediately elaborating.

Attack on LNG plant thwarted

The military coalition said it thwarted an attack on an LNG plant at a petrochemicals complex in the Red Sea port city of Yanbu run by the Saudi Arabian Oil Co better known as Aramco. It was not immediately clear if the attack had inflicted any damage on the plant.

Other aerial attacks targeted a power station in the country’s southwest a desalination facility in Al-Shaqeeq on the Red Sea coast an Aramco terminal in the southern border town of Jizan and a gas station in the southern city of Khamis Mushait the coalition said.

The extent of the damage was unclear. The official Saudi Press Agency posted various photos of firetrucks dousing leaping flames with water hoses as well as wrecked cars and craters in the ground allegedly left by the series of drone and ballistic missile attacks.

The Saudi-owned al-Hadath TV channel quoted the Saudi-led coalition later on Sunday as saying it destroyed a boat laden with explosives that belongs to the Iran-aligned group.

The destruction of the boat off the Yemeni coastal city of Hodeidah thwarted an imminent attack on shipping in the Red Sea the TV channel said.

There was no immediate confirmation from the Houthis who control most of northern Yemen including Hodeidah.

The incident comes after the Saudi-based Gulf Cooperation Council invited Yemen’s warring sides for talks in Riyadh aimed at ending the nearly eight-year war.

The Houthis have said they would participate only in discussions held in a neutral country and the priority should be lifting a coalition blockade on areas held by the group.

Peace talks have floundered since the Houthis have tried to capture oil-rich Marib one of the last remaining strongholds of the Saudi-backed Yemeni government in the country’s north.

Saudi Arabia is leading a military coalition in Yemen in support of the internationally recognised government which has been engaged in a bloody conflict against the Houthis since 2015.

Worst humanitarian crisis

The war has cost hundreds of thousands of lives directly or indirectly and displaced millions in what the United Nations has called the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.

On Wednesday the UN voiced disappointment after a donors’ conference raised only $1.3bn far short of the $4.27bn target.

Houthi rebels often target airports and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia the world’s largest oil exporter. The Yemeni armed group has also carried out several attacks in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) this year as it expanded attacks against the two oil-rich Gulf nations.

Riyadh and Abu Dhabi are leading members of the military coalition involved in the Yemen war after the Houthi rebels seized the capital Sanaa and subsequently much of the north.

The UAE withdrew troops from the country in 2019 but remains an active player.

The latest attack comes as Aramco prepares to announce its 2021 results on Sunday.

A drone assault on the YASREF refinery in the Yanbu Industrial City on the Red Sea has “led to a temporary reduction in the refinery’s production which will be compensated for from the inventory” the energy ministry said in a statement. There were no casualties it added.

The statement cited a ministry official as saying two drone attacks at around 5:30 a.m. local time were launched at Yanbu’s gas plant and another on YASREF which produces 400000 barrels per day according to its website.

The official condemned the attacks saying they followed a Saturday “drone assault” on a petroleum products distribution terminal in Jizan in the south of the country.

The Iran-backed Houthis against whom Saudi Arabia leads a military coalition in Yemen have repeatedly targeted the kingdom including Aramco’s sites.

The insurgents said on Sunday that they launched cross-border drone and missile attacks on the kingdom targeting a number of “vital and important” establishments — including Aramco facilities.

The coalition meanwhile said it intercepted and destroyed ballistic missiles launched towards Jizan as well as nine armed drones targeting other areas in the kingdom.

“Initial investigations indicate the militia used Iranian cruise missiles that targeted Al-Shaqeeq desalination plant and Aramco’s Jizan bulk plant” it said in a statement adding other targets included a Dhahran Al-Janoub power station a gas station in Khamis Mushait and an Aramco gas plant in Yanbu.

It said that the “hostile attacks” and scattered debris after interception caused “some material damage” without specifying which sites were damaged.

In 2019 aerial assaults on two Aramco facilities in the eastern region temporarily knocked out half of the kingdom’s crude production underscoring the vulnerability of its infrastructure.

The latest round of attacks comes after an oil refinery in the Saudi capital Riyadh was targeted on March 10 by a drone an operation claimed by the Houthis.

The Houthis days ago rejected an invitation from the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council to attend talks on the Yemen conflict to be held in Riyadh between March 29 and April 7.

ST. LOUIS — In the last two years Mitchell Reynolds has spent more time in the hospital than the doctors and nurses. But there's finally light at the end of the otoscope.

""I feel better right now than I have in the past five six years"" he said.

The 67-year-old Reynolds is recovering from a lung transplant. And his medical team is recovering from an amazing race against time.

It all started with a lifesaving gift of donated lungs in Chicago.

""So our team of surgeons flew to Chicago using a small jet to get there"" said Dr. Ramsey Hachem a Washington University pulmonologist and surgical director of the Lung Transplant Program at Barnes-Jewish Hospital.

They landed just after midnight at a private airport.

""It was kind of just starting to snow"" Washington University surgical resident Dr. Katharine Caldwell said ""but we thought we would have enough time to do the procurement and get back out of Chicago.""

In these situations the clock is ticking. They need to minimize the time that the lungs are outside the body.

""That entire time period we try to keep under 7 hours. And the shorter the better"" Dr. Hachem said.

Beyond that risks injury to the lungs.

But when they got back to the plane freezing fog made taking off impossible. Off in the distance though was Chicago's Midway Airport.

""We immediately started looking at our phones and checking for flights"" said Beth Albertine the Lung Transplant Coordinator back in St. Louis.

The only option was a direct Southwest flight leaving in less than an hour at 6:20 a.m.

With the lungs in a cooler and riding in an ambulance Dr. Caldwell and the team made short work of Chicago's Cicero Avenue then jumped out and ran straight to the Southwest ticket counter.

""I said 'I'm a doctor this is a pair of human lungs'"" Dr. Caldwell recalled. ""'You guys have a flight leaving at 6:20 a.m. and I need to be on it.'""

The line at TSA wasn't long but the explanation was.

""They called over their supervisor to come look at it and look at all of our paperwork"" Dr. Caldwell said ""and she explained to me that she worked there a long time but she had never seen anything like this.""

Then after sprinting the length of the terminal they arrived at the gate just as the doors were shutting. There was no way that cooler was going into an overhead bin so the pilot and the flight attendants gave the doctors a companion pass of sorts.

""They helped us get the cooler on board and quite literally strapped it into a seat"" a grateful Dr. Caldwell said.

""I was very nervous I'm not going to lie"" Albertine said. ""It was very stressful but at the same time I just kept thinking we have to do this transplant. We can't let this precious gift go to waste.""

And it didn't.

Mitchell Reynolds now has new lungs and a story to tell. A story he didn't hear until days after his surgery.

""I was absolutely amazed"" Reynolds said. ""I thought 'My gosh this sounds like a good plot for a cliffhanger movie.'""

He says he owes everything to everybody on the Barnes transplant team. And of course the donor.

""None of this would be possible without organ donation"" Dr. Hachem said.

A journey that was not just about an operation but cooperation: from Southwest Airlines to TSA to the BJC transplant team.

""I took this job because I want to fight for people"" Dr. Caldwell said. ""I want to fight for each individual person who needs a second chance.""

Pilots at major US airlines including JetBlue and American are suing the CDC over mask rules.

The suit claims the federal mask mandate ignores scientific studies showing it is ""ineffective.""

Claimants also alleged it posed a risk to the health of pilots ""imperiling aviation safety.""

A group of pilots who work for major US airlines is suing the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) over the federal transportation mask mandate.

The 10 pilots work for commercial airlines including JetBlue American Airlines and Southwest Airlines according to the lawsuit.

In the filing the pilots alleged that the CDC acted ""without providing public notice or soliciting comment.""

The mask mandate applies to public transportation including commercial aircraft. It was extended on March 10 for 30 days according to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). The rule will stay in effect through April 18 at the earliest.

""This revised framework will be based on the COVID-19 community levels risk of new variants national data and the latest science"" the TSA said in a statement.

The pilots have alleged that the federal policy ""ignored countless scientific and medical studies and articles showing that face masks are totally ineffective in reducing coronavirus spread but are harmful to human health in at least 68 ways.""

They further alleged that they had ""serious concerns about the safety implications"" of the mask mandate in relation to unruly passenger behavior incidents caused by mask policies.

The lawsuit stated: ""As pilots for major airlines we have seen up close and personal the chaos in the sky created by the FTMM (Federal Transportation Mask Mandate) with thousands of reports to the Federal Aviation Administration of 'unruly' passenger behavior since the FTMM took effect Feb. 1 2021.""

The pilots alleged that nearly all of the ""chaos"" related to masks and that 2021 was the ""worst year on record for buffoonish behavior on planes.""

According to the FAA there were 4290 mask-related incidents reported in 2021. And more than 75% of the FAA's unruly incidents in 2021 arose from people vehemently refusing to wear masks. Since January last year the agency proposed fines of more than $682000 against unruly passengers.

The suit also claims the CDC ignores that the mask mandate ""impairs pilots' health"" and subsequently imperils aviation safety.

""Wearing a mask before and during flight causes us numerous medical deficiencies"" the suit alleged. ""Extended wearing of a mask which has become a part of routine life has led to the emergence of 'mask fatigue.' Mask fatigue is defined as the lack of energy that accompanies and/or follows prolonged wearing of a mask.""

On March 19 just before 8:45 a.m. airport tower officials called 911 and reported that an airplane had crashed near runway 1.

GFD crews searched the area to find the small two-seater plane that crashed north of Glendale Avenue on New River Road.

""The plane obviously had a hard landing and was just off the road into the dirt with power lines all around the area. Even with the damage the plane remained intact and did not catch on fire"" stated GFD's Chris James.

The two men were able to exit the plane on their own prior to firefighters arriving at the scene.

""One male had knee pain and the other male didn’t sustain any injuries. Both men were evaluated at the scene but declined being transported to the hospital"" said James.

The cause of the crash is not known at this time and remains under investigation.

Stanley Black & Decker (SWK 1.41%) a leader in tools and storage solutions released its first-quarter earnings on May 2 showcasing resilience amid economic fluctuations. The company reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.56 slightly above the expected $0.55. Despite a 1.5% drop in revenue from the previous year total revenue of $3.87 billion was likewise better than the consensus forecast for $3.83 billion.

Metric Q1 2024 Q1 2024 Analysts Estimate Q1 2023 % Change Adjusted EPS $0.56 $0.55 ($0.41) N/A Revenue $3.87 billion $3.83 billion $3.93 billion (1.5%) Gross margin 28.6% N/A 21.2% 7.4 percentage points

The core of the operation

Stanley Black & Decker has cemented its place as a cornerstone in the tools and outdoor equipment industry. With renowned brands like DeWalt and Craftsman as well as its namesake marques the company thrives on innovation quality and operational excellence. Its focus has sharply turned toward optimizing supply chains reducing costs and innovating on the product front as key strategies for sustainable growth.

In the earnings release the company described consumer demand for its products in Q1 as ""muted"" and noted that volumes also fell on the infrastructure side of the business.

However the company's adept maneuvering through cost-reduction initiatives and strategic portfolio adjustments speaks to its resilience. That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Investors are encouraged to monitor the company's progress in its global cost reduction program and its investments in innovation and growth initiatives. These areas crucial for long-term value creation embody Stanley Black & Decker's strategic pillars for navigating future market dynamics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9kZWNvZGluZy1zdGFubGV5LWJsYWNrLWRlY2tlci1pbmMtMDUxNDExOTgyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Decoding Stanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK): A Strategic SWOT Insight,"Comprehensive SWOT analysis based on Stanley Black & Decker Inc's latest SEC 10-Q filing.

Detailed financial overview and strategic insights into the company's operations and market positioning.

Expert assessment of potential challenges and growth prospects for Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

On May 2 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) filed its 10-Q report with the SEC providing a snapshot of the company's financial health and strategic direction. As a leading manufacturer of hand and power tools SWK operates primarily in two segments: Tools and Outdoor and Industrial. The company has shown resilience in a competitive market with a strong brand portfolio that includes DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. The financial overview from the filing reveals a year-to-date cost of sales totaling $2761.0 million a decrease from the previous year's $3096.3 million indicating improved cost management. Interest expenses have slightly increased to $131.5 million from $130.9 million. The company has also reported a net gain on cash flow hedges albeit minimal and continues to manage its defined benefit pension items with a net of tax amortization of $(2.1) million. These figures set the stage for a deeper dive into SWK's SWOT analysis providing investors with a clearer picture of the company's internal dynamics and external environment.

Decoding Stanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power: Stanley Black & Decker Inc's brand strength is a significant asset. The company's portfolio includes some of the most recognized names in the tool industry such as DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. These brands are synonymous with quality and reliability which has helped SWK maintain a loyal customer base and command premium pricing. The brand power is further evidenced by the company's ability to sustain revenue generation with the Tools & Outdoor segment contributing the lion's share of total revenues amounting to $13.4 billion in 2023.

Operational Efficiency: SWK's commitment to operational excellence is evident in its supply chain transformation initiatives. The company has generated approximately $145 million in pre-tax run-rate savings during the first three months of 2024 driven by lower headcount indirect spend reductions and supply chain efficiencies. This focus on cost control and operational streamlining positions SWK to improve its gross margins and enhance profitability in the long term.

Weaknesses

Market Demand Sensitivity: The company's performance is closely tied to market demand which can be volatile. In the first quarter of 2024 SWK experienced a 1% decline in volume in the Tools & Outdoor segment attributed to a muted market demand backdrop. This sensitivity to economic cycles and consumer spending patterns can lead to fluctuations in revenue and profitability making it challenging to maintain consistent growth.

Story continues

Legal and Compliance Risks: Stanley Black & Decker Inc faces ongoing legal and compliance risks as highlighted by the potential $32 million civil penalty for alleged untimely reporting related to product recalls. Additionally the company is cooperating with investigations into transactions that may raise compliance questions under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). These issues not only pose financial risks but can also impact the company's reputation and investor confidence.

Opportunities

Innovation and Product Development: SWK plans to invest between $300 million to $500 million in innovation and commercial investments through 2025 to accelerate organic growth. This strategic focus on innovation presents an opportunity to develop new products and technologies that can meet evolving customer needs and expand market share particularly in high-growth areas such as cordless and smart tools.

Geographic Expansion: With a majority of revenue derived from the United States SWK has significant opportunities to expand its international presence. The company's established brands provide a strong foundation to grow in emerging markets where demand for quality tools and outdoor equipment is increasing. Strategic partnerships and acquisitions could further facilitate international expansion and diversification of revenue streams.

Threats

Competitive Pressure: The tool industry is highly competitive with numerous players vying for market share. SWK must continuously innovate and differentiate its products to stay ahead of competitors. Price competition particularly from lower-cost manufacturers can erode margins and market position if not effectively managed.

Supply Chain Disruptions: Global supply chain challenges including material shortages and transportation bottlenecks pose a threat to SWK's ability to meet customer demand and maintain operational efficiency. While the company is undertaking a supply chain transformation it remains vulnerable to external disruptions that could impact production and delivery timelines.

In conclusion Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) demonstrates strong brand equity and operational efficiency as key strengths while facing challenges related to market demand sensitivity and legal risks. Opportunities for growth through innovation and geographic expansion are promising but the company must navigate competitive pressures and supply chain vulnerabilities. As SWK continues its strategic focus on cost reduction and product development it is well-positioned to leverage its strengths and capitalize on market opportunities despite the potential threats in its operating environment.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Organic revenue or organic sales is defined as the difference between total current and prior year sales less the impact of companies acquired and divested in the past twelve months and any foreign currency impacts. Organic revenue growth organic sales growth or organic growth is organic revenue or organic sales divided by prior year sales. Gross profit is defined as sales less cost of sales. Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of sales. Segment profit is defined as sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses (aside from corporate overhead expense). Segment margin is segment profit as a percentage of sales. EBITDA is earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is EBITDA as a percentage of sales. Gross profit gross margin SG&A segment profit segment margin EBITDA and EBITDA margin are adjusted for certain gains and charges such as supply chain transformation costs acquisition and divestiture-related items asset impairments restructuring and other adjusting items. Management uses these metrics as key measures to assess the performance of the Company as a whole as well as the related measures at the segment level. Adjusted earnings per share or adjusted EPS is diluted GAAP EPS excluding certain gains and charges. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and software expenditures. Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity as well as its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners and is useful information for investors. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service other borrowing activity discretionary dividends on the Company's common stock and business acquisitions among other items. Free cash flow conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by net income. The Non-GAAP statement of operations and business segment information is reconciled to GAAP on pages 12 through 14 and in the appendix to the earnings conference call slides available at http://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/investors. The Company considers the use of the Non-GAAP financial measures above relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the Company's results business trends and outlook measures aside from the material impact of certain gains and charges and ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods.

The Company also provides expectations for the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EPS presented on a basis excluding certain gains and charges as well as free cash flow. Forecasted adjusted EPS is reconciled to GAAP EPS on page 4. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash flow from operations a reconciliation of forecasted free cash flow to its most directly comparable GAAP estimate has been omitted. The Company believes such a reconciliation would also imply a degree of precision that is inappropriate for this forward-looking measure.

Here's why we bought the dip,"Stanley Black & Decker overcame a soft demand environment to deliver a top and bottom line beat Thursday but the stock is falling because the toolmaker simply reiterated its guidance. That's a fate shared by home-improvement peers and many other companies this earnings season. We added to our position on the pullback. Revenue fell 2% year over year in the January-to-March period to $3.87 billion edging out the $3.82 billion expected by analysts according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 56 cents topping the 54-cent estimate LSEG data showed. Stanley Black & Decker Why we own it: Stanley Black & Decker is in the later innings of a multi-year restructuring plan. The company launched a series of initiatives designed to generate cost savings optimize inventory streamline and simplify the organization and transform its supply chain. Although repair and remodeling demand environment is soft due to higher interest rates management's cost-cutting plan will create a stronger company for the next cycle. As we wait for the turnaround to play out we're getting paid a hefty dividend. Competitors: Bosch Techtronic Industries and Illinois Tool Works Most recent buy: May 2 2024 Initiation: June 14 2023 Bottom Line Stanley Black & Decker turned in another solid quarter of execution on matters within management's control. It's making good on its plan of optimizing expensive inventory reducing complexities and improving its supply chain to reach $2 billion in annual cost savings by the end of 2025. The progress is evident in the results with adjusted gross margins continuing to improve. The one problem is the broader demand environment is still mostly soft preventing management from raising the midpoint of its outlook. Given the stock's lackluster year-to-date performance we would have thought investor expectations had come down enough to be satisfied with a beat and backing of guidance. However there's always someone with their expectations too high. That's pushing the stock down more than 7%. Stanley Black & Decker's professional customers remain resilient but demand from do-it-yourself customers has not returned to growth. This should be largely understood and we expect to hear similar rhetoric when Home Depot and Lowe's report their earnings later this month. We probably won't see DIY activity meaningfully rebound until mortgage rates come down and reinvigorate the existing home sales market. We focus on existing home sales because the first thing people typically do after buying an older home is spend money on repair and remodeling projects. This dynamic makes Stanley Black & Decker one of the more interest-rate-sensitive stocks we have in the portfolio. We don't want to have too many of them in this ""higher for longer"" environment but at least with Stanley Black & Decker our patience is being rewarded with hefty dividend yield of about 3.80%. The thesis may be taking longer to play out but what management is doing to take out costs in the soft environment will make its earnings power look more impressive once the cycle turns. We are lowering our price target to $105 from $110 because rate cut expectations keep getting pushed out extending the timing of the DIY market recovery. But we are reiterating our 1 rating and bought this pullback earlier Thursday. Quarterly commentary Stanley Black & Decker's largest segment by far — known as Tools & Outdoor — generated sales of $3.29 billion in the quarter topping the $3.27 billion expected by analysts according to FactSet. However operating income of $279 million slightly missed analyst projections of $286 million per FactSet. Volume growth of 1% in the company's flagship DeWalt power tools could not overcome a muted consumer and a soft do-it-yourself environment which pressured sales for hand tools. Outdoor organic revenue was up 2% in the quarter mostly driven by demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment. Pricing was flat which we think is a positive because it shows the company isn't cutting prices to spur demand. Once you give up price in this business it's very hard to get it back. Sales in Stanley Black & Decker's smaller Industrial segment— largely made up of fasteners in end markets such as automotive and aerospace — totaled $585 million in the period missing the $596 million estimate according to FactSet. Quarterly operating income in the segment of $71 million topped estimates at $63 million according to FactSet. Organic sales fell 4% partially offset by a 1% price increase across the segment. Within the segment its so-called Engineered Fastening business saw organic revenues grow 5% thanks to a 30% increase in aerospace and a 4% increase in automotive. As a reminder Stanley completed the divestiture of its Infrastructure business on April 1 for $760 million in cash. Net proceeds from the sale were used to reduce short-term debt in the second quarter. The company's adjusted gross margin performance of 29.0% was a solid mark improving 590 basis points compared with last year and exceeding expectations of 28.7%. The result keeps the business on track to achieve its goal of about 30% over the full year. The gross margin improvements were driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. Free cash flow was negative which is typical with first-quarter seasonality. However the result was a little better than expected due to inventory control. The company's capital deployment priorities this year are to invest in organic growth fund the dividend and strengthen the balance sheet. Stanley Black & Decker has been paying a dividend for 147 consecutive years with increases in each of the past 56. Guidance Management made no real changes to its 2024 guidance. It still expects total company organic sales to be relatively unchanged plus or minus low single digits. At the segment level organic sales in Tools & Outdoor are projected to be relatively flat at the midpoint while Industrial is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Margins at Tools & Outdoors are expected to improve year over year while Industrial is expected to remain flat. Management continues to expect adjusted EPS to be between $3.50 to $4.50. Considering the stock sell-off Wall Street must have been looking for some signaling that earnings were trending toward the higher end of the range based on the consensus forecast of $4.14. This was way too optimistic. This modeling came well before the market erased its expectations for multiple interest rate cuts this year. While Stanley's wide earnings range leaves us ambiguity into the rest of the year CFO Patrick Hallinan said he believes the midpoint of the range can be achieved due to costs controls. Meanwhile management reiterated its full-year adjusted free cash flow of $600 million and $800 million. In addition the company expects gross margins to increase sequentially in both halves of 2024 and total 30% for the full year. Gross margins are expected to be in the low 30s exiting the year setting up 2025 for another year of strong year-over-year earnings expansion even if the demand environment stays tepid. The company's long-term adjusted gross margin target of 35% is supported by the $2 billion in annual cost savings it expects by the end of next year. ""We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments"" Hallinan said.

But Schultz — who was recently named Starbucks’ interim chief executive — never confronted a unionization movement as big and fast-growing as the current one. Six U.S. Starbucks stores have voted to unionize since December and at least 140 more in 27 states have filed petitions for union elections.

It’s unclear how Schultz will tackle the issue when he returns to the company in April.

“He took it really personally that his workers wanted to be part of a union because he thought with him in charge they wouldn’t need it” said Pam Blauman-Schmitz a retired union representative who worked to organize Starbucks’ first stores in the early 1980s. “He would say stuff like ‘Maybe you need unions in the coal mines but not at Starbucks stores.”

Starbucks announced March 16 that its CEO of five years Kevin Johnson was retiring. The company tapped Schultz to serve as interim CEO until it finds a permanent replacement by this fall. Schultz 68 who has held the honorary title of chairman emeritus since 2018 is also rejoining the company’s board.

It is not yet clear if Schultz will try to amp up the fight against unionization. But Timothy Hubbard assistant professor of management at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business said he is well-positioned to do so.

“My sense is that if they want to shut down the unions this is the best course of action” Hubbard said. “Schultz has what it takes to tackle a hard topic like unions.”

Schultz did not respond to attempts to contact him through his website or his family’s foundation.

In a November letter to employees posted just before the first unionization votes at three stores in Buffalo New York Schultz said he tried to create the kind of company that his blue-collar father never had the chance to work for.

He recalled the “traumatic moment” his family had no income after his father suffered a workplace injury and said that’s why Starbucks has benefits like health care free college tuition parental leave and stock grants for employees.

“No partner has ever needed to have a representative seek to obtain things we all have as partners at Starbucks. And I am saddened and concerned to hear anyone thinks that is needed now” Schultz wrote.

But to many union organizers who complain of inconsistent hours poor training understaffing and low wages Shultz’s words fell flat.

“A lot of people felt like they were being lectured to by a disappointed father because they weren’t grateful” said Jaz Brisack a Starbucks barista and labor organizer who heard Schultz speak at an employee forum in Buffalo last fall.

Others say they’ve seen outright anger from Schultz over unions.

Blauman-Schmitz said as soon as Schultz bought Starbucks in 1987 he reneged on a labor agreement that had been reached between the company and the United Food and Commercial Workers union which represented six Seattle-area stores and a roasting plant. Schultz wanted a new contract with weaker benefits and job protections said Blauman-Schmitz who has since retired from the union.

One day she said Schultz spotted her passing out flyers in the roasting plant and rushed toward her screaming and red in the face.

Anne Belov was working part-time in the roasting plant and sat on the union negotiating committee. She had always gotten glowing performance reviews but after Schultz took over she was suddenly being reprimanded constantly. Belov left the company in 1988.

“You could see the writing on the wall. As the company grew it was not going to continue to be possible to act on the good faith of the people who controlled all the power” she said.

Schultz soon swept the union out. In his 1997 book “Pour Your Heart Into It” he recalled how a barista who opposed the union began a campaign to decertify it. By 1992 the union no longer represented the stores or the roasting plant. Schultz saw that as a sign that workers trusted him.

“If they had faith in me and my motives they wouldn’t need a union” he wrote.

Still efforts to unionize Starbucks didn’t go away and the company continued to fight them. Starbucks had to reinstate fired workers or pay to settle labor law violations numerous times in the early 2000s.

Last year the NLRB found that Starbucks unlawfully retaliated against two Philadelphia baristas who were attempting to unionize. The NLRB said Starbucks monitored the employees’ social media unlawfully spied on their conversations and ultimately fired them. It ordered Starbucks to stop interfering with workers’ right to organize and offer reinstatement to the two workers.

More recently on March 15 the NLRB issued a complaint against Starbucks alleging that district and store managers in Phoenix spied on and threatened workers who supported unionizing. The complaint says Starbucks suspended one union supporter and fired another.

Starbucks did not make anyone available to comment.

In a letter to employees in December Starbucks North America President Rossann Williams said the company will respect the legal process and bargain in good faith. But the company insists its stores function better when it works directly with employees.

The outcome of the current unionizing effort is unclear. The number of stores that have petitioned for union elections is still only a fraction of Starbucks’ 9000 company-owned stores in the U.S. And Starbucks has the resources to keep fighting with annual revenue of $29 billion last year.

But Brisack said this unionizing effort is also stronger than past ones which were thwarted by high worker turnover and resource-starved unions. Organizers now have the backing of Workers United — an arm of the 2 million-member Service Employees International Union — and a union-friendly president in the White House. Brisack said the pandemic also fueled workers’ outrage.

The climate is also changing. Dan Cornfield a labor expert and professor of sociology at Vanderbilt said U.S. polling shows growing public support for unions since the Great Recession. That’s a big difference from the 1980s when Starbucks first fought back unions.

“By taking an anti-union stand from the Reagan era they are actually potentially jeopardizing their customer base” Cornfield said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NuYXRpb25ub3cuY29tL3VzLW5ld3Mvc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWlzLWdldHRpbmctcmlkLW9mLXNpbmdsZS11c2UtY29mZmVlLWN1cHMtaW50cm9kdWNpbmctYS1tb3JlLWNvbW11bmFsLW1vZGVsL9IBf2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NuYXRpb25ub3cuY29tL3VzLW5ld3Mvc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWlzLWdldHRpbmctcmlkLW9mLXNpbmdsZS11c2UtY29mZmVlLWN1cHMtaW50cm9kdWNpbmctYS1tb3JlLWNvbW11bmFsLW1vZGVsL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks moving away from single-use coffee cups introducing a more communal model,"(NEXSTAR) – Starbucks has a vision for the future — and it includes communal coffee cups.

Starbucks has announced plans to reduce the use of single-use coffee cups by 2025 in favor of reusable models. In a press release issued Tuesday the company detailed plans to achieve its latest “planet positive goal” by encouraging customers to bring their own personal cups to be refilled or by offering communal cups that guests would be instructed to return upon their next visit.

Those communal cups would then be professionally cleaned at the store and provided to other Starbucks customers who would in turn repeat the process.

“Innovation is how we will build our next chapter advance our planet positive impact and boldly reimagine our future together” said Michael Kobori the company’s chief sustainability officer in a statement included with the press release.

The communal cups would be cleaned in-store before being provided to other customers. (Starbucks)

Starbucks has already tested several different pilot programs both in the U.S. and abroad hoping to learn from customer preferences and behavior. In Japan Singapore and London for instance some stores have adopted the communal-cup model (also known as “Borrow A Cup”) in addition to offering single-use cups. Meanwhile 16 other shops in Korea offer no single-use cups at all but rather reusable communal cups personal cups or “for-here” drinkware — the latter of which is provided to customers who choose to enjoy their beverages in-store. Another “experiential” location in Shanghai offers nothing but for-here drinkware.

It’s unclear exactly how Starbucks will be incentivizing customers to adopt the communal-cup model — or whether stores will begin charging a deposit for its communal cups — although the company has long offered a discount to customers who bring their own reusables. In some tests at U.S. locations Starbucks confirmed that it had charged an additional fee for guests who requested single-use cups which is already a common practice at Starbucks stores in the UK and Germany.

A representative for Starbucks said it was still testing various incentives and disincentives to get customers on-board with its reusable cup program.

Tuesday’s announcement marks a dramatic shift from the policies Starbucks was required to enact in the earlier part of the pandemic when the company was temporarily unable to allow customers to use their own reusable cups between March 2020 and June 2021. Upon reinstating the practice Starbucks adopted a new process whereby reusable cups were placed in ceramic mugs which were then handled by its baristas.

In setting its reusable goals for 2025 Starbucks is also tackling a longstanding problem with its paper cups which are only recyclable in certain U.S. municipalities. Over the last several years Starbucks has worked toward a more sustainable cup — with projects aimed at redesigning the cup or figuring out a solution on the recycling industry’s end — but the process remains ongoing.

“Upping the recycled content of our hot cups is a long-time commitment and an area where we can continue to lead” reads a portion of Tuesday’s press release.

A previous version of this story suggested single-use cups would be removed from Starbucks locations altogether; a representative for Starbucks has clarified that single-use disposable cups will still be available when reusable models are adopted.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL3N0YXJidWNrcy1tYXktc29sdmUtYS1iaWctcHJvYmxlbS1mb3ItdGVzbGEtYW5kLXRoZS1ldi1pbmR1c3RyedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks May Solve a Big Problem for Tesla And the EV Industry,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/starbucks-may-solve-a-big-problem-for-tesla-and-the-ev-industry on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL3N0YXJidWNrcy1tYXktc29sdmUtYS1iaWctcHJvYmxlbS1mb3ItdGVzbGEtYW5kLXRoZS1ldi1pbmR1c3RyedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8va2p6ei5vcmcvY29udGVudC8xNzY1MjU5L3Njb3R0c2RhbGUtc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLXdvcmtlcnMtd2hvLXdhbnQtdW5pb25pemUtc2F5LXRoZWlyLWhvdXJzLWhhdmUtYmVlbi1jdXTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scottsdale Starbucks workers who want to unionize say their hours have been cut,"Vaughan Jones/KJZZ Scottsdale Starbucks employees rally in support of unionization.

Starbucks employees at the Scottsdale Road and Mayo Boulevard location hosted a rally Saturday afternoon to raise awareness of their attempt to unionize.

They say the efforts have been met by opposition from management including intimidation and cutting hours for involved employees.

The location joins over 100 Starbucks across the country that have filed petitions for union elections including a successful election at a store in Mesa.

Callie Daly is a barista at the Scottsdale and Mayo location. She said she was working 28 hours a week steadily before she joined the union effort.

“In order to keep my college benefits through Starbucks for ASU I have to maintain at least 20 hours a week and that’s recently been cut to 16 or lower and I had to really fight to get back to that 20 baseline” said Daly.

Scottsdale and Mayo Starbucks employee Laila Dalton was named in a formal complaint against Starbucks from the National Labor Relations Board. She says she has received more discipline from management since starting the unionization process.

“They have put us through so many obstacles trying to give me so many write-ups trying to cut so many people's hours from working 20 hours to just 10 to five hours a week” said Dalton.

Dalton says the successful election in Mesa as well as unionization attempts across the country helped spur and continue the process in their store.

A Starbucks spokesperson called claims of anti-union activity “categorically false” and said employees are held to the same standards regardless of union affiliation.

Scottsdale barista Bill Whitmire says the union effort stems from frustration with upper management specifically communication problems.

“We don't feel like corporate listens to us at all that's why we started the union because we didn't feel listened to. We tried a number of times to talk to management about our concerns from the management level all the way to the district management level. And promises were made. But they were never followed up on” said Whitmire.

Ben Minkler works at a Starbucks in Deer Valley but attended the rally in support of the workers at the Scottsdale location. He cited similar communication issues at his location which is also undergoing a union petition.

“Our store we've been asking for renovations for years at this point and they keep saying ‘It's on the way it's on the way.’ At the moment I feel like we're not being heard. And so I feel like this is the goal right now is to really try and get our voices out there” said Minkler.

Whitmire says the store’s union election is expected to take place in mid-April and if successful the store would be the second corporately-owned Starbucks in Arizona to unionize.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd2h5eS5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZXMvc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLXVuaW9uLWVmZm9ydHMtZ3Jvd2luZy1ob3dhcmQtc2NodWx0ei_SAU1odHRwczovL3doeXkub3JnL2FydGljbGVzL3N0YXJidWNrcy11bmlvbi1lZmZvcnRzLWdyb3dpbmctaG93YXJkLXNjaHVsdHovYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Labor foe Schultz returns as Starbucks union effort grows,"From the time he bought Starbucks in 1987 to the time he stepped down as chairman in 2018 Howard Schultz consistently — and successfully — fought attempts to unionize Starbucks’ U.S. stores and roasting plants.

But Schultz — who was recently named Starbucks’ interim chief executive — never confronted a unionization movement as big and fast-growing as the current one. Six U.S. Starbucks stores have voted to unionize since December and at least 140 more in 27 states have filed petitions for union elections.

It’s unclear how Schultz will tackle the issue when he returns to the company in April.

“He took it really personally that his workers wanted to be part of a union because he thought with him in charge they wouldn’t need it” said Pam Blauman-Schmitz a retired union representative who worked to organize Starbucks’ first stores in the early 1980s. “He would say stuff like ‘Maybe you need unions in the coal mines but not at Starbucks stores.”

Starbucks announced March 16 that its CEO of five years Kevin Johnson was retiring. The company tapped Schultz to serve as interim CEO until it finds a permanent replacement by this fall. Schultz 68 who has held the honorary title of chairman emeritus since 2018 is also rejoining the company’s board.

It is not yet clear if Schultz will try to amp up the fight against unionization. But Timothy Hubbard assistant professor of management at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business said he is well-positioned to do so.

“My sense is that if they want to shut down the unions this is the best course of action” Hubbard said. “Schultz has what it takes to tackle a hard topic like unions.”

Schultz did not respond to attempts to contact him through his website or his family’s foundation.

In a November letter to employees posted just before the first unionization votes at three stores in Buffalo New York Schultz said he tried to create the kind of company that his blue-collar father never had the chance to work for.

He recalled the “traumatic moment” his family had no income after his father suffered a workplace injury and said that’s why Starbucks has benefits like health care free college tuition parental leave and stock grants for employees.

“No partner has ever needed to have a representative seek to obtain things we all have as partners at Starbucks. And I am saddened and concerned to hear anyone thinks that is needed now” Schultz wrote."

On Thursday St. Peter's stunned Kentucky to become the 10th No. 15 seed to win a men's NCAA tournament game.

On Saturday it joined truly rarified air. In a second-round matchup with No. 7 Murray State the Peacocks picked up where they left off with a 70-60 win over the Racers to secure an unlikely Sweet 16 bid. And like on Thursday this was no fluke. St. Peter's was the better team from the opening tip.

The Peacocks never trailed Murray State. They opened a 32-27 halftime lead then scored the first eight points of the second half as if to announce to their doubters that this was actually happening. Murray State cut the deficit on multiple occasions but St. Peter's had an answer every time.

Now a Murray State team that entered Saturday at 31-2 is going home with its third loss of the season and its first after 21 straight wins. St. Peter's meanwhile is making plans to travel next weekend to a Philadelphia regional 90 miles south of its Jersey City New Jersey campus. The winner of Sunday's game between Texas and Purdue awaits.

With the win St. Peter's becomes the third No. 15 seed to ever advance to the tournament's second weekend. ""Dunk City"" Florida Gulf Coast was the first to do so in 2013. Oral Roberts repeated the feat just last year. Now St. Peter's joins the exclusive club.

""It's an amazing ride"" head coach Shaheen Holloway told CBS after the game. ""How 'bout that. ... I told these guys all year nobody works harder than them. The stuff I put these guys through — this is easy. Practice is tough. Kudos to these guys. They deserve it.""

The party back home appropriately marked the occasion.

Seniors Sencire Harris and Ramar Pryor and junior Lance Hayes relentlessly attacked the basket and led STVM to a 63-35 victory over Gates Mills Gilmour Academy.

The win gave STVM its 10th state championship.

""It never gets old"" STVM coach Dru Joyce II said. ""This is special. These guys have been through a lot. They have played hard and we have had a tough schedule. These guys make a sacrifice every day just to get to school and to have them come and put in the time and the work just makes it even more special.

""As a team this is a special group because you could just see the growth. Other years coming in I kind of had an idea that we were going to be good. This year I knew we were going to have two good players but I wasn't sure about the team because we were young and didn't have a whole lot of varsity time and the schedule was tough.""

Harris led STVM (23-4) with 17 points seven assists four rebounds two steals and a blocked shot before a crowd of 3845.

""We put in a lot of hard work and kept pushing"" said Harris a 6-foot-4 University of Illinois recruit. ""Today is a very special moment for me.""

Hayes totaled 11 points six rebounds four steals three assists and a block.

Pryor a 6-foot-3 Cleveland State University recruit finished with 10 points six rebounds an assist and a block.

STVM held an edge in rebounds (30-22) assists (14-7) steals (8-2) and blocks (3-0). The Irish had three turnovers and forced the Lancers into 15 turnovers.

""We are going to guard you"" Joyce said. ""That is what we talk about and that is what we do. ... Three turnovers is definitely a season low. That is special to do it on the biggest stage.""

In the opening minute of the fourth quarter the STVM student section started chanting ""This game's over. This game's over. This game's over.""

Their thoughts were accurate Sunday and were accurate with regards to STVM's entire tournament run that featured seven lopsided wins.

STVM opened the tournament with a 60-21 sectional final win over Warrensville Heights and then topped Mentor Lake Catholic 78-36 and Buckeye 93-53 to a win district title. The Irish beat Youngstown Chaney 82-43 and Louisville 61-21 to earn a regional crown and dispatched Kettering Archbishop Alter 72-47 in a state semifinal.

Senior Ryan Mueller paced Gilmour (23-6) with nine points and five rebounds. Lancers junior Brandon Rose scored eight points and grabbed four rebounds and junior Dorjan Flowers had seven points four assists and three rebounds.

""They pressured us in ways we have never seen this year"" Mueller said of STVM.

Added Flowers: ""This was the best team we have played that can all defend one through five. That was pretty tough. There was no one with any weaknesses on defense.""

Gilmour was playing in its second state final after being the Division IV runner-up in 1992.

""This was really a historic run for our program this year"" Gilmour coach Dan DeCrane said. ""Being in Division II for the last five years and not being able to get back to the state tournament much less the state championship game in 30 years. For myself to see my fourth year end with nine seniors — one manager and eight players — do something incredible is great. ... This was an awesome journey that we will all remember.""

STVM led 24-17 at halftime with Hayes scoring eight points and Pryor and junior Darius Stratford contributing six points apiece.

Hayes also had five rebounds and two assists in a very active first half. Flowers paced Gilmour with seven points three rebounds and three assists in the opening 16 minutes.

STVM held a 17-9 advantage in rebounds at halftime and committed three turnovers. Gilmour had six turnovers at the break.

Harris made four layups and one free throw to score nine of his 17 points in the third quarter and extend the Irish lead to 42-19 with 52.1 seconds on the clock.

""This was definitely a complete game for us"" Harris said. ""We really locked in at halftime. ... We executed we limited the turnovers and we got our assists up in the second half.""

Gilmour senior Lucas Grover made a 3-pointer to conclude the scoring in the third quarter but STVM led 42-22 .

""We knew if we got the lead extended they would have to come out of the zone [defense]"" Joyce said. ""When they came out of the zone they couldn't guard us.""

The Irish lead expanded in the fourth quarter with scoring from Harris Hayes junior Kevin Hamilton Jr. senior Ethan Connery senior Clinton Thomas III sophomore LaVelle Sharpe and freshman John Whorton.

Hamilton finished with seven points and Stratford scored six points.

STVM shot 50.9% from the field (27-of-53) and 63.6% from the free-throw line (7-of-11). Gilmour shot 38.2% from the field (13-of-34) and 54.5% from the free-throw line (6-of-11).

""I thought we gave a great effort for awhile today"" said DeCrane a 2003 Archbishop Hoban graduate who played basketball and was an assistant coach with the Knights.

""I didn't think we played very well overall. I know some of that had to do with the guys in white and green. We didn't shoot it well. It was hard to enter into some of our offense. ... They do some things defensively that I know is tough to beat.""

STVM state tournament history

STVM's victory Sunday gave the boys basketball program its seventh state championship in Division II.

Joyce has served as coach on all seven (2003 2009 2011 2017 2018 2021 and 2022).

STVM's other state titles were in 1984 in Class AA under coach Joe Suboticki and in 2000 and 2001 in Division III under coach Keith Dambrot.

""Ten state championships I have been blessed to be a part of nine — seven now as a head coach [and two as an assistant to Dambrot]"" Joyce said. ""I am honored that I can have an opportunity to work with young men. The victories and the championships are good. They are special but what is even more special is I want to see what kind of men they grow into. That is what is most important.""

STVM was a Division I state runner-up in 2019 and Division II runners-up in 2002 2013 and 2016. The Irish were a state semifinalist in Class AA in 1983 and 1987 and in Division II in 2006 and 2014. Prior to merging St. Mary won the Class B state title in 1929 under Leo Engler and St. Vincent was a Class A state semifinalist in 1949.

""A lot of credit to St. Vincent-St. Mary"" DeCrane said. ""They are here pretty much every year for a reason. They are quite the monster. We have a lot of respect for their team and their program. Coach Joyce obviously does a terrific job.""

(KKTV) - A Colorado Springs family is ready to take on the next step in their life after a rough few months and Bob Penkhus Motor Company was able to step in and help. After the local car company got off the phone with CSPD who was working on a case where a family had been involved in a hit-and-run with an uninsured driver and left there vehicle totaled. Turns out this car was a huge part of keeping their family of five safe.

The mother her husband and three little kids reportedly lived in the totalled vehicle and were trying to get back on their feet. Their story goes as follows:

A young mother and father of three – ages one two and three – have endured hardship after hardship starting in 2017 when they lost their Houston home to Hurricane Harvey. That’s when they began living with family and friends then ultimately living in their 2008 Hyundai Santa Fe car for 3-4 months. After continuing to try and make things work in Texas the family of five moved to Colorado in November of 2021 for a fresh start. The family continued to live in their vehicle then in December of 2021 began staying in a local shelter thanks to Family Promise. Another obstacle was recently thrown their way when the couple became victims of a hit and run. On February 2nd their car was impounded with extensive damage to the front end and issues to the radiator and adjoining components that were prohibitive to repair without full coverage insurance. Only days later the mother had multiple interviews for a job at Amazon having to take the bus two hours one way to get there while the father stayed at the shelter to take care of their kids. She was offered the position and accepted it.

That’s when Bob Penkhus decided to step in and see if they could get this family a “safe and reliable” car. “A gentleman brought in a car that we were able to appraised and it was worth about $5000. And it was a car with low miles one owner in amazing condition brand-new tires; It was like the perfect car” says Sevan Stryker the General manager for Bob Penkhus Motor Company “We ended up purchasing that vehicle and that’s what we ended up donating to this family a few days later.”

This was something the family never expected.

“They had no clue they were getting a car. In fact the initial statement that the lady made was I thought maybe we were getting a couch or something just that somebody had that they could donate to us. I had no clue that I was going to get a car... When she walked in and we unveiled it she instantly broke into tears as did the husband” says Stryker.

This one small act of kindness to help someone in need also touched the staff of Bob Penkhus. “When you hear the story and you see the people it’s such a stronger emotion to see the mother break down in tears the father break down in tears. More than anything it’s just hey were going to be able to get to work.we’re going to be able to pay our bills we’re gonna be able to take care of our kids” says Stryker.

The company tells 11 News they love to help out the community and the people who live here and this is just the start of good they plan to do.

STRYKER Ohio — Williams County Sheriff's Deputy Jeff Lehman says seven people were taken to the hospital Sunday after fentanyl was found in the air ventilation system at the Northwest Ohio Juvenile Detention Training and Rehabilitation Center in Stryker.

The Williams County Sheriff's Department Stryker Police Department and Bryan Fire responded to the facility on County Rd. 24/25 around 8:30 p.m.

Lehman said they received a call that juveniles at the facility became affected by something and collapsed.

After a search response teams found a fentanyl release in the air ventilation system.

Seven people were affected: four juveniles and three staff members according to the sheriff.

All seven were taken to the hospital for evaluation and treatment. Information on their condition is not available.

The remaining juveniles at the facility were then transferred to the adult detention facility while crews investigated.

Lehman said they will remain at the adult facility separated from the adult detainees until other arrangements can be made.

The Northwest Ohio Juvenile Detention Center “provides a safe and secure placement for delinquent youth who are being detained in accordance to a court order or pursuant to the laws of arrest” according to their website.

On Monday WTOL 11 spoke to a representative from Drug Abuse Response Team (DART) to learn exactly what the seven experienced when they were exposed to the dangerous drug.

""You gonna notice that the respiratory or breathing is gonna change in that person. So it becomes more shallow it becomes lessened to the point where there is possibly no breathing taking place at all"" DART member Tamme Smith said. ""You're gonna notice that the lips and nailbeds kinda start to turn blue and ashed. And of course the last thing you're gonna notice is that person is unresponsive.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vYmcudXNlbWJhc3N5Lmdvdi91cy1zZWNyZXRhcnktb2YtZGVmZW5zZS1sbG95ZC1hdXN0aW4tbWFyY2gtMTgtMTktdmlzaXQtdG8tYnVsZ2FyaWEtMDMtMTktMjAyMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin's March 18-19 Visit to Bulgaria,"We’re sorry this site is currently experiencing technical difficulties.

He is currently Head of Food Development at Sysco Speciality Group where he works with their extensive customer base to forge meaningful links between grower farmer producer manufacturer chefs and buyers to deliver profitable relevant and innovative menu solutions and to help develop the understanding and appreciation in the trade about how our produce arrives from field to fork.

During his time in professional kitchens Ian held positions as Executive Chef at such prestigious venues as Hampton Court Palace Stoll Moss theaters and The London Coliseum. Ian is also involved in the wider industry and is an active member of The Craft Guild of Chefs and a regular judge at The Great Taste Awards Quality Food Awards World and British Cheese Awards Hotelympia Salon Culinaire and the Craft Guild of Chefs Graduate Awards.

He is also co-founder and event director of The Universal Cookery and Food Festival.

We asked PRODUCE BUSINESS Contributing Editor Steven Loeb to find out more. Ian talked to us about the current food trends in the UK how to convince growers to take a chance on new crops and the difference between what chefs and consumers look for in their produce.

Ian Nottage

Head of Food Development

Sysco Speciality Group

Q: Talk about yourself a little bit about yourself and what your company does.

A: I work for the UK Sysco speciality group which is a collection of different companies. So we have M&J Seafood which is obviously a seafood and shellfish speciality company; we have FreshDirect which is a bit like FreshPoint in the US. So that’s the fresh produce business. We have a company called Wild Harvest which makes real premium ingredients for chefs so that’s produce but speciality produce like blood oranges wild garlic forage ingredients. And we also have a lot of chef ingredients as well things like ingredients from molecular gastronomy different types of chocolate and couvertures specialist oils vinegars truffles that sort of thing. And we also have our own production facility called Fresh Kitchen where we make sauces soups stews pickles mostly vegetables and things for our customers although we offer a bespoke service; I guess you guys would call it ‘commissary.’

I’ve been with the company now for two years and I head up the food development team. Food development is talking chef to chef so we’ll work with our customers to help them develop menu innovation recipes ingredients that will showcase what’s best in season and help them to design menus. We also work with a lot of our producers and our growers and we form the link between the chef and the restaurant or the hotel or the contract caterer with the guys that grow the food for them. It’s really really important for us to help chefs understand where produce comes from.

Q: Sysco and FreshDirect they act as a portal for restaurants to acquire foods including fresh produce. What role does the company play in that?

A: For want of a better description we’re wholesalers. So we will source the product we will contract the product with growers and producers and we’ll then sell that on to the end user the chefs and the restaurants and the groups.

Q: How do growers and shippers work with the company to get new products out there and higher use of fresh produce?

A: They’ll work with our procurement team and they’ll work with my team and we also have a range team. So it’s a little bit convoluted but effectively the range team will decide what we sell and the procurement team will source what we sell. So it’s a two way street. Hopefully the good growers will come to us and say ‘hey I’ve got sprouting cauliflower. I’ve got purple sprouts kalettes or a new type of sweet potato’ whatever it might be. So we’re quite reliant on them but it’s also about us getting out with them to meet them get on the farms get in the greenhouses and see what they’re doing so then we can act as that bridge between the grower and the chef. We’re trying to form those bonds and it really helps chefs to be more in tune with their products and their seasonality and what goes into making the product rather than just a box of cauliflower turning up at the back door of the restaurant. They’ll understand if it’s snowing when it’s not supposed to be snowing and the products are not as good as they should be or if there’s rainstorms in Spain and they can’t get the product across. So that’s what we try to encourage is a better understanding of where produce comes from.

Q: It’s almost like you’re working with both sides to foster innovation in a certain sense. So does that come from the top down or the bottom up? And by that I mean do the chefs come up with what’s going to be new? Or do the customers decide ‘this is what I want’ and then that decides what should be grown?

A: It’s some and some because in the world of produce you can’t just go ‘I’d like a purple tomato go and grow it.’ It takes years and years and years and years of research. So we’re pretty reliant on field trials and trial varieties and stuff like that. It is tricky because it can take 10 or 15 years or more to develop a product so we’re pretty reliant on growers coming to us and saying ‘look I’ve got some amazing new tomatoes that are super sweet. It’s been 15 years in development.’ And then it’s our job to take that to the chef and say ‘look this is new. Can you use it? What do you think?’ And that’s always the hard bit because it’s breaking the cycle of what they already know but they’re always up for something new. It’s always an interesting thing for me because I’ll get chefs coming to us saying ‘hey what’s new?’ ‘Well actually nothing. It’s all been grown for thousands of years but you just haven’t used it yet.’ Everyone is getting a bit excited about purple sweet potatoes or Okinawa yams and they’ve been around forever. The Hawaiians use it for koi and stuff like that. Because of where it’s grown regionality and stuff I guess it’s not so easy to get those sorts of products over here. It’s like a tomatillo; I guess in the States a box of tomatillos is a couple of dollars but over here it’s £25 which is $40 for a box of tomatillos because we’ve got to import it. It’s not a native product. We can grow it over here but we can’t go in the size and scale that we’d want to use it. So it’s always a bit tricky.

Retail plays a part as well. We only work in foodservice but in general the retailers get the first bite of the cherry with anything new because the grower knows he’s going to get volume. So we can go to a big superstore like Tesco or Sainsbury’s or whatever and they know it’s going to hit 4000 5000 6000 shops. For us our largest restaurant group might be 600 restaurants and that’s really pushing it. So the retailers will generally get their first bite at it. But having said that where foodservice comes in is when the product may be a little bit too niche for your average consumer but chefs might love it.

Q: I was going to ask if the part the retailers play is that they say ‘this is what customers want right now this is what’s hot. This is what people want.’ But I do understand that there is a difference between what somebody is going to buy to cook with themselves and what a chef will use in their own recipes is not going to be the same. So there has to be that balance I would assume.

A: Yeah that’s right. Chefs would be a bit more experimental and I guess when you go out to eat in a restaurant you’re probably looking for a better experience; you’re looking for something you can’t get at home. So yeah we’ll all use carrots and we’ll all use cauliflower and we’ll all use broccoli but it might be that the consumer doesn’t necessarily want to buy something they’re not sure how to process or how to use at home. They’d rather get it done professionally by a chef in a restaurant.

Q: How does working with a company like yours help the operator ensure things like food safety and sustainability and availablity?

A: We’re very very big into sustainability and all that stuff. So we will vet the growers and the producers and the suppliers to make sure they’re accredited whether it be LEAF which is Linking Environment And Farming or British Red Tractor or Sedex which is Supplier Ethical Data Exchange to make sure they’re not using slave labor. There are a lot of checks and balances taking place.

It’s an interesting thing: in this country more and more and more pesticides are being taken away from growers and farmers which is potentially a good thing. They use a lot more natural systems but no farmer or grower really wants to grow unsustainably because most of these guys are family businesses and they want to pass it on to the next generation and the next generation and the next generation; a lot of growers are fourth fifth sixth generation farmers. So it’s in their interest to keep the soil healthy and to make sure they grow in a sustainable way. Otherwise they’ve got nothing to pass on. So we talk a lot about sustainability in this country and everywhere really but the majority of British growers have been doing it forever. It’s just natural to them but suddenly it’s a big buzzword and a watchword.

Q: Do you feel like sustainability is more important now than it used to be just because of the awareness? Now they have to answer to the consumer on social media and there’s more interaction between all the different players and their own customers.

A: There’s a lot more awareness about it. It’s always been a thing but what we’re seeing now is more social proof being required. In the old days we’d say ‘Yeah it’s sustainable’ and they’d go ‘oh great it’s sustainable.’ Now a lot of our customers go ‘Well how? Why? What makes it sustainable? What are they doing that’s different?’ That’s where you have to explain the picture. ‘This is what they’re doing: they’re using regenerative farming methods crop rotation and managing the soil in a better way.’ So I wouldn’t say it’s more important now; it’s always been important but it’s probably people a lot more aware about it now. And obviously the next generation Greta Thunberg and all that stuff they’re probably more aware than a good few years back. They’re going to be the guardians going forward. So yeah there’s much more awareness about it now particularly amongst the younger guys.

Q: What are some of the current food trends that are happening right now in the UK that you’ve seen?

A: There were a few really about guests in restaurants and I guess in retail: sustainable credentials is one that we’ve already mentioned; provenance is another so there’s a big move for UK products now more so than ever. We still have to use imports obviously we can’t grow lemons and oranges and pineapple in the UK but there’s a big move towards the UK in season and the story behind whether it’s British asparagus or British top fruit apples and pears or British grown brassicas.

That’s also driving the next trend which is seasonality. Because people are now looking at buying British more than ever before they’re getting more aware of seasonality. In this country you can get strawberries for 12 months of the year 365 days of the year but we don’t grow them 365 days a year in the UK. Now our season typically will be from March to October. So it’s trying to drive a little bit of that agenda and people are getting more aware. ‘Really should we be eating strawberries on Christmas Day?’ You can you can get them but they won’t taste very good because they’ll be flown in from Egypt and there’ll be pretty hard and white shouldered and big green flags and all the other stuff. So that’s definitely a trend.

Premiumization is another trend. It’s where people are upselling a bit. So they’re prepared to spend more in a restaurant but they want better quality for it. And that’s really been driven over here by the lockdowns that we’ve had through the pandemic in that people have probably had more time at home they’ve had more time to cook they’ve had more time to learn about food. Suddenly they’re realizing ‘Actually I could make spaghetti carbonara at home for £5 but I go to a restaurant and they’re trying to charge me £15 for one bowl.’ So now they want something a little better a little different a little more premium. That’s a really big trend that we’ve seen a lot of. Then also health vegan plant-based is huge. It’s not huge in terms of menu takeups; it still only makes up about 3 or 5% in the UK but it’s the noisiest bit. It’s the bit that people will Instagram about like ‘the amazing plant burger’ or ‘the most amazing vegan fish’ or whatever it might be. But that’s the bit that’s making the most noise and restaurants are having to rise to the challenge.

Q: That health trend is definitely something that I’ve seen in the last few years. I live in California so people here are generally trying to be healthy eaters and people are definitely more conscious than they used to be about their health and about what they’re eating. I’m not sure if that’s pandemic related but that might be part of it because over the last couple of years we’ve really had to pay attention to our own health in a way maybe we didn’t have to before. But it’s very interesting that you said that that doesn’t seem to be translating as much to restaurants. It seems like healthy eating may be more when people make it for themselves. Do they want something more decadent when they go off to a restaurant? Maybe going into a restaurant is almost like a cheat for them a little bit.

A: In general that’s right. I mean you don’t go to a restaurant for a salad that you can make at home and pay a lot more money for it. There is still a move towards healthy eating and it’s going to be pushed a little bit now because in April all of our menus in the UK are going to have to declare the calorie count on every dish and the nutritional information needs to be available how much fat how much salt how much sugar. So some restaurants get a bit nervous about that and they’re coming to us and saying ‘what have you got that’s good and fresh and healthy and vibrant that we can chat about rather than just a salad or just something plant-based?’ So there is a move towards it. It’s probably more of a domestic thing than a foodservice thing the healthy thing but it is definitely happening. But it’s some and some: you don’t go to a dirty burger restaurant if you’re health conscious; you might go to a plant-based restaurant or you might go to someone that’s got a good salad cart or whatever. But yeah it’s generally an indulgent experience.

Q: When you identify that people are being healthier for example or whatever trends there are how do you help the growers and producers stay ahead of that?

A: We work by default with a lot of healthy food producers because we’re working with people that grow plants and whe’re working with people that pull fish out of the sea. Plants and fish are two of the healthiest things you can eat. It’s our job in the middle I guess to translate that to the end user and give them menu solutions. We’re not teaching them how to cook because they’re all good chefs anyway but we might have access to more things than they would normally see in their day job because they’re in their kitchen they’re focused on what they’re doing with tunnel vision and they rely on guys like us. We do what we call food shows where we’ll bring the guys into our facility. We’ve got the seafood plant and the produce warehouse and then we’ll cook dishes with them. If the brief is ‘look healthy’ then it might be that there’s a lot of plant-based food on their market there’s a lot of produce on their market there’s a lot of simply cooked fish without heavy sauce on there. So that’s how we help to translate it because at that point we’re dealing with guys that have got the raw product so there’s not much more they can do to make it healthier. By nature it’s healthy. So it’s our bit to be in the middle to go ‘if you combine this fish which is high in omega-3s with this beetroot which is high in fiber and antioxidant and this carrot which is high in vitamin D.’ That’s the way we tend to do it.

Q: Is there a way that chefs and growers and producers should be working together to deliver that innovation to food? Are there things that they could be doing that they aren’t?

A: It’s a tricky one. I get challenged with this a lot and I’ve just helped a friend of mine write a thesis on this for a college dissertation. It’s probably fair to say a lot of growers are risk averse and I challenge them a lot with this because it’s like ‘we want to grow this same beetroot in the same volume that we’ve grown for years because we know we can make money out of it and we know we can sell it.’ When you go to them say ‘Okay can you go to some baby beetroots? Can you grow some candy striped beetroot? Can you do golden beetroot?’ they’re a bit hesitant because it’s like ‘we don’t know because it’s still fairly new.’ So it’s not going to be as much as you’d be growing before but take a chance. So we do try and push our guys to do that even if it’s setting a few fields aside to try new stuff. They want to try stuff but they are risk averse. I mean there’s very tight margins in produce and it’s tied up in the ground for a lot of time it’s in the ground for three months. As chefs we always want new stuff we want different stuff we want exciting stuff. But when you get to that point a lot of guys don’t want to commit to it. They don’t want to say I want new stuff and I’ll take 10 pallets a week off you. It’s like ‘I want new stuff but I don’t want any risk.’ So it is a challenge but we are always pushing our growers to try something different or tell us what’s different because we may not know.

Q: As you said earlier it can take but a decade to come up with a product so that’s a big investment for something you’re not really sure people are going to want. How do they deal with that? If they’ve done something for 10 years and they come up with a product and then they show and and people go ‘Oh I don’t really want that.’ What if the timing doesn’t work?

A: It happens. It’s true. Baby kale is a big thing now little baby kale leaves for salads; when they first came out people just didn’t understand it because it was three times the price of regular kale. and it took a long while for that to take off. But now it’s pretty mainstream and you see quite a lot. So it’s about keeping the faith that’s the thing and being prepared to take a chance on stuff. But as I said even if it’s trying stuff that already exists but growing it in the UK that is sometimes challenging. A good example of that is a few years ago I was working for a different produce supplier and we were constantly going to our beetroot grower saying ‘we’re bringing all this candy striped beetroot and golden beetroot from France every week. Why don’t you grow it?’ and they went ‘Oh no it’s a flash in the pan. It’s a gimmick it won’t last.’ And it went on for three years where we were still selling it and it was like ‘that’s money going to France not to your farm.’ And then it was ‘okay fine. And they started to grow it and then it’s like ‘actually yeah that was a good idea.’ It’s still a tiny proportion versus regular beetroot but they can command a premium for that because it’s slightly different.

There is a consensus that increasing produce consumption is important as a public health tool. Some look to varietal development to create more flavorful produce as a tool in this battle. Indeed this might work but it can take a long time. A full size pear tree can take six to nine years to begin yielding fruit and that might not be the variety that ultimately prevails. So to test varieties and plant and harvest from commercial scale orchards – it can take decades.

As a result the hope of increasing produce consumption depends heavily on culinary technique. Creating dishes that use more produce and that are made appetizing by cooking methods. The foodservice/catering sector is absolutely vital because they can introduce techniques and methods flavors and cuts that consumers will not only enjoy at restaurants but will look to emulate at home.

The basic challenge for the produce industry when it comes to boosting consumption is that our innovations have only tended to replace existing usage. So all the sudden kale becomes hot and consumption of kale increases ten fold – but all it means is that the steak that was served with a side of spinach now is served with a side of kale the spinach salad now becomes a kale salad. Total sales and total consumption of produce is unchanged. Only culinary change can alter consumption patterns. Instead of a giant steak with a little vegetable on the side you have to move people to say a stir fry rich in vegetables where a little meat is added to provide a certain flavor.

At this year’s edition of the London Produce Show and Conference we were super excited that Sysco and Fresh Direct stepped in to host a hospitality lounge on the floor and our Culinary Theatre helping to support a culinary team working to develop appealing and delicious produce centric recipes with the goal of using them to help boost consumption.

Ian’s thought leadership is another contribution to the industry and one for which we are grateful.

Come and engage with Ian and see the direction the culinary world can engage in to help us all move the needle on produce consumption.

That didn’t happen in the US for some reason. We’re now closing in on a month from launch and that first update is just hitting Verizon units.

A reader of ours pinged us after checking for an update and finding build S908USQU1AVC8 on his Galaxy S22 Ultra. If his Ultra is getting it the Galaxy S22 and S22+ should be getting a similar build only with S901 (S22) and S906 (S22+) at the front.

We don’t have a changelog yet from Verizon but again this should be similar to a day 1 update and it introduces the March 2022 security patch. I don’t believe this takes care of the throttling that Samsung thought you’d appreciate on your $1300 phone.

Once we get more details we’ll be sure to update this post. For now if you own a Galaxy S22 on Verizon head into Settings>Software update and then tap “Download and install.”

UPDATE 3/20: Alright Verizon has posted details and this is indeed the Game Booster anti-throttling update that Samsung was supposedly pushing out.

Verizon says the following about Game Booster Labs and settings so you can disable or enable for better performance:

A new option “Game Booster Labs” has been added under Game Booster settings. You can turn “Alternate game performance management” on for better gaming performance. When you enable “Alternate game performance management” “Game optimization” will be disabled. Alternate game performance management can be found under the Game Booster settings > Labs > Game Booster Labs > Alternate game performance management

For builds on each Galaxy S22 device we have the following:

Galaxy S22 Ultra : S908USQU1AVC8

: S908USQU1AVC8 Galaxy S22+ : S906USQU1AVC8

: S906USQU1AVC8 Galaxy S22: S901USQU1AVC8

A mask and a cap concealed her face though there was typically a wide grin underneath especially as the Mariners continued their late-season surge. On some nights she picked a spot on the lower concourse along the base lines to observe the speed of the game and mingle with season-ticket members. Others she was in the Diamond Club enjoying the fine dining before taking to an up-close seat behind home plate with the high rollers. For one weekend game she took in the T-Mobile 'Pen where the casual-fan crowd brought a happy-hour vibe to the standing-room beer garden beyond left-center field. But she also loved the nosebleeds for their sweeping views of the skyline and the playing surface panorama. She watched the game competition for sure but that objective was secondary. The intent behind her self-guided tours of T-Mobile Park after arriving in late August was to listen and observe -- and her purpose was so simplistic. What audience demographic sat in one portion of the ballpark versus another? How did their behavioral patterns differ as she meandered from one area to the next? What foods and beverages sold well here versus there? In which areas were fans watching the game more attentively versus casually? And at every inquiry a “why?” followed. For Catie Griggs the Mariners’ new president of business operations it all tied back to a basic analysis of addressing consumers’ needs and desires. What about the Mariners’ game-day product was good and what could be improved? To find out she believed she needed to immerse herself in the fan experience. “But also listen to the fans around me” Griggs said. “And I think that was really really illustrative in terms of what some of the different experiences were like. … Our fans want this team to win and all I can tell you is so do I.” *** When Griggs was hired in late July coming over from a similar role for Major League Soccer’s Atlanta United she became the only active female president in an MLB front office and the first in Mariners history. But she mostly shouldered that significance and preferred to be graded on accomplishing her goals over her gender. Like many in comparable roles across professional sports man or woman she put the highest premium on her team’s fans -- and she sought to immediately put her words into action.

Beyond her freestanding game-day adventures through the ballpark Griggs oversaw two town halls with Mariners fans following the regular season when passion was palpable and ambition for what’s next following a 90-win season was as high as it’s been in years. Behind the scenes Griggs spent this offseason examining process and function from both 30000-foot and microscopic views. Her credentials spoke for themselves in the eyes of John Stanton and Mariners ownership as did her references. But what stood out most was her intellect and long-term scope. Jerry Dipoto the team’s president of baseball operations has described Griggs as “one of the most forward-thinking people I’ve ever worked with.” For a sport presently challenged with growing its audience particularly among Gen Z and Gen Alpha Griggs is already pondering the possibilities of expanding the game and the Mariners’ brand by addressing every demographic. “This is not an experience that is exclusively to the domain of people who grew up playing know how to score keep anything like that” Griggs said. “Those people are incredibly important and core to what we're doing but we need to be bigger and broader than that.” *** The fanbase that Griggs inherited in Seattle is far different from the one she left in Atlanta. There a team was quite literally being built from the ground up debuting in 2017 and winning its first championship in 2018. Here an entire region salivates at success amidst the longest active playoff drought in American professional sports now at 20 years which naturally has been accompanied with pain and frustration -- including the resignation of former president and CEO Kevin Mather last February which created the opening that Griggs filled. As such there are naturally some believe-it-when-we-see-it skeptics when it comes to off-the-field Mariners hires correlating to on-field success.

“This community is passionate” Griggs said. “Sometimes we [the Mariners] may have given them fewer reasons to be engaged than others. But they care.” Winning typically cures all and while she won’t have a hand in baseball-related decisions -- Stanton has reiterated that is exclusively Dipoto’s realm -- Griggs does bring a track record of success. Atlanta United FC had a winning record in each of her first three seasons including the MLS Cup title in year two. Despite being a brand-new club it has led the MLS in average attendance by a mile in every season since its inception even amid pandemic-impacted restrictions in each of the past two years. When Griggs took over as chief business officer ATLUTD had a strong on-field product led by Josef Martinez who was the MLS MVP in 2018 and the newly opened Mercedes-Benz Stadium. But Griggs leveraged those natural lures to help build a brand that has elevated near the top of a sports region dominated by college football and the Braves. “What she's a master at is really creating the relationships across the board from all of the business leaders” said Georgia O’Donoghue who worked under Griggs at ATLUTD and has since been promoted to the role Griggs vacated. “She was able to really use the resources of the business in a smart way rather than saying ‘Oh we're just little Atlanta United over here on the side.’” In 2019 the Sports Business Awards named ATLUTD its Sports Team of the Year and Mercedes-Benz Stadium the Sports Facility of the Year. The club has also received honors from MLS including 2017 Marketing Team of the Year 2018 PR Team of the Year and 2018 Digital Team of the Year -- all of which fall under business ops. Every ATLUTD home event is also managed by that department and Griggs oversaw everything from the MLS All-Star Game in 2018 down to the pre-match emails that went out to ticket buyers. Griggs will have another All-Star Game to plan for at T-Mobile Park in 2023 one which she intends to make “a uniquely Seattle event highlighting the amazing people food and culture and baseball community that we all have here.”

O’Donoghue attested to Griggs’ ambition and execution for the All-Star Game they oversaw. “You want your branding and you want your season-ticket numbers to feel connected to it and you want you know the Atlanta United way to be shown and of course MLS wants it to be their way and the All-Star way” O’Donoghue said. “It's a hard thing to bridge and I think she did that very artfully.” Griggs also led multiple uniform redesigns or “kit launches” as part of directives from Adidas to continuously evolve the team’s look a more emblematic component of soccer culture and especially MLS. For example the Seattle Sounders go through a similar process regularly. No the Mariners aren’t changing uniforms tomorrow or perhaps ever. But in many of her peers’ eyes the kit launches underscored Griggs’ ability to advance a brand through something as simple as a new uniform yet as complicated as the possibility of compromising a look fans love. “What she's really good at is she’s able to make sure that people are connecting and people are sharing knowledge across and to build all that into one big strategy so everyone is working towards the same goal” said O’Donoghue who first met Griggs when they were at Turner Sports a decade ago. “In her mid-20s she was already the smartest person in the room. But you've sort of seen her evolve over time to really get better at that gravitas of ‘I'm not just the smartest person in the room but I can mold this room to get it where we need it to go. And I can develop the kumbaya moment that needs to happen to get all of the team on the same page.’” *** Griggs’ professional journey began when she graduated early and enrolled at North Carolina State University. She was 14 years old -- yes fourteen -- the age of most eighth graders though she skyrocketed through the required curriculum because she was on a far more aggressive and non-traditional timeline: Her own. Griggs was homeschooled in the Raleigh-Durham N.C. area beginning at age 11. Once she mastered a subject she moved on. If she was proficient in algebra in two months so be it; she then advanced to calculus and so on. Griggs jokes that one of her early-age character flaws was and remains impatience. “It's something where there was never anything that I felt was holding me back from continuing to learn and see what was next” Griggs recalled of her early education applying it to her logic of today. “So I'd say it's intellectual curiosity driven by ‘I don't see any reason to impose artificial constraints on how far I can go or frankly how far we can go.’” It was this stage of life in which her love for sports soared. Griggs played baseball and softball when she was younger -- “I'm really terrible at basketball for whatever reason” she jokes -- then she transitioned to soccer because there were more opportunities for girls. Griggs’ father regularly brought her and her brother and sister both younger to see the Durham Bulls one of Minor League Baseball’s most tradition-rich teams. And of course ACC basketball in that region is huge -- and Griggs found herself in the student section there sooner than most before she could legally drive. “She doesn't wear her intellect on her sleeve” said Sydney Finkelstein a professor of management at Dartmouth University’s Tuck School of Business. “She doesn’t show up other people. She doesn’t even think she's special in some ways. She's modest in that way; humble really which by the way is a very important criteria characteristic for a leader. I've studied leaders my whole career.”

Indeed Finkelstein is a consultant and speaker to senior executives around the globe as well as an author of 25 books on executive leadership. He taught Griggs when she was earning her MBA at Dartmouth where she’d already earned an undergrad degree after transferring from N.C. State at age 17. In between now with a degree in international relations she spent two years as a strategy consultant while fulfilling a lifelong dream of living in New York City -- not exactly the path to the top of an MLB front office. “I'm really interested in why people do what they do and how do you have an impact on the world around you” Griggs said. “And I think international relations was a sort of intellectual way to dig into that curiosity and how people have done at a really large scale in terms of how the different governments actually get along. I didn't graduate with a perspective of ‘I'm going to be the next president of a Major League Baseball team’ or even that I’d work in sports.” No that path manifested after Griggs took a job at Turner Sports immediately after earning her MBA. There she brokered multiple high-profile broadcast deals for the cable giant while climbing its business ladder. Then when a longtime mentor Simon Wardle called asking Griggs to launch his international consultancy’s first North American office she took a leap of faith by leaving a sea of co-workers at Turner to an island of one at Futures Sport and Entertainment. But that department grew quickly after Griggs helped land multiple blue-chip rightsholders. (Futures has since acquired MLB as a client after her departure thanks in part per Wardle to Griggs’ efforts). Her staff there burgeoned the projects took on more prominence and competitors took notice. She eventually left Futures for ATLUTD the exact same way she left ATLUTD for the Mariners -- a headhunter came calling with an offer too strong to ignore."

Take-Two Interactive isn’t leaving fans to wonder about which wrestlers are coming to its latest wrestling game. The publisher has confirmed the full lineup of characters coming to the game with an assortment that ranges from “why are they here?” to “why are they DLC and not on the base WWE 2K22 roster?”

Though the PlayStation and Xbox storefronts leaked some of the DLC wrestlers the six that were revealed are actually a cross-section of five DLC packs that will add 28 new playable characters to WWE 2K22. These packs will drop between April and July 2022. Here’s the full DLC schedule for WWE 2K22.

WWE 2K22 will receive five packs of DLC that will include wrestlers such as Ronda Rousey Cactus Jack Big Van Vader and Rob Van Dam. It will also feature three celebrities who have appeared on WWE programming in the past.

WWE 2K22’s DLC packs will be released between April and July 2022. Each one will boast either five or six wrestlers. A total of 28 new playable characters will be added to the roster.

Banzai Pack April 26

Omos

Kacy Catanzaro

Yokozuna

Umaga

Rikishi

The first batch arrives in April adding three superheavyweights from the past and two notable names still performing today. Omos was conspicuously absent from WWE 2K22’s base roster despite already having won gold in the WWE’s main roster. Kacy Catanzaro helps shore up an anemic women’s roster in WWE 2K22.

The centerpiece of the DLC pack is a trio of Anoa’i family members. Yokozuna was one of the top WWF wrestlers of the 1990s with his cousins Umaga and Rikishi both enjoying main event runs in the 2000s.

Most Wanted Pack May 17

Cactus Jack

Vader

The Boogeyman

Ilja Dragunov

Indi Hartwell

Two pro wrestling legends will be included in the Most Wanted Pack with Cactus Jack the deadliest face of Mick Foley joining the game alongside WCW and New Japan Pro Wrestling legend Vader.

As with Kacy Catanzaro in the original pack NXT wrestler Indi Hartwell adds another option to the women’s roster. NXT UK Champion Ilja Dragunov will also be joining the pack alongside novelty act The Boogeyman. Though The Boogeyman has been a frequent performer for the WWE this is actually only his third appearance in a game after WWE 2K Battlegrounds and WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2007.

Stand Back Pack June 7

Hurricane Helms

Stacy Keibler

A-Kid

Wes Lee

Nash Carter

While the first two packs had some highly influential figures things are decidedly more low-key for the Stand Back Pack that drops on June 7. Hurricane Helms headlines despite being a mid-card comedy act for most of his run while Stacy Keibler makes her first WWE console game appearance since 2006.

Past that are three NXT wrestlers. Wes Lee and Nash Carter had a strong run as NXT Tag Team Champions and A-Kid is another major player from NXT UK.

Clowning Around Pack June 28

Doink the Clown

Ronda Rousey

The British Bulldog

Mr. T

Doudrop

Rick Boogs

Despite having big names of both the past and present Doink the Clown got title treatment for the fourth scheduled WWE 2K22 DLC pack. Two other throwbacks are also included with The British Bulldog and Mr. T. The British Bulldog needs no introduction to fans who watched WWF in the 1990s while Mr. T famously wrestled in the main event of Wrestlemania 1.

He’s joined by three wrestlers who were inexplicably omitted from the WWE 2K22 base roster. Foremost among them is Ronda Rousey who may wind up main eventing Wrestlemania 2022. Rick Boogs has also been a steady presence on WWE TV of late alongside Shinsuke Nakamura while Doudrop has been getting prominent booking in the women’s division. It’s anyone’s guess as to why these three are being released as DLC rather than being included on the main WWE 2K22 roster list.

The Whole Dam Pack July 19

Rob Van Dam

Logan Paul

Xia Li

Machine Gun Kelly

LA Knight

Commander Azeez

The final DLC pack for WWE 2K22 boasts two celebrity appearances in Logan Paul and Machine Gun Kelly. Logan Paul has been prominently featured in major WWE shows over the last 12 months but Machine Gun Kelly has only made sporadic appearances. His lone instance of something similar to wrestling was when he was power bombed off the WWE entrance stage by Kevin Owens in 2015.

There are three relative newcomers to the WWE umbrella in Xia Li LA Knight and Commander Azeez.

WTTW Passport members can stream the next episode now. Recap the following episode and previous season.

Charlotte Heywood first came to Sanditon as the result of a happy accident when she helped the Parkers after their carriage lost a wheel. Now she is returning due to a tragedy: Sidney Parker her erstwhile lover has died of yellow fever in Antigua.

Sidney was the guardian of Charlotte’s heiress friend Georgiana Lambe; that guardianship has now transferred to his brother Tom who worries that Georgiana will never accept a suitor—she dismisses them all as substanceless and money-grubbing. Tom’s wife Mary suggests that Georgiana needs the company of a friend and so the Parker carriage once again brings Charlotte to the seaside town this time with her sister Alison in tow.

They are greeted by Tom Mary and Tom’s brother Arthur who is now Tom’s aide in developing Sanditon into a fashionable resort. (When Arthur returned to Sanditon without his sister Diana his hypochondria seemed to be cured. He suspects his new sense of purpose—helping his brother—is the cause.) The Parkers were surprised to hear Sidney was in Antigua; they have asked the agent gathering Sidney’s things to discover why he was there.

Tom is excited by the impending arrival in Sanditon of a company of soldiers whom he hopes will spend plenty of money thus helping him to repay Sidney’s wealthy widow Eliza who currently owns a large portion of Sanditon because Sidney covered Tom’s debts before his death.

Charlotte Alison and Georgiana go to tour the soldiers’ encampment and meet the officer in charge Colonel Lennox and his subordinate Captain Fraser. Lennox is taken by Charlotte and Alison encourages the connection—she wants to find husbands for both herself and Charlotte in Sanditon especially so that Charlotte isn’t trapped into a marriage with a dull farmer back home who is ready to propose. To that end Alison is eager for the soldier’s parade the next day and wants to look her best—her idea of romance is drawn from books.

At the parade Charlotte is reacquainted with Lady Denham and her niece Esther who is visiting while her new husband Lord Babington is away. Esther is recovering from a miscarriage and was told that trying to have another baby could be fatal but she is determined to give Babington an heir and hopes the sea air will cure her. She lies in a letter to Babington that Sanditon’s Dr. Fuchs is confident about her prospects. She’s also shocked to note that her scheming stepbrother Edward is amongst the company of soldiers.

Lady Denham is as ever brutally candid in her interactions including in her dismissal of a sugar boycott initiated by Georgiana and proselytized by her chaperones the Hankinses in order to press for the abolition of slavery in overseas territories.

Georgiana and Arthur avoid the parade as does the eccentric artist Charles Lockhart a new resident of Sanditon. Arthur and Charles dislike the military but Charles does find Georgiana intriguing especially when she openly disdains his pride and earnestness. Arthur whom Georgiana takes as a model of a possible husband smiles.

As the soldiers pass a little boy dashes after them and falls into the street. Charlotte saves the child from trampling by a horse and takes him and his older companion to the Parkers to dress a cut shin. Turns out the boy “Leo” is actually Leonora and her companion is her brooding cousin Augusta Markham. Charlotte accompanies them home to a wealthy estate where she learns that a governess is needed for the motherless girls.

They don’t get along with each other and are rude to Charlotte. Augusta hates living with her uncle Leonora’s father at the estate. Charlotte learns from the Parkers that his name is Alexander Colbourne. Tom calls him a recluse and miser always obstructing Tom’s attempts to improve Sanditon. He withdrew from society after the death of his wife.

Colonel Lennox stops in to the Parkers’ to make sure that Leonora is okay and stays for tea. Alison works overtime to commend Charlotte to him leading Charlotte to suddenly excuse herself and leave. She goes to church and lights a candle for Sidney. When she returns Alison apologizes; she does understand that Charlotte is still in love with Sidney but wants to help her move on. Charlotte explains that she has realized that she never wants to be under a man’s power—and so she will not get married. Instead to the horror of her sister and Mary and the disappointment of Georgiana she will become a governess to make her own living.

She returns to the Colbourne estate to interview with Alexander who quickly quizzes her on her accomplishments but argues against her intention to thoroughly educate his daughter and niece. I know what happens to women who don’t meet society’s expectations he says. Charlotte walks out telling him that if he doesn’t want his charges to become learned and independent than she’s not the woman for the job. He eventually rides after her gives her the job and rides away.

Alison also has a dramatic encounter. Georgiana takes a would-be suitor’s carriage for a ride along the beach with Alison circling a group of soldiers. But a wheel breaks sending the young women to the sand. Alison opens her eyes to a dashing soldier Captain William Carter bending over her to her delight.

A less pleasant encounter occurs between Edward and Esther when he comes to visit Lady Denham who warns him to keep his distance especially from Esther. Esther herself dismisses Edward and he promises to stay away. But despite his claim to Lady Denham that his appearance in Sanditon is a coincidence he was the one to suggest it as a location to Colonel Lennox and he’s already racking up gambling debts. Esther fears that Lady Denham will fall for Edward’s charm and extends her stay.

More surprising news reaches the Parkers. Sidney wasn’t in Antigua on his own affairs. He was there on behalf of Georgiana.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2dhbWVyc29ubGluZS5jb20vZ2FtZXMvcmFjaW5nL2dyYW4tdHVyaXNtby03LXVwZGF0ZS1kcmF3cy1iYWNrbGFzaC1mcm9tLWZhbnMv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3BvcnRzZ2FtZXJzb25saW5lLmNvbS9nYW1lcy9yYWNpbmcvZ3Jhbi10dXJpc21vLTctdXBkYXRlLWRyYXdzLWJhY2tsYXNoLWZyb20tZmFucy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gran Turismo 7 Update Draws Backlash From Fans,"The latest update to Gran Turismo 7 has arrived. It addresses a variety of quality of life issues and online play. The update also adds broadcast mode. However it has not been received well by fans. The update seemingly puts players at a precipice of participating in a time-consuming grind or using microtransactions.

Gran Turismo 7 in Hot Water

Credits are the in-game currency of Gran Turismo 7. Players earn credits by participating in races. You can utilize the credits to buy other vehicles cosmetics or purchases parts to maximize the potential of a vehicle. You can also purchase credits by using real-world cash.

In the new update however the number of credits players earn by completing races has been drastically reduced.

In some cases the credits received have been reduced by half. As a Reddit thread details races like Fisherman’s Ranch have dropped from paying 65k credits to 30k credits; Goodwood’s payout has fallen from 35k to 12k and Suzuka Circuit has been lowered from 75k to 50k.

It doesn’t seem to be anomalous either. Players have noted at least 24 races paying significantly less than they did before the update.

For collectors the grind will be more tedious than before. They will have to spend even longer grinding races to be able to purchases legendary vehicles. As a result this will push players to utilize microtransactions.

This does not bode well for the long-standing racing franchise. Players have historically been against microtransactions of any kind or at least forced ones. There was little information to suggest that credit payouts needed to be modified. Most fans felt the grind was challenging enough to earn top-of-the-line cars.

The GT7 subreddit has been fervently against the sudden push for microtransactions. Polyphony the GT7 development team has not responded to the backlash the update has received.

Let us know how you’re feeling below about the changes in Gran Turismo 7.

Since its inception the certificate program has invited multiple professionals to New College for “campus conversations” giving career-driven students a firsthand glimpse of what leadership looks like.

“Our leadership certificate offers students the ability to connect with varying levels of leadership on an intimate basis” said Patricia Courtois one of New College’s Professionals in Residence and the head instructor and coordinator of the certificate program. “The lessons learned through those dialogues can be applied not only during their time at New College but also as they begin to explore potential career paths and engage in the community after they graduate.”

Courtois knew Cornell would be an ideal speaker for the program having worked with him in the mid-1990s at Tropicana. During the conversation at New College Cornell shared details about his background—including how he worked toward an undergraduate degree in political science at UCLA ultimately deciding against a career in law to pursue leadership positions in consumer-packaged goods and retail. Those choices ultimately led him to his position as CEO of Target in 2014.

“We talked about what he wanted to maintain as a culture at Target when he first joined—one of community engagement and support—and how he and his leadership team would build upon that with higher wages benefits and overall team culture” Courtois said. “Having that culture in place allowed Target to continue to serve the community during the pandemic with team members who felt valued.”

Cornell said that he placed priority on the welfare of the internal team over shareholders which was unpopular on Wall Street (but it proved to be a competitive advantage during the pandemic with Target reaching record earnings). Cornell also spent time answering student questions some of which directly challenged the earnings gap as well as unionization.

“We want to make sure that people in leadership roles are getting to share their wisdom with New College students. We have tons of student leaders on campus that can benefit from this type of mentorship and from learning about how to be strategic when leading” said Lisandra Jimenez an assistant director and career coach for the CEO. “Brian’s talk provided a glimpse into what it’s like to run a business as large as Target.”

Target currently has more than 1900 stores covering all 50 American states with a team of 350000-plus employees. Prior to joining Target Cornell spent upwards of 30 years in escalating leadership positions at leading retail and consumer-product companies.

Similarly Courtois is a seasoned professional who has spent more than four decades leading communications and corporate philanthropy efforts for companies and brands such as Beatrice Foods Company Sara Lee Corporation Tropicana Sweet’n Low Butter Buds Sugar in the Raw and ClosetMaid.

Courtois’ ability to teach students about leadership—and to bring in experts like Cornell—gives students at New College a major competitive edge. Students who aim to earn the Certificate in Leadership participate in four 90-minute workshops in a given semester (led by Courtois and guest facilitators) and participate in a practical experience such as an internship or research project. During this process students from all areas of concentration gain the skills and insights needed to make a meaningful impact in the world.

Dwayne Peterson the executive director for career education at New College said that all of the College’s students have the capacity to become leaders; they just need the optimal tools.

“We could argue that all New College students are leaders. But part of this certificate program is about trying to bring out and practice the leadership ability that lives in each New College student” Peterson said. “Our students are collecting leadership approaches through these experiences and really figuring out how to develop their own approaches that will serve them in their careers.”

Sheldon Whitehouse violates federal STOCK Act,"Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse a Democrat from Rhode Island is the latest member of Congress to violate the disclosure requirements of the federal Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012 a law meant to defend against conflicts of interest and enhance public transparency.

The senator from Rhode Island bought stock in late January but didn't report it until mid-March a couple days late.

Congress is debating whether to ban federal lawmakers from trading stocks at all.

58 members of Congress have now been found in violation of the STOCK Act since 2021.

Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island has violated a conflicts-of-interest law by disclosing two personal stock purchases past a federal deadline according to financial records reviewed by Insider.

On January 28 Whitehouse purchased between $15000 and $50000 worth of shares in both Target Corporation and Tesla Inc.

Whitehouse's office acknowledged that the senator disclosed his trades on March 16 — after a federally mandated 45-day filing deadline.

""The filing came two days late due to a staff transition in the office"" Whitehouse spokesman Rich Davidson told Insider.

Whitehouse in his third term is a member of the Senate Committee on Environmental and Public Works which has jurisdiction over air pollution and environmental policy matters among others. Davidson did not reply to a question about whether Whitehouse's investment in Tesla which manufactures electric vehicles and solar panels represents a conflict of interest.

Lawmakers who are late disclosing their stock trades — dozens have been tardy in recent months — face a $200 fine for an initial offense.

But Whitehouse won't pay a penalty because the US Senate Select Committee on Ethics which administers financial disclosure fines allows violators a fine-free ""grace period"" so long as they disclose their stock trades no more than 30-days late. The committee may also choose to waive even later disclosures although it's unclear how often they do this because the committee does not report this information publicly.

Other members of the US Senate that Insider and other news organizations have found in violation of the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act's disclosure requirements include Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California Republican Tommy Tuberville of Alabama Republican Roger Marshall of Kansas Republican Rand Paul of Kentucky Democrat Mark Kelly of Arizona and Republican Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming.

""First and foremost it is critical for lawmakers to comply with these reporting deadlines because it is the law"" said Dylan Hedtler-Gaudette government affairs manager for nonpartisan watchdog group Project on Government Oversight. ""In other words by not fully complying they are breaking the law. And this is to put it mildly not a good look.""

Movement to ban congressional stock trading

Whitehouse's late disclosures come at a time when Congress is debating whether to ban federal lawmakers and potentially their immediate family members from trading individual stocks.

A Committee on House Administration hearing on the matter — delayed because Chairperson Zoe Lofgren contracted COVID-19 — is imminent and dozens of lawmakers have sponsored or co-sponsored any of several similar stock-ban bills.







Lawmakers' interest in pursuing stock trading reforms deepened after Insider's ""Conflicted Congress"" project in December found that dozens of lawmakers and at least 182 senior congressional staffers had failed to comply with the reporting requirements of the STOCK Act.

""Conflicted Congress"" also found numerous examples of conflicts of interest including that four members of Congress or their spouses have either currently or recently invested money in Russian companies at a time when Russia has invaded Ukraine.

At least 18 members of Congress — Whitehouse among them — have investments in at least one of two defense contractors Lockheed Martin and Raytheon who manufacture missiles Western nations are shipping to Ukraine's military.

Whitehouse ""supports a ban and is working with proponents of multiple bills to reach a unified caucus position"" Davidson said adding that the senator does not personally trade stocks but has a financial account manager do so on his behalf without the senator's consultation.

""I don't decide on neither am I even informed of trades that are made in my account"" Whitehouse told Politico in 2017.

Whitehouse has not however created what's known as a ""qualified blind trust"" — a formal publicly disclosed arrangement requiring congressional approval in which a lawmaker officially transfers management of their financial assets to an independent trustee. Senate guidance says these trusts provide the ""most comprehensive approach"" to avoiding ""potential conflicts of interest or the appearance of such conflicts"" although they can be expensive and time-consuming to establish.

No matter who does the stock trading members of Congress are personally responsible for publicly disclosing their stock trades on time. All members of Congress also undergo ethics training about federal reporting requirements.

""By continually giving the finger to reporting requirements related to their stock transactions members are telling the public — their constituents — that they don't care about what the public thinks"" Hedtler-Gaudette said. ""That is both deeply cynical and deeply troubling since members of Congress are at the end of the day public servants.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YWJyb2VrbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy8yMC9uZXdzL2d1eWFuYS9hbGJpb24tc3VycGFzc2VzLXdlZWtseS1zdWdhci1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLXRhcmdldC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Albion surpasses weekly sugar production target,"For the first time for the year the Albion/Port Mourant Estate has surpassed its weekly sugar production target according to the Guyana Sugar Corporation (GuySuCo).

In a statement GuySuCo said the estate exceeded its target for the week ending March 19 by 7.9%. “This was the first weekly target surpassed for the year 2022 in the sugar sector” it said while noting that as a result of the achievement qualified workers (who worked 80% or more days available for the week) will benefit from an additional day’s pay tax free.

According to GuySuCo despite the challenges posed by the intermittent rainfall which was measured at almost 30 mm during the past week and stalled the estate’s mechanical harvesting operations Albion was able to leverage the improved cane quality better harvesters’ attendance and increased human productivity on the fields to push past the weekly target.

The statement noted that at the commencement of the first crop GuySuco introduced an improved Personal Performance Incentive (PPI) Scheme which has seen a positive response from cane harvesters in the way of improved attendance and productivity.

The PPI rewards each worker progressively as they improve their productivity. The Corporation has also implemented a similar incentive scheme for the Planters fertilising crew and chemical weed control workers.

The statement noted that the Weekly Production Incentive (WPI) is one of several initiatives in place to boost employees’ productivity and was implemented on May 13 1989. The payment of a WPI is based on the individual estate’s achievement of one hundred percent (100%) or more of its weekly sugar production target.

The letter reveals that customers who place one or more cumulative orders to purchase multiple Tesla vehicles need to sign the “No resale commitment letter”. The letter forces customers to promise not to resell to a third party within one year. Violators will pay a penalty of 20% of the vehicle’s original fee. According to a Tesla staff this move is to prevent scalpers from reselling the car after booking in advance. However Tesla’s customer service as well as sales staff claims that they know nothing about the “No resale commitment letter”.

The “No Resale Commitment Letter” is a preventive measure against the recent phenomenon of individuals purchasing multiple Teslas at one time on the official website. The purpose is to maintain a fair and transparent car buying experience for the majority of consumers. This also truly protects the rights and interests of consumers. Therefore it will not cause any impact on the normal car purchase and overall experience of ordinary consumers.

Tesla has raised prices three times in a week in a row and all models of Model 3 and Model Y have raised prices.

Us neither but regardless we now have an answer thanks to Armormax. Taking a stock Model S Plaid the specialist firm added bulletproof windows as well as reinforced struts and body panels throughout.

You wouldn't be able to tell the car was armored at first glance however taking a look inside reveals thick windows and various other minor giveaways. The doors themselves are also heavier unsurprisingly however they are still easy to open and close.

YouTuber Ben Hardy was given a chance to take the armored Plaid for a drive and found performance was barely impacted by the extra weight. Autopilot worked as usual too.

All in all around 300 lbs (136 kg) of armor was added. Considering the Plaid weighs 4828 lbs (2189 kg) to begin with that's not a lot in the grand scheme of things. Hence Ben concluded that he couldn't tell the difference between the armored Plaid and the regular version.

So how much would it set you back to coat your Plaid in bullet-resistant armor? Well according to Armormax prices vary depending on individual specification although their website states the average package costs around $60000 on top of the price of the vehicle. Therefore the Plaid in the video is probably worth at least $200000.

Magdeburg in former East Germany is famous for its towering gothic cathedral and not a lot else. It's now about to play a key role in U.S. and European efforts to tilt the global balance of power.

Intel Corp. unveiled plans on March 15 to build a giant $18.7 billion factory making cutting-edge semiconductors in the city adding to new plants in Arizona and Ohio the company announced over the past six months.

They are part of Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger's plan to wrest control of production from Asia and tackle the global shortage of chips exacerbated during the Covid-19 pandemic and exposed again following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""The situation reinforces why we're doing this project and the need for globally resilient and balanced supply chain"" Gelsinger said after revealing the Magdeburg site.

His ambition is one that the U.S. and European Union are promising to back with a combined $100 billion in a subsidy race to reduce reliance on imports just as China plans to turn itself into a chip powerhouse. Behind closed doors though some people in the industry are getting increasingly concerned that the push to make the West more competitive might backfire.

Their worry is not only that the money will be too little too late but the political strings attached to the aid may complicate global supply chains further. Different parts of the planet will compete to secure supplies while championing domestic plants that can't yet fill the void.

The dearth of semiconductors has brought some car manufacturing to a halt and delayed shipments of game consoles and smartphones waking Washington and Brussels up to the fact that their continents are dependent on a handful of regions for the key parts. The most notable is Taiwan a geopolitical hotspot because of historically tense relations with China and one whose vulnerability is under more scrutiny since Russia's invasion of its smaller neighbor.

Yet however dysfunctional it may look at the moment the supply chain is global and fully integrated. Unpicking it could carry greater risks said Rudi De Winter CEO of German chip maker X-Fab Silicon Foundries.

The semiconductor industry ""is a very global business and it has done well being a global business"" he said. ""This whole trend of trying to make things sovereign in every region and having its own supply chain is rather driven by politics and not by the semiconductor industry.""

Russia which has been sanctioned by the U.S. and Europe now is a clear example of how semiconductors have become increasingly important political tools. The items were some of the first goods that Washington and Brussels targeted to cut Russia off from the global economy and they've continually threatened more action. Manufacturing of cars in Russia for example has already been hit.

On the flip side Russia and Ukraine export palladium and neon used to make semiconductors though chipmakers have downplayed the potential impact.

U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said in an interview on March 9 that if Chinese companies defy U.S. restrictions against exporting to Russia Washington could shut down companies by cutting them off from the American equipment and software they need.

Semiconductors and other high-tech are becoming ""weaponized"" with the current trade wars and supply chain issues said Rafael Laguna de la Vera CEO of SPRIN-D Germany's federal agency for disruptive innovation. ""This is why regions need to invest into high tech to get resilient"" he said.

The U.S. and Europe want to claw back their share of the chip market after collapses in recent decades. The U.S. accounted for nearly 40% of the world's silicon wafer production in the 1990s while the EU accounted for more than 20% according to figures cited by Washington and Brussels. The U.S. is now below 15% and the EU has about 10%.

In an effort to shift production away from Asia President Joe Biden plans to put $52 billion into domestic semiconductor research development and production as part of its broad China competition bill though it is still awaiting approval. The EU's 27 member states meanwhile are only just scrutinizing the European Commission's recent proposal worth $48 billion to build up the bloc's chip capacity.

China has already been spending what could amount to $150 billion by 2030 to jumpstart production. The country is still far behind especially when it comes to advanced chip making but it's catching up quickly.

""We're laser-focused on revitalizing America's semiconductor industry"" Raimondo said at Intel's new site in Ohio in January. ""Semiconductors are the essential building blocks of our modern economy.""

Some members of Congress though want to see the taxpayer funds attached to guardrails that prevent companies from using the money to invest in China while Intel at one point lobbied against the taxpayer funds going to firms headquartered abroad.

In the past things were simple for chip producers said Kurt Sievers CEO of Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors. Companies ""could just choose production locations and R&D locations wherever you wanted"" he said. ""But I think we just have to stay realistic: Maybe these times are over. Now we are dealing with the world as it is going to evolve.""

Intel CEO Gelsinger is a major force behind government investment in new plants. Despite the naysayers he believes public funding could help Intel lower the cost of trying to catch up on cutting-edge chips after falling behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. known as TSMC and South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. It would also make the U.S. and Europe more self-reliant.

""Let's not waste this crisis"" Gelsinger told Bloomberg earlier this year. ""It's good economics but it's also national security."" Intel's new plant in Magdeburg which will start production in 2027 is part of an 80 billion-euro package of investment in Europe by the Californian company.

Whether the numbers stack up remains to be seen. The U.S. and Europe have some serious catching up to do said SPRIN-D's de la Vera. Japan for example is also promising state aid to boost production. New facilities include a $7 billion factory planned by TSMC in conjunction with Sony and Denso Corp.

South Korea also wants to become the world's biggest chip producer with companies and the government pouring a total $450 billion into the industry by 2030.

Achieving economies of scale that can compete with Taiwan's business model is also going to be tough if each region is racing to build its own capacity. TSMC accounts for more than 50% of the global foundry market or the business of purely making chips for other companies. Its customers include Apple Inc. which relies on Taiwanese chips for iPhones.

Indeed the reliance on TSMC is the core concern: an invasion of the island by China would leave the world's most advanced chips in the hands of Beijing. U.S. academic Jared McKinney recently suggested in a U.S. Army journal that Taiwan should protect itself by threatening to destroy chipmaking facilities so that Beijing would see its tech industry ""immobilized"" should it invade. He called it a ""broken nest"" strategy.

TSMC will have a new U.S. location operating in Arizona in two years and is now mulling a potential plant in Germany after European carmakers repeatedly expressed concerns about the impact from the chip shortage. But Taiwanese industry insiders remain skeptical of plans to relocate production back to the West.

""It's not possible to turn back the clock"" TSMC founder Morris Chang told a Taiwanese tech association in October. ""If you want to re-establish a complete semiconductor supply chain in the United States you will not find it to be a possible task even after you spend hundreds of billions of dollars.""

The federal money on the table is just a fraction of what the U.S. industry needs. And some executives are already wary of how governments are asserting themselves by slapping down mergers limiting exports or banning working with industry partners.

The most recent example was Germany's nixing of Taiwanese company GlobalWafer's takeover of German rival Siltronic earlier this year. Industry officials say the move showed the West is turning inward when governments should develop stronger alliances with Asia.

The White House has quietly moved to stop Dutch company ASML Holding NV from exporting its cutting-edge equipment to China. ASML has an effective monopoly on advanced extreme ultraviolet lithography machines used by companies like TSMC.

The Trump administration began pressuring the Dutch government as early as 2018 not to authorize the sale of ASML's EUV machines to China according to people familiar with the talks. That pressure has escalated under Biden with officials considering pushing the Dutch government to put in writing the de-facto export ban according to people familiar with the internal deliberations.

The company has become increasingly frustrated with the intervention of the U.S. which is also debating whether to ask the Dutch to ban ASML from selling its mature deep ultraviolet lithography systems to China. ""Any suggestion by any country to limit the shipment of the production equipment for mature technology to areas of the world where that technology is being produced is not a good idea"" said ASML CEO Peter Wennink. ""We should not do that.""

The U.S. and Europe will discuss their strategies on semiconductors as part of the Trade and Technology Council but there's still a long way to go to figure out if and how to coordinate government aid in the most strategic ways. A U.S. official said they want to avoid a subsidies arms race though a lingering mistrust from the Donald Trump years has made the EU wary.

While American eyes are on China the EU plans to add strings to subsidies that would ensure the bloc has the essential components in times of emergencies. These ideas follow lessons from the pandemic when the U.S. and U.K. had quicker access to vaccines. EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton has said the U.S.'s Defense Production Act was a source of inspiration for the ""security of supply"" proposals.

The plans are not protectionist nor are they seeking to make Europe completely autonomous he said. Instead they give the EU leverage to compete. ""That's the new geopolitics of supply chains"" Breton said.

There's no shortage of skepticism considering the EU tried to double production nearly 10 years ago and failed. Now the overall goal is for Europe to make 20% of the world's semiconductors by 2030. With global demand expected to as much as double in practice that means quadrupling Europe's production within eight years.

This time the EU opened the door to providing public money for production of chips - a massive shift. But many companies in the region question whether the bloc should be placing so much weight on making the next generation of chips rather than the less advanced more ""mature"" chips currently in shortage.

NXP CEO Sievers said the bloc should focus on providing first what the industry needs now. ""Right away leapfrogging to leading edge only I think would be missing the beat of what the European industry needs in the next couple of years"" he said.

Whatever type of chips end up being produced industry insiders expect the U.S. and Europe will always be dependent on Asia for their materials not least because of the global intricacies of supplies.

TSMC Chairman Mark Liu highlighted the connectivity in December saying that some semiconductor chemicals required by Intel are shipped to the U.S. by Taiwanese suppliers. In other words even American-made products rely on the outside world.

That's what makes the plans by Washington and Brussels so unrealistic said Jan-Peter Kleinhans a researcher at the German thinktank Stiftung Neue Verantwortung in Berlin.

There's also the risk of exacerbating shortages if you have politicians telling companies to prioritize certain chips for certain regions Kleinhans said. ""Suddenly it's not up to the market anymore"" he said. Governments aren't chip buyers or chip makers. ""It's really 20th century policy tools applied to a 21st century value chain.""

Direct air capture (DAC) sounds too good to be true. Humanity is threatened by an excess of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere so build a giant DAC machine that can remove it.

By the numbers ▸ 415 ppm 2022 Atmospheric CO 2 concentration in 2022 ▸ 280 ppm Atmospheric CO 2 concentration in 1850 ▸ 1080 Gta CO 2 added to the air since the start of the Industrial Revolution ▸ 36.3 Gt per year Ongoing global greenhouse gas emissions ▸ 1.3–29 Gt per year Estimated hard-to-abate greenhouse gas emissions ▸ 10000 t per year Estimated current direct-air-capture (DAC) capacity ▸ $300 to $400 per metric ton Cost of DAC credits for large corporate buyers Sources: CDR Primer South Pole Carbon Engineering Lux Research International Energy Agency. a gigatons equivalent to a billion metric tons.

And it can be done. Right now in Iceland a plant built by the DAC start-up Climeworks is pulling CO 2 out of the air at a rate of about 4000 metric tons (t) per year and pumping it deep underground. The CO 2 reacts with basalt rock there to form stable carbonate minerals. The plant named Orca runs on low-carbon geothermal electricity and waste heat so it is by all accounts a carbon-negative process.

But DAC is expensive and energy intensive. Critics of DAC say that other forms of carbon removal are cheaper and that reducing emissions in the first place will always be a better investment in the fight against climate change. So the question isn’t if DAC works; it’s if DAC makes economic sense. There’s a lot riding on the answer.

In an influential report in 2018 the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that humanity can keep global warming below 1.5 °C and dodge the worst consequences of climate change if we can reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

The strategies for getting there fall into two buckets: emission reduction and carbon removal. Emission reduction is anything that results in less CO 2 being released including point-source carbon capture improved energy efficiency electrification renewable energy regenerative agriculture and forest management and reengineering of industrial processes. Carbon removal is anything that pulls CO 2 out of the air including nature-based methods such as planting trees and technologies such as DAC.

Though the two approaches sometimes compete for investment and for buyers of the emissions-offset credits they create many experts say both will be needed. Marcius Extavour vice president for energy and climate at the XPrize Foundation says the IPCC report and its follow-ups lay out the need clearly. “If we want to avoid warming beyond 1.5 °C every scenario is going to require some kind of carbon removal in addition to reducing emissions immediately and as fast as possible.”

Even within the area of carbon removal DAC has competition from other methods most of which are lower cost. “In the nature-based solutions community they say ‘It’s a no-brainer. We’re the cheapest or the most abundant’ ” Extavour says. At the same time he adds many people in DAC “think direct air capture is the only thing that’s really scalable.”

Extavour is leading the Carbon Removal XPrize a competition that will award $100 million to groups developing DAC and other carbon removal methods. Eighty million of that will be split between up to four teams that demonstrate systems that remove 1000 t of CO 2 per year and present a clear techno-economic path to expanding to a megaton scale. On April 22 Earth Day XPrize will announce 15 contestants that will receive $1 million each in milestone funding to develop their concepts.

DAC has a lot in common with point-source carbon capture in which CO 2 is scrubbed from the flue gas of power plants or other industrial facilities. But the two address very different markets and needs according to Thomas McDonald the former CEO of Mosaic Materials. Mosaic has developed CO 2 sorbent materials based on metal-organic frameworks for both DAC and point-source carbon capture.

Applied to combustion power plants McDonald says point-source carbon capture can result in clean electricity that competes with renewable and nuclear power. It can also handle process emissions such as the CO 2 produced by yeast during ethanol fermentation or by refineries and chemical plants.

DAC comes into play to deal with CO 2 emissions that are unavoidable and can’t be captured with point-source methods such as those from aviation. It’s also necessary to remediate historical greenhouse gas emissions—the CO 2 the world has been spewing for the past 100-plus years.

Exactly what emissions can and can’t be avoided is the subject of some debate. “There’s going to be a fight across the economy for every sector to be considered hard to abate so they don’t have to change” says John Noël a senior climate campaigner at the environmental nonprofit Greenpeace.

The CDR Primer a digital textbook about carbon dioxide removal published in 2021 by a team from the University of Pennsylvania estimates truly hard-to-abate emissions at 1.5–3.1 gigatons (Gt) of CO 2 per year. That number assumes that the electricity and industrial sectors can be completely decarbonized. It thus includes only some shipping aviation and heating CO 2  along with emissions of nitrous oxide—a greenhouse gas more potent than CO 2 —from agriculture wastewater and landfills.

Other estimates classify some emissions from power and manufacturing as hard to abate including those from the chemical industry. They range from 5 to 29 Gt per year.

According to the International Energy Agency an intergovernmental organization 19 DAC plants including Orca currently operate for a total capacity of roughly 10000 t per year. Most are pilot-scale facilities built to develop the technology rather than to capture a meaningful amount of CO 2 ; several are not even net negative in carbon.

DAC companies are developing two basic business models: sequester the CO 2 underground and sell credits to companies looking to offset their emissions or sell the CO 2 to companies that can use it.

We want to remove our emissions today. And this means we must limit our investment in direct air capture where plants are still under construction. Mario Tuthorn marketing manager Thermo Fischer Scientific inorganic mass spectrometry group

The aviation industry is one hoped-for customer for CO 2 from DAC. Carbon dioxide can be combined with hydrogen to produce hydrocarbons such as kerosene-type jet fuel though that technology is also not yet at commercial scale.

“Direct air capture is an essential step to decarbonization in the sense that it should be in the longer term the only way to produce synthetic kerosene” says Matteo Mirolo sustainable aviation policy officer at the nonprofit Transport and Environment. Flying all European Union–originating flights on such “e-kerosene” would consume 365 million t of captured CO2 per year Mirolo says.

Climeworks is bullish on fuels derived from captured CO 2 . It’s part of a consortium called Norsk e-Fuel that recently announced plans for a plant in Norway that it expects to produce 25 million L of jet fuel per year from DAC CO 2 and renewable electricity.

But critics say better options will be available to decarbonize jet fuel too. Biomass-derived fuels can in principle be carbon negative if plants use waste biomass and are fitted with carbon capture. The biofuel company Gevo for example has aviation fuel partnerships with Archer Daniels Midland Chevron and Delta Air Lines. And Strategic Biofuels is working with regulators on an injection site in Louisiana for a jet fuel project consuming forestry waste.

Other DAC firms are racing to join Climeworks in having steel in the ground. Carbon Engineering is working with Oxy Low Carbon Ventures a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum on megaton-scale DAC plants in Norway and Texas. Carbon Engineering’s system uses a set of calcium-chemistry “loops” to isolate the CO 2 it catches using a potassium hydroxide solution.

The firm’s Norwegian plant will inject its CO 2 underneath the ocean floor. Oxy will use the Texas plant’s CO 2 to push more oil and gas out of depleted wells a practice called enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Global Thermostat with backing from ExxonMobil and the US Department of Energy is working on both EOR and ways to use captured CO 2 as a feedstock for fuels and plastics.

Greenpeace’s Noël calls using captured CO 2 to extract more oil a “joke” and warns that partnering with the oil and gas industry is a dangerous path. “It is a Trojan horse for these companies to maintain their access and influence over climate policy and design and implementation going forward at the state federal and global level” he says.

At the same time EOR operators are willing to pay some of the highest prices for CO 2  and DAC needs customers in order to grow.

Former Carbon Engineering CEO Steve Oldham who left the firm in January says EOR from DAC can be carbon neutral. But the firm is also looking at e-fuels and pure sequestration. “DAC is fundamentally a service” Oldham says. “You and I pay someone to take garbage away from our house. DAC is a model that makes sense for hard-to-decarbonize sectors.”

The market for removing carbon the way we remove the trash is gaining steam McDonald says. “There’s an incredible amount of demand that’s coming to purchase these and there’s actually not enough supply of high-quality additional verifiable credits.”

Despite that need DAC has struggled to catch on because of high prices and limited capacity.

Thermo Fisher Scientific’s experience is instructive. The company launched a line of carbon-neutral mass spectrometers in 2021 using carbon removal credits to offset the emissions created during the instruments’ life cycle. The firm’s inorganic mass spectrometry group calculated that 15 kg of CO 2 is emitted for every 1 kg of spectrometer delivered.

“Emission reduction is obviously the most important long-term goal for decarbonizing the economy” Mario Tuthorn marketing manager for the group said in a presentation on the program. But that’s hard to do in precision manufacturing where performance of the final device is very sensitive to material and design choices he added. “If we want to make a change today the most practical approach is to offset our emissions.”

If we want to avoid warming beyond 1.5 °C every scenario is going to require some kind of carbon removal in addition to reducing emissions immediately and as fast as possible. Marcius Extavour vice president for energy and climate XPrize Foundation

Avoided emissions such as those gained from planting or protecting trees were not good enough in the team’s analysis because they are hard to calculate and track. “Will the forest you paid to protect still be protected in 50 to 100 years’ time?” Tuthorn asked. “A much more rigorous offsetting approach is carbon dioxide removal.”

In a white paper the group detailed how it shopped for carbon removal credits. It emphasized permanent removal of CO 2 that would not have been removed other ways. Priority also went to technologies that have the potential to scale but need investment now to drive down costs.

Though Thermo Fisher sounds like the exact customer DAC firms are courting DAC won only 3%—which went to Carbon Engineering—of the program’s 2021 carbon removal spending. Instead 78% went to construction with sustainable timber and insulation with recycled paper. Biochar and bio-oil projects which heat plant matter to convert it to charcoal or pyrolysis oil that is then buried or injected into old wells shared 19%.

Though Tuthorn described DAC as the gold standard for carbon removal alongside biomass-based energy plants that sequester their CO 2 emissions he said it wasn’t ready and affordable yet. “We want to remove our emissions today” he said “and this means we must limit our investment in direct air capture where plants are still under construction.”

Price was also a concern. Thermo Fisher was willing to spend an average of $80 per metric ton of carbon removed more than most other initiatives want to spend. Market watchers estimate the current price of DAC offsets at about $400 per metric ton. At that price DAC could be only a small part of the pie. Over time Tuthorn said DAC will gain a bigger share of the credits the program buys.

DAC similarly won only a small chunk of Microsoft’s fiscal 2021 carbon removal credit purchases. The software giant bought 1400 t of removal credits from Climeworks 4000 t from biochar and bio-oil projects and 193000 t from soil carbon management. Most of its purchases—1.1 million t—were from forestry projects.

In 2022 Microsoft replaced DAC in its offset portfolio with a project to mineralize CO 2 in old concrete. The company paid an average of $19.40 per metric ton for its 2022 offsets.

Microsoft detailed the problem in its 2022 carbon offset white paper. “High-durability solutions are critical but supply is limited and expensive and many companies cannot yet afford them at scale” it says referring to biochar bio-oil mineralization and DAC. “We need expensive higher durability solutions to become more affordable.” Microsoft says it is both an offset credit customer of Climeworks and an investor in the firm through its Climate Innovation Fund.

“It’s great to have these customers” says Christoph Beuttler head of climate policy at Climeworks. But it’s a chicken-and-egg moment: for prices to come down DAC needs to scale up and to do that DAC needs customers buying carbon offsets. “We are a technology right? So we’re expensive now; we get cheap as—if—we scale up. We need the money now” Beuttler says.

He estimates that DAC needs $100 billion in R&D investment to reduce the price to a point where the technology can really compete.

In a 2021 paper in Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research Klaus Lackner and Habib Azarabadi of Arizona State University were more optimistic. They argue that DAC costs could fall with increased use as solar photovoltaic costs have; it might take only $200 million of carbon credit purchases to bring the cost of DAC down to $100 per metric ton (DOI: 10.1021/acs.iecr.0c04839).

“In just the chemistry there’s still a lot of potential that we can tap into” Beuttler says. “But obviously there’s also a lot to gain from economies of scale. The ones behind me are handmade in Switzerland” he says pointing to a photo of a Climeworks DAC module. That is “probably not the most cost-efficient way to produce them” he adds. “If we continue making them by hand it will remain a luxury product.”

Climeworks is planning to build a plant in 2024 that will be 10 times as large as Orca moving the firm in the right direction on both chemistry advances and economies of scale Beuttler says.

Nearly everyone working in DAC agrees that emission reduction is the low-hanging fruit in fighting climate change and should be harvested as quickly as possible. The importance of carbon removal will grow over time though and DAC may be the most scalable trackable and tradable way to cover the “last mile” of hard-to-abate and historical emissions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNDE5LTAyMi0wNDY4Ny150gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amyloid β / PKC-dependent alterations in NMDA receptor composition are detected in early stages of Alzheimer´s ...,"NR2B subunit and PSD95 levels increase in postsynaptic density fractions of prefrontal cortex from early-stage AD patients and correlate with Aβ levels

Western blot analysis of NR2B subunit (Fig. 1A B) and PSD95 (Fig. 1A C) revealed a significant increase of both proteins in PSD fractions particularly at Braak II stage compared to nondemented control group and to Braak III IV and V-VI classified subjects. Expression of both proteins decreased concomitantly from Braak II to Braak VI stages which reveals a significant transient increase in the early stages of the disease followed by a decrease during disease progression (Fig. 1A–C). Accordingly synaptophysin levels were also increased specifically in non-PSD fractions of Braak II stage AD brains when compared to controls and Braak V-VI (supplementary Fig 1). In addition quantification of Aβ 42 by ELISA (n = 37 samples supplementary Table 1) in PSD extracts showed increasing levels throughout AD stages (Fig. 1D). Importantly Aβ 42 levels in PSD fractions ranged from 0.1 to 4.5 ng/mg protein and positively correlated with synaptic proteins in human samples (Fig. 1E F). However when Aβ 42 levels exceeded 4.5 ng/mg protein these correlations were lost pointing out towards an Aβ 42 threshold concentration for NR2B and PSD95 upregulation. Taken together these data show a specific increase of NR2B subunit and PSD95 that correlates with Aβ 42 levels in the prefrontal cortex of brain samples at early stages of AD which is counteracted along the progression of disease. These important changes suggest a critical temporal dynamics of molecular reorganization of the synapse throughout the course of the disease that is dependent on Aβ 42 peptide.

Aβ peptide levels correlate with NR2B and PSD95 deregulation in the 3xTg-AD mice

To study molecular distribution and organization of NR2B PSD95 synaptophysin and Aβ 42 along synaptic deficit progression we initially selected an age with no signs of pathology in the triple transgenic mouse model (3xTg-AD) (1 month; Fig. 2E; supplemental Fig S2) and another when Aβ is just emerging (6 months; Fig. 2) [23]. Isolated synaptosomes from the hippocampus were analyzed by ELISA and Western blot. In 6-month-old 3xTg-AD mice we observed a significant increase in NR2B subunit (Fig. 2A B; 1.28 ± 0.29 vs. 0.52 ± 0.07 arbitrary units a.u.) PSD-95 (Fig. 2A C; 5.83 ± 2.81 vs. 2.39 ± 0.29 a.u) synaptophysin (Fig. 2A D 4.83 ± 0.73 vs. 2.72 ± 0.62 a.u) and Aβ42 levels (Fig. 2E; 3.35 ± 0.86 vs. 0.66 ± 0.07 a.u) as compared to control animals (n = 5 mice in all instances). Notably these data showed a robust correlation between Aβ42 with NR2B (p = 0.036) and PSD95 (p = 0.011) (Fig. 2F G). As control protein levels of 1-month old mouse showed similar expression in 3xTg-AD and WT mice (Supplementary Fig 2 n = 7 and 8 mice respectively). Thereby these results indicate that 6-month-old 3xTg-AD mice show an enhanced expression of NR2B subunit PSD-95 and synaptophysin proteins which is associated with increased levels of Aβ42 peptides in isolated synaptic terminals of the hippocampus.

Aβ injection increases NR2B and PSD95 levels in adult mice hippocampus

To elucidate the biological effects of Aβ oligomers in NR2B and PSD95 protein expression we injected Aβ oligomers or vehicle into the hippocampus of C57 adult mice. Aβ injection led neurons to overexpress NR2B and PSD95 proteins in DG as revealed by quantification of the immunolabeled area with synaptic markers NR2B (Fig. 2H I; 33.3 ± 2.2 vs. 27.3 ± 2.0 a.u; Aβ- vs. vehicle-injected mice (n = 16 animals in three experiments) and PSD-95 (Fig. 2J K; 28.2 ± 2 vs. 22.5 ± 1.7 a.u; Aβ- vs vehicle-injected mice (n = 9 animals in three experiments). However any change in NR2B and PSD95 expression was observed in CA1 and CA3 areas (Supplemental Figure S3 and S4 respectively). Overall these histological findings demonstrate that Aβ oligomers trigger NR2B and PSD95 upregulation in DG of mouse hippocampus.

Aβ oligomers regulate NR2B-containing NMDA receptor density and related Ca2+ response in neuronal membranes

Cultured neurons were treated with 1μM Aβ for 30 min or 24 h and cell surface receptor density was determined by cleavable biotinylation assay followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3A C Aβ acute treatment for 30 min enhanced NR2B but not NR2A subunits at neuronal membrane surfaces (129.8 ± 7.6% compared to control vehicle-treated cells 100% n = 4 cultures). Conversely longer Aβ treatment for 24 h reduced both NR2A and NR2B subunit localization at cellular surface (46.9 ± 16.6% and 53.2 ± 9.8% respectively compared with control vehicle-treated cells 100%; Fig. 3A C; n = 4 cultures). Neither acute nor chronic Aβ treatments exerted significant effect on the expression of NR2A or NR2B subunits in total cell lysates (Fig. 3A B; n = 6–10). In addition although Aβ treatment increased both cytosolic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+] cyt ) and the presence of NR2B in the neuronal membrane excitotoxicity elicited by the NMDA post-treatment was not significantly affected with respect to untreated cells (Supplemental Figure S5). These results show that Aβ selectively modulates the membrane localization of NR2A and NR2B subunits in NMDA receptors of primary cortical neurons.

Fig. 3: Aβ promotes alterations of NR2A and NR2B subunit distribution and function in neurons. A–C Cultured neurons were incubated with Αβ 1 µM for 30 min or 24 h and total and biotinylated neuron-surface NR2A and NR2B were identified by western blot (A supplemental material). Graph bars (means ± S.E.M.) represent the volume band intensities of total NMDAR subunits (B) and surface NMDA receptors (C) normalized to β-actin and expressed as a percentage of untreated cells. *p < 0.05 compared to non-treated (control) cells; paired two-way ANOVA. D E Neurons were exposed to 1 µM Aβ for 30 minutes or 24 h loaded with Fura-2AM for 30 minutes and Ca2+ rise was evaluated after application of 30 µM NMDA 1 min. Each recording represent the average of 52–65 cells from 3 independent experiments. E Violin plot represents data distribution and mean ± S.E.M. of the area under curve for each condition in arbitrary units (a.u.).

G Ca2+ recordings following synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDAR activation in control and neurons treated with 1 µM Aβ for 30 min (n = 3 experiments; 67 and 63 cells respectively). Synaptic NMDAR activity was recorded after addition of 50 µM bicuculline and 2.5 mM 4-AP. Extrasynaptic NMDAR-mediated ion fluxes were recorded with NMDA agonist (30 µM) following synaptic NMDAR blockade with 10 µM MK-801 applied during treatment with bicuculline. H Violin plot represents data distribution and mean ± S.E.M. of area under Ca2+ response curve for control (untreated-cells) and Aβ-pretreated cells in synaptic and extrasynaptic-associated recorders. Data were analyzed with unpaired Student’s t-test; *p < 0.05. Full size image

Next [Ca2+] cyt induced by NMDA was recorded in neurons pretreated with 1 μM Aβ for 30 min or 24 h. Aβ-pretreatment for 30 min significantly enhanced the [Ca2+] cyt after NMDA application while chronic pretreatment with Aβ reduced the NMDA-induced Ca2+ response compared to control (Fig. 3D E 12.7 ± 0.3 14.6 ± 0.4 and 10.8 ± 0.5 a.u. respectively; n = 3 cultures 191 cells). Furthermore NMDA-dependent [Ca2+] cyt increase in the presence of 10 µM TCN-201 a NR2A specific inhibitor revealed that contribution of NR2B to Ca2+ accumulation was more prominent in Aβ-treated than in control cells 4.7 ± 04 and 2.6 ± 0.4 quantified as area under the curve respectively (Fig. 3F; n = 3 cultures 178 cells). To selectively activate synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs primary cortical neurons were treated with bicuculline and 4-AP to activate synaptic NMDARs followed by MK801-induced blocking. NMDA agonist selectively activated extrasynaptic NMDARs as shown in Fig. 3G (n = 3 cultures; 130 cells). Under these conditions Aβ-treated neurons (n = 67 cells) showed specifically a significant increase in synaptic (11.5 ± 1.4 vs. 6.8 ± 0.4 a.u.) but not in extrasynaptic (7.2 ± 0.5 vs. 5.3 ± 0.3 a.u.) NMDA-evoked [Ca2+] cyt increase compared to control (n = 63 cells) (Fig. 3H). Overall these results point out that soluble Aβ modify NMDARs-induced cytosolic Ca2+ signals by modulating the function of synaptic but not extrasynaptic NR2B-containing NMDARs on neuronal cell surface.

Aβ oligomers increase both synaptic expression and interaction of NMDA receptor subunit NR2B and postsynaptic scaffold protein PSD-95

Next we examined whether Aβ could modify NR2B incorporation at synaptosomal fractions. NR2B subunit levels were significantly increased in Aβ-treated cells for 30 min (Fig. 4A B 161 ± 19 % compared to control 100 ± 20%) while no significant changes were observed in Aβ-treated cells either for 3 or 24 h (Fig. 4AB). Moreover PSD-95 protein was also overexpressed in Aβ-treated neurons for 30 min (Fig. 4C 164 ± 25 % compared to control 100 ± 23 %). To explore Aβ-induced modification on NR2B subunit and PSD-95 colocalization in dendrites EGFP-NR2B subunit was overexpressed in cortical neurons and after Aβ treatment for 30 min extracellular region of NR2B subunit was labeled in in vivo conditions using anti EGFP antibody and subsequently stained with the postsynaptic marker PSD-95 (Fig. 4D). Pearson’s coefficient analysis showed that Aβ oligomers increased significantly NR2B/PSD95 colocalization compared to control cells (Fig. 4E 0.08 ± 0.01compared to 0.12 ± 0.01 a.u. n = 4 cultures). Taking together these results show that NR2B subunit and PSD95 synaptic expression and colocalization are early modulated by Aβ oligomers.

Fig. 4: Aβ treatment increases the location of NR2B subunit and PSD-95 in neuronal surface and favors their colocalization. A Neurons were exposed to 1 µM Aβ for 30 min 3 h and 24 h. Total synaptic and cytosolic protein samples were extracted and NR2B and PSD-95 levels were detected by immunoblot (Supplemental Material). B C Graph bars show the means ± S.E.M of NR2B and PSD95 band volumes normalized to corresponding β-Actin of three independent *p < 0.05 **p < 0.01 one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett´s test.

PKC activation by Aβ oligomers controls NR2B subunit localization and function in neuronal plasma membrane

NMDAR function is regulated by PKC activity [24]. To assess the role of PKC in Aβ-induced NMDAR modulation in neurons a genetically encoded fluorescent reporter for PKC-mediated phosphorylation (Myr-Palm CKAR Violin et al. 2003) was transfected in primary neurons. First basal PKC-mediated FRET signals were confirmed with PMA and Gö6983 PKC activator and inhibitor respectively (Fig. 5A B D). Next PKC activation by 1 μM Aβ oligomers was revealed by FRET signal in CKAR-transfected neurons pretreated with the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A (100 nM) for 10 min (Fig. 5C) to avoid that cellular phosphatases counteract PKC activity [25]. To confirm whether Aβ oligomers phosphorylate NMDARs by changes in PKC catalytic function by autophosphorylation [26] phosphoPKC and phosphoNR2B (Ser1303) were quantified by western blot. Accordingly we found that 1 μM Aβ oligomers for 30 min significantly increased levels of phosphoPKC in total cell extracts from neurons (Fig. 5F 1.6 ± 0.2 compared to control levels 0.9 ± 0.1 a.u; normalized to total PKC) and promoted NR2B phosphorylation at S1303 (Figs. 5E 4.3 ± 0.7 compared to control levels 2.7 ± 0.2 a.u; normalized to total NR2B). In addition Gö6983 abolished the Aβ-induced phosphorylation of NR2B subunit in neurons (Fig. 5E). Next the role of PKC activity in NMDAR function was confirmed by an enhanced intracellular Ca2+ influx to NMDA agonist in PMA pretreated neurons (Fig. 5G). Similarly intracellular Ca2+ increase after NMDA addition in Aβ-pretreated neurons was significantly boosted when compared to control (Fig. 5H J; 11.5 ± 0.4 Aβ-treated compared to control levels 8.5 ± 0.4) and abolished in the presence of the PKC inhibitor Gö6983 (Fig. 5I J; 8 ± 0.9 Aβ + Gö6983 compared to Gö6983 7 ± 0.4). Finally we analyzed whether PKC was involved in the Aβ-induced increase of NR2B subunit at synaptic sites. Neurons were incubated with 1 μM Aβ for 30 min with or without Gö6983 and synaptosomal fractions were analysed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 5K L Aβ oligomers induced a NR2B subunit upregulation with respect to control from 1.0 ± 0.02 to 1.3 ± 0.04 respectively which was blocked by Gö6983 to 0.9 ± 0.2 compared to its respective control 1.0 ± 0.1. Altogether these results indicated that Aβ oligomers control NR2B protein levels in synaptic sites through classic PKCs.

Aβ oligomers upregulate NR2B subunit density via integrin β1/PKC signalling pathway

To investigate molecular mechanisms underlying the Aβ/PKC-mediated NR2B subunit modulation we examined the possible involvement of integrin β1 previously described as a receptor for Aβ oligomers that induce synaptotoxicity and astrogliosis [18 27]. First the Aβ-induced PKC phophorylation (Fig. 6A; 0.57 ± 0.02 vs 0.35 ± 0.06 a.u. Aβ-treated vs. control cells; normalized to total PKC) was significantly reduced in neurons preincubated with RGDS peptide which contains the integrin-binding sequence and inhibits its function [28] (Fig. 6B; 0.4 2 ± 0.1 vs. 0.36 ± 0.06 a.u. RGDS + Aβ-treated vs RGDS control cells; normalized to total PKC). Similarly TS2-16 an integrin β1-activating antibody [29] potentiated phosphorylation of PKC to levels comparable to those induced by Aβ oligomers (Fig. 6; 0.44 ± 0.04 0.35 ± 0.06 vs. 0.21 ± 0.03 a.u. TS2-treated Aβ-treated vs control cells respectively; normalized to total PKC). Overall these results indicated that PKC is phosphorylated by Aβ/integrin β1-dependent mechanisms. Moreover we confirmed the role of integrin β1 in the Aβ-mediated PKC activity by changes in FRET assays with CKAR reporter (Fig. 6C). Thus PKC activity was blocked when cells were preincubated with antiCD29 an integrin β1-inhibiting antibody [30] but not by the isotype control IgM. Taken together these results confirmed that Aβ oligomers required integrin β1 to modulate PKC phosphorylation and activation. We also studied whether changes on Ca2+ permeability of NMDARs by Aβ oligomers was mediated by integrin β1 (Fig. 6D E). NMDAR-mediated intracellular Ca2+ changes quantified as area under the curve in Aβ + IgM antibody-treated cells as control were significantly reduced in neurons exposed to Aβ along with CD29 antibody (Figs. 6D 10.1 ± 0.9 vs. 7.5 ± 0.8 respectively). Additionally TS2-16 antibody-treated cells showed a higher Ca2+ response to NMDA agonist than vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 6E; 14.2 ± 0.7 vs. 9.7 ± 0.8 respectively). These results confirmed that integrin β1 modulated Ca2+ permeability of NMDARs. Finally we analysed NR2B density in functional synaptosomes of IgM+Aβ- and CD29 + Aβ-treated neurons. Aβ induced an increase in NR2B density in IgM-treated cells (Fig. 6F G; 1.03 ± 0.07 to 1.4 ± 0.13 IgM control vs. IgM+Aβ) Importantly the presence of the integrin β1 receptor blocker CD29 antibody inhibited the Aβ-mediated NR2B increase (Fig. 6FG; 1.12 ± 0.06 to 0.8 ± 0.06 CD29 control vs. CD29 + Aβ). These results suggest that soluble Aβ requires integrin β1/PKC pathway in order to mediate actively on NR2B localization and function in synaptosomes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzE4NzQzOTE5MjIwMDAyNDDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Phosphopeptide enrichment using Phos-tag technology reveals functional phosphorylation of the nucleocapsid protein ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1874391922000240 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzE4NzQzOTE5MjIwMDAyNDDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbG9jYWxwcm92LmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2dlcmFyZC1iLi1jb3Vybm95ZXItZGllcy1hdC03OdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gerard B.

Over 3 million women undergo BV annually in the United States2. BV is linked with increased risk of preterm birth miscarriage acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus and sexually transmitted infections3456. BV is commonly characterized by reduced level of lactobacilli elevated vaginal pH vaginal discharge vaginal fluid fish odor and overgrowth of pathogenic anaerobic bacteria such as Gardnerella vaginalis spp. Prevotella bivia and Fannyhessea vaginae7.

G. vaginalis spp. are facultative anaerobes detected in up to 95% of BV cases8. G. vaginalis spp. have been regarded as one of the bacterial consortiums inducing BV that was best-studied species among the pathogenic anaerobic bacteria910. These bacteria adhere to vaginal epithelial cells and make an environment favorable for growth of other pathogenic anaerobes forming biofilm leading to an induction of cytotoxicity on vaginal epithelial cells11. However despite over 60 years of research a definite etiology of BV has not been fully elucidated12.

The administration of antibiotics such as clindamycin and metronidazole has been recommended for treatment of BV6 since it showed 75–86% cure rates13. However the use of antibiotics has limitations due to their side effects. About 52% of the patients with BV who were orally treated with metronidazole were associated with gastrointestinal complaints14. About 80% of the women with BV who were administered with clindamycin were reported to be exposed to pathogenic anaerobes which are resistant to this antibiotic15. Moreover about 60% of women experienced recurrence of BV after 12 months of metronidazole treatment16.

To avoid the side effects of antibiotic treatments there has been an increasing interest in administration of probiotic bacteria instead of antibiotics which can alleviate BV. Reid et al. demonstrated that vaginal microbial microbiota in the patients with BV were reinstated after oral administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and L. fermentum RC-14 which did not cause any adverse effect17. Moreover oral administration of L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. fermentum RC-14 caused a reduction in the levels of pathogenic bacteria and yeasts in vagina18. Intravaginal administration of L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. fermentum RC-14 to the patients with BV suppressed recurrence of BV19. Intravaginal administration of L. crispatus CTV-05 to the patients with BV resulted in this bacterium colonizing the vagina consequently restoring healthy vaginal microbiota in the patients20.

Although some reproductive women maintain a healthy vaginal environment without lactobacilli21 lactobacilli are still considered as the most common bacteria in vaginal tract of healthy reproductive-age women and play an important role in maintaining healthy vaginal mucosa22. Lactobacilli have been known to have protective effects against BV via production of H 2 O 2 and lactic acid232425. Moreover they can produce antimicrobial compounds that inhibit growth of pathogens in the urogenital ecosystem26. Bacteriocin produced by L. acidophilus 160 had inhibitory activity against G. vaginalis27.

We found that cell-free supernatant of L. paracasei CH88 possessed antibacterial activity against G. vaginalis. Moreover cell-free supernatant of L. paracasei CH88 that was adjusted to pH 7.0 (LCFS) also showed the antibacterial activity against G. vaginalis.

Thus we hypothesized that the antibacterial activity of the LCFS (pH 7.0) may be attributed to antibacterial compounds other than lactic acid. The aim of this study was to characterize and fractionate the LCFS and to determine antibacterial effects of the LCFS fraction against G. vaginalis in-vitro and ameliorative effect on G. vaginalis-induced BV in mice."

The store which will be quite large will take up two spaces located between The Paper Store and Old Navy. One of these spaces was most recently occupied by the odd lots discount store Loot.

According to Wikipedia Home Goods is a national chain that was started in Framingham Massachusetts in 1992. Given the name it should not be a surprise that the stores sell items needed for the home. Dishes pots pans linens etc. It is owned by TJX Companies. TJX also owns TJ MaxxSierra Trading Post and Marshalls. As of 2020 there were just over 800 stores nationwide.

Not including the new Augusta location Maine & New Hampshire locations of the chain include Rockland Maine Scarborough Maine Bangor Maine Gilford New Hampshire and North Conway New Hampshire.

There is no word on when the store will open. So far inquiries to the plaza's leasing agents have not been returned.

Invitational in Fresno,"By: Mandi McCary

FRESNO Calif. – On Sunday afternoon as the PBR (Professional Bull Riders) Pendleton Whisky Velocity Tour’s (PWVT) PBR Tractor Supply Co. Invitational concluded in Fresno it was Adriano Salgado (Batatais Brazil) that stood humbly on the dirt inside of Save Mart Center collecting the event win for the second consecutive year.

Translated by fellow countryman Junior Patrik Souza (Sonora Brazil) Salgado thanked God and dedicated his win to fallen best friend Amadeu Campos Silva (Atair Brazil) before kneeling to pray. Campos passed away in late August 2021 due to injuries sustained in competition at the previous year’s event in Fresno.

As the two-day event began on Saturday night Salgado declined a re-ride offered by judges shocking fans and fellow riders alike by keeping his 18.5-point score aboard High Jacked (Humpz and Hornz/ ET Cattle).

As Round 2 began on Sunday afternoon Salgado was paired with Spirit Guide (Rodriguez Bucking Bulls) for a solid 83-point ride score.

In the championship round the talented young Brazilian was paired with Red Bones (Kathy Boone/ Joe Beaver/ Clay Struve/ Dakota Rodeo/ Chad Berger). Despite his best attempt Salgado was dispatched after a mere 2.13 seconds.

Salgado’s 2-for-3 weekend in Fresno earned him 37 world points and he now sits at No. 48 in the world standings.

Canada’s Griffin Smeltzer (Claresholm Canada) went 1-for-3 to collect a second-place finish.

After taking the lead in Saturday’s opening round Smeltzer began Sunday at the top of the leaderboard.

The 22-year-old was paired with Red (JD Nix Rodeo Co.) in Round 2 which did not go as planned when he was tossed to the dirt at 4.51 seconds unsuccessful in his efforts to continue his lead.

Hoping to redeem himself in the championship round Smeltzer clung to his bovine opponent Not Today (Nancy Haverty/ Clay Struve/ Dakota Rodeo/ Chad Berger) but fell short of 8 seconds.

Despite the setback on Sunday Smeltzer collected 27 world points and now sits at No. 57 in the world standings.

Tying for third place were Dustin Martinez (Canjilon New Mexico) and Dallee Mason (Weiser Idaho) after recording matching 86.5-point scores on Saturday night.

Sunday was not ideal for Martinez. After being bucked off by Rougie (Walking Lazy J Bull Team/ Hawkins Bucking Bulls) in Round 2 he was also dispatched by Sam I Am (Heald Pro Bulls/ Clay Struve/ Dakota Rodeo/ Chad Berger) in the final round.

Mason had a similarly unsuccessful Sunday. He hit the ground early aboard Frat Boy (Rodriguez Bucking Bulls) in Round 2 and was bested by Crazy Corona (Jeb Fredericks/ M Rafter E Bucking Bulls/ Dakota Rodeo/ Chad Berger) in the championship round.

Both cowboys leave Fresno having collected 11.5 world points. Martinez now holds the No. 91 spot in the world standings and Mason No. 113.

Dawson Branton (Jefferson Oregon) rounded out the Top 5 of the PBR Tractor Supply Co. Invitational also going 1-for-3.

After a successful Saturday night Branton began Sunday aboard Simple Jack (Hawkins Bucking Bulls). The athletic animal athlete prevailed bucking him off after 4.97 seconds.

Paired with Surprise Package (Clay Struve/ Dakota Rodeo/ Chad Berger) in the championship round he again fell short.

For his efforts the Oregon man received six world points and holds the No. 54 spot in the world standings.

The talented bull riders of PBR’s PWVT will next head to Oakland California for the PBR Ticketsmarter Classic at Oracle Arena on Saturday March 26.

Officials in Hood County ordered a mandatory evacuation Sunday afternoon for residents of Lipan and Tolar who were told to evacuate towards nearby Granbury immediately. Three shelters in Granbury were established for evacuees on U.S. Route 377 by Tractor Supply Granbury United Methodist Church on Loop 567 and the Church of Latter-Day Saints on Ross Lane.

""Downtown and skyways are starting to have a noticeable pulse again"" said Patrick Skinner general manager of Wells Fargo Place the tallest office building in St. Paul's downtown.

The 37-story tower is 90% leased and Skinner now expects building usage to be 60 to 65% of pre-pandemic levels by the summer up from 30 to 35% now.

""Within the last couple of weeks we have learned that all of our tenants save for a couple smaller tenants are planning a return-to work-strategy for the near future"" Skinner said.

Before most office employees started working from home in March 2020 about 1500 workers from Wells Fargo the Internal Revenue Service Merrill Lynch Wealth Management and other tenants were in the building daily.

""We are also seeing very encouraging improvement in activity and sales numbers for our restaurant tenants"" Skinner said.

Downtown Minneapolis and the areas around big corporate campuses such as 3M and Best Buy also will get a boost as more companies set plans for a hybrid schedule for workers.

In downtown St. Paul Wells Fargo workers started coming back last week as did the Travelers Companies' 2100 insurance workers in St. Paul. Securian Financial has set Tuesday for the start of its phased return while Ecolab corporate employees will return April 4.

Already the moves are leading to increasing activity on the streets said Joe Spencer president of St. Paul Downtown Alliance.

""Walking around downtown these days you can feel an anticipation and excitement brewing just under the surface"" Spencer wrote in an e-mail. He also pointed to recently opened bars and restaurants like Momento Lost Fox MetroNome Brewery and Hepcat Coffee.

Sunny skies plus the return-to-work announcements renewed St. Patrick's Day events the Minnesota boys high school hockey tournament — all are ""adding up to a feeling that's been missing for most of the last two years"" Spencer said.

The plummeting COVID-19 infection rates in recent weeks have led many Twin Cities employers to set in motion plans to add office days back into the mix.

Travelers is taking a ""flexible approach to work arrangements"" a spokeswoman said. ""This means that some employees have chosen to or have roles that require them to work from the office full time. While others have fully remote positions and some have chosen a hybrid arrangement.""

That's the approach most companies are taking although the details of hybrid plans differ.

3M reopened its headquarters campus in Maplewood last week and announced its ""Work Your Way"" model that lets most workers choose options.

While most lab and manufacturing employees have to work on-site 3M's U.S. office employees including the nearly 10000 in Minnesota were given a choice to return to the office said 3M spokesman Tim Post during a phone interview.

""Working from a 3M office will be another option for 3M's nonproduction employees as they find a schedule that best works for them"" Post said.

Best Buy's approach for most headquarters employees is more structured — three days in the office two at home or another location of their choice the company said. Some employees will be full time at the Richfield campus and other offices some will be fully remote.

Best Buy's new hybrid structure goes into effect the week of April 18.

Deluxe Corp. employees at the company's new downtown Minneapolis headquarters officially started hybrid work last week joining workers at employers such as the city of Minneapolis the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and Ameriprise Financial.

""We are definitely seeing an increase in workday activity especially in the middle of the week Tuesday through Thursday"" said Steve Cramer chief executive of Minneapolis Downtown Council.

Yet a schism remains between the young fliers targeted by these new business models and more established private-jet clients.

Wheels Up which launched in 2013 originated the single-seat charter concept by offering shared flights on its original fleet of King Air 350i turboprops before extending the program to larger business jets. Its Shared Flight program involves Core members looking to fill empty seats by posting upcoming flights on its app; depending on the number of travelers who hitch a ride that could result in savings of 50 percent or more.

Wheels Up president Vinayak Hegde says shared membership activity has maintained its popularity. “It’s not like we just book a seat” he says. “Two parties need to agree about the terms of the partnership so they’re the ones who control the situation.”

Meanwhile XO is reporting year-over-year gains of nearly 80 percent in its single-seat Shared Charter program. “We’ve had the program since the start of the company” says XO chief marketing officer Lynn Fischer “and it continues to expand.” XO sells empty seats on 50 weekly charters from New York to South Florida and interest is gaining for the New York–to–Naples Fla. and Los Angeles–to–Aspen routes.

Charterers can advertise an empty seat or individuals can join “crowd-funded” flights. Driving both programs: aspirational fliers between 18 and 44. “We’ve been communicating how accessible private aviation is” Fischer says. “We want to fully occupy these flights rather than flying them half-empty.”

Dallas-based JSX organized its core business around selling individual seats originally for as low as $199 between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. The company began scheduled flights between fixed-base operators in California Las Vegas and Phoenix using converted Embraer ERJs with 30 seats positioning it as a more luxurious alternative to commercial flights. It was an instant hit among aspirational types says JSX director Ben Kaufman. “The customer base was heavily weighted towards people under 35” says Kaufman. “We received a lot of publicity thanks to social media with people taking selfies on the airplane.”

But as JSX has expanded—it now flies to locations in California Nevada Texas Florida and New York—its dynamic pricing model raised rates significantly; that $199 LA-to-Vegas ticket is now often closer to $500 which has altered the customer base. “We’ve seen our clients from 35 to 55 [years old] grow to 60 percent during the pandemic” says Kaufman.

The more traditional aviation clients including aircraft owners and 25-hour jet-card members have moved in the opposite direction according to Jamie Walker president and CEO of Jet Linx. “We launched our OpenSeat Exchange in 2019 at the request of card members who wanted to fill a seat on their aircraft” he says. Initially the exchange performed as planned. “But as soon as the pandemic hit activity slowed to a crawl” Walker adds noting that now “very few members are releasing those seats.” That’s due in part to the fact that Jet Linx’s members are a different demographic than the aspirational fliers attracted by single-seat programs. “If they’ve committed to 25 hours [of private-jet travel] per year they can afford not to sell the seats” he explains. But he expects activity to resume as Covid abates. Which begs the question: Just how “private” is private-jet travel if it includes a bunch of strangers?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGVsbWFuYWdlbWVudC5uZXQvb3BlcmF0ZS9ob3RlbHMtbG9vay1hdHRyYWN0LWJhY2stZ3JvdXAtZGVtYW5k0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hotels look to attract group demand back,"As U.S. hotels continue to recover from the devastating effects of the pandemic leisure travel has been a boon for the industry. Recent studies in fact suggest that leisure travel will reach prepandemic levels in 2022. However not all hotels cater to the leisure segment leaving a large swath of properties that cater to group demand behind the curve. The meetings industry and the hotels that support it have suffered considerable losses since 2020. And while pandemic concerns ease there is still widespread agreement that group demand will be the last segment to recover.

Hotels that cater to groups will find the need to ramp up sales efforts quickly amid a much different and likely permanently altered landscape for meetings.

How Group Got Here

After experiencing steady increases in occupancy and average daily rates for the past 10 years the devastation brought on by the pandemic was felt industrywide at a level estimated to be as much as nine times greater than the effect of 9/11. Key performance indicators for 2020 and 2021 were down significantly from prepandemic numbers in 2019 especially for full-service hotels.

The decline in 2020 was unprecedented and thankfully unlikely to be repeated. The industry remained optimistic in early 2021 forecasting group and business travel to begin to rebound in the third quarter. However the emergence of the delta and omicron variants quickly reduced those hopes for late 2021 and early 2022. As many companies continue to work from home conferences and conventions have either been postponed or become virtual affecting business and group travel across many markets.

While the increase in leisure travel and the higher rates paid by leisure travelers have had a positive impact on hotels occupancy at full-service hotels (that more often cater to group demand) was 15 points lower in 2021 compared to 2019. Leisure travel has not been and will not be enough to raise the vast majority of full-service hotels to prepandemic levels for two main reasons:

Many full-service hotels are not in leisure markets. Full-service hotels with 300 rooms or more often depend on up to 60 percent of their business to come from group business.

Without group demand these hotels must operate under vastly different models to which they have been accustomed and be able to pivot to capture this returning demand.

How Group Demand Will Drive Recovery

The effect on group demand cannot be overstated in its impact. The following table shows how many roomnights were impacted in group business from 2019 to 2021:

These numbers indicate that while the segment rebounded slightly in 2021 it is still little more than 50 percent of 2019 levels. As an example of the impact we can consider two hypothetical hotels in the same market. We can see how group business at one hotel can have a positive impact at another.

Hotel A has 500 rooms and 50000 square feet of meeting space

Hotel B has 200 rooms and 10000 square feet of meeting space

During a healthy economy these hotels typically rely on approximately half of their rooms revenue to come from group and meeting business. As Hotel A works to sell 300 group rooms to groups at a discount rate the 50 percent occupancy gives rise to confidence to increase the pricing of the remaining guestroom inventory to sell to individual travelers.

Competitor hotels like Hotel B see this higher price point at Hotel A and adjust their pricing to be in line with the higher rates. In simple economic terms the group business decreases the supply of available rooms on a day in the market allowing prices to increase to accommodate demand. Without a base of group business the exact opposite is true. Discounted rates will be offered for all the rooms at Hotel A in order to attract demand and fill the hotel. Hotel B will monitor the pricing and adjust it to be in line with the lower prices.

As a simple example Hotel A is recognized in the market as a nicer hotel and typically prices its guestrooms at $220 and averages 75 percent occupancy. Hotel B typically prices its guest rooms at $200 $20 less than Hotel A.

On a particular night Hotel A has secured 250 rooms of group business at a discounted rate of $190 per room night. The hotel has to sell 125 additional rooms to reach 75 percent occupancy. With the group base the hotel can price the remaining rooms at $250 and reach 75 percent occupancy and will likely increase their prices higher if demand exceeds 75 percent occupancy. Hotel B will price its rooms at $230 ($20 less than Hotel A). The addition of group rooms has increased room revenue at Hotel A 5 percent. This example does not include catering audiovisual restaurant and other ancillary revenues that are attributed to group business.

This example assumes that the group business demand injected into the market is enough for Hotel B to achieve 75 percent occupancy at the higher rate. However if the additional demand is not enough for Hotel B to get to 75 percent occupancy the property will need to sell 117 rooms at $230 to reach $27000 in revenue equal to the property’s revenue without any group business in the market.

Given the expected percentages of group demand and the symbiotic relationship between competing hotels securing group business is necessary to expedite a recovery in ADR and occupancy for the entire hotel industry and it is especially critical for full-service hotels that focus on this business.

Preparing for Recovery

As the pandemic begins to recede the majority of full-service hotels must be prepared to capture group business when it returns. The hotel sales team needs to be in place and proactively connect with past contacts solicit potential customers to drive awareness of their hotel and respond quickly to every lead. Operators must understand how the meetings market has changed perhaps long term due to the pandemic and respond accordingly. Beyond cleaning protocols hotels must have technology in place to offer hybrid meetings. In addition to reliable and speedy Wi-Fi hotels must have cameras and lighting designed to capture stream and record meeting content from various meeting set-ups. This will be imperative for planners to cater to those comfortable traveling and offer those attendees not comfortable the ability to receive the content virtually. It remains to be seen how operators can monetize those options to retain revenue among what will likely be a continuing trend.

Menu options may also change as the trend away from communal buffet meals has reshaped some food and beverage operations. It may still take time before planners and attendees are comfortable with traditional options. In the short term table service individual packaging and additional staffing will be the new normal for group meals as demand ramps up. Hotels may also wish to offer additional opportunities for outdoor dining to make guests feel more comfortable. This may call for creative solutions. Perhaps there is opportunity to add rooftop dining or lounge to an existing property.

Light at the End of the Group Tunnel

Group guestrooms associated with meeting business will be the foundation of recovery for full-service hotels. As this demand returns the group meeting environment will be extremely competitive and hotel sales teams must present their best offer initially to capture the group business quickly and put the hotel in a position to increase prices for individual travel opportunities. With business and group travel virtually eliminated in 2020 and 2021 and amid apprehension to travel and meet face to face many hotels placed sales staff on furlough or eliminated the positions entirely. Hotels should be filling some or all of these sales positions especially those responsible for securing group business.

Another proactive step is to re-evaluate technology and menu offerings to reflect a post-pandemic meeting environment. Full-service hotels should set goals to fill 30 percent to 60 percent of their hotel room inventory with discounted group business and be poised to capture the returning individual travel demand at higher rates. Hotels that wait to see the individual traveler return before filling group sales positions will experience a much longer recovery.

At the beginning of the group recovery many operators may look to offer discounted rates and incentives. Speed will be the most important attribute and hotels are not in a position for complex negotiating. Offering these perks on the front end could help to ramp up sales and ensure a faster recovery amid what will be a competitive environment. The long-term profitability and survival of the vast majority of full-service hotels will only come from having base group business booked in the hotel giving the property confidence to charge higher retail rates for the returning individual travel demand and ultimately driving profitability.

Conclusion

Though rumors of group demand death have been wildly exaggerated it will take time effort savvy operations and an ""all hands-on deck"" approach to drive full-service hotel recovery. Leisure alone cannot bring the industry back to prepandemic levels.

GREENSBORO N.C. — Over a month ago SunTrust and BB&T merged to become Truist bank.

When this happened some customers told WFMY they had issues accessing funds or using their new debit cards. Since then some of those problems have been resolved. Others said they've continued to have issues.

Karen Hatchett and her husband own a firearms business in Eden. Their business bank account turned into Truist after the SunTrust/BB&T merger.

“My husband had banked over 20 years with BB&T - never had a problem until Truist. Until they merged and became Truist"" Karen said.

After the merge The Hatchetts received a returned check for ""insufficient funds"" even though they say they had plenty of money in their account.

“We cannot access our funds we cannot pay our vendors we were logged out. One vendor was thinking we had insufficient funds when that was not the case” Karen said.

After that the Hatchetts retrieved their money and closed their account.

When the merge happened hundreds of our viewers commented on our Facebook post saying they were having some sort of issue.

Since then problems have been resolved for some.

But for others like Felicia Andrews the struggle continues.

“So of course with my debit card everything that I had on that debit card number is no longer clearing so of course I’m getting a lot of calls” Andrews said.

But rather than switch banks just yet Andrews said the issues are slowly but surely working themselves out.

Just a week ago a spokesperson for Truist said ""there are no broad system issues but some clients are still experiencing challenges. Our wait times are steadily improving and we’re working diligently to provide these clients the care and attention they deserve.""

Truist is headquartered in Charlotte and has branches in 15 states.

On Feb. 19 the merger was set to go through. With new cards ready to activate and use on Feb. 21.

Feb. 21 was a federal holiday so banks were not open for people to call if their new cards weren't working.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1sYi5jb20vYnJhdmVzL3ZpZGVvL2JyaWFuLXNuaXRrZXItb24tYnJhdmVzLXJvc3RlctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brian Snitker on Braves roster | 03/20/2022 | Atlanta Braves,"add-reel-193012 Reels share-square-2-193013 Share

Freddie Freeman admits he’s still baffled and hurt by the way his 15 years with the Atlanta Braves ended.

The star slugger is also thrilled that the messy breakup allowed him to start the next chapter of his impressive career close to home with the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Freeman joined the Dodgers on Friday for his first workout since agreeing to a $162 million six-year contract to be a centerpiece of Los Angeles’ powerhouse roster.

FREDDIE FREEMAN THANKS BRAVES FANS TEAMMATES

""Everyone has just welcomed me with open arms"" Freeman said from the balcony of the Dodgers’ spring training complex after hundreds of fans below cheered while he donned a white Dodgers jersey for the first time.

""They know how much I care about winning and family"" Freeman added. ""If I was going to leave a place I was for 15 years coming home and being in this organization is probably the best thing that could have happened.""

BRAVES PLAYERS REACT TO END OF FREDDIE FREEMAN ERA IN ATLANTA

Freeman arrived at the Dodgers’ Camelback Ranch training complex in a suit and tie but immediately got some good-natured ribbing from his more laidback new teammates. Freeman is a Southern California native who probably should have known better but he is eager to fit in back home.

""It’s not really a suit organization I guess"" Freeman said with a laugh.

The 32-year-old slugger quickly changed into Dodger Blue for the first showcase of his famously consistent swing in the batting cages.

The Dodgers paid top dollar to get Freeman after his impressive career with the Braves including a 12-year run with the big-league club culminating in the 2020 NL MVP award and the 2021 World Series title.

Freeman will make $27 million a year with Los Angeles but $7 million is deferred in each of the first three seasons and $12 million in each of the last three for a total of $57 million. That money is payable in installments of $4 million each July 1 from 2028-35 and $5 million each July 1 from 2036-40.

But the big new contract and bright future hasn’t quelled all of Freeman’s hurt. He was the face of the Braves but the slugger feels they turned their back on him.

Freeman also was not convinced by the tears from Alex Anthopoulos when the Braves general manager discussed his departure: ""I saw them. That’s all I’ll say.""

Although Freeman got just two phone calls from the Atlanta front office during the offseason he still figured he would be returning to the only team for which he had ever suited up. He kept the faith even when he got a contract offer at last season’s trade deadline countered it — and never got another offer.

His optimism vanished Monday when the Braves swung a dramatic trade with Oakland for Matt Olson who got a $168 million contract a day later.

Freeman was working out at home in Orange County when he heard about the Olson trade which ""blindsided"" him.

""I had no idea that was going to happen anything like that"" Freeman said. ""When I got told emotions were all over the place. I couldn’t really speak for a couple of hours trying to figure out what was going on.""

Once he gathered himself Freeman and his agent entertained offers from several teams. The Dodgers easily made the most sense.

""I talked to my wife and I said ‘I think it’s time to go home’"" Freeman said. ""I’ve got my 67-year-old dad and my 86-year-old grandfather who’s now going to be able to watch me play every day just like 15 years ago in high school so that’s what’s special to me. To put on a uniform that cares about winning and strives to win every year that’s all you can ask for.""

The five-time All-Star first baseman is expected to be an immediate staple at the heart of the Dodgers’ batting order and at first base as they seek their second championship in three seasons.

""We couldn’t be more excited to add him as a staple of our lineup for years to come"" Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman said.

Freeman batted .300 with 31 homers and 83 RBIs while playing in 161 regular season games last year. He then hit .304 with five homers and 11 RBIs in the postseason while leading the Braves to their first title since 1995 with a six-game victory over the Dodgers in the NLCS along the way.

The Dodgers have made the playoffs in nine consecutive seasons and they ignored their normal aversion to lavish long-term contracts to lock up Freeman who lives in the Costa Del Mar neighborhood of Newport Beach during the offseason about 25 minutes from his boyhood home.

Freeman never really thought he would leave Atlanta but the Dodgers have had their eyes on him for a long time Friedman acknowledged.

""The last few years every time he got to first base Justin Turner would have a conversation with him about how good he would look in Dodger Blue"" Friedman said with a grin. ""I think there could definitely be some tampering charges against Justin Turner.""

Instead of setting the market it may have stole it. Correa never received the type of long-term contract he was looking for to top Seager.

Instead Correa went the high AAV route signing the largest contract ever for a infielder in terms of average annual value.

Seeing a lot of “my team could have offered this” which is true in many cases but Correa got that record AAV and ability to opt out after each season. Still think it’s a pretty good outcome for him. https://t.co/0IfzCxzfHi — D.J. Short (@djshort) March 19 2022

Correa’s new contract provides him ultimate flexibility to maximize his earning potential over the next couple of years. He likely wanted to receive $35 million a year over a long-term contract but when that wasn’t available he instead takes it over the next three seasons.

Still the chances of Correa actually playing out this entire contract is rather slim as it really is a one-year deal masquerading as a three-year one. Correa can opt out of his contract after each season allowing himself the security of a three-year pact but the flexibility to hit the open market again after a strong season.

If Correa plays the same way he did last season the shortstop will hit free agency again next year at the ripe age of 28. He will have no qualifying offer attached and also could enjoy a better market in an offseason that isn’t interrupted by a lockout.

There is also the Scott Boras wrinkle to this as it had been reported that Correa’s new agent would stand to benefit greatly from him signing a one-year deal. Because Correa switched representation mid-offseason his old agent would have been the beneficiary of whatever contract he signed. Now next offseason that money will go to Boras."

Supply chains in food construction fashion fast-moving consumer goods electronics automotive professional services and freight account for more than half of all global greenhouse gas emissions.

The importance of supply chains to companies’ sustainability goals is now widely accepted.

A report by Accenture reveals that CEOs agree that technology is enabling new business models and will unlock the future of industry decarbonisation. The ability to track every stage of the product journey from raw materials to the consumers doorstep through to the end-life of the product is now top of mind for businesses. In fact research by EY lists end-to-end visibility as the number one factor in creating a successful supply chain. Furthermore as global supply chains continue to be affected by challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic this is a way to build resilience and future-proof supply chains from disruptions.

To fully leverage the transformational opportunities that technology can unlock organisations need effective data management and item-level visibility across the value chain - but this can’t be accomplished without the right technologies.

Traceability leads to visibility

When we look at the future of sustainability from net-zero goals to circular business models none of it is possible if companies don’t first understand the what when where why and how of their products at each stage of the supply chain.

This is where the benefits of digital identity technologies can have a profound impact. By assigning each product its own ‘digital twin’ companies can unlock sophisticated real-time monitoring of their supply chains. This helps them to make supply chain decisions that can reduce waste increase efficiencies and create circular processes.

A prime example is the use of digital twins in the food sector capable of driving better management of expiry more precise product removal during recalls and improved monitoring of temperatures to avoid spoilage. Based on pilot studies we believe radio frequency identification (RFID) tagging can help grocers reduce food waste by as much as 20%.

Chipotle Mexican Grill recently announced it is testing RFID technology to enhance its traceability and inventory systems across approximately 200 restaurants in the greater Chicago area. A leader in food safety Chipotle is one of the first major restaurant companies to leverage RFID case labels to track ingredients from suppliers to restaurants via serialization. The ambition is to save suppliers time on inventory management and stock rotation mitigate human error and increase expiration date visibility and accountability.

Driving decarbonisation

To meet the urgency of curbing climate change it’s critical that businesses act to eliminate GHG emissions and when we consider that the food supply chain alone represents a quarter of global GHG emissions the possibilities are huge and the supply chain’s role in decarbonisation could be an absolute game-changer.

Avery Dennison is working with a major sports retailer who is piloting our atma.io connected product cloud solution to trace the carbon footprint of its raw materials. By assigning every product a digital identity which is connected to the cloud the sports retailer can determine the carbon cost of each product from manufacturer to store shelf.

The next frontier of supply chain decarbonisation is to ensure companies are measuring and managing their total value chain. Scope 3 emissions account for 65-95% of a company’s emissions but progress on tracking these emissions has been slow. The latest updates to the atma.io connected product cloud have been created to help brands meet net-zero targets and reduce waste across the supply chain. The atma.io Real-time Carbon Impact Analytics tool provides brands with data-driven insights regarding the carbon footprint of their products including Scope 3 emissions and beyond. It captures data from every stage of a product’s journey from raw material to consumer and can help firms as they work to comply with forthcoming EU ‘Digital Product Passport’ regulations.

Supply chains for value-driven customers

Consumer behaviour is changing and given the COVID-19 pandemic transparent and real-time information is becoming critical to ensure health and safety but also to align with consumers’ increasing demands for sustainability.

The information made possible by digital identity technologies goes way beyond a product’s origins to letting people know where their product has been giving them access to behind-the-scenes footage of where products are made to information on how or where to recycle or resell their clothing.

As the global economy is transitioning away from a linear model to a circular one digital identity technologies provide consumers with information through a smartphone scan or tap on how or where to recycle or resell their clothing and by providing resellers with the authenticity of a garment enabling its second life.

For example Levi’s partnered with Hong Kong upcycling brand The R Collective to create a fully traceable denim collection. Each item has an Avery Dennison-enabled digital label with a QR code that informs consumers how to care for their garment and how to recycle at its end of life. French lingerie brand Etam is deploying RFID technology across its entire range of bras and underwear as a means of tracking and tracing product throughout its journey from factory to store shelf. This provides a global vision of its stock wherever the product happens to be allowing the brand to take full advantage of its inventory whether it is being showcased in stores in stockrooms or in warehouses. As part of its commitment to transparency shoppers can scan QR codes on product labels to beam short videos about factories and product insights directly to their smartphones.

Transparent supply chains are fast being seen as ‘business as usual’ not an innovative extra with digital twins being used all the way from item creation to optimising manufacturing operations to end of life. The evidence around the commercial benefits is extensive.

According to an Accenture study across five use cases digital twins can unlock US$1.3tn in economic value and 7.5 Gt CO2 emissions reductions till 2030. We have the societal and the business case for change coupled with the technology required now we just need to see more urgency and action.",,,,,,,,,,,,

More than two decades after Mike Tyson bit off a chunk of Evander Holyfield’s ear at the 1997 WBA Heavyweight Championship fight the legendary boxer has released a line of edibles – in the shape of ears.

The cannabis-infused gummies are called “Mike Bites” in homage to Tyson’s most notorious moment.

Holyfield the only four-time world heavyweight champion defeated Tyson at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas in 1996. The following year during their highly anticipated rematch Tyson bit off a small section of Holyfield’s ear spit it onto the canvas and was promptly disqualified. The gory incident marked the rematch as one of the most bizarre fights in the history of boxing.

Tyson who was the youngest boxer ever to win a heavyweight title has launched several cannabis-related ventures in recent years. Tyson 2.0 the company releasing “Mike Bites” describes itself as “a premier cannabis company formed with legendary boxer entrepreneur and icon Mike Tyson.” In 2021 the company expanded its sales to over 100 locations in California.

On Twitter Tyson himself vouched that “These ears actually taste good!”

Holy ears! They’re finally here! Go get your Mike Bites now 👂😤 pic.twitter.com/BCbXcdYcra — TYSON 2.0 (@itstyson20) March 15 2022

Tyson is part of a wave of celebrities who have launched their own cannabis-related products and brands. In 2015 rapper Snoop Dogg debuted “Leafs by Snoop” a branded line of cannabis products. Similarly in 2019 hip-hop artist Drake announced that he was going into business with a Canadian cannabis firm. Joining the trend Martha Stewart launched her own line of CBD-infused dog treats in 2021 and Jaleel White released a strain of – wait for it – Purple Urkel cannabis.

Tyson hasn’t been shy about his strong relationship with cannabis. The former heavyweight champion admitted in 2019 that he spends $40000 a month on weed at his 40-acre cannabis ranch. Tyson opened the farm in 2018 after California legalized recreational marijuana. Tyson 2.0’s website explains that “When Mike was in his prime he used cannabis to relax his body and focus his mind.”

Tyson and Holyfield have reconciled since the infamous “Bite Fight.” The two appeared in a humorous Foot Locker ad together and in 2014 Tyson delivered the speech for Holyfield’s induction into the Nevada Boxing Hall of Fame.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiuwFodHRwczovL3FjdGltZXMuY29tL2V4Y2x1c2l2ZS9pbnNpZ2h0L2ltbWlncmFudHMtYXJlLWRyaXZpbmctcG9wdWxhdGlvbi1ncm93dGgtaW4tdGhlLXF1YWQtY2l0aWVzLWFuZC10aGF0cy1ib29zdGluZy10aGUtcmVnaW9uYWwtZWNvbm9teS9hcnRpY2xlXzc1NDczNDk1LTBjZWQtNTNhOC1hNWY3LTM2NTJhYTMxMjEyMS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Immigrants are driving population growth in the Quad-Cities. And that's boosting the regional economy.,"Jonnabelle Presentacion had never heard of Erie or Rock Island Illinois. But she’d moved from her family’s home in the Philippines to Saudi Arabia to improve her English and become certified as a medical technician with the hope of a better future. By the time she’d passed all the exams and filled out the paperwork she was willing to go anywhere as long as it was in the U.S.

Her destination? The Quad-Cities; UnityPoint Health was hiring in Rock Island.

Arriving in 2018 without knowing anyone in the area or how to drive Presentacion relied on well-meaning coworkers for transportation and finding amenities.

“A car is a need not a want here. It's kind of difficult to move around without a car” Presentacion said. “So that’s one thing I’ve been helping them (new hires) with.”

Now Presentacion is the technical lead for Hematology at UnityPoint Trinity campus in Rock Island owns a home a quick walk from the medical campus where she works and hopes to raise a family in the Quad-Cities with her husband.

“When I started here the thought was just that it would just be for experience but then getting to know the slower pace of living it's really nice a good place to start a family or raise children” Presentacion said. “..Because when you're in a fast-paced city you always are tired you don't have time to see how they grow you are always busy and stressed.”

Immigrants and refugees like Presentacion are among the biggest drivers of the Quad-Cities’ population and economic gains. Newcomers to our region are more likely to be of working age between 25 and 64 years old. Immigrants are also more likely to open their own businesses and employ others than U.S.-born Quad-Citians. And they may be the region's best hope for growing population and entrepreneurship in the future.

Augustana professors Chris Strunk and Claire Bess studied the region’s 2020 decennial census numbers and most recent American Community Survey five-year data. One major finding: From 2010 to 2019 the population of the metropolitan Quad-Cities increased by just 1.1% from 37600 to 381000 while the foreign-born population grew by 3694 an 18.6% increase.

“The net effect especially for places like the Quad-Cities which have been losing population especially on the Illinois side for so long immigrants really have a very positive impact because they're providing so many resources and creating jobs and doing jobs that most other people are not doing” Strunk said.

In the past few years however tighter immigration policies and pandemic-related immigration restrictions and backlogs have put additional roadblocks in the paths of newcomers looking to come to relocate in the Quad-Cities. On the whole some 2 million immigrants who'd otherwise have worked in the United States have been shut out of the country according to a Business Insider analysis of census immigration data.

Locally missing migrant workers are one layer of a complex labor landscape in which employers are struggling to find workers especially in service construction and other fields considered essential.

“There's a huge slowdown in visa processing and a huge backlog in visas” Strunk said. “And so this is really contributing to job shortages in areas where immigrants make up a really big part of the labor force.”

Overall visa issuance declined by 4.7 million in fiscal 2020 according to the State Department. Many would’ve gone to short-term visitors but thousands would have gone to workers.

For some the wait time is scheduling an interview. According to the State Department’s monthly numbers more than 400000 eligible immigrant visa applicants are waiting on an interview. In 2019 it was typically closer to 60000.

New Americans in the Quad-Cities

New Americans in the Quad-Cities according to the Augustana report are more likely to work in manufacturing (40.3%) educational services health care and social assistance (13.2%) and arts entertainment recreation accommodation and food services.

Most foreign-born Quad-Cities residents have been in the U.S. for at least 10 years. About 42% of residents are naturalized citizens meaning they went through the application process and became U.S. citizens. That number is higher for newcomers who arrived before 2000 — 64.2% are naturalized citizens.

New Americans also spend quite a bit too according to the Augustana analysis. Foreign-born Quad-Cities residents pay close to $15 million in annual state local and federal taxes and have spending power (subtracting taxes from income) of $36.5 million.

“There's certainly some debate in the in the public about whether immigration helps or hurts the economy. I think for the most part though economists and I think we see this now that immigrants really have a positive impact on the economy” Strunk said. “Immigrants tend to start businesses at much higher rates than native-born folks in the United States. And they're creating jobs at a higher rate than native-born people. And then there are a lot of positive multiplier effects creating those jobs but then also filling essential worker positions.

“We also see a lot of refugees who are resettled in other metro areas who choose to come to the Quad Cities"" Strunk added. ""Which I think speaks to the way that school districts and other institutions are doing a lot of good work in welcoming people and helping them find resources. My kids are in the Rock Island schools I'm amazed at how they are incorporating a lot of kids from so many different backgrounds and providing a welcoming environment.”

New Americans are more likely to open businesses

Salvador Castañeda’s eyes light up when he talks about his vision for his new business. He plan to convert an old seed-operation complex into an establishment that blends salsa dancing beer drinking and coffee brewing. He and his wife hope to open this spring once the building remodel is complete.

He came to the U.S. when he was 7 years old with his parents on vacation.

“I like to joke around that we came on vacation and just we never went back” he said.

Castañeda spent the rest of his childhood in Moline. He didn’t know any English but remembers it being not too difficult to learn. Many friends and people in his school and neighborhood knew Spanish and helped him translate.

“I know that my parents went through very difficult times when we were growing up here in the U.S.” Castañeda said. “But they did a really good job of hiding that from us.”

Before his family was granted amnesty under a Ronald Reagan-era bill that legalized most undocumented immigrants that arrived in the U.S. before 1982 Castañeda said his father would work long hours for less than minimum wage and his parents did whatever they could to hide the challenges from their kids.

“The story basically is that in the beginning my dad used to work a lot of hours but they wouldn't pay him very much because he wasn't a legal working person here in the U.S… He would go home with less money than what he was expecting and I guess for I don't know for how long but my parents used to basically go get cans out of the dumpsters for us to eat. But we never knew that.”

At 18 Castañeda wanted someday to own a nightclub. He joined the Air Force after graduating high school and during his service he deejayed and taught salsa lessons for a short time. It fanned a flame to one day own his own establishment.

Now at 47 after becoming a U.S. citizen six kids a move to Eldridge and starting up an IT consulting business he and his wife Jessica are opening the Granary a brewery and coffee shop 219 N 1st St. Eldridge that draws inspiration from their experiences traveling Central America and the Western U.S.

Castañeda attributes his entrepreneurship more to his personality and continuing interest in the business field than how he came to be a U.S. citizen. His parents though he credits with molding him into a big dreamer.

Quad-Cities immigrants are more likely to start businesses

Nationally first-generation Americans like Castañeda are more likely to open businesses and be self-employed. According to the New American Economy’s analysis of the American Community Survey in 2019 immigrant entrepreneurs made up 21.7% of all business owners in the U.S. but 13.6% of the population and 17.1% of the U.S. labor force.

In the Quad-Cities new Americans are slightly more likely to be self-employed entrepreneurs than U.S.-born Quad-Cities residents 5.2% compared to 4.5%.

“A lot of times immigrants tend to have a lot of skills but they don't necessarily translate to the U.S. job market” Strunk said. “So they may have degrees aren't recognized in the states or they may have certain sets of skills that that don't necessarily translate to jobs that are available. That's one reason we tend to see immigrants who are self-employed.”

Countless examples exist of newcomers opening businesses to fit a need not yet met especially in the Quad-Cities.

Jean Baptiste a Rwandan refugee opened a transportation service that shuttled people to and from medical appointments after he noticed many newcomers without cars had difficulty making those appointments without reliable transportation.

Wilfried Ahokpe handles his own trucking operation from his East Moline home setting his own schedule and contracts with his own truck and shipping goods cross-country in a short-handed industry.

Ahokpe won a visa lottery to come to the U.S. from the West African country of Benin. He'd graduated college in Côte d'Ivoire with a degree in computer processing and landed a job working as a contractor with the government. In a spur of the moment decision he applied for a visa and to his surprise won the lottery. When he first arrived in Virginia Beach Virginia he could only find a low-wage job housekeeping. He decided to keep looking and moved to the Quad-Cities on word that there were higher-paying manufacturing jobs like at Tyson Foods that hired newcomers.

Now he owns a home in East Moline with his wife and helped to grow and represent an organization of Beninese Americans in the Quad-Cities which helps newcomers with job applications growing their businesses home-buying navigating government processes and building a familiar community of people from Benin.

Ahokpe said already he's advised four or five families on how to buy a house.

""I explained you can do it too"" Ahokpe said. ""I explained to them that it is not very very hard to buy a house. It is not very very hard if you want to open your business. So I share my experience with all of them so they know that they can also do stuff like that. To help themselves and their family and their community.""

Organizations in the Quad-Cities exist that are dedicated to lending a helping hand to newcomer entrepreneurs: Mercado on Fifth which hosts an outdoor market in Moline serves as a resource and catalyst for minority entrepreneurs and works with both English and Spanish-speaking entrepreneurs to help start and grow their businesses. In 2022 Mercado plans to open a new 6300 square-foot indoor space with 5000 square feet of adjacent patio space according to Mercado’s website.

The Hispanic Chamber of Commerce started in mid-2000s likewise connects business owners with resources in Spanish and English. In 2018 the Des Moines-based Immigrant Entrepreneurs Summit held a workshop event for immigrant and refugee entrepreneurs in Moline. Blackhawk College offers a Food Protection Manager Certification class in Spanish. And general business resources like the Western Illinois University Quad-Cities Small Business Development Center help too.

Nationally a 2018 study by the National Foundation for American Policy found that immigrants started 55% of the U.S.’s startup companies valued at $1 billion or more or 50 of 91.

Strunk suggests the Quad-Cities add more resources for immigrants. “So classes to help immigrants learn about all the ins and outs of starting a business in the United States"" he said. ""We could have more funding for ESL classes. I think language barriers can be a huge barrier to either finding a job or finding a job that allows for social mobility.”

Quad-City businesses facilitate immigrant growth

Tyson Foods launched a program called Immigrant Connection which puts Department of Justice-certified legal experts into plants with particularly large share of members that have an immigrant status to help them fill out work authorization papers to keep up to date as well as answer questions on applying for citizenship.

With the legal expert the goal is to meet workers where they’re at and remove barriers to accessing legal expertise: needing to travel long distances wait months for a local appointment opening or pay thousands for that legal expertise.

“Really the goal is to help them become more stable as an employee help them improve their quality of life as a human by removing these immigration status barriers"" said Garrett Dolan a Tyson senior manager.

At Joslin nearly half of the employees have an immigration status of some kind Dolan said. And of Tyson's 120000 hourly workforce in 30 states about a third of those have some kind of immigration status.

Carolyn O’Connor from Esperanza Legal Assistance Center said on her first day in January at the Joslin plant the immigrant connection team saw 15 people on a myriad of issues around work authorization and citizenship questions. They plan to only have 12 30-minute appointments a day so O'Connor said there was more engagement than they were expecting.

O'Connor said common questions included asking what to do about updated work authorization that they've been waiting on which O'Connor said sometimes there are ways to help push the process along that the average person probably doesn't know about or clearing up misinformation or hearsay about the citizenship application process.

“Some of the questions were around I've already filed but my stuff is sitting there. And there are avenues to push paperwork forward. They can take time but very few people know about those methods"" O'Connor said.

""One of the things that really made me happy about it was you know they come in with very big eyes very concerned very worried. And then they walk away with a smile of OK I've got someone in my corner"" O'Connor added.

The immigrant connection program has certified legal people physically in-person in 40 of Tyson's roughly 115 plants Dolan said. The remaining ones have access to legal expert appointments remotely. Dolan said Tyson reimburses the application fee and pays for the legal services.

""We often say the immigration pathway in the United States is like a maze with moving walls. And since Carolyn is always in that maze and I'm always in that maze we know what walls are moving"" said Zach Szmara executive director of Immigrant Connection.

International students choose the Quad-Cities to study

Lewis Moston remembers his first night at St. Ambrose very clearly. At 1 a.m. he’d just landed at the Moline airport it was pouring rain and he was locked out of the residence hall he soon would call home. But the story gets better from there he said. He played soccer on a scholarship and met and married a classmate. The couple now have a baby on the way. An internship turned into a job at Aronson Group LLC a Bettendorf-based insurance company specializing in transportation after he graduated in December 2019. He returned to England in March 2020 when his father died just before the onset of a global pandemic keeping him in England for an extended two month stay while he to keep his visa needed to keep working 40 hours a week about 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. he said.

After his student visa expired delays in getting work authorization meant he had to take a forced hiatus unpaid from work that ended up lasting 10 months. He got a green card six months ago.

At Augustana University about 11.9% of its roughly 2400 students in 2020 were international students. St. Ambrose enrolls about 120 international students each year.

Soon Moston said he hopes to begin applying for citizenship. With a family now here he’d like to move more freely between the UK and the U.S.

“The cost of living here in Iowa is a lot cheaper than other parts of the country” Moston said. “…In comparison the cost of living is low and the income is a good start. So that's kind of why we're still here.”",,,,,,

CASE SUMMARY

The indictment in this matter alleges that between August 2011 and March 2013 Oleksii Volodymyrovych Bystrov and his co-conspirators fraudulently obtained the online banking login credentials belonging to numerous customers of a U.S. financial institution. Using those credentials without the knowledge or authorization of the rightful accountholders Bystrov and his associates setup ACH (Automated Clearing House) links between those victim accounts and destination accounts controlled by Bystrov and his associates. In doing so Bystrov and his co-conspirators falsely represented themselves as the legitimate customers of the U.S. financial institution and subsequently caused and attempted to cause said U.S. financial institution to execute wire transfers into bank accounts controlled by Bystrov and his associates. Furthermore Bystrov and his co-conspirators changed the verification phone numbers and verification email addresses on the victim accounts to phone numbers and email accounts under the control of the fraudsters. In this manner the conspirators sought to evade bank scrutiny of the unauthorized transfers of funds.

Bystrov is charged with aggravated identity theft wire fraud bank fraud and conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud.

The prosecution is being handled by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California.

The charges and allegations contained in the indictment are merely accusations and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

Then her bank froze the savings she needed to move on,"Brauns | E+ | Getty Images

Siraba Keita survived New York's deadliest fire in decades — only to see her bank freeze the savings she needed to pick up the pieces. Her story reflects the hardship of many low-income Americans in a system that seems to prioritize debt collectors over a bank's customers according to consumer advocates. Keita and her four children lived in an apartment building on East 181st Street in the Bronx where a blaze killed 17 people on Jan. 9. The family was on the third floor of the 19-story complex — the same floor where a faulty space heater ignited the flames. ""We lost everything not just the house — clothes shoes everything"" said Keita 39 an immigrant from Mali in West Africa. When Keita a J.P. Morgan Chase customer tried using her bank card shortly thereafter the transaction was denied. Unbeknownst to Keita a creditor had gotten a court order to freeze her money — the vestiges of old credit card debt that had spiraled out of control.

watch now

New York law automatically protects up to $3600 from such a freeze; additional funds like monthly child tax credit payments may also be protected. Many states have variations of these rules to help customers subsist while settling a debt dispute and federal law offers immunity to benefits like Social Security. But Chase withheld all of Keita's savings — more than $5000 — for weeks despite several trips to her local bank branch and repeated phone calls she and her attorney said. Prior to the fire Keita had been living on her savings government benefits like food stamps and by selling her jewelry. She'd stopped working as a nursing assistant to care for her 3-year-old son who has autism. ""I have all my money in there"" Keita said of her account. ""This was all my life.""

CNBC reached out for comment from the bank but a Chase spokesman said they were unable to discuss specifics of Keita's case due to privacy reasons. ""When we receive a restraining notice tied to a New York court-ordered judgment against a customer to freeze funds they owe to a creditor we comply with the law and notify our customers in writing to explain what is happening and the steps they need to take to gain access to exempted funds"" the spokesman said.

CNBC identified other individuals who like Keita believe their bank broke the law by freezing funds improperly due to a debt judgment. Low earners bear the brunt of this — a group most likely to turn to high-interest debt but with the least ability to repay it according to consumer advocates. While it's unclear exactly how many people this happens to each year debt collectors have been suing consumers more frequently in court.

I saved my money for a rainy day. And then it's a rainy day and I can't get the umbrella. Taneesha Woodyear Harlem resident

The number of debt-collection lawsuits in state civil court more than doubled nationwide to about 4 million from 1993 to 2013 according to The Pew Charitable Trusts a nonpartisan research organization. Available data suggests that trend has continued it said. Such lawsuits make up about one of every four civil cases in state court; the ratio was one in nine in the early 90s Pew found. Debt lawsuits are likely to spike as most pandemic-era financial protections (like eviction and foreclosure moratoria) come to an end according to the National Consumer Law Center. Debt collection was already the second-largest source of complaints to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2020. Over half were for attempts to collect on a debt that wasn't owed.

And household debt at an all-time high of $16 trillion grew at its fastest pace since 2007 in the fourth quarter according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. ""I've been seeing it more than I would like to"" Mary McCune an attorney at Legal Services NYC who is representing Keita said of banks freezing funds they likely shouldn't. ""It feels like we're in Dickensian times sometimes"" McCune added. ""It's the criminalization of poverty."" Other consumer advocates think banks have gotten better at complying with the law though. ""In years past I've certainly seen banks do that"" according to Cliff Dorsen an attorney at Skaar and Feagle in Georgia which handles consumer rights cases. ""I haven't seen it in a while."" ""It doesn't mean they're not doing it"" he added. ""But no one's calling us about it.""

'Not a bad person'

In Keita's case she owed Discover Bank about $5200 in credit-card debt (including principal and interest) documents show. She tried paying off the debt in installments of $100 to $200 a month but couldn't keep up. Discouraged she stopped looking at notices. She doesn't use credit cards anymore. ""I didn't mean for it to end up like that"" Keita said. ""I'm not a bad person. I can't pay."" Some customers were unaware the debt even existed only learning of it after their bank turned off the spigot. Even then they weren't privy to the debt's origination — leaving them guessing as to its authenticity and navigating a legal morass.

I have all my money in there. This was all my life. Siraba Keita Bronx resident

Taneesha Woodyear 49 learned of a $2400 debt only after Chase called to notify her of an overdrawn account. She ultimately waited more than five months from May to October 2021 to access her savings. ""I saved my money for a rainy day"" said Woodyear who lives in Harlem. ""And then it's a rainy day and I can't get the umbrella."" The bank froze her funds after getting a restraining notice from Judgment Recovery Partners LLC a debt collector based in New York. The judgment was over a decade old dating from January 2011 according to documents filed in the Civil Court of the City of New York. (A different debt buyer Advantage Assets II Inc. had obtained the 2011 judgment; Judgment Recovery Partners later bought the debt and was trying to collect.) It was a ""default"" judgment meaning the court automatically ruled in favor of the debt collector because Woodyear who didn't know of the debt didn't show up to a hearing. (About 70% of debt-collection cases are decided by such default judgments according to Pew.) Interest keeps accruing on such loans though — and Woodyear's debt had ballooned to more than $4600. Collectors are third parties that buy up loans (like medical and student debt) at a discount and try to recoup the funds.

A common experience

It's not uncommon for consumers not to know of a debt until it's too late according to Carolyn Carter deputy director of the National Consumer Law Center. For example she said: What if a renter moves out of an apartment thinking it's in fine condition but the landlord sues for cleaning costs? The renter may not think they owe money if they never receive that bill. Or perhaps you co-sign a car loan for a friend child or aunt but they fall behind on payments years later. You may be on the hook and not suspect it. The court wouldn't tell Woodyear or her attorneys where her debt initially came from; she suspects it was from around the time her mom died when her finances temporarily fell into disarray. Woodyear had $7180 in her bank account — well exceeding the $4600 debt judgment. However New York state law lets banks freeze twice the total amount of the judgment (in this case the restraint amounted to roughly $9200) meaning her whole account was locked.

It feels like we're in Dickensian times sometimes. It's the criminalization of poverty. Mary McCune attorney at Legal Services NYC

In so doing her attorneys Ahmad Keshavarz and Emma Caterine claim the bank broke state law (the Exempt Income Protection Act) which should have left $3600 untouched. Pandemic-era rules should have also granted her access to other funds (like federal stimulus payments from March 2021 and later child tax credit payments for her 11-year-old) the attorneys said. The freeze persisted even after a judge threw out Woodyear's debt judgment on May 25 according to court documents. Chase ultimately granted access in the fall months later. ""I had a struggle paying my rent paying my bills even buying my 11-year-old clothes sneakers toiletries"" said Woodyear. ""It's your money and the bank is saying you can't have it."" A spokesman for Chase couldn't comment on the specifics of Woodyear's case for privacy reasons. He reiterated that the bank follows the law and notifies customers of steps to take to access their funds.

A range of rules

Every state but one (Delaware) allows creditors seize bank accounts to satisfy debt according to Carter of the National Consumer Law Center. Like New York these states have exemption laws that protect certain funds from seizure. They vary greatly between states. Arizona for example exempts just $300 in a bank account. But other assets are off-limits too: a home worth up to $250000 a car worth $6000 and $6000 in household goods according to the National Consumer Law Center. Mississippi protects a home worth $75000; it gives an additional ""wildcard"" exemption for $10000 which debtors can apply to any property (a car bank account household goods).

Six states (California Connecticut Massachusetts Nevada New York and Washington) have ""self-executing"" rules Carter said. They automatically exempt a certain dollar amount in bank accounts from garnishment without action on a consumer's part she said. That means in most states bank funds can be frozen as soon as a debt collector furnishes a garnishment order. Consumers must take procedural steps (typically filing court papers or attending hearings) to claim the protections. Even if they can navigate the legal thicket these processes can take weeks maybe months according to consumer advocates. Delays can have cascading effects: Outstanding checks may bounce late fees can pile up landlords may move to evict credit scores may suffer and so on.

'Afraid to check'

New York has among the strongest protections relative to other states according to the National Consumer Law Center. Yet even there customers still need to file paperwork to access some protected funds (like unemployment benefits) if they exceed the $3600 blanket threshold. The forms must be filed to the bank and creditor within 20 days; then the creditor has a week to object in court. Assuming this process goes smoothly the bank frees up the money. Aboubacar 58 an immigrant from Cote d'Ivoire in West Africa filed that Exemption Claim Form within the 20-day window according to Susan Shin legal director of the New Economy Project which gives advice to low-income New York City residents including Aboubacar. (He asked to use only his first name for privacy reasons.) Capital One his bank left about $10000 unfrozen. But it also withheld thousands of dollars of protected funds including a Small Business Administration disaster loan unemployment benefits and child tax credit payments according to bank records. He waited from September 2021 to January 2022 for Capital One to free up the money. Aboubacar's debt judgment dated to 2000; its source is a mystery. Since the judgment was more than 20 years old it wasn't legally enforceable since it exceeded New York's statute of limitation Shin said.

The problem is when the banks make a mistake and don't act to remedy their mistake. They leave the customer at the mercy of the debt collectors who hold all the power. Susan Shin legal director of the New Economy Project

A single father of four Aboubacar drives for a ride-share service and made about $25000 a year at the time his account was frozen. ""His income puts him and his family below the federal poverty line and their financial hardship was greatly exacerbated by the months-long restraint"" Shin said. A Capital One spokesperson said the bank acted lawfully in Aboubacar's case. The bank ""never received a signed and dated exemption claim form from the customer"" according to the bank spokesperson. That triggered a lengthy process involving a court hearing and the relay of the court's decision to the NYC Marshal's office the plaintiff's attorney's office and then Capital One to process the order the spokesperson said. The bank ultimately released the account on Jan. 19. It seems Aboubacar mailed his Exemption Claim Form in the appropriate amount of time. Capital One initially notified him Sept. 9 of the account withholding the bank said. Signed and dated forms addressed to the bank and creditor's attorney were mailed on Sept. 28 within the 20-day window according to a copy of a United States Postal Service Certificate of Mailing which was obtained and reviewed by CNBC. It's unclear what happened after that — if the bank didn't receive the forms at all or if the bank received them and deemed them insufficient for example. A bank spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment on this point.

UBER,Uber,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZ1bHR1cmUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvc3VwZXItcHVtcGVkLXRoZS1iYXR0bGUtZm9yLXViZXItc2Vhc29uLTEtZXBpc29kZS00LXJlY2FwLWJvb2Jlci5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Super Pumped: The Battle For Uber' Season 1 Episode 4 Recap,"In the first scene of this terrific episode Travis Kalanick likens himself to General George S. Patton when talking about his Uber “family” a typically odd and distasteful reference especially as it comes after news that a dozen Uber drivers have been murdered in Brazil. His callousness recalls another military man once played by George C. Scott in the movies General “Buck” Turgidson in Dr. Strangelove. Advising the president in the War Room over nuclear war scenarios with the Soviet Union Turgidson offers the “admittedly regrettable” possibility of 20 million dead rather than 150 million people killed. The president aghast says he’s talking about mass murder not war. To which Turgidson replies “Mr. President I’m not saying we wouldn’t get our hair mussed.”

Uber is getting its hair mussed in “Boober” and the dead Brazilian drivers are only one strand among many. Travis’ brand of scorched-earth capitalism unchecked by morality or empathy or even a scintilla of self-awareness is starting to come back to haunt him. To him other people seem to fall under two categories: Those who can help him and those who are enemies and it doesn’t take much for the helpers to become enemies if he feels like they’re obstacles to his world-domination plan. Bill his supposed mentor and chief investor is an enemy for suggesting that adding tips will make his miserable drivers happier. Austin his multi-city driver-relations maestro is a hassle for asking him to stop the rampant sexual harassment in the company. Gabi his girlfriend is an enemy for chatting with Google’s Sergey Brin at a conference because he’s the one who should be getting the attention.

If all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail and Travis pounds away obliviously never thinking about how his recklessness might endanger his company (which he cares about) much less his employees and passengers (who he doesn’t). His obsession is the growth and increased valuation of Uber which has the added effect of shielding him from accountability inside the company because he’s making everyone filthy rich. “When I walk in this room” he tells his board “it should be like Kirk Gibson walking into Dodger Stadium — one loud long cheer that goes on the whole fucking game.” As the episode unfolds he cannot stop seething about Bill David Drummond and the other turncoats on the board trying to rein him in. Their job is to indulge him. Any advice to change course sounds like a sinister conspiracy.

The issue with the drivers extends beyond the immediate mortal threat in Brazil though Bill wants to make it clear that protests over safety could undermine the company’s continued global expansion. The bigger problem is that drivers have lost the incentives that brought them on board and now they’re having to work brutal hours to make ends meet which is part of the argument for tips. But in Travis’ thinking screwing over drivers and passengers is a feature not a bug. The whole point of “disrupting” the cab industry was to eliminate competition and make Uber the sole option for all parties. Making Uber a “good” company isn’t the goal for Travis as it might be for Bill. When Bill warns that people might stop using Uber Travis lays out his philosophy in a speech that lifts the veil on Silicon Valley revolutionaries:

“Just like they’re going to stop shopping at Walmart and stop eating at McDonald’s? Everyone knows those are shit-heel companies but no one gives a fuck because the price is dirt cheap and the fries are delicious. We consume what we want and our brains figure out a way to justify it later.”

With this speech Travis feels back on that airport runway with Bill looking unimpressed at the private jets around him when what he really wants is a hangar full of them. Uber is to be thought about as a route to wealth and power and all those surveys and reports about unhappy (or murdered) drivers and customers are not worth considering if making adjustments impedes growth. The mere suggestion of a course correction sounds to Travis’ ears like an implicit and mutinous attack on his decision-making. He displays a combination of supreme arrogance and hypersensitivity that isn’t healthy for any leader much less one this prone to mistakes.

The title of the episode “Boober” references a GQ interview with Kalanick in 2014 where he bragged about his sex life — not the first time a man has done so in the pages of Gentleman’s Quarterly but not something the head of a company should say. Earlier in the season the party in Las Vegas suggested a top-down frat-boy culture at Uber that manifests itself in the office here to powerful effect. First we follow a new woman engineer who gets assigned to a top team at the company only to get harassed immediately by her supervisor who sends her DMs about how he and his girlfriend have an open relationship. When she takes a complaint to HR she’s startled to find herself rebuffed. (“I don’t really see the need to ruin his life over something so small.”) And when she talks to Austin about it she’s again surprised to get a colorful grin-and-bear-it retort: “We basically signed up to work in the middle of Mardi Gras” says Austin. “We’re not going to show our tits for a bunch of beads but there’s nothing we can do to stop the parade.”

That all of these conversations happen between women at the company is a fascinating and persuasive example of how the victims of a sexist corporate culture can wind up reinforcing it against their better judgment. Austin has just had her own repulsive encounter with an Uber colleague at a party where a drunken team member ran a hand up her leg. And because she’s “Employee Four” at the company she can go directly to Travis to complain about it. Travis initially flies into a rage (“I’m going to dismantle that motherfucker”) which isn’t helpful in its own right but his actual solution to tell the offender never to do it again makes things worse for Austin. When she goes back to Travis a second time his message is that “assholes” get things done and tolerating them is a small price for a multimillion-dollar piece of the company.

The Mardi Gras analogy then is rational under the circumstances: The choices at Uber for a woman who likes her work and wants to make money is to accept harassment as the trade-off. If they want to be part of the team they’ll have to survive a night out at the bar or the strip club. And it’s not like Uber has any more respect for the privacy of its office workers as it does for its app users: The excellent director of the episode John Dahl (Rounders The Last Seduction) turns the open-office space into a hotbed of paranoia and dread a fishbowl where people can spy on and intimidate each other. It’s corporate transparency of the worst kind.

Off The Meter

• One issue with Super Pumped as with Billions is that it can be energetic to a fault. The tempo is most appropriate to the lives of Type-A moral monsters but devices like the video game-style “Boardroom Brawl” sequence with Quentin Tarantino narration are too flashy by half. (And a QT line later in the episode “This is not somebody who says the first thing that pops into her cabeza daddio” made me break out in hives.)

• This will pay off in future episodes presumably but Uber’s efforts to circumvent Apple’s privacy policies by “geoblocking” Apple headquarters in Cupertino are still so breathtakingly audacious to consider. And also a sign that Travis simply doesn’t know what he’s doing. It’s amateur hour.

• Uma Thurman’s Arianna Huffington impersonation is a little iffy but people who have worked in the media for a while can certainly recognize the connection between Uber and The Huffington Post regarding employee relations. The narration efficiently assesses HuffPo as an operation where “writers didn’t get paid dick” and Huffington sold her piece for $300 million.

• Travis’ hilariously dopey braggadocio comes out when he tries to lure a self-driving car engineer from Google: “They’re the establishment man. We’re the renegades. I take fear I mix it up with some Iams and I feed it to my dog for breakfast.”

• The Dean Martin example Travis likes to use in reference to his sexist posturing in interviews ricochets beautifully in his last meeting with Austin. “It’s a persona” he tells her. “Dean Martin drank milk.” To which Austin replies “No that was counter spin. He had fucking liver failure.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDIyL21hci8yMC9hZmdoYW5pc3RhbnMtZm9ybWVyLWZpbmFuY2UtbWluaXN0ZXItaXMtbm93LXViZXItZHJpdmVyLWluLXdhc2hpbmd0b24tZGPSAXZodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vd29ybGQvMjAyMi9tYXIvMjAvYWZnaGFuaXN0YW5zLWZvcm1lci1maW5hbmNlLW1pbmlzdGVyLWlzLW5vdy11YmVyLWRyaXZlci1pbi13YXNoaW5ndG9uLWRj?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Afghanistan’s former finance minister is now Uber driver in Washington DC,"Days before Afghanistan fell to the Taliban last August Ashraf Ghani the Afghan president was “welcomed” to the United Arab Emirates. He was alleged to have taken with him $169m from his country’s treasury.

Six months on Khalid Payenda once Ghani’s finance minister is driving an Uber in Washington DC.

“If I complete 50 trips in the next two days I receive a $95 bonus” Payenda told the Washington Post from behind the wheel of a Honda Accord.

The 40-year-old once oversaw a US-supported $6bn budget. The Post reported that in one night earlier this week he made “a little over $150 for six hours’ work not counting his commute – a mediocre night”.

The Post recorded Payenda telling one passenger his move from Kabul to Washington had been “quite an adjustment”.

He also said he was grateful for the opportunity to be able to support his family but “right now I don’t have any place. I don’t belong here and I don’t belong there. It’s a very empty feeling.”

Afghanistan faces a humanitarian and economic crisis assets frozen and cut off from international aid that would require recognition of the Taliban government which replaced the US-supported regime.

The Post described Payenda’s experience in late 2020 when his mother died of Covid-19 in an impoverished Kabul hospital. He became finance minister after that. The Post said he now wished he had not.

“I saw a lot of ugliness and we failed” he said. “I was part of the failure. It’s difficult when you look at the misery of the people and you feel responsible.”

Payenda told the Post he believed Afghans “didn’t have the collective will to reform to be serious”. But he also said the US betrayed its commitment to democracy and human rights after making Afghanistan a centerpiece of post-9/11 policy.

“Maybe there were good intentions initially but the United States probably didn’t mean this” Payenda said.

Payenda resigned as finance minister a week before the Taliban seized Kabul as his relationship with Ghani deteriorated. Fearing the president would have him arrested he left for the US where he joined his family.

“We had 20 years and the whole world’s support to build a system that would work for the people” Payenda said in a text message to a World Bank official in Kabul on the day the capital fell quoted by the Post.

“All we built was a house of cards that came down crashing this fast. A house of cards built on the foundation of corruption.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9lY29ub215L3ViZXItbHlmdC1kcml2ZXJzLWNvbnNpZGVyLXF1aXR0aW5nLWFzLXBhaW4tYXQtdGhlLWdhcy1wdW1wLWdyb3dz0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2Vjb25vbXkvdWJlci1seWZ0LWRyaXZlcnMtY29uc2lkZXItcXVpdHRpbmctYXMtcGFpbi1hdC10aGUtZ2FzLXB1bXAtZ3Jvd3MuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber Lyft drivers consider quitting as pain at the gas pump grows,"A number of Uber and Lyft drivers are considering quitting the app-based ride-hailing platforms as fueling up becomes costlier with some calling the newly announced surcharges ""insulting"".

The companies announced this month a 55-cent per-ride surcharge that would be paid directly to drivers in response to record gas prices because of the Ukraine crisis.

But Uber and Lyft drivers who form a big chunk of the gig economy and typically pay for their own gas are not happy.

GAS PRICES: DIESEL NEARS $7 PER GALLON IN CALIFORNIA

A survey of over 300 drivers conducted by the Rideshare Guy a popular blog followed by drivers showed about 15% of them had already quit driving and nearly 40% were driving less.

""It's rather insulting that they even suggest 55 cents per ride because you have rides that are two minutes long and then you have rides that are an hour long"" said Fabricio Lombeyda a part-time driver in Buford Georgia.

Uber and Lyft however have said the number of active drivers on their platforms is steadily rising as people return to offices book more rides to airports and nightlife resumes.

""We've not seen a decline in the number of drivers on the platform or the hours they drive when for example you compare March to January"" Lyft said in a statement.

UBER TO ROLL OUT FUEL SURCHARGE IN UNITED STATES AMID HIGH GAS PRICES

Lyft cited an internal analysis that showed drivers in the United States were spending on average of 75 cents more on gas per hour but were still earning more per hour than they were a year ago when the pandemic dimmed demand for rideshare.

Uber lifted its core profit forecast earlier this month on faster-than-expected growth in rideshare demand.

Both companies however face the prospect of drivers quitting as runaway fuel prices burn a hole in their pockets.

""There is some risk of driver departures otherwise you would not have seen both Uber and Lyft institute surcharges"" MScience analyst Michael Erstad said.

Ticker Security Last Change Change % LYFT LYFT INC. 17.52 +0.32 +1.86% UBER UBER TECHNOLOGIES INC. 71.51 +2.28 +3.29%

Another survey by Coworker.org that polled over 200 participants showed 90% agreed the surcharges were just not sufficient and that they would not be able to afford to take longer rides.

The business model of ride-hailing companies was based on gas being $3 per gallon said David Marcotte a senior vice president at data analytics firm Kantar.

But gas prices on Friday stood at $4.27 per gallon even surpassing $5 a gallon in some parts of the country.

He also warned a rollback of the surcharge could cause more problems in an already strained labor market making a loose connection to retail workers seeking better wages after the reversal of ""hero pay"" offered during the height of the pandemic.

For now drivers are caught between a rock and a hard place.

""First and foremost we have been trying to get higher wages per trip even before the gas prices went up.

After two decades of conflict the United States withdrew from Afghanistan in August 2021.Months before the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan former President Donald Trump's government signed a conditional peace deal with the militant group in February 2020 vowing to pull out the US troops over 14 months. The agreement notably did not include the Aghan government.Senior US officials have mostly moved on from the Afghanistan war which started 20 years earlier with high-minded promises of democracy human rights and women's rights and concluded with an American president accusing Afghans such as a Payenda for the mess that was left behind.As Payenda's relationship with Ghani deteriorated he resigned as the finance minister a week before the Taliban captured Kabul.

Instacart is the latest platform to add a temporary fuel surcharge to customers' orders.

The grocery delivery company said in a blogpost that orders would cost an extra 40 cents.

The company joins Uber and Lyft in adding surcharges to help offset rising gas costs for drivers.

Grocery delivery company Instacart has joined Uber and Lyft in adding a temporary fuel surcharge to customers' orders to help cover the skyrocketing gas prices its drivers are paying.

In a blogpost on Friday Instacart wrote: ""We're implementing a temporary surcharge on customer orders to help offset the increased cost of gas over the next month.""

It added: ""This surcharge will add an additional $.40 on customer orders across our marketplace with a clear indication of the fuel surcharge on the batch before you accept it.""

Gas prices have reached record highs after the Biden administration said it would ban imports of Russian oil in a retaliatory move against the country's invasion of Ukraine.

Insider's Dominick Reuter reported that the US is likely to see $5 per gallon before prices start to come back down.

To aid transparency Instacart said that customers will be able to see the fuel surcharge on their order.

""In a time of increased fuel costs across North America we know that every cent counts and we're hopeful this temporary fuel assistance will help offset some of the near-term challenges that shoppers are facing"" said Tom Maguire vice president of operations and care at Instacart.

Recently Uber announced that riders would pay a surcharge of up to 55 cents for each ride and that the fees would go to drivers. Uber Eats orders would cost an additional 35 or 45 cents the company said.

There's no shortage of facial oils that can rightfully heal skin concerns yet argan oil is arguably one of the most popular. The antioxidant-rich ingredient brings multiple benefits to dry skin (and hair) such as reducing inflammation and acne and softening fine lines and wrinkles. It's for this reason Josie Maran includes it in every single one of its skincare products — and for today only you can snag the best-selling Whipped Argan Oil Face Butter for half-off during Ulta's 21 Days of Beauty Sale.

Josie Maran sources its 100 percent pure argan oil from a UNESCO-protected region in southwestern Morocco collecting only argan nuts that have naturally fallen to the ground in an effort to prevent deforestation according to the Josie Maran site. This sustainably-sourced argan oil is what makes the brand's products including the Whipped Argan Oil Face Butter so effective.

You don't have to go all out with colorful eyeshadow looks paired with bright lips but something as small as adding a warmer pink blush on your cheeks can easily take your look from winter to spring.

Eyeliner upgrade



@walker_ash

If a black or brown wing is part of your everyday makeup routine consider changing it up this spring. You can start slow by trying out a navy blue or purple liner (we heart L.A. Girl's Shockwave Eyeliner in Vivid $4.49 ulta.com) but soon enough you'll be bold enough to try out some more vibrant colors and eyeliner styles. You might even find the perfect color to make your eyes pop!

Pigmented blush



@kennedyclairewalsh

This is perhaps the easiest way to bring color into your makeup routine. For the spring blush becomes an essential item in our routines—for that perfect sunkissed look. While you might've worn light pink shades throughout the winter try out some warmer coral shades for the springtime. We recommend Rare Beauty's Stay Vulnerable Melting Cream Blush in Nearly Apricot $21 sephora.com.

Bold lip



@char_barker

If you're not a huge fan of heavy eye makeup looks and prefer a more natural base you can show color through your lipstick. A bold lip can be a bright red or more subtle with a pigmented gloss (like Tower 28 Beauty's ShineOn Jelly Lip Gloss $15 sephora.com). With a bold lip you'll look instantly put together—and get an extra shot of confidence natch.

Colorful mascara



@sophialacorteee

A super fun option is to play around with your mascara. Switch out your go-to black mascara for a vibrant blue hue. You can also find tons of other colors to make your eye color stand out or to match your outfits. Regardless our current fave is Benefit Cosmetic's BADGal BANG! Volumizing Mascara in Blue $27 ulta.com.

Iridescent highlighter



@neocbb

For a more subtle way to incorporate color choose an iridescent highlighter with the color you prefer such as pink or purple (we love Stila's Heaven's Hue Highlighter in Transcendence $34 ulta.com). This way you can highlight the key points of your face with a spring vibe. It's so light and fun that people will only notice the pop of color as you turn or the sun hits your face. You glow girl.

Then a YouTube dive team solved it in hours.,"Doug Bishop (left) and Anthony Giampetro (right)  divers from Adventures with Purpose return to the water at Ridley Township Municipal Marina in Ridley Park on Sunday. Ridley Township Police confirmed late Saturday night that human remains were found in a submerged vehicle and that the plate number matched a “missing person entry from December of 2003.” Read more

The out-of-town divers had barely conducted a 10-hour investigation into a missing-person case that had stymied Ridley Township investigators for nearly 20 years and most of their interviews were conducted in the back of an RV parked outside a local restaurant.

But by Saturday afternoon Doug Bishop and his crew of skilled divers and amateur detectives from Adventures with Purpose a search-and-recovery team that travels the country helping families find missing loved ones free of charge and then films their investigations for YouTube were confident that their sonar had found the Ford Explorer that James Amabile had been driving when the father of two vanished.

So Bishop of Oregon and diver Anthony Giampetro of Long Island donned their drysuits and full-face masks on a boat ramp behind Stinger’s Waterfront a trendy restaurant inside the Ridley Township Municipal Marina and plunged into the icy water. By following a long cable they had affixed to the dock they descended nearly 25 feet below the surface of a swift-moving Darby Creek and felt for the wreck in debris-filled water so dark and murky that Bishop said it was like swimming through chocolate milk.

In moments Bishop had traced his hands over the algae-covered license plate.

“We have discovered Jimmy” he radioed up.

And soon they discovered human remains still seatbelted in the driver’s seat.

By Sunday the Adventures with Purpose team returned to the Ford and working with township officials were able to retrieve most of the remains including teeth that were sent to the Medical Examiner’s Office for identification. The divers also sealed the SUV with a mesh netting to protect any remaining physical evidence for recovery.

Ridley Township Police Sgt. Marc McKinney said Sunday that the township would decide this week whether to recover the vehicle but that his department would not comment in detail about the case until a positive identification had been made. The marina had been redeveloped a few years after Amabile disappeared McKinney said with the upscale eatery and new boat ramps. Bishop said the builders had unknowingly drilled a pylon directly through the Ford’s engine bay.

“You would think someone drilling pylons into riverbed would have done a survey of the riverbed” Bishop said.

The discovery brings near-certain closure to the mystery of what happened to Amabile who was 38 and worked at the United Parcel Service center on Oregon Avenue in South Philadelphia. He had just awakened after working a nightshift and was rushing to pick up his daughters — then 5 and 8 — when he disappeared on a December afternoon in 2003. He had called the babysitter to tell her he was running late. His cell phone last pinged off a local police tower but he was never seen again.

At the time of Amabile’s disappearance his family said he wore an implanted insulin pump for his diabetes and could become confused and lose sense of where he was due to low blood sugar. They said they had come to believe he was dead because they knew he would never abandon his daughters.

On Saturday after the volunteer divers signaled their discovery Stephen Amabile said he now believes his brother must have slipped into a diabetic coma and drove into the creek after making a wrong turn.

On Sunday returning to the dock he said all those years of not knowing had felt like “purgatory.”

“Your brain goes crazy and you try to figure it out but there was never any closure zero none” he said. “Not until I was standing on that dock and he was 20 feet below me.”

Other family members had also gathered at the dock but declined comment.

Bishop said one of Amabile’s relatives contacted Adventures with Purpose last year after watching one of the diving group’s YouTube shows. Based in Portland the group was formed two years ago and Bishop said they’ve relied on skilled volunteers top-notch sonar common-sense investigations and community help to solve 20 cold cases across the country.

The YouTube shows get about 20 million views a month he said. And while on the East Coast they’re working on two other local cases. Last week they dove for evidence in the case of Michael Carty 50 — who was last seen in 2019 driving in Cape May and suffers from a cognitive disease that causes psychiatric disorders — but were unsuccessful. And this week they plan to search the Delaware River in the case of Danielle Imbo and Richard Petrone who went missing in 2005 after they were last seen walking to Petrone’s truck parked on South Street in Philadelphia.

When Adventures with Purpose arrived in Ridley Township its members set up their camper and got to work. On Saturday morning they interviewed Amabile’s family then drove the route he would have taken to the babysitter’s. They focused their search on Darby Creek after deciding two other creeks were too shallow to conceal an SUV — and researched the tides and currents from the day Amabile disappeared to settle on the stretch of water by the marina gliding back and forth in their 14-foot inflatable boats. Within moments their sonar screens showed the image of what was clearly an SUV in the water.

On Sunday after huddling with the Amabile family one last time Bishop and his divers packed up their gear.

“It’s an absolute honor and privilege to provide this service to families” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9zYXJhaC1taWNoZWxsZS1nZWxsYXItcmV2ZWFsZWQtc2hlLTE0NTYxODM5NC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sarah Michelle Gellar Revealed She Had 'Heated Moments' With One Shocking Buffy Co-Star,"If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website SheKnows may receive an affiliate commission.

Sarah Michelle Gellar will always be Buffy in our hearts. We all wanted to be her (and nothing’s changed on that) and learn everything we can about the hit series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. In a recent interview for Evan Ross Katz’s new book Into Every Generation a Slayer Is Born: How Buffy Staked Our Hearts Gellar revealed that she had a few “heated moments” with Buffy co-star and on-screen BFF Alyson Hannigan.

She said “Look we worked really hard hours. We were young we had ups and downs. Everybody had arguments.” Gellar added that another co-star David Boreanaz was reportedly a handful as well. “There were times where David [Boreanaz] could be a handful. He never really was to me but I’m sure [he was]. And I’m sure I was the same way to people also right? It wasn’t rosy. Nobody gets along all the time. And Alyson [Hannigan] and I had moments. There’s no question. But you’re young.”

Gellar added she attributes the ongoing heated set atmosphere to be a byproduct of director Joss Whedon who many past Buffy stars like Charisma Carpenter Emma Caulfield Julie Benz and Danny Strong (according to HollywoodLife) has said made the work environment pretty toxic and even abusive. “I think that unfortunately the set we were on and the world we were in was pitting us against each other. I think it would have been different if it was today. It would have been a very different relationship. But we have a great relationship now.”

Gellar also added that she’s “not excusing” herself either. “There are times where I wish I could have done things differently but I didn’t know how to handle the stress that I was under. I was really young and I didn’t have any outside life. I was the one that was always working and sometimes I would be resentful of the fact that they didn’t have to work all the time. It ebbs and flows and anyone that tells you they get along with everyone all the time it’s just not true.”

Buffy the Vampire Slayer was at one point everyone’s favorite show as it followed a girl named Buffy Summers and her friends who have to fight the evil monsters of the world. The show went on for seven years garnering a cult-like fanbase (including us.)

Municipal Marina on March 19 2022. Read more

Stephen Amabile stood by a dock along Darby Creek on Saturday morning keeping optimism in check as he waited for an independent dive team to surface from the murky water.

Amabile 63 had heard lots of theories since his brother James disappeared Dec. 4 2003 but discounted most of them for one reason: James was a family man he said devoted to his two daughters. On the day he disappeared James 38 at the time called the babysitter to tell her he was running late. He never arrived and was never seen again.

So when Amabile saw the diver’s hand emerge from the water holding the blue-and-white Pennsylvania license plate — FLA 4785 — they’d pried off the Ford Explorer he believed the closure he wasn’t expecting was placed gently in his hands.

“It’s my brother” Amabile told The Inquirer hours later. “They found him.”

Ridley Township Police Capt. James Dougherty confirmed late Saturday night that human remains were found in the vehicle. He said the plate number matched a “missing person entry from December of 2003.” He said police were not releasing the person’s name and that the Delaware County Medical Examiner’s Office was examining the remains for “positive identification.”

Amabile said the divers told him human remains were in the driver’s seat still buckled in with a seat belt. For Amabile the location of the Ford Explorer in Darby Creek just blocks from that babysitter’s home confirms his theory. He believes his brother who was diabetic had a hectic day slipped into diabetic shock and drove straight into the creek after making a wrong turn.

“He drove right into the water” Amabile said.

Adventures With a Purpose the dive team that found the vehicle and remains has a reputation for breaking missing-persons cases involving bodies of water. According to the group’s website it has recovered over 100 vehicles and helped solve 19 missing-persons cases since 2019. Amabile said a family member reached out to the group and a representative told them they’d come out Saturday. They asked if a family member could be there.

“Honestly I wasn’t expecting anything. I’ve gotten used to not expecting anything and I tuned a lot of things out” Amabile said. “But it didn’t take them very long to figure out there was an SUV down there.”

Amabile said the family didn’t pay the dive team.

“They did’t ask for anything” he said.

Diver Anthony Giampetro confirmed that human remains were found in the SUV but he said Saturday night it wasn’t certain that they were those of James Amabile since the driver’s identity had not yet been ascertained.

“At this particular moment we’re just happy that we provided closure” Giampetro said.

Amabile said family members converged on the scene as news of the diving operation spread. James’ daughters were overcome with emotion their uncle said.

“No matter what anyone ever says you’re not at peace until you get more answers” Amabile said.

According to Inquirer accounts at the time of the disappearance James Amabile wore an implanted insulin pump and could become confused and lose sense of where he was due to low blood sugar.

A Cardinal O’ Hara graduate he worked at the United Parcel Service center on Oregon Avenue in South Philadelphia. In the aftermath of his disappearance police helicopters searched the wetlands of the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum.

Stephen Amabile and his now-deceased brother Michal also walked the creeks in the area he said. Mary Amabile their mother died less than a year after her son disappeared.

Amabile said it was too soon to say what type of services might be held for James.

“I’ve been able to learn a lot about the transportation industry and the Bennett Family of Companies during their relatively short involvement with RCR this season and I am so impressed with not only their business model but their core values and objectives” Dillon said in the press release. “I’m looking forward to representing Bennett on the track this season and helping make their first year in motorsports a successful one.”

Along with serving as the primary partner for the return to COTA the Bennett Family of Companies will have a continued presence on the stock car. Bennett will serve as an associate partner for select races in 2022.

The Primary Partner Already Reached Victory Lane

Prior to the 2022 Xfinity Series season RCR revealed that one of its new drivers would debut the Bennett Family of Companies scheme. Austin Hill who made the leap from the Camping World Truck Series would have multiple partners for his debut season including Alsco Uniforms Bennett Family of Companies United Rentals and Global Industrial.

Bennett made its debut during the season-opening race at Daytona International Speedway while sharing the scheme with United Rentals. The company experienced immediate success as Hill won the Beef. It’s What’s for Dinner. 300 and punched his ticket to the playoffs.

Bennett has since served as the primary for three other races during the opening stretch of the season. The company joined Hill for Auto Club Speedway Las Vegas Motor Speedway and Atlanta Motor Speedway. This run included Hill’s runner-up finish behind Ty Gibbs at the reconfigured Georgia track.

Dillon Will Strive To Rebound From an Unexpected Issue

The early portion of the 2022 Cup Series season has featured Dillon performing well in the Gen 7 Chevrolet. He had a strong run at the Busch Light Clash at the LA Memorial Coliseum and he finished second overall at Auto Club Speedway behind Kyle Larson. He also finished 11th at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.

Dillon had strong moments early while competing at the reconfigured Atlanta Motor Speedway. He started 17th but worked his way up to 10th overall by Lap 55. Dillon move up to fifth overall during Stage 1 and he appeared to be poised for a strong run all afternoon. However the situation changed drastically with an unexpected issue.

A wreck unfolded with five laps remaining in Stage 1. Denny Hamlin moved up in front of Dillon and took away some of his air while Kyle Busch continued to push on the rear of the No. 3. Both Dillon and Busch lost control and hit the wall hard.

“The 18 decided to stick with me. I know he probably thought he was doing us a favor but you can’t push in the left rear on exit of Turn 4 going as fast as we’re going” Dillon told FOX Sports’ Bob Pockrass after exiting the infield care center. “So he just turned me and it took us both out of the race.”

Groceries cost more gas costs more everything seems to cost more. This past week the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in an effort to tame the highest inflation in 40 years.

The cost of rent is really through the roof. Residential rents across the country went up an average of 15% last year – nearly twice the overall inflation rate. That's particularly painful for tenants because according to Census Bureau data they now often have to spend as much as half their total income on rent.

Why are rents rising so much? Well it turns out that big Wall Street firms are playing a role but we found the fundamental problem was years in the making…and will take years to fix.

Lesley Stahl: How much did your rent go up?

Justin Blocki: They attempted to raise it $400 a month.

That would have been a 40% jump for Justin Blocki and Brittney House. She's a nursing student and he's an occupational therapist in Jacksonville Florida. When they first rented their apartment a year and a half ago they were paying just over a thousand dollars a month.

Justin Blocki and Brittney House

Justin Blocki: I eventually came to terms with them for a 30% increase which was $300.

Lesley Stahl: Still 30%--

Justin Blocki: I've never heard of anything like that.

Lesley Stahl: Do you know why your rent jumped that much?

Justin Blocki: They told me the market justified it. And they were right. Because I looked at 30 other apartments and they were all way too-- too much for us to afford.

Lesley Stahl: So when your rent goes up 30% what's the impact? Are you having to give things up?

Brittney House: Yeah our fridge is-- does not look the same as last year before our lease.

Lesley Stahl: Really--

Brittney House: It's-- yeah--

Lesley Stahl: You're really cutting back on groceries.

Brittney House: Yeah.

Daryl Fairweather: It's pretty much universally true rents are going up all around the country. But it's even more severe in migration destinations. Like the sunbelt of the country Austin Phoenix Florida. A lotta people are moving there and there's just more demand for rents.

Daryl Fairweather is the chief economist at Redfin a nationwide real estate brokerage firm that pulls together real-time statistics on both the sales and rental markets. For example their numbers show that rents increased 31% in Jacksonville last year 40% in Austin Texas.

Lesley Stahl: What's causing this?

Daryl Fairweather: We are not building enough housing for everybody who needs a place to live. We built fewer homes in the 2010s than in any decade going back to the 1960s and at the same time millennials are the biggest generation and they're entering into home-buying age. Millennials aren't living in their parents' basement any more or shacking up with roommates they want a place of their own and we didn't build any housing for them in the last decade because we are still so traumatized by the last housing crisis. We didn't put any investment into housing.

Daryl Fairweather

In the economic crisis of 2008 and 2009 construction of new housing came to a grinding halt. But even when the economy recovered home construction didn't.

Lesley Stahl: So how big is the rental shortage in the United States?

Daryl Fairweather: The government has estimated that we are short about 4 million homes in this country and that number is likely growing especially since the pandemic.

Lesley Stahl: 4 million shy.

Daryl Fairweather: Yes. That's the hole that we're in that we need to build ourselves out of.

Lesley Stahl: That number 4 million is that mainly in the south and southwest? Or does that include New York City and San Francisco?

Daryl Fairweather: That's the entire country.

With something as essential as housing in such short supply you'd have to figure that Wall Street would see an opportunity buying modest single-family houses the kind you'd see on any middle class suburban street and then renting them out.

Daryl Fairweather: In places like Jacksonville Atlanta Charlotte investors are buying almost 30% of the homes that are available for regular home buyers.

Gary Berman: This is a home we bought. This is 3518 Shiner Drive in Jacksonville.

Lesley Stahl: Right.

Gary Berman: This home is 1700 square feet.

Lesley Stahl: How many bedrooms?

Gary Berman: Three bedrooms. Two baths. It was built about three years ago.

Gary Berman is CEO of Tricon Residential a Toronto-based company that has quietly become one of the largest owners of single-family homes in the United States.

Gary Berman: So today we own about 30000 single family rental homes across the U.S. largely in the Sun Belt. And we've got probably about 75000 people living in our homes.

Lesley Stahl: You are a multi-billion dollar company. You're publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

Gary Berman: Correct.

Lesley Stahl: And the--

Gary Berman: Toronto Stock Exchange.

Lesley Stahl: --Toronto Stock Exchange. I even read in one of your own documents that your revenue went up last year by 67%? Is that correct?

Gary Berman: Yeah-- we're expanding. I mean when you think about it we have an incredible amount of demand for what we do. So Lesley in any given week we might have two or 300 homes available.

Lesley Stahl: For renting?

Gary Berman: For renting. And we get about 10000 leasing inquiries a week.

Gary Berman

Tricon is trying to buy 800 houses a month and there are companies even bigger. Invitation Homes owns more than 80000 rental houses American Homes 4 Rent close to 60000. Some of the all stars of finance – Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Blackstone - have put hundreds of millions of dollars into these companies. They all offer rental homes online and all focus on the sunbelt.

Gary Berman: Our largest-- portfolio w-- would be in Atlanta in Charlotte in Phoenix in Tampa.

Lesley Stahl: And those are the cities that young millennials are flocking to?

Gary Berman: This is where Americans wanna be. We're finding that Americans are moving from the Northeast from the Midwest to move to the Sun Belt because taxes are lower. It's a friendlier business environment. It's better weather. And so there's a movement taking place. And the pandemic unleashed powerful nesting trends and work-from-home trends.

Lesley Stahl: Nesting trends?

Gary Berman: Powerful nesting trends. When we survey our residents 'Why did they move-- to be with us?' The number one reason is they want more space.

Lesley Stahl: Big investment companies like yours are being blamed for this huge increase in rents across the country. And you can set the rent any way you want really given the demand you're talking about.

Gary Berman: First. I mean corporate landlords represent 2% of all single-family rental housing. So there's a lot more going on than just corporate landlords bidding up homes. It's a very competitive and difficult environment.

It's true that big investors don't own nearly as many houses as mom-and-pop landlords people who might have just a few properties. But big firms like Tricon do play a larger – and growing – role in the sunbelt cities where they're active.

Rent increases are all over the map: 35% in New York but just 9% in Chicago. 29% in Portland only 10% in LA. And in only one big city were rents actually down last year: Kansas City.

Berman says Tricon strictly caps how much it will raise rent on existing tenants when they renew their leases.

Lesley Stahl: But let's say I had come in as a new renter here. Would the rent here be 30% more than it was about a year ago?

Gary Berman: It could be. Because it-- we-- when we come in and buy a home we have to pay a market price for the home. And then we have to set a market rent right?

Here are two examples of homes Tricon recently bought in Jacksonville. This one they're charging 40% higher rent than the previous owner asked this one 30% higher.

These before-and-after pictures taken by Tricon show how they fix up many of the houses they buy. They also have a fleet of trucks and technicians to service them.

Gary Berman: This is-- a standard Tricon home.

Lesley Stahl: And you put in the kitchen? These-- you put in the appliances--

Gary Berman: This home was built three years ago. We put in about $15000. Most of our homes are a little bit older. We probably put in about twenty or $25000. This is very typical of what our product looks like when you move into it. It's in move-in-ready condition. It's broom swept.

Lesley Stahl: And if things go wrong-- if there's a leak--

Gary Berman: If things go wrong--

Lesley Stahl: We call you.

Gary Berman: If we have a leaky faucet or the-- you know oven or microwave's not working you will call us. You'll call and our maintenance techs will come and-- and service the home.

The houses Tricon and other investors are buying in places like Jacksonville are what might be called ""starter homes"" usually selling for about $300000. When one of those comes on the market investors are ready with all-cash offers.

Heather Kruayai: I would say probably a third of the listings that I'm putting up are getting investor offers.

Heather Kruayai

Heather Kruayai is a Redfin real estate agent in Jacksonville. She represents both buyers and sellers.

Heather Kruayai: You are seeing a lot of these Wall Street investors that are coming in. You know you put a house on the market and within an hour I'm getting offers full price cash. And so these-- the sellers are seeing that and-- ""Oh okay. Cash. We can close in 15 days."" It's very enticing to people when they see that offer come across.

Lesley Stahl: So when you sell are you having to stage the house? Paint it? Put furniture in make it look really nice?

Heather Kruayai: Not now. It's not necessary now in this-- this way the way the market's going now. You really don't need to do anything to your house to sell it. Typically the-- investors never look at the home. Never.

Lesley Stahl: They don't even look at the home?

Heather Kruayai: They never look at it.

That plus the fact that investors often waive inspections puts would-be first-time home buyers at a serious disadvantage. Before they can even see a starter house it's gone.

Justin Blocki: Most people our age are not gonna be able to have $350000 in liquid cash.

Justin and Brittney the young Jacksonville couple facing steep rent increases are starting to lose hope they'll ever be able to buy a home.

Even Tricon's own presentation to investors says quote ""homeownership is increasingly out of reach.""

Gary Berman: In our portfolio the majority cannot buy a home. Cannot afford to buy a home or don't have the credit to buy the home. So for example they may have student debt or they may have medical debt. And therefore they can't qualify to get a mortgage. And if they want access to a single family home which we think's incredibly important this is the best way to-- for them to obtain it.

I think if you asked a lot of millennials and that tends to be our primary resident-- they would probably tell you they don't necessarily desire to own a home or to own a car. They've grown up in the sharing economy. And for what's important to them is lifestyle right? And so if they can move into this what we call a turnkey or a hotel ready home and have a low-maintenance lifestyle that's very compelling for them. Very compelling.

Lesley Stahl: We were told by the head of one of these big companies that people your age want to rent that you're not as interested in buying a house.

Justin Blocki: No. I mean (LAUGH) I think the American Dream is owning your own property and having your own dirt that you own. And that's specifically why we moved here was to own a house.

Brittney House: I realize my first house is probably going to be a starter home. It may not be that dream house but it's a house. It's a home. Now the-- our dream is now unattainable. It's-- it's very-- it's disturbing.

Daryl Fairweather: Most people desire that single-family home with the picket fence. And if they can't buy it because they can't afford it their only option is to rent it.

Lesley Stahl: Yeah but the investor's buying it.

Daryl Fairweather: Yeah and they're getting that wealth that normally or in previous years would've gone to the person living there.

Lesley Stahl: So what's happened to the American dream? When we used to say that it meant owning a house. What's the American dream now?

Gary Berman: Well if we think the American dream is-- is embodied in a suburban home with a yard and-- and a white picket fence then I think we're making the American dream much more accessible.

Lesley Stahl: Rent your American dream.

Gary Berman: You can rent the American dream.

That is if you can afford the rent.

United Way of Monroe/Lenawee Counties

Perhaps the most critical barrier to overcome for a person with a disability is the barrier to his or her home.

It's not something an able-bodied person gives much thought. Look at your own home. Those three four or more steps to the front door may only be an inconvenience for you on occasion — when your arms are full of packages for example. However for someone with mobility impairment even one step can be an impossible barrier.

A home can be a virtual prison if it is not designed for easy wheelchair access.

""Aha!"" you say ""a ramp is the solution."" Indeed a ramp can provide freedom for people with disabilities to come and go independently.

A ramp can make the whole world available — schools stores churches medical care and fun outings with family and friends. Unfortunately a ramp is only one part of the solution. Money is the other part the part that puts ramps out of reach for many people who need them.

The fact is many people with disabilities are on a fixed income with an inability to help their own financial situations. Add limited public support and high medical bills and what you have is a recipe for financial hardship that explains why many people with disabilities can't afford ramps — no matter how basic the need.

Since 2019 Project Ramp-Lenawee has been under the umbrella of the United Way of Monroe/Lenawee Counties. In a partnership with the Monroe/Lenawee County AFL-CIO Central Labor Council the program has built dozens of ramps across Lenawee County for residents with mobility needs. Since June 28 2019 we have built a total of 23 ramps across Lenawee County.

The United Way has more than a 20-year history administering Project Ramp in Monroe County and has now brought that wealth of experience to the Lenawee County program. Along with the United Way the Project Ramp-Lenawee task force is composed of the Lenawee County Department on Aging Habitat for Humanity Community Action Agency Housing Help of Lenawee Helping Hands Area Agency on Aging Goodwill Crossroads Community Church and disAbility Connections.

In Lenawee County the biggest challenge for Project Ramp-Lenawee is funding. Our partnership with organized labor community churches and local volunteer organizations have allowed us to reach out to volunteers throughout southeast Michigan. However funding remains the greatest barrier.

Each wooden ramp has increased dramatically in material cost in 2022. We once estimated material at $1500 per ramp and now have seen the cost rise to $2000. We have successfully run an aluminum ramp program in Monroe and have made strides to instituting an aluminum ramp program in Lenawee. This will allow us to address rentals or very short lengths of need for barrier-free access. The goal is to initially purchase 12 aluminum ramps for $60000 or $5000 each. We have reclaimed six aluminum ramps and inherited approximately three through Helping Hands all of which have been installed.

If you would like to help “build freedom” for residents in Lenawee or Monroe counties with mobility issues donations are accepted through the United Way of Monroe/Lenawee Counties. Please earmark donations for “Project Ramp-Lenawee” and send to 136 E. Maumee St. Suite 15 Adrian MI 49221 or 216 N. Monroe St. Monroe MI 48162 or donate online at www.unitedwaymlc.org.

He answers questions about WHO’s preparation for armed conflicts in the country and its health-related humanitarian response since the Russian military offensive and war began.

What was your experience in Ukraine before the current Russian military offensive started?

“Ukraine has been the most dynamic country to work in from a health perspective. Since 2014 3.4 million people in the Donbas region of south-eastern Ukraine have needed health-related humanitarian assistance. In addition when I started working here the measles outbreak in the country was the second largest in the world before our team helped in efforts to respond to it. And of course we then had COVID-19 to deal with since 2020 so I have been working closely with the government to develop a national COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan and been active in our pandemic response across the whole country. Then late last year a polio outbreak was detected so we started working together with the Ministry of Health and partners to get all children from the ages of 6 months to 6 years vaccinated. Since 2016 Ukraine has been in a process of reform and even with all these health emergencies going on government reforms of the health system to move towards universal health coverage didn’t stop. New institutions have been created and new practices applied. All in all as a public health professional it has been very challenging but very rewarding to be working in Ukraine all these years.”

How long has WHO been preparing for the possible escalation of the conflict in Ukraine?

“In Ukraine we have always worked on emergency preparedness but we started to do more hands-on work in October/November last year. This included visits to oblasts in the eastern part of Ukraine filling our warehouses with supplies and delivering to selected hospitals and bringing in colleagues from the Regional Office and headquarters to assess our operations. In December we also set up our emergency medical teams briefed authorities and translated WHO guidelines and materials focused on armed conflicts into Ukrainian.

Early this year we also pre-positioned trauma supplies – essential life-saving materials and treatments for injuries – in our warehouses and hospitals and Dr Hans Kluge the WHO Regional Director made a special visit to the country to discuss what needed to be done from a health perspective in the face of escalating violence.”

How did you feel when the Russian military offensive started?

“At the end of February when the military offensive started it was the school holidays so people were perhaps feeling more relaxed than usual – making the attack even more of a shock. We had just signed a Biennial Collaborative Agreement between WHO and the national health authorities in January to take the health agenda further so were really looking forward to all the positive changes we could make. We were also supposed to have a WHO- and World Bank-supported national conference on hospital reforms at the end of March and were preparing to celebrate World Health Day on 7 April to make progress on primary health care. All of these initiatives had to be put on hold. The last weeks have involved learning reflecting and coming to terms with the situation because even though we have been preparing for hostilities for a long time and more intensely in the last 4 or 5 months none of us thought this would actually happen to such an extent.”

How has the WHO Country Office adapted in response to the war?

“We have a very agile dynamic team – we work from wherever we are. Some colleagues have relocated; some colleagues have temporarily evacuated; some colleagues have also arrived into Ukraine. One thing we learned from the COVID-19 emergency is that wherever you are you are virtually connected to colleagues. We have daily online meetings involving staff in 20-plus countries. We also have more than 60 colleagues in Ukraine some in Kyiv some elsewhere.”

What has WHO been able to do to support the health response in Ukraine?

“I'm very proud that due to our experience and team spirit we are one of the UN agencies which has been able to deliver goods to Kyiv and other cities. Moreover in all my 19 years of experience with WHO I have never felt the 3 levels of WHO – headquarters Regional Office and Country Office – come so closely together listen to each other and prioritize the response. We are finding solutions and we really are getting our best brains and people together to respond. That’s how we got medical supplies from Dubai to Poland from Poland to Ukraine and from Ukraine to individual hospitals across the country. Our WHO Country Office is just a small team but we are able to mobilize thousands across the whole organization to support Ukraine.”

How would you describe the current health and humanitarian situation in the country?

“It's changing daily. In less than a month over 3 million people have left the country and nearly 2 million have been internally displaced. This has happened faster than in any previous European crisis. There is no safe place in Ukraine right now yet we need to ensure that health services are available.

Meanwhile the military offensive continues with a number of cities being entirely isolated – people are running out of food and water and hospitals might not have electricity. Worse still we have seen many attacks on health workers and health facilities as well as patients. This is happening daily and is unacceptable. So if you ask me how to describe it every day things are getting worse which means every day the health response is becoming more difficult.”

How are you and your staff coping with the situation?

“Personally I tend to work. It’s also important to sleep – fortunately for me the more stressed I am the better I sleep! Honestly though it's difficult especially as everything I own is in Kyiv: my clothes my apartment. But most importantly I have my health and energy to support Ukraine. Dealing with all of this is hard and all of us have stories to be told at a later time.

Over the last week we have been refocusing and regrouping to respond to the enormous health challenges the country now faces. 3 weeks ago we dreamed that we could still do some of our development work but the huge scale of the humanitarian crisis must be recognized. Right now we need to focus on the humanitarian response but also start thinking about the recovery phase not knowing whether this war will end in the near future or if it will last for a long time.”

Feted by Oscar nominee Jessica Chastain Moreno took the stage and broke out in dance ahead of accepting her Stanley Kramer Award for social justice work shaking her shoulders and shimmying her way to the podium while Chastain did the same. While delivering a speech Moreno kept the momentum going.

“I am not a person of religious faith but for me film has often been a sacred text that has spurred me to follow what [Abraham Lincoln] called the ‘better angels of our nature’” Moreno detailed. “In 1963 I sat on Abraham Lincoln’s steps only a few feet from [Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]. I was there. … Thanks to an invitation from Harry Belafonte I was there to hear the preacher’s dream. In seasons when profits fall silent and statesmen reign thankfully filmmakers keep on preaching and never stop advocating for matters of equity and justice.”

Producer and director Stanley Kramer her award’s namesake “was one such prophet who never shied from matters of social justice and equity in his body of work” the actress told the crowd. Because of that Moreno said it’s so meaningful and gratifying to receive such recognition and be associated with Kramer’s legacy.

“I am 90 now” said the legend who stars in the best picture-nominated West Side Story for Steven Spielberg. “And working for a lifetime and this business has taken tenacity and hard work. Advocating for issues of social justice for the last 60 years has been exhausting exhilarating and life-giving. Had it not been for those sets and the fire set inside me as a young woman I would certainly not be here tonight receiving this wondrous honor.”

Trending on Billboard

She then praised Spielberg and writer Tony Kushner for the adaptation a collaboration that tells “the immigrant story with integrity fleshing out of characters and respecting ethnicities” in such a way that it “put logs on this fire that was inside me.”

Moreno closed her brief speech by countering critics who take aim at actors who use their platforms to speak out on issues that are meaningful to them.

“We are in the throes of yet another award season and some in our tribe have been known to use a spotlight to advocate for issues addressed in their nominated works — climate change universal health care voting rights and LGBTQ advocacy and many many others” Moreno explained. “And I know that in some audiences that has been known to create how shall I say — a mild discomfort? For others heart palpitations. ‘After all who are these actors these Hollywood types think they are huh? Citizens in a democracy?’”

To that end Moreno said bluntly: “Well f— ’em. Freedom of speech belongs to all of us actors. And let’s not forget comedians are patriots too — just look in the direction of Mr. Zelensky in Ukraine.”

With that Moreno closed her brief and literal spin in the spotlight by saying “Thank you and I promise I’ll be more charming on another occasion.”

In this thought leadership piece Abdullahi Tsanni discusses the launch key messages and recommendations from the report.

“The giant of Africa — Africa’s largest country in terms of population and economy — enjoys considerable unrealised potential. The time to achieve greatness is now with health at the heart of the development agenda.” — The Lancet Nigeria Commission: Investing in health and the future of the nation.

The quote above summarises the report of The Lancet Nigeria Commission entitled: “Investing in health and the future of the nation” which was launched in Abuja Nigeria on March 16 2022 by Nigeria’s Vice-President His Excellency Professor Yemi Osibanjo. The report published in one of the leading health journals The Lancet was put together by a multi-disciplinary team of Nigerian experts from around the world — including scientists researchers academics and policymakers. They reviewed Nigeria’s health inequalities and made detailed recommendations on the opportunities to improve the country’s health metrics.

While delivering his keynote address His Excellency Professor Yemi Osibanjo noted that the whole notion of the ‘One Nation One Health’ policy to attain Universal Health Coverage would benefit segments of the Nigerian population that bear the highest disease burden — the poor.

“This [Commission] recommends prevention to be at the heart of health policy given Nigeria’s young population and requiring a lot of government approach and community engagement” said Prof. Osibanjo adding that “the report proposes a new social contract centered on health to address Nigeria’s needs and define the relationship between the citizens and the states.”

The report provides insight into the challenges of healthcare delivery in Nigeria and recommendations to change health policies improve health outcomes for all Nigerians and ultimately achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) — ‘One Nation One Health’.

There is no doubt that Nigeria has an abundance of human capital with great potential to drive sustainable development and economic prosperity but this potential is severely hindered as millions of Nigerians live in poverty — a condition that constrains the ability of the people to access quality healthcare services among other things. To harness Nigeria’s full potential health must be at the front and center of the national development agenda.

The level of investment in the nation’s public health will determine the accessibility and quality of healthcare services available to Nigerian citizens. This will‌ play a crucial role in spurring productivity and economic political and social development.

Mamora; Consultant in Microbiology & Infectious Diseases Addenbrookes Hospital Cambridge Dr Sani Aliyu and The Lancet Editor-in-Chief Richard Horton. Professor Ibrahim Abubakar Dean UCL Institute for Global Health London and the lead author delivered the presentation of the Commission report.

Professor Abubakar who led the team that wrote the report pointed to Nigeria’s disease burden analysis which shows a combination of a high burden of maternal and child mortality a reduced yet significant burden of infectious diseases particularly malaria and a growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). This poses a threat to Nigeria’s rapidly growing population. Lack of quality healthcare is a major obstacle for millions of Nigerians to live healthy lives. “Nigeria’s life expectancy at birth is just over 54 years the fifth-lowest in the world”. He ended optimistically — “We aim to help reposition health policy in Nigeria to achieve health for all. Our vision is to provide recommendations to ensure the health and wealth of future generations of Nigerians. Our report offers specific recommendations on innovation financing and specific interventions to improve healthcare staffing information systems and access to care for all”.

Professor Iruka Okeke a pharmaceutical microbiologist at the University of Ibadan Nigeria and one of the Commissioners said with the vast majority of people in Nigeria as young adults the country has to work towards deriving value from its demography. Of the over 200 million Nigerians nearly half are aged under 19. “If we invest in these people we could be an enormously great country. If we invest in public health provide access to quality healthcare and keep the population healthy we will save a lot of money and the people are going to be productive and create jobs in the country. We are at the point where we should take this enormous human resource to spur economic prosperity for our nation” said Professor Okeke.

The making of the Report

Over a two-year period the group of experts studied health inequality in Nigeria and examined population health outcomes in the country between 1998–2019. The team found that dismal health outcomes are holding back the progress of Nigeria and threaten the future of an otherwise dynamic nation despite its large economy and population and higher health expenditure since 2001.

The study analysed gender patterns of mortality years of life lost years lived with disability life expectancy healthy life expectancy and health system coverage and concluded that Nigeria compares less favourably than similar nations in West Africa.

Following the findings of the report here are some ‌recommendations that were presented for consideration by the government to achieve Universal Health Coverage:

A new social contract centered on health must be developed to address Nigeria’s need to define the relationship between the citizen and the state. Given Nigeria’s young population prevention should be at the heart of health policy and this requires a whole-of-government approach and community engagement. The government should create a healthcare reform programme to deliver a centrally determined locally delivered health system including providing health insurance coverage for 83 million poor Nigerians who cannot afford to pay premiums. Build a health system that encourages innovation and engages communities to ensure that existing nationally driven schemes have local buy-in and are sustainable; and reforming the policy and regulatory landscape to unleash the market potential of the private sector. Improve health financing and ensure better accountability and distribution of resources by increasing the proportion of spending and improving the efficient use of existing resources devoted to health to help defragment and decolonise the Nigerian health landscape. Do a whole system assessment of the investment needs in Nigeria’s health security. This is especially imperative as the COVID-19 pandemic exposed weaknesses in the nation’s health security. Federal and state governments should fund and lead the development of standards for the digitisation of health records and better data collection registration and quality assurance systems.

The Lancet Nigeria Commission is a landmark report that x-rays the major obstacles of the Nigerian health sector and charts a new path toward delivering equitable and optimal healthcare for all. Governments at all levels stakeholders and ordinary citizens must commit to taking immediate steps to ensure the report recommendations are incorporated into health policy. “A commitment to a ‘One Nation One Health’ policy would prioritise the attainment of Universal Health Coverage for all particularly for the most vulnerable Nigerians who bear an unacceptably high disease burden” Professor Abubakar said.

CEBU Philippines — The Cebu City Council has approved a resolution designating Barangay Health Workers (BHWs) as barangay-level Health Education and Promotion Officers (HEPO) who shall collaboratively function with other members of the respective primary care provider networks in the city.

This is to ensure the proactive and effective implementation of health promotion policies programs and activities in the community.

Councilor Prisca Niña Mabatid sponsored the measure which was approved by the council Wednesday.

“Currently BHWs remain as indispensable members of the local health system-serving at the frontline of the pandemic prevention and response actions in the community assisting in the operations of the Barangay Health Services Urban Health Centers or Rural Health Units conducting house visits and helping in organizing and mobilization of community members for relevant health events and activities” said Mabatid.

It is aimed at further strengthening primary care and reorienting services towards health promotion as envisioned now by the Universal Health Care Act Department of Health Administrative Order No. 2020-0024 on the Primary Care Framework and Sectoral Strategies further underscores the need to enhance the capacities of primary care workers including the BHWs as an important strategy to ensure quality safe and affordable care and to achieve the full realization of primary care.

As stated in the resolution the city shall ensure the provisions of just and commensurate honorarium and financial and/or non-financial incentives and benefits for the BHWs.

It added that the resources necessary to mobilize BHWs including for honoraria operational expenditure equipment and/or training costs may be sourced from Special Health Fund and other local budgetary sources.

Section 17 of the UHC Act ensures that all Filipinos are guaranteed equitable access to quality and affordable health care goods and services likewise mandates the establishment of primary care networks for the delivery of health services.

These primary care provider networks which include the BHWs as community health workers and volunteers deliver services serve as initial contact and navigator to guide patients' decision making for cost-efficient and appropriate levels of care and coordinate patients to facilitate two-way referrals and remove barriers to health services. — FPL (FREEMAN)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcHJpbnQuaW4veW91cnR1cm4vc3Vic2NyaWJlcndyaXRlcy10aW1lLWZvci1pbmRpYW4tZ292ZXJubWVudC10by1yZS10aGluay1oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBvbGljeS1yZWZvcm1zLzg3OTY4MS_SAXpodHRwczovL3RoZXByaW50LmluL3lvdXJ0dXJuL3N1YnNjcmliZXJ3cml0ZXMtdGltZS1mb3ItaW5kaWFuLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtdG8tcmUtdGhpbmstaGVhbHRoY2FyZS1wb2xpY3ktcmVmb3Jtcy84Nzk2ODEvP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SubscriberWrites: Time for Indian government to re-think healthcare policy reforms,"The ongoing Indian medical student evacuation from Ukraine has quantified the unacknowledged gap that exists between need for medical seats and the abysmal lack of opportunities to fulfil students’ desire to be a doctor. India has a gap not just in seats but also of medical jobs. This gap can be plugged through out-of-the-box policy reforms and international agreements.

Indian society allocates extremely high aspirational quotient to engineering and medicine profession. While engineering has taken off and has many affordable colleges a huge job industry and large contribution to GDP the medical aspirants are left behind. There are more than 3500 engineering colleges in India. In comparison India has only 479 medical colleges.

‘The number of people who appear for NEET every year is more than 10 lakhs and there are only about 30000 government college seats. The rest are private which are more expensive and demand donation too.

Hence students are left with no option but to go abroad’.

Students are not just going to Ukraine but to many other small countries. Medical council of India recognizes 403 universities. Some of these are in developed countries like US UK but many others are in countries like Georgia West Indies Kazakhstan Romania and some even in Pakistan and Iran.

After an arduous journey of getting into a college and eventually being eligible for a job the hairy issue is that there are not enough jobs. Even though India has an understaffed public health Care system (PHC) there are still not enough jobs for MBBS graduates. In 2018 the PHC had only 34000 openings vs 67000 MBBS graduates. Most of the private hospital jobs are in urban areas or are specialization centric.

Now if we look at the need from the patient side.

India scores poorly on Universal health care goal by United Nations SDG.

In 2021 it had a service coverage score of only 55 which is the lowest amongst the G20 countries. The SDG also measures the amount of household income spent on healthcare and India has one of the highest amounts here.17% of income is spent on healthcare clearly indicating there is a need for making healthcare more affordable for a low-income country like India.

In recent years the government has been making some healthcare sector reforms. In 2018 India touched the golden line of having doctor: citizen ratio of 1:1000. +12000 new medical seats have opened just in the last 5 years.

But this is far from what is needed. The government needs to address both sides of the equation.

A-Improve supply of medical seats by simplifying the labyrinth requirements and reducing cost for opening a medical college to make medical education more affordable.

B- Convert the massive healthcare demand into tangible job opportunities for students. This can be done in 3 ways

1- Improve public health care by thinking transformatively about its delivery. India must move away from the brick-and-mortar model and instead create required IT backbone to connect doctors in urban areas to the remote areas. Public health care specialist should be accessible to villagers on video chat and their responses can be tracked to ensure better performance. Medicine delivery can be done within 24 hours through the amazon model of warehousing and hubs. Necessitating travel to urban areas only for chronic issues to specialized hospitals.

2– Create an offshore medical services industry just like the hugely profitable offshore IT services industry. Since India has a huge potential to have high-quality medical talent India must take a lead in fostering agreements with other countries. Raghuram Rajan has been propagating this idea to circumvent the delays in manufacturing industry development stage.

3- Mercurially expand jobs in the high-end trillion-dollar healthcare/pharmaceutical industry and increase medical research. India’s R&D expenditure is far below desired. Countries like Israel and South Korea spend +45% of GDP whereas India is only at 08%. Even in this low amount only 18% is towards health. India must incentivize private sector to participate more. India’s researcher intensity is just 20% of China. 70% of patents filed by Indians are from non-residents. The corresponding figure for China and Japan is 10% and 20% respectively. This hints at the lack of a research ecosystem in India.

In the recently concluded state elections in 2022 while all political parties have a strong narrative on caste and religion but most young voters are vociferously seeking jobs. Irrespective of who wins in the state elections the demand for job creation will not take a back seat. Jobs will be a major electoral ask for 2024 elections. The post-corona and post-Ukraine war (hopefully post) environment will be conducive to drive the necessary policy changes and budget allocations needed for medical job creation stated above.

Likewise for anyone who filled up a car at a local gas station supplied from Monroe Energy LLC the Delaware County oil refinery owned by Delta.

The airline’s refinery outside Philadelphia was the nation’s largest single importer of Russian crude oil last year buying 10.7 million barrels or 15% of the total U.S. crude imports from Russia according to U.S. Energy Department data analyzed by The Inquirer. PBF Energy which operates nearby refineries in New Jersey and Delaware also imported a significant amount of Russian crude and unfinished oils last year.

Under President Joe Biden’s March 8 ban on Russian energy imports those refiners and dozens of other importers of Russian oil and petroleum across the nation must switch to new suppliers. However Russian shipments already ordered are allowed to continue. Biden imposed the ban in response to growing calls from Congress to punish Russia for its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.

U.S. industry can adapt

The administration and the oil industry say the ban on Russian imports will be manageable as were previous market disruptions after the United States imposed sanctions on Iranian and Venezuelan crude. The Russian ban could contribute to rising energy costs that have caused pump prices to soar in the last year.

Russia is the world’s second-largest exporter of crude oil and a major supplier to Europe. But Russia accounted for only 3% of U.S crude imports last year.

It was a bigger exporter of petroleum products to the United States which includes refined fuels and unfinished oils. Altogether it accounted for 245 million barrels of crude oil and petroleum imports to the United States or about 8% of total U.S. petroleum imports.

While American industry can adapt to the loss of Russian imports the change in flows of crude and petroleum disrupts international shipping which can affect prices said Dean Foreman chief economist of the American Petroleum Institute.

“On a systemwide basis these volumes are relatively small” he said. “Shipping markets however are tight. And if you need to change the source of crude oil or these intermediate products in a relatively tight shipping market this change of source could result in higher costs.”

Russia accounted for 29% of Monroe’s imports

The Russian import ban will be felt in some parts of America more than others. Russian products arrive by large ships to a few coastal customers such as Monroe Energy and PBF while refiners in the nation’s interior are unaffected. For Monroe Russian crude amounted to 29% of its total imports last year second only to crude imported from Nigeria. For PBF Russia’s 7.5 million barrels amounted to about 12% of its imports last year ranking behind Saudi Arabia Canada and Mexico.

Monroe Energy says it placed its last order for Russian crude in November. “Monroe doesn’t plan to enter into additional agreements for Russian-supplied crude oil for the foreseeable future” said Adam Gattuso a company spokesperson who declined to answer other questions about the refinery’s crude oil sourcing practices.

PBF whose local refineries are in Delaware City Del. and Paulsboro referred questions to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) an industry trade group.

“No American refinery is contracting for new orders of Russian oil or petroleum products” said Ericka Perryman an AFPM spokesperson.

Why Philly refineries need imports

Industry experts say Russian crude oil can be replaced by similar grades of crude oil from other countries or from U.S. producers though it costs more to transport domestic crude by rail or American-flagged ships to Northeastern refineries that are not connected to producers by pipelines.

That’s a curse for import-dependent East Coast refineries whose output has declined by two-thirds in the last 15 years after a raft of plants closed including the giant Philadelphia Energy Solutions refinery in South Philadelphia in 2019.

But no American refineries were dependent specifically on Russian imports said John R. Auers executive vice president of Turner Mason & Co. an energy consultancy. Refineries bought Russian crude because it made economic sense in the prevailing market. ”Russian crude is more of an opportunistic piece of the crude slate” he said.

Auers said the economic advantages of buying Russian crude were dissipating at the end of 2021 explaining why Monroe and other refiners were already reducing their orders months before the Ukraine invasion. After the invasion Russian crude attained instant pariah status. Workers in Britain refused to unload a shipment earlier that arrived in a German-flagged vessel.

Now orphaned Russian crude is cheap on world markets while activists track vessel shipments online and are poised to publicly shame any buyers.

“Currently Russian crude is at a high discount because their markets are limited” said Auers. “But it doesn’t matter because you can’t buy it.”

The Monroe Energy refinery is configured to use light crude that is “sweet” meaning it contains low levels of sulfur an impurity that needs to be removed during the refining process. In addition to Russian and Nigerian crude Monroe also imported shipments last year from Canada Kazakhstan Angola and a small amount from North Sea producers in Britain and Norway.

Monroe can receive domestic crude by rail and ship though individual movements of U.S. crude are not reported publicly by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). According to maritime sources the Trainer refinery received several visits by crude oil tankers from the U.S. Gulf Coast last year. Cargo that moves between U.S. ports must be transported on U.S. flagged vessels which increases transportation costs.

Delta Air Lines bought the Trainer refinery in 2012 from Conoco-Phillips and optimized production for jet fuel. It transports jet fuel to Northeastern airports including major Delta hubs at LaGuardia Airport and JFK International Airport in New York. According to its financial reports Delta swaps the gasoline diesel and other fuels it manufactures at Monroe Energy for jet fuel delivered to other airports across the nation where it operates.

Where does the Russian oil go?

The end-users for much of the Russian products to the United States are not always easy to track beyond the companies that import the material.

Besides Monroe Energy and PBF Russian crude was delivered to refineries on the Gulf Coast the West Coast and Hawaii according to EIA company-level reports.

The two largest corporate buyers were Marathon Petroleum Corp. which imported 13.9 million barrels to refineries in Alaska California Washington and Texas and Valero Energy which bought 13.1 million barrels of Russian crude for plants in Louisiana Texas and two locations in California.

Russia also exported 129 million barrels of partly refined unfinished oils to the United States last year 78% greater than its crude oil exports to the U.S. Most of these heavy intermediate oils were delivered to Gulf Coast refineries which have the equipment to refine the material into valuable fuels like diesel and gasoline. The PBF refinery in Delaware City which is configured to refine heavy sour crude oil also received 4.1 million barrels of intermediate product from Russia last year.

The United States also imported some Russian finished fuel and “motor fuel blending components” which includes materials like alkylate benzene toluene and xylene that are mixed into fuel to make finished motor gasoline (it doesn’t include ethanol).

Most of the 18.4 million barrels of blending components were imported into the Northeast by companies like ExxonMobil and BP Products North America Inc. which added it to fuel supplies.

The U.S. imported about 24 million barrels of refined Russian products mostly into East Coast markets including diesel gasoline jet fuel and residual fuel a heavy oil used to power some marine vessels and industrial boilers. The fuels were primarily imported by large international commodity trading companies like Trafigura AG and Gunvor USA LLC which sold them to distributors or large industrial customers. Most of the gasoline was destined for Southeastern ports: Norfolk Va. Savannah Ga. Jacksonville Fla. and San Juan Puerto Rico.

Lukoil the Russian oil company that has become the target of a consumer boycott after the Ukraine invasion imported about 1.1 million barrels of Russian diesel and heating oil into Northeast markets.

A silver lining?

Monroe Energy which has struggled in recent years amid efforts by Delta to sell the facility or to find a strategic partner reduced production during the pandemic when airline traffic cratered and changed its output last year to produce more motor fuel and less jet fuel according to Delta’s financial reports.

But Auers the refinery consultant believes that the current crisis in Eastern Europe and the uncertainty of Russian energy flows may be favorable to Monroe Energy and other beleaguered East Coast refiners that in recent years have been at the short end of a competition with European refiners that can export surplus production to the United States.

European refiners now face uncertain crude oil supplies from Russia as well as soaring prices for Russian natural gas which is a major cost for refiners he said. And with elevated crude oil prices the profit margins for U.S. refiners have gone up.

“I think Delta/Monroe actually has pretty good prospects for the foreseeable future given the negative environment for European refiners” said Auers. “The short-term and even medium-term prospects of East Coast refineries have really improved at the expense of the European refiners.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

(Prohibida su reventa y archivo)

Seúl 20 de marzo (Yonhap) - El principal fabricante de automóviles de Corea del Sur Hyundai Motor Co. ha dicho este domingo que su marca independiente Genesis ha alcanzado ventas globales de más de 700.000 unidades gracias a la creciente popularidad del poder de su marca.

Las ventas globales de la marca local de gama alta totalizaron las 700.612 unidades desde su lanzamiento en noviembre de 2015 hasta finales de febrero de 2022. El 305 por ciento de tales ventas se produjeron en el extranjero según los datos de relaciones con inversores de Hyundai Motor.

Las ventas globales de Genesis aumentaron en 100.000 unidades en los últimos tres meses respaldadas por la popularidad que ha crecido rápidamente de sus autos recreativos y la subida de las ventas en América del Norte.

Del total su sedán G80 gozó de las mayores ventas con 298.002 unidades.

Hyundai dijo que también aumentó la popularidad mundial de los vehículos utilitarios deportivos (SUV según sus siglas en inglés) GV70 y GV80 particularmente en Corea del Sur y en Estados Unidos.

Los observadores del mercado dijeron que es probable que las ventas de Genesis superen el umbral de 1 millón en el transcurso de 2022 si se mantiene el ritmo actual.

Hyundai Motor dijo en enero que tiene como objetivo vender 220.000 unidades de Genesis a nivel mundial en 2022 lo que representa un 10 por ciento más que las 200.000 vendidas el año pasado.

La línea Genesis está compuesta por los sedanes G70 G80 y G90 de combustión interna y el sedán G80 eléctrico así como por el SUV GV60 eléctrico y los SUV GV70 y GV80 de combustión interna.

Las compras de estos pasajes se pueden efectuar desde un mes hasta seis meses de antelación.

“Cubana de Aviación ofrece para compras anticipadas (6 meses 3 meses 1 mes) en las rutas Madrid-Santiago-Habana. Precios desde 170 pesos cubanos hasta 250 más impuestos. Incluye además dos infantes que no ocupen asiento y uno que sí pero al 50% del costo del boleto” se lee en la promoción colgada en sus redes sociales.

Algunos usuarios comentaron a la compañía aérea cubana que el mensaje se perdía un poco por lo que Cubana insistió en que “La ruta es Madrid-Santiago-Habana y el retorno Habana- Santiago- Madrid”. Esta ruta a Madrid es una de las pocas internacionales que oferta dicha compañía cubana pues apenas la otra es la de Buenos Aires con contados enlaces en el mes.

¿CÓMO SE RESERVA DESDE CUBA Y DESDE EL EXTERIOR?

Desde la isla no existe la opción online así que puede reservar desde las oficinas de la aerolínea su pasaje Habana- Santiago o viceversa con antelación de hasta seis meses con estas ofertas antes mencionadas. El horario de atención establecido es de 8:30 am a 4:00 pm en sus oficinas.

Mientras desde fuera del país la reserva desde el exterior es a través de la página oficial de Cubana: www.cubana.cu. Además desde finales de 2021 se habilitaron más teléfonos para la comunicación con los posibles clientes como: 7833-1987 y 7833-1988. Todo ello porque hace algún tiempo se venían presentando problemas con los teléfonos de atención al cliente de la oficina de ventas de La Rampa en el Vedado habanero.

Cómo hemos anunciado en nuestras páginas los boletos para cubanos residentes se venden en pesos cubanos y esta ruta Habana-Santiago tiene una tarifa fija de 1100 pesos cubanos por persona lo que hace evidente la rebaja de esta oferta con anticipación.

En la más reciente rueda de prensa realizada por Porsche la marca alemana anunció los planes que estarán desarrollando a futuro. Bajo una ruta de acción definida la compañía ha dejado claro que habrán varios lanzamientos y que esperan numerosas ventas.

Frente al tema de electrificación Oliver Blume delegado de Porsche centró su intervención en esta estrategia y en cómo los beneficiaría. Al tiempo confirmó la llegada del mítico 911 híbrido y una posterior transformación de 718 Boxster/Cayman en futuros eléctricos para 2025.

Bajo estas propuestas y sumado a otros modelos que harán parte del futuro eléctrico Porsche visualiza que habrá éxito en sus objetivos comerciales. Al llegar 2025 es decir en tres años la idea es que el 50% de las ventas sea por parte de los autos híbridos y eléctricos.

¿Cuáles serán las novedades?

Cabe decir y hablar con cifras contundentes pues en 2021 Porsche vendió más de 300 mil autos lo que en materia operacional representó un beneficio de 5.300 millones de euros. Un logro importante pues nunca antes habían superado esa barrera en 2020 fueron 272.162 unidades.

La lista en ventas la encabeza el Taycan con 41.296 autos vendidos seguido por el Porsche 911 con 38.464 unidades. Sin embargo el beneficio económico de este último es superior al de cualquier otro auto de la marca.

De otra parte la marca continúa generando expectativa pues la próxima generación del Macan abarcaría protagonismo. El modelo llegaría en versión eléctrico basado en la plataforma EPI desarrollada junto a Audi y al parecer el SUV deportivo está en una etapa avanzada.

We don’t have a changelog yet from Verizon but again this should be similar to a day 1 update and it introduces the March 2022 security patch. I don’t believe this takes care of the throttling that Samsung thought you’d appreciate on your $1300 phone.

Once we get more details we’ll be sure to update this post. For now if you own a Galaxy S22 on Verizon head into Settings>Software update and then tap “Download and install.”

UPDATE 3/20: Alright Verizon has posted details and this is indeed the Game Booster anti-throttling update that Samsung was supposedly pushing out.

Verizon says the following about Game Booster Labs and settings so you can disable or enable for better performance:

A new option “Game Booster Labs” has been added under Game Booster settings. You can turn “Alternate game performance management” on for better gaming performance. When you enable “Alternate game performance management” “Game optimization” will be disabled. Alternate game performance management can be found under the Game Booster settings > Labs > Game Booster Labs > Alternate game performance management

For builds on each Galaxy S22 device we have the following:

Galaxy S22 Ultra : S908USQU1AVC8

: S908USQU1AVC8 Galaxy S22+ : S906USQU1AVC8

: S906USQU1AVC8 Galaxy S22: S901USQU1AVC8

Next stop: Metropolitan Opera.,"No operatic team takes on a literary property as deep and complicated as The Hours without having a viable plan for theatrically blending its three psychologically penetrating stories that take place all over the 20th century. But composer Kevin Puts librettist Greg Pierce and an all-star cast with the Philadelphia Orchestra beat the next-to-impossible odds in an operatic adaptation of the famous Michael Cunningham novel and 2002 film in the premiere Friday at the Kimmel Cultural Campus.

The opera-in-concert presentation repeated Sunday at Verizon Hall can be safely called a historic event. Though something of a preview for a full production next season at the Metropolitan Opera there was no sense that this is a work in progress so fully realized was the opera’s treatment of the three parallel plots as well as the performances by Renee Fleming Kelli O’Hara and Jennifer Johnson Cano under Yannick Nézet-Séguin. The near-full audience that cheered the opera’s concluding mesmerizing three-soprano trio would no doubt agree.

Without lowering the brow of the story the opera is immediately lovable with a lush orchestration that hits you in the solar plexus — plus an ever-present chorus that sings what everybody is thinking and had the Philadelphia Symphonic Choir deftly blended with the textures of the orchestra.

Harmonically the opera reflects influences from John Adams — as do so many pieces by many current composers — though composer Puts has a more precise dramaturgical sense than Adams and a tougher edge that’s demanded of the opera’s three stories: about author Virginia Woolf writing her famous novel Mrs. Dalloway in the 1920s; a suicidal housewife reading the novel in the 1940s; and an AIDS caregiver living the novel in the 1990s. Thanks to the kind of magic realism that’s possible in opera the different stories overlap unfold simultaneously and ultimately have powerful dialogues with each other thanks to Puts’ mastery of high-def big-screen sound pictures and librettist Pierce’s smart choices in drawing from the huge possibilities of the source material. Surtitles were full of plot signposts that saved this operatic package from potential confusion.

And as one who followed the opera easily from having studied the film and Puts’ score I was pleased to talk to concert goers who had no background in The Hours but had no problem navigating its constantly shifting sands.

Of course Puts’ broad musical vocabulary is very much responsible for telling the stories on visceral and subliminal levels. Big turning points arrived with both grandeur and detail so much that a good orchestral suite could be drawn from this score starting with the Act I prelude suggesting Debussy in his darker Edgar Allen Poe-influenced moments. But the opera’s hallmark was more intimate moments that achieved gut-wrenching intensity equal to the best of Puccini but with an extra ring of truth. Those who have lived through similar stories — including the 1990s AIDS epidemic — might find that this opera goes knowingly into the core issues of that time.

Each main character had an individual sound world: Virginia Woolf’s being spare with good use of silence often implying more than the music said and an occasional dash of Ralph Vaughan Williams. Laura the housewife had music with a surface luster suggesting a materialistic world of post-war plenty plus whiffs of 1950s pop music. The latter-day Mrs. Dalloway of the 1990s was a common musical meeting ground a nerve center of sorts and with plenty of nervous rhythm of course.

Fleming and O’Hara had the luxury of having their roles written specifically for them which was reflected in any number of arresting moments though both were still in the process of wrapping their voices around some of the contours of their vocal lines. Cano’s portrayal of Woolf was 100% there: Every word was clear both in content and intention and her mezzo-soprano tone was deeply alluring. Equally excellent in similar ways was Brett Polegato as the AIDS-stricken Richard. Even small rolls were fully realized including Jonah Serotta as Laura’s son Richie. The orchestra under Nézet-Séguin played the score as if it had lived with the music for years (as opposed to days which was actually the case).

A historic event indeed and one that stands with Jennifer Higdon’s blue cathedral (2000) Michael Hersch’s The Vanishing Pavilions (2005) and Julia Wolfe’s Anthracite Fields (2014) as great beacons of artistic truth that were first heard in Philadelphia.

The Hours will be repeated at 2 p.m. Sunday in Verizon Hall. Tickets: $53-$165.

Experts say you should watch out for impending cyberattacks thanks to the Russia-Ukraine war. SIM swapping is an especially dire threat since it takes over your smartphone rendering it useless.

Basically a cybercriminal scrapes personal data either from your social media accounts or from a security breach. Tap or click here to see if your info is floating around on the web. They use that information to call your phone carrier pretend to be you and claim your phone is lost.

The carrier then provides a new phone and SIM card disconnecting your old line and transferring everything to the criminal’s device. This means your phone will stop working; you won’t get any calls or texts. SIM swapping is a huge issue which is why you should use these three preventative strategies.

1. Enter a passcode when you change your SIM card

If you’ve never been a victim of SIM swapping you should do two things. First count your lucky stars. Second call up your phone provider and set up a PIN so you never become a victim.

Here’s a quick review if you’ve never heard of SIM swapping. Scammers break into your phone by transferring the data on your SIM card onto one of their own. They do this by calling your mobile provider pretending to be you and linking your phone number to the SIM card in their phone.

Your mobile carrier then deactivates your SIM card. That means the criminal gets access to your phone number.

This access allows criminals to send forgotten passwords or account recovery requests to your email and other online accounts associated with your mobile phone number.

Now the crooks will receive 2FA codes intended for you which gives them access to your online accounts. The criminal uses the codes to log in and reset passwords gaining control of online accounts associated with your phone profile.

You may think “My mobile carrier would never fall for that!” Actually it happens all the time according to the FBI. The bureau says SIM swapping schemes cost victims more than $68 million in 2021.

How to set up a PIN or passcode for your wireless account

To protect yourself contact your mobile carrier or head to its website. Make sure to set up a PIN or passcode that you have to enter to make changes to your SIM card. Now criminals will have to know this PIN to break into your device.

The specific steps depend on which carrier you use. Many carriers have different names for this service. For example AT&T calls this feature Extra Security.

How to turn on Extra Security to get SIM protection with AT&T

Head to your Profile. Tap or click Sign-in info. Select your wireless account from the dropdown menu. In the Wireless passcode section select Manage extra security. Check extra security and re-enter your passcode to confirm it. Check or uncheck extra security and re-enter your passcode if prompted.

How to get SIM protection with Verizon’s Number Lock feature

Verizon’s Number Lock feature literally locks your account. Your number can’t be ported to another carrier until you move the lock. Follow these steps to turn it on:

Sign into your Verizon account online. Head to Account > Account Settings > Security Settings. Click Number Lock. You’ll see your mobile phone number(s). Select On.

SIM swap attack prevention with T-Mobile phone

If you’re on T-Mobile or Metro by T-Mobile you can set up a PIN or passcode for your SIM card. The feature is called Account Takeover Protection. To activate this feature follow these steps:

Sign into your T-Mobile account online. Under My Line tap or click View Details. Head to the Lines and Devices section. Then tap or click on the specific line you want to protect. Select Manage Add-ons.

From there you can select Account Takeover Protection. Tap or click here for a direct link.

This is just the first step in your protection journey though. These steps stop people from porting your number out … but there are still more ways to fight against SIM swaps. Check them out below.

2. Tell your carrier to only port your number when you show up in person

This is another option to take advantage of. Your carrier may not offer it so call them to make sure. Ask the customer service rep to have a note placed on your account.

This note will tell your carrier only to port your number if you show up in person. This is another reason why you should use biometrics. Even if someone does impersonate you they can’t port your number because they don’t have your finger eyeball or face. (Knock on wood!)

3. Use authenticator apps instead of 2FA to fight SIM swapping

One great way to protect your important accounts is by using two-factor authentication (2FA). Whenever you log into your account you have to confirm your identity by answering a prompt on another device. It stonewalls scammers because while they may know your password they can’t intercept the 2FA text or email sent to you.

All of that goes out the window when SIM swapping is involved. When a criminal remotely takes over your phone all login confirmations go to their phone. You’ve lost control of your iPhone or Android.

Thus we recommend using authenticator apps. They generate one-time codes you use to log into accounts. The best part is that the codes generate within the app.

Essentially it’s harder to break into an account you secured with an authenticator. An attacker would need to know your secret key. Oh and they would also need to be able to break into the encryption algorithm. Tap or click here for our simple and easy guide to authenticator apps.

Bonus: Use a password manager to help yourself remember all your strong original passwords

You shouldn’t reuse the same password. It would be best if you created original passwords for each account. Those can be hard to remember. Luckily you don’t have to.

With a password manager you can put everything in one place. Our IT geniuses swear by LastPass. If John and Jeremy’s words weren’t enough trust our content queen Allie. She swears by this app."

Whether it’s in Kyiv Damascus or Kabul it’s hard to know how to respond to stories of families being ripped apart of people fleeing from being shot in cold blood of children deliberately targeted in war crimes.

The case for military intervention on humanitarian grounds is rarely as open and shut as its strongest proponents and detractors would have us believe. However there is one aspect of the humanitarian response that could not be easier to get right. How wealthy countries that can offer safety choose to treat those fleeing war and terror is a reliable test of the moral character of a government: and it is one that Britain is failing comprehensively.

More than three million people have fled Ukraine since the conflict started just under a month ago. The EU responded swiftly waiving all visa requirements for Ukrainians. Poland is now host to almost two million Ukrainian refugees; Romania half a million. Ireland a country with less than 10% of the UK population has offered refuge to 6500.

Britain stands in contrast to the rest of Europe by the mean-heartedness of our response. Ukrainians with family members settled in the UK can obtain a visa to join them but they have reported long delays which left vulnerable refugees scrabbling to fund hotel stays as they wait for Home Office bureaucracy to creak into action. Those arriving in Calais were being told to go back to visa centres in Paris or Brussels. Just 4000 visas for Ukrainians out of 17100 applications have been granted so far. In the first week of the crisis a Home Office minister posted a now-deleted tweet suggesting that Ukrainians could apply for fruit-picking visas.

It quickly became clear that the public were not going to stand for this. And so the government last week introduced an additional resettlement route Homes for Ukraine that allows those without family members in the UK to come so long as they are sponsored by a named individual in the UK willing to house them for at least six months who will be paid £350 a month for doing so.

There are things to like about this scheme. Perhaps most of all it shows the strength of public feeling that Britain should be doing more: 150000 potential hosts registered their interest ahead of its launch on Friday. Placing refugees in people’s homes on a temporary basis can have great mutual benefit: helping them make friends and settle into life in their new communities as well as being incredibly enriching for host families. Unlike refugees who apply for asylum once they reach the UK people on this scheme will be pre-approved to work although only for three years.

To realise these benefits though the scheme must be thoughtfully developed as part of a wider more generous offer to Ukrainians and others fleeing conflict. Instead the government appears to have rushed it through in response to a public demand for action without addressing its risks.

This is a recipe for abuse of female and child refugees: for sex trafficking sexual exploitation and modern slavery

Those risks are serious. Without a trace of irony given the significant administrative hurdles faced by Ukrainians who are eligible for visas and are trying to get here Michael Gove told MPs that the government wanted to “minimise bureaucracy” in matching refugees to sponsors. That means only light-touch vetting checks although the government has now bowed to pressure to in time run more extended checks on those who will be hosting families with children. Refugees must be sponsored by an individual in many cases someone they have never met. The government has said it envisages the scheme applying to individuals who have hotels or Airbnbs with empty rooms as well as spare rooms in their own homes.

This is a recipe for abuse of female and child refugees: for sex trafficking sexual exploitation and modern slavery. Unsavoury people – including criminal gangs fronting this with individuals without criminal records – will see this as an opportunity to get paid as refugee sponsors while using the hold they have as named sponsors on the visa to exploit women for sex and free labour. There is no justification for asking refugees fleeing conflict to accept an individual they have never met as a visa sponsor – indeed the Scottish and Welsh governments will act as “super-sponsors” to avoid this. There are no details about what will happen if the relationship between sponsor and refugee breaks down; though the government has said refugees will not be allowed to apply for housing benefit which risks allowing sponsors using the threat of homelessness to exploit vulnerable adults.

To realise the benefits while minimising the risks this scheme should have been part of a wider visa-free offer not capped at the number of people willing to offer accommodation. Refugees placed with hosts should have access to a case manager – either in a local council or charity – to help manage the placement and get them out at the first signs of exploitation.

That the government has not done this suggests it is driven more by headlines and less by a concern for refugee welfare. It is in keeping with a government whose driving motivation for immigration policy has been to make the UK as hostile as possible to those not born here even though it came at the price of terrible consequences for the Windrush generation who have legitimately lived here for decades or of cruel levels of bureaucracy and extortion for young people who have grown up in the UK hoping to secure their status when they turn 18. Indeed Priti Patel’s nationality and borders bill – which the Commons will vote on this week – seeks to break the spirit and the letter of international law by criminalising those arriving in the UK to claim asylum and sending them to be processed offshore to a territory like Ascension Island.

It is very revealing that Boris Johnson appeared to treat the safe evacuation of cats and dogs from Afghanistan as a higher political priority than getting out individuals who had worked to support British forces. However the scale of the response to Homes for Ukraine is a reminder that while the government may see refugees as legitimate fodder for its culture wars the British public are more generous in their approach to asylum than successive Conservative prime ministers have given them credit for.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL2FzaWFuam91cm5hbC5jb20vdXNhL2RhdGVsaW5lLXVzYS9maXJzdC1vZi1pdHMta2luZC1hLW5ldy1kaWdpdGFsLWJhbmstY2F0ZXJzLXRvLXRoZS1maW5hbmNpYWwtbmVlZHMtb2YtZ3Jvd2luZy1maWxpcGluby1hbWVyaWNhbi1wb3B1bGF0aW9uLWluLXVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,First of its kind a new digital bank caters to the financial needs of growing Filipino American population in US ...,"FILIPINO Americans can now sign up for the first-ever digital bank built with their cross-border financial responsibilities in mind.

BayaniPay has tied up with California-based East West Bank to launch a pioneering neobank that will cater to the banking needs of more than 4 million Filipinos based in the United States.

A neobank also referred to as a challenger bank is a financial technology firm that partners with a traditional bank to provide federally insured banking services.

Launched on March 16 BayaniPay’s neobank services will include the Easy Digital Checking Account powered by East West Bank a Visa Debit Card and zero-fee faster remittances to the Philippines.

Powered by East West Bank the largest publicly traded bank headquartered in Southern California BayaniPay users can apply and open a checking account which will be insured by Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) up to $250000. It has no minimum deposit or balance maintenance requirements.

Associated with the Easy Digital Checking Account BayaniPay will also offer an East West Bank co-branded Visa debit card that can be used at retailers and in-network automated teller machines (ATMs) across the U.S. The company said soon the debit card will provide cash back and other rewards on purchases.

Many immigrants continue to choose to keep their funds in cash because of the barriers associated with traditional banking including high fees and paperwork-heavy application processes.

The latest data shows that the estimated 4.2 million U.S.-based Filipinos account for $145 billion or 14.4% of the $1.3 trillion Asian American spending power in the U.S.

“Despite their significant market size and buying power no bank has catered to their financial needs and responsibilities both here and in the Philippines” BayaniPay chief executive officer Winston Damarillo said during the company’s press launch on Wednesday March 16 in Los Angeles.

Damarillo a serial entrepreneur with three Silicon Valley exits shared how BayaniPay came about based on his experience migrating to the United States and having to adapt to the country’s banking system.

“As an immigrant myself I’ve had firsthand experience with how financial services for global professionals were solely lacking or came with high fees. That’s why we created BayaniPay” he said.

East West Bank executive vice president and chief operating officer Parker Shi said this is the first time that the bank will make its digital banking platform available to enable banking as a service.

“As a premier financial bridge between the United States and Asia we have developed robust digital banking capabilities to meet our customers’ cross-border needs” Shi said. “We introduced direct-to-consumer digital banking services to provide customers around the world with comprehensive solutions that fit their lifestyle. This partnership enables fintech providers like BayaniPay to embed our products and services to serve a whole new group of customers.”

Moreso BayaniPay customers can also continue to enjoy its core features — market-leading exchange rates and zero-fee remittances now completed in real-time — when they apply and are approved for the Easy Digital Checking Account.

Offering competitive exchange rates Damarillo said is a commitment made possible by BayaniPay’s strategic partnership with East West Bank and BDO Unibank Inc. the largest universal bank in the Philippines through its subsidiary BDO Remit (USA) Inc. By connecting two banks BayaniPay is able to take out the middlemen common in many remittance services Damarillo added.

There’s the agent that collects the cash the bank that stores it and somebody in the middle in the forex and the other side in the Philippines that you pay for distribution. If you limit that to East West Bank in the U.S. and BDO in the Philippines it’s point-to-point” Damarillo said.

BayaniPay is able to offer zero-fee remittances because “the customer now is doing everything themselves by using their apps. Now our job is to bridge the two banks and provide the very powerful and secure application” he added.

In line with this BayaniPay has also partnered with Seafood City the largest Filipino-run supermarket chain in the U.S. with an average of about 1 million visits from customers every week. The startup currently has activation booths in stores across California with ambassadors who are helping customers sign up with their accounts.

With a minimum remittance of $99 and maximum daily transaction of $1999 remittances through BayaniPay can be received within 24 hours or less —or 12 hours or less with the digital bank account.

Remittances can be claimed through major Philippine banks or any 1400 BDO branches 4400 BDO Unibank ATMs or over 8000 BDO Cash Agad outlets; plus rural banks pawnshop partners and Cash Pick UP Anywhere locations including: BDO branches SM Forex Business Centers PinoyCenters Palawan Pawnshop Banko Mabuhay Villarica Pawnshop RD Pawnshop Card Bank Bank of Florida QCRB and Rang-ay Bank.

Asked how fool-proof is their system Damarillo assured that all BayaniPay services will undergo a rigid KYC (know your customer) safety check to ensure seamless and secured digital banking transactions for all app users.

“We are backed by two big banks. On the U.S. side its FDIC insured up to $250000 and in the Philippines it is Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) insured. At the two ends it’s highly secured to begin with and guaranteed by the federal governments” he said. “The transmission is between a bank and a bank and the likelihood of the money going away is very less. In addition to that we’ve shown you the biometric KYC that makes it more secure because of the facial recognition. No remittance companies do that I think we’re one of the first ones that had it” he added.

Asked about their future expansion plans Phillip Thong vice chairman of the BayaniPay board said after saturating the US market they would eventually offer their digital platform services to other countries with large Filipino immigrant populations like Canada.

BayaniPay which entered the market in November 2021 offering remittances was formed in partnership with Talino Ventures Labs the Asian Journal and Wavemaker Partners. (The Asian Journal is a partner of BayaniPay but maintains editorial independence.)

“It is beneficial not only to overseas Filipino families but also to the Philippine economy. For all these things the arrival of BayaniPay is such a wonderful thing. But what makes it more remarkable is that it was developed by Filipinos for overseas Filipinos” said Philippine Consul General Edgar Badajos during Wednesday’s launch.

BayaniPay will initially be available to California residents sending money to the Philippines. The company plans to offer its financial services to other states in the coming months.",,,,,,,,,

DeCicco

Correspondent for the Taunton Daily Gazette

BERKLEY — Dairy farm milk containers filled with water and bucket brigades manned by local farmers fought the fires in Berkley until the fire department was formally established in 1947.

This year as the department celebrates its 75th anniversary it's also marking its mere decades-long growth from a small town community volunteer effort to a modern yet still community-small fire and rescue department.

The current Fire Chief Scott Fournier knows the anecdotal progression of the department well.

His grandfather Francis Fournier was its first full-time chief from 1956-1969. His father Dwight Fournier served as chief from 1992-1993.

He said the town's fire chiefs were part-time until his grandfather was hired.

Before that time he said Taunton mutual aid and ""a rag-tag bunch of farmers with brooms and buckets"" handled the task. A dairy farm truck would fill the large containers used for milk with water to assist many a firefighting effort.

Ash from passing trains sparked blazes in Myricks

Even after the department was established by a town meeting vote on March 3 1947 firefighting remained community oriented Eden Jones of the Berkley Historical Society said.

Real estate report:New house in new Taunton subdivision sells for more than $600000; Berkley's sales

In the 1970s young boys would sign in at the fire station to fight a local blaze then get paid at the end of each month.

She noted the early 20th century saw a lot of fires in Myricks because ash from the trains traveling on the nearby railroad tracks sparked the blazes. That's why many of the houses and buildings in that part of town had metal roofs.

Stations one and two built in 1950s

But Myricks didn't get its own station until the late 1950s. Station #2 was built in 1957 and opened in 1958. It cost $20500 for the combined cost of its construction and its new factory-built Ford Darley fire truck.

Station #1 which stood where the current police and fire public safety building is located off of the town common was built earlier in 1953 the year the town purchased its first factory-built fire truck a 1953 Ford Farrar.

Before that time the town stored fire apparatus in private barns and garages and fire chiefs worked out of their homes Jones said.

Memorable blazes in Berkley history

Most noteworthy among Jones' records: The original Berkley Congregational Church built in 1848 burned to the ground in December 1903 as ""the tall steeple fell to the cellar and the spot where but two hours ago the church stood was but a heap of ash.""

Fournier recalled being one of the first to respond to two of the town's biggest fires in his lifetime.

When the fire that gutted the Common Place store 11 North Main St. started in February of 1990 he was working on the highway department building that was being constructed at the time. He was the highway department foreman and an on-call fire lieutenant.

""I saw a lot of black smoke"" Fournier said. ""There was one person on duty then. We went to the fire first. It burned all day. It was tough. We were able to save the front of the building. But it was a 90% loss. It burned all day but we managed it.""

Not just brownies:Chef David takes cannabis cooking to next level in Taunton

According to Taunton Daily Gazette records the fire started when an employee was filling cans of kerosene for a customer.

When fire leveled the famed local restaurant The Golden Pheasant at Berkley and North Main streets in 1991 Fournier was also the first one on scene. That one was a total loss he said.

""We lost water because we had to bring in water by tank. We don't have our own water system. It was another all-day affair. They suspected arson but it was labeled 'of unknown origin'"" Fournier said

Following in their boot steps

Fournier was drawn to become a call firefighter and follow in his father's and grandfather's fire boot steps at age 16 in 1984.

He said his only training then was the fires themselves.

""We had a lot of fires. That's how we trained. Back then we had eight to nine fires a year"" Fournier said.

The reason for far fewer fires

""Now we are lucky to have one a year"" he added but quickly noted he is glad that is the case.

The biggest factor creating this change is the schools' SAFE program that teaches residents early about fire prevention he said.

""Eighty-percent of our calls now involve EMT emergencies. We're putting ourselves out of business. But that's OK. Fire prevention is a big thing now and for a good reason. It's a good thing. It's protection of the public. That's our job"" Fournier said.

The department's first 'Red Network'

Fournier became chief in 2011.

""I enjoy the work"" he said reflecting on his long career in Berkley. ""It's exciting work. I enjoy helping the town helping the people stay safe. It's never the same day to day. I didn't set out to become chief. But here I am 30 years later"" Fournier said.

He's seen the department's growth firsthand and he is proud of that growth. In 1947 he said the town built its first fire truck out of an old Dodge oil truck. In 1960 the department's first ""Red Network"" was installed nine phones connected and a radio dispatch placed in then chief Francis Fournier's home. His wife Marietta served as the only dispatcher for years even after Francis's death.

The system had phones installed in key firefighters' homes. After being alerted a fire was in progress they would run to each station and ""pull the hook"" which would activate the roof sirens at each end of town.

Another milestone the first ambulance

The department's first ambulance a used Packard was obtained around 1960. Its second was a used Cadillac ambulance acquired in the late 1960s. The 1970s saw the addition of a brand-new ambulance and a brand-new engine. That ambulance was a factory-built Dodge van equipped with oxygen and trauma supplies.

The engine was a factory-built Ford Farrar that carried 1000 gallons of water much more than most engines of that era.

The new public safety building that now houses both the fire/rescue and police departments was designed and built in 1997. The fire department now boasts four full-time personnel and approximately 45 on-call members and 24 hours a day fire/EMT/paramedic service.

In between these milestones the fire department started its annual Fathers Day Fire Muster a competition testing the firefighting skills of local teams in the 1950s then after a break re-started them in 1981. The tradition was marked by just a parade in the past two years because of the COVID pandemic. Fournier said the muster will happen for real this year on June 19.

But first will be the 75th anniversary celebration March 30 starting at 6 p.m. at fire station #1 5 North Main St. Local and state dignitaries will speak.

Harris Howard 28 is accused of crashing his Nissan Pathfinder into an SUV while fleeing Ferndale police on Feb. 14 2020. Mary Lackamp 89 was a passenger in the SUV and died three days later from injuries she suffered in the collision. Lackamp a former administrator at University of Detroit Jesuit High School was on her way home from a basketball game at the school traveling with an art teacher from the school and the teacher’s husband. The crash occurred at Eight Mile and Wyoming roads.

Ferndale police said just before the crash Howard was seen driving 70 mph in a 40 mph zone and officers tried to pull him over. Howard reportedly slowed down and activated his vehicle’s emergency flashers but then sped off. Officers followed Howard for less than a minute when he ran a red light and crashed into the SUV police said.

During a pretrial hearing March 15 in Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Cheryl Matthews granted a request to withdraw from defense attorney Fred Miller who said Howard refused to speak with him about the charges. “Basically I can’t proceed” Miller said.

Miller was Howard’s third attorney on the case. Of the other two appointed by the court one left to go into private practice.

Howard told the judge there was a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship with Miller and that he’s “trying to hire another attorney.”

“My family’s scraping up the money” Howard said. “I’m trying to fight for my life.”

The judge said she’s willing to appoint another attorney — warning him that there’s a limit on how many times she will do so — but Howard told her that he wants to move forward with retaining one. Matthews set the next pretrial hearing for March 29 and Howard is expected to have new representation by then.

Howard faces two additional felony charges of fleeing and eluding Ferndale police. He’s jailed without bond.

Howard has multiple felony convictions in four other states mostly for theft and resisting and obstructing police and was wanted in Texas for an outstanding drug charge police said. He was released from a Pennsylvania prison a few months before the deadly crash.

Walmart,"A man critically wounded his wife and killed the man she was with at a busy Walmart parking lot in Berks County in a case of domestic violence police said.

There were various patrons including children in and around the store when the suspect arrived at the Brookshire Square Shopping Center in Wyomissing and shot his wife Wyomissing Police Department Chief John Phillips said.

The other man tried to get away in an SUV but he was fatally shot as he drove with the SUV crashing before coming to a stop Phillips said. Police were also investigating a sedan that appeared to have its driver's side window shot out.

Police identified the alleged shooter as Nehemias Santiago Montes. The victims were identified as Jessica M. Cruz-Rodriguez 30 and Alexi Omar Rodriguez Serra 34. Cruz-Rodriguez remained hospitalized in critical condition from wounds to her head police said.

Tasha Richardson said she was near the front of the Walmart when employees came running through the store and told people to head to the back because of a possible active shooter.

“It’s really scary because we were at the door. We were in self-checkout. It’s right at the door. We were on our way outside” Richardson said.

Phillips said the situation could have been a lot worse.

“We have kids coming in and out of all these stores all the time. It could have been a real tragedy more than what it already is” he said.

Police officers quickly arrived and arrested the gunman.

Why aren't more of them doing it?,"CNN —

As the US attempts to wean itself off its heavy reliance on fossil fuels and shift to cleaner energy sources many experts are eyeing a promising solution: your neighborhood big-box stores and shopping malls.

The rooftops and parking lot space available at retail giants like Walmart Target and Costco is massive. And these largely empty spaces are being touted as untapped potential for solar power that could help the US reduce its dependency on foreign energy slash planet-warming emissions and save companies millions of dollars in the process.

At the IKEA store in Baltimore installing solar panels on the roof and over the store’s parking lot cut the amount of energy it needed to purchase by 84% slashing its costs by 57% from September to December of 2020 according to the company. (The panels also provide some beneficial shade to keep customers’ cars cool on hot sunny days.)

As of February 2021 IKEA had 54 solar arrays installed across 90% of its US locations.

Big-box stores and shopping centers have enough roof space to produce half of their annual electricity needs from solar according to a report from nonprofit Environment America and research firm Frontier Group.

Leveraging the full rooftop solar potential of these superstores would generate enough electricity to power nearly 8 million average homes the report concluded and would cut the same amount of planet-warming emissions as pulling 11.3 million gas-powered cars off the road.

The average Walmart store for example has 180000 square feet of rooftop according to the report. That’s roughly the size of three football fields and enough space to support solar energy that could power the equivalent of 200 homes the report said.

“Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them” Johanna Neumann senior director for Environment America’s campaign for 100% Renewable told CNN. “Now is the time to lean into local renewable energy production and there’s no better place than the roofs of America’s big-box superstores.”

Judson Jones CNN

Advocates involved in clean energy worker-training programs tell CNN that a solar revolution in big-box retail would also be a significant windfall for local communities spurring economic growth while tackling the climate crisis which has inflicted disproportionate harm on marginalized communities.

Yet only a fraction of big-box stores in the US have solar on their rooftops or solar canopies in parking lots the report’s authors told CNN.

CNN reached out to five of the top US retailers — Walmart Kroger Home Depot Costco and Target — to ask: Why not invest in more rooftop solar?

Many renewable energy experts point to solar as a relatively simple solution to cut down on costs and help rein in fossil fuel emissions but the companies point to several roadblocks — regulations labor costs and structural integrity of the rooftops themselves — that are preventing more widespread adoption.

The need for these kinds of clean energy initiatives is becoming “unquestionably urgent” as the climate crisis accelerates said Edwin Cowen professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University.

“We are behind the eight ball to put it mildly” Cowen told CNN. “I would have loved to see policy help incentivize rooftop solar 15 years ago instead of five years ago in the commercial space. There’s still a tremendous amount of work to do.”

What’s the holdup?

Neumann said Walmart the nation’s largest retailer possesses by far the largest solar potential. Walmart has around 5000 stores in the US and more than 783 million square feet of rooftop space — an area larger than Manhattan — and more than 8974 gigawatt hours of annual rooftop solar potential according to the report.

It’s enough electricity to power more than 842000 homes the report said.

“Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them.” Johanna Neumann Environment America

Walmart spokesperson Mariel Messier told CNN the company is involved in renewable energy projects around the world but many of them are not rooftop solar installations. The company has reported having completed on- and off-site wind and solar projects or had others under development with a capacity to produce more than 2.3 gigawatts of renewable energy.

Neumann said Environment America has met with Walmart a few times urging the retailer to commit to installing solar panels on roofs and in parking lots. The company has said it’s aiming to source 100% of its energy through renewable projects by 2035.

“Of all the retailers in America Walmart stands to make the biggest impact if they put rooftop solar on all of their stores” Neumann told CNN. “And for us this report just underscores just how much of an impact they could make if they make that decision.”

According to Environment America Walmart had installed almost 194 megawatts of solar capacity on its US facilities as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year and additional capacity in off-site solar farms. The company’s installations in California were expected to provide between 20% to 30% of each location’s electricity needs.

Target ranked No. 1 for on-site solar capacity in 2019 according to industry trade group Solar Energy Industries Association’s most recent report. It currently has 542 locations with rooftop solar — around a quarter of the company’s stores — a Target spokesperson told CNN. Rooftop solar generates enough energy to meet 15% to 40% of Target properties’ energy needs the spokesperson said.

Richard Galanti the chief financial officer at Costco said the company has 121 stores with rooftop solar around the world 95 of which are in the US.

Walmart Target and Costco did not share with CNN what their biggest barriers are to adding rooftop or parking lot solar panels to more stores.

“My suspicion is that they want an even stronger business case for deviating from business-as-usual” Neumann said. “Historically all those roofs have done is cover their stores and rethinking how [they] use their buildings and thinking of them as energy generators not just protection from rain requires a small change in their business model.”

Home Depot which has around 2300 stores currently has 75 completed rooftop solar projects 12 in construction and more than 30 planned for future development said Craig D’Arcy the company’s director of energy management. Solar power generates around half of these stores’ energy needs on average he said.

Aging rooftops at stores are a “huge impediment” to solar installation D’Arcy added. If a roof needs to be replaced in the next 15 to 20 years or sooner it doesn’t make financial sense for Home Depot to add solar systems today he said.

“We have a goal of implementing solar rooftop where the economics are attractive” D’Arcy told CNN.

CNN also reached out to Kroger which owns about 2800 stores across the US. Kristal Howard a Kroger spokesperson said the company currently has 15 properties — stores distribution centers and manufacturing plants — with solar installations. One of the “multiple factors affecting the viability of a solar installation” was the stores’ ability to support a solar installation on the roofs Howard said.

Cowen the engineering professor at Cornell said solar is already attractive but that labor costs incentives and the different layers of regulation likely pose some financial challenges in solar installations.

“For them this means usually hiring a local site firm that can do that installation that also knows local policy” Cowen said. “It’s just another layer of complexity that I think is beginning to make sense because the costs have come down enough but it needs kind of reopening that door of getting into an existing building.”

Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois who co-chairs the power sector task force in the House said the US has “failed to provide the incentives to people who have the expertise to go in and build these things.” The reason both retail companies and the power sector have not made much progress on solar is because “our system is so disjointed” and has a complex regulation structure Casten said.

“Why aren’t we doing something that makes economic sense? The answer is this horribly disjointed federal policy where we massively subsidize fossil energy extraction and we penalize clean energy production” Casten told CNN. “For a long long time if you wanted to build a solar panel on the rooftop of Walmart your biggest enemy was going to be your local utility because they didn’t want to lose the load.

“We could have done this decades ago” Casten added. “And had we done it we would not be in this dire position with the climate but we’d also have a lot more money in our pocket.”

Acting on climate equitably

For Charles Callaway director of organizing at the nonprofit group WE ACT for Environmental Justice strengthening the rooftop solar capacity in big box retail stores is a no-brainer especially if companies allow the local community to reap benefits either through installation jobs or sharing the electricity produced later.

Either way it would put a massive dent in curbing the climate crisis and help usher in an equitable transition away from fossil fuels — and it’s doable Callaway told CNN.

The New York City resident led a worker training program that helped train more than 100 local community members mostly people of color to become solar installers. He also formed a solar workers cooperative to ensure many of the participants of the training program get jobs in a tough market.

In the last two years Callaway said his group has not only installed solar panels on roofs of affordable housing units but also equipment capable of producing 2 megawatts of solar energy on shopping malls up in upstate New York. He emphasized that hiring locally would be most beneficial since local installers know the community and local regulations best.

“One of my huge concerns is social equity” Cowen said. “Access to renewable energy is a fairly privileged position these days and we’ve got to figure out ways to make that not true.”

Jasmine Graham WE ACT’s energy justice policy manager said the potential of building rooftop solar on big box superstores is encouraging only “if these projects use local labor if they are paying prevailing wages and if this solar is being used in a manner such as community solar which would allow [utility] bill discounts for folks that live in the same utility zone.”

Pressure is mounting for global leaders to act urgently on the climate crisis after a UN report in late February warned the window for action is rapidly closing.

Neumann believes the US can meet its energy demand with renewables. All it takes she said is the political will to make that switch and the inclusion of the local community so no one gets left behind in the transition.

“The sooner we make that transition the sooner we’ll have cleaner air the sooner we’ll have a more protected environment and better health and the sooner we’ll have a more livable future for our kids” Neumann said. “And even if that requires investment it is an investment worth making.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YWF5dHYuY29tL25ld3MvaW5kaWFuYS1oZWFsdGgtb2ZmaWNpYWxzLXRlc3Rpbmctd2F0ZXItYWlyLXF1YWxpdHktYWZ0ZXItZmlyZS1hdC13YWxtYXJ0LWRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvbi1jZW50ZXIvYXJ0aWNsZV84ODA5NzFkMS1kOGI1LTU3MDUtYjJjOC1iM2UxNGQxMDliY2MuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Indiana health officials testing water air quality after fire at Walmart distribution center,"You have permission to edit this article.

The decorations live up to the hype. The whole enterprise down to the efficient parking systems was impressive.

Galaxy’s Edge is a new Star Wars themed area in Hollywood Studios

In his book The Decadent Society Ross Douthat argues that following the Apollo mission Americans underwent a period of economic stagnation demographic decline and intellectual and cultural repetition. I think he makes good points and every American should grapple with his proposition.

He specifically mentions Disneyland on page 36-37:

But has anything that fits this description happened since the moon mission? … There has been a growth in what [David] Nye calls “the consumer’s sublime” of Disneyland and Las Vegas. … But the hyperloop is a blueprint Las Vegas is a simulacrum…

Has Douthat been to Orlando recently? Walt Disney was not complacent and neither are the Disney employees who continue to carry out his vision. Orlando is a place where Americans have built stuff in the past few decades instead of trying to veto all progress.

Perhaps it is a decadent society that overvalues the Disney World pilgrimage. My parents never took me so I am proof that you can have a good childhood without it. However to build this zone and enjoy it seems like a perfectly legitimate peacetime activity for a country. People desire to stroll down a safe beautiful clean walkable street with their families. The problem is that so many Americans can only do that for a few days per decade and empty their savings to Disney for the privilege.

There is a pernicious idea that respectable Americans live in towns that look just like 1950 and they do tourism at sites that look like 1850. Walt Disney obviously did not think that way. On Twitter @EliDourado and @mnolangray are agitating every day to build more better stuff. We don’t need Donald Duck on every corner but we could create cities that serve families better.

One surprise I found inside of the Tomorrowland zone of Magic Kingdom is an old ride called The Carousel of Progress.

An American home circa 1900

Newfangled conveniences

Animatronic characters tell the story of material progress in America. As an economist this is a story I have already studied closely. This ride could be eye-opening for some families who wander in just because it’s a ride with a short line and a shelter from the outdoor elements. The Carousel of Progress erased my doubt about what Disney World is about. It is an inspiration whether you like princess parades or not.

Present day American home

An objection to my positive review might be that Disney World has become symbol of inequality. Tyler just posted a link to an article last week about Disney World becoming a destination for the rich as opposed to a broadly accessible American experience.

It is a luxury good. Recall my parents made the prudent choice of never taking me. My husband’s parents made the pilgrimage from Northern Virginia in the ‘90s. They drove the whole 850 miles in the family car and stayed in a cheap hotel 10 miles away from the park. A family of 4 today desiring nothing more than to enter a park for one day would pay about $500. They could pack in water bottles and PB&J sandwiches like we did if they don’t want to buy expensive park food.

Visitors can choose to add on much more. Families who stay in themed Disney resort hotels and eat at exclusive park restaurants and add Fast Pass to skip lines are spending a lot more than $500 per day. No one should feel like they need all these extras and no one should feel like they have to go to Disney World at all. It’s just one nice place in a big world for which no one should run up credit card debt.

While at the park I spent half the day standing in lines. I was scrolling war Twitter a good deal when my kids were under control. Of course more of my mental energy in the past month has been directed toward Ukraine than the Mouse. By fighting this war Ukrainian people are choosing the rules-based order over Russian rule. Putin would like to dictate his philosophies to others but he has created a bad environment for families. One of the more interesting Twitter threads this week explained how Russian speakers within Ukraine turned against the Russian government after experiencing what it is like to live under Russian rule. Leaders who create prosperous safe cities are going to have an outsized impact.

This conflict reminds us of what is at stake and why we should not be a decadent society. People around the world are watching how Americans live. Can families build a good life in democracies? Are safe beautiful streets something that people only experience at Disney World after paying admission or can we build them everywhere?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9maWxtLzIwMjIvbWFyLzE5L3dhbHQtZGlzbmV5LXdvcmxkLWFwb2xvZ3ktdGV4YXMtaGlnaC1zY2hvb2wtZHJpbGwtdGVhbdIBY2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9maWxtLzIwMjIvbWFyLzE5L3dhbHQtZGlzbmV5LXdvcmxkLWFwb2xvZ3ktdGV4YXMtaGlnaC1zY2hvb2wtZHJpbGwtdGVhbQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Nostalgic racism is racism’: Disney criticised for Texas students’ performance,"Walt Disney World apologised after a Texas high school drill team performing at the entertainment giant’s Florida theme park wore fringed outfits and chanted: “Scalp ’em Indians scalp ’em.”

“The live performance in our park did not reflect our core values and we regret it took place” a spokesperson Jacquee Wahler said in a statement.

Native American advocates criticised Disney and Port Neches-Groves high school after video of the performance to Twitter.

“Any Natives who attend [Port Neches-Groves high school] should prolly just accept their classmates dehumanising them cuz ‘tradition’ right?” wrote Tara Houska an Ojibwe tribal attorney and founder of the Giniw Collective and Not Your Mascots.

“Shame on [Disney] hosting this” she said. “Nostalgic racism is RACISM.”

According to the Orlando Sentinel a Disney employee asked the troupe to remove headdresses prior to their performance.

Wahler the Disney spokesperson said the performance that followed was “not consistent with the audition tape the school provided and we have immediately put measures in place so this is not repeated”.

Cuz a bunch of kids in fringe chanting “scalp ‘em Indians scalp ‘em” is honor right?



And any Natives who attend @pngisd should prolly just accept their classmates dehumanizing them cuz “tradition” right?

It has been a tough month for Disney which faced backlash over its response to Florida’s controversial Parental Rights in Education act a measure known by critics as “Don’t Say Gay” and branded as anti-LGBTQ+ rights.

According to screenshots posted by Houska Port Neches-Groves high school whose band performed the Cherokee fight song said it was “terribly disheartened by the disrespect with which they were treated at Walt Disney World in Florida”.

Houska protested a “special kind of death-grip on obviously racist bullshit” and pointed out that the school proclaims “Welcome to the Reservation” on its student activities office Twitter account.

The activist wrote: “Emailing the school generates a response calling Cherokee Nation ‘extremely dishonorable’ for revoking use of their seal. ‘Welcome to the Reservation’ ‘Pow Wow News’ and ‘War Whoop Year Book’. Srsly wtf.”

In recent years Disney has added disclaimers to some of its older material. It now warns for instance that the 1953 film Peter Pan shows indigenous people “in a stereotypical manner”. Other films are flagged for featuring “negative depictions and/or mistreatment of people or cultures”. New material is filtered through a diversity and inclusion initiative.

Houska told the Orlando Sentinel: “It would be a lot more believable that [Disney] are willing to carry out these values if they unequivocally condemn [the Texas school band’s] behavior acknowledge their mistake and continue to try to not only increase representation but prevent something like this from happening again.”

According to the National Congress of American Indians 1929 schools in the US from kindergarten to high school use “Native ‘themed’ school mascots”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy8yMC9wb2xpdGljcy9kZXNhbnRpcy1kaXNuZXktZmxvcmlkYS1sZ2J0cS1kb250LXNheS1nYXktYmlsbC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFbaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8wMy8yMC9wb2xpdGljcy9kZXNhbnRpcy1kaXNuZXktZmxvcmlkYS1sZ2J0cS1kb250LXNheS1nYXktYmlsbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DeSantis vs. Disney showdown bolsters Florida governor's standing in GOP,"CNN —

Months before Disney CEO Bob Chapek tiptoed into a roiling debate in Florida and before the legislation that opponents would call the “Don’t Say Gay” bill was even filed Gov. Ron DeSantis delivered a threat to business leaders who got in his way.

“If you are in one of these corporations if you’re a woke CEO you want to get involved in our legislative business look it’s a free country” the Florida Republican said last June. “But understand if you do that I’m fighting back against you. And I’m going to make sure that people understand your business practices and anything I don’t like about what you’re doing.”

DeSantis this month made clear he wasn’t bluffing. A day after Chapek publicly condemned a controversial Florida bill that would ban classroom instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity before fourth grade DeSantis ripped Disney to a room of supporters. He called Disney a “woke corporation” and criticized its business interests in China. Fox obtained and posted a video from the private event and DeSantis and his staff helped spread it on social media.

For DeSantis already considered a future presidential contender the episode has only further bolstered his standing within his party and it has exposed a widening chasm between the current crop of Republican leaders and the corporations that have traditionally curried favor with the GOP. More and more Republicans once loath to criticize big business have adopted former President Donald Trump’s approach of calling out corporations whose stances on hot-button issues they disagree with.

One longtime Republican consultant in Florida who asked not to be named in order to speak freely about DeSantis and Disney told CNN it was “a different day for the corporate-loving GOP in Florida.”

“This thing with Disney this is his modus operandi” the consultant said of DeSantis. “There’s no playbook anymore for corporations. You just have to take your lumps.”

Disney has faced internal strife and a public reckoning in the days leading up to and after the bill’s passage by the Florida Legislature. Chapek who first said in a tepid statement that Disney’s involvement would be “counterproductive” and did not publicly criticize the bill until it had passed later apologized to his LGBTQ employees telling them “You needed me to be a stronger ally in the fight for equal rights and I let you down. I am sorry.” The fallout continued Wednesday as some Disney employees staged walkouts.

Meanwhile conservative pundits flocked to Twitter to praise DeSantis for standing up to the entertainment giant. One commentator for the National Review wrote that DeSantis had given Republicans “a playbook for confronting woke ideology going forward.”

Disney did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Leaning into fights

To the outside world it was perhaps surprising that a Republican governor would put his state’s best-known company on blast. Disney after all isn’t just an iconic brand it’s also a main driver behind the tourism industry that helps keep Florida’s income tax-less economy afloat. Before the pandemic the theme park annually drew nearly as many visitors as there are people in the state (about 20 million) and it employs 77000 Floridians.

But unlike past GOP leaders DeSantis has been unmoved by corporate pressure or threats of economic boycott over divisive policies. Rather he has gained a national following by leaning into fights no matter who is on the receiving end.

One Republican noted that the legislation Disney objected to didn’t originate with DeSantis and said his involvement was initially minimal. When he first remarked on the bill officially titled “Parental Rights in Education” in February DeSantis acknowledged that there weren’t many instances of Florida classrooms teaching about sexual orientation and identity.

But as outrage against the bill spread throughout the country to late-night television and the White House DeSantis and his team began to aggressively push back. After “Saturday Night Live” poked fun at the bill the governor’s spokeswoman tweeted that anyone who opposed the measure was “probably a groomer” a term used to describe a sexual predator who trains a victim to trust the predator. Opponents of the bill said her comments evoked ugly debunked arguments used in the past by anti-gay activists to diminish and demean the LGBTQ community.

With the bill gaining momentum Disney which is headquartered in Burbank California but has 38 registered lobbyists in Florida worked behind the scenes with state lawmakers to try to soften the legislation. It passed both Republican-controlled chambers largely unchanged.

Chapek told shareholders March 9 that he had called DeSantis after the bill passed the state Senate to convey the company’s “disappointment and concern.” DeSantis’ office said his support for the legislation hadn’t wavered. He then went public with his criticism of Disney.

“When you have companies that have made a fortune off being family-friendly and catering to families and young kids they should understand that parents of young kids do not want this injected into their kids’ kindergarten classroom” DeSantis told supporters in the video reported by Fox. This time he didn’t mention that there are few examples of this occurring in Florida.

As a Republican legislative aide told CNN “It’s like Ron Burgundy said: That escalated quickly.”

Christopher Miles a Miami-based GOP consultant said watching a Florida governor go after Disney was “not a world I expected to be living in a couple of years ago.” But he said DeSantis like Trump has gained popularity by bucking conventional wisdom.

The surprise isn’t that DeSantis pounced Miles said it’s that Mickey Mouse walked into the trap.

“If you come at Ron DeSantis directly he will come after you. He has made that clear” Miles said. “It’s almost like Disney gave him a nice platform to run for president and it was a good opportunity for him to spike the football. If you draw DeSantis into a fight he’s going to go to the mat.”

A shift within the GOP

Disney’s unsuccessful attempt to fight the Florida bill may also be the latest sign of corporate leaders’ dwindling sway over state governments when it comes to divisive policies.

Last year Georgia marched ahead with legislation that put new voting restrictions in place despite objections from some of the state’s largest businesses and Major League Baseball which pulled its All-Star Game out of Atlanta.

By the time Florida passed its own bill to limit early voting the business community was largely silent.

The NCAA issued a statement last year signaling it could pull championship events from states that altered the eligibility status of transgender athletes. Undeterred DeSantis signed a bill banning transgender athletes from girls’ and women’s scholastic sports.

The NCAA still held the men’s and women’s Division I Cross Country Championships in Tallahassee only a few miles from where the anti-transgender legislation became law. Florida is scheduled to host several more championships in the coming years.

“If you don’t want to hold an event in my state you know what I got a lot of events in my state” DeSantis said at the time. “I’m not worried about that.”

In the past corporate leaders were able to convince some Republican politicians that contentious social policy bills would stifle economic activity in their states. In 2015 blowback was swift in Indiana when then-Gov. Mike Pence signed a bill making it legal for businesses to reject service to LGBTQ people if they cited religious exemptions. Criticism came from corporations sports leagues and conventions which warned of economic repercussions. Within 10 days Pence signed new legislation softening the law.

Before Disney weighed in the Florida bill hadn’t stirred that kind of response from businesses.

“The folks who consider the GOP to be pro-business that’s not how they have been acting” said Cathryn Oakley state legislative director and senior counsel at the Human Rights Campaign the country’s largest LGBTQ advocacy group. The organization recently rejected a $5 million donation from Disney because it felt the company hadn’t done enough to stop the bill from passing in Florida.

But Republicans remain convinced that overzealous corporate leaders are using their power to suppress conservative voices and ideals. Other than President Joe Biden and the media industry no entity at last month’s Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando was treated as a greater threat to America than the corporate boardroom. An entire panel at CPAC was devoted to fighting back against what participants saw as the leftward lurch of multinational corporations. Pundits and politicians took turns knocking Fortune 500 companies such as Facebook Spotify and even Coca-Cola and attendees were encouraged to spend their money at businesses that were in line with their values.

“It is really important that we start building our own institutions and our own little networks that are friendly to the American way of life” said Terry Schilling the president of the conservative American Principles Project.

Fundraising pause

Chapek announced after passage of the LGBTQ topics instruction bill that Disney would halt political contributions in Florida. Disney has been a prolific donor to Florida campaigns mostly to Republicans contributing more than $2.1 million to candidates and committees since the start of 2021. The company had previously donated $50000 to DeSantis’ bid for reelection this year.

The DeSantis campaign released its response on Tuesday: A video of a campaign worker delivering the text of the legislation to Disney’s headquarters in Central Florida and a message to “Just read the bill.”

Chapek said DeSantis had agreed to meet with Disney’s LGBTQ employees. DeSantis’ office said it was not aware any meeting had been scheduled.

DeSantis’ dust-up with Disney has provided fodder for his political opponents in Florida but few within the state’s business community are coming to the company’s defense. The Florida Chamber of Commerce and the Associated Industries of Florida two top business groups have remained silent throughout the saga. Neither responded to requests for comment.

Nor have Republicans publicly defended Disney their longtime campaign benefactor. One Republican aide said it was too soon to know the full impact of Disney’s pullback on the GOP’s ability to fundraise. In addition to cutting Republicans big checks Disney properties often host GOP events at no cost to the party.

It is unlikely to make a difference to DeSantis who already has $89 million for his reelection fight.

“He thinks it doesn’t matter. He’s got a bottomless pit of goodwill and his base will support him” said Ron Book a longtime Florida lobbyist. “Everything he does he’s talking to his base.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMjAvZGlzbmV5LWNlby1jaGFwZWstaWdlci1mYWxsaW5nLW91dC5odG1s0gFLaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjIvMDMvMjAvZGlzbmV5LWNlby1jaGFwZWstaWdlci1mYWxsaW5nLW91dC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Extremely awkward': Bob Chapek and Bob Iger had a falling out they rarely talk — and the rift looms over Disney's future,"In this article DIS Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT

April 12 2020. That's the day former Disney CEO Bob Iger's relationship with his handpicked successor current Disney CEO Bob Chapek began to fall apart. Iger had stunned the world in February of that year by resigning as Disney's chief executive effective immediately. He elevated Chapek whom Iger and the board had long seen internally as the front-runner for the position given his operational experience and decades at the company. Iger would stick around as executive chairman and direct the company's ""creative endeavors"" to help with the transition. The timing of a CEO change at arguably the world's most famous entertainment company couldn't have been worse. Just weeks after Iger stepped down Disney began closing its theme parks around the world during the initial stages of the Covid-19 quarantine. Iger and Chapek seemed to be ready for the pandemic challenge together. ""I can't think of a better person to succeed me in this role"" Iger said March 11 2020 during the company's annual shareholder meeting a day before the company announced it would begin closing its parks. Chapek returned the optimism.

A Mouse House divided The pressure is on Disney CEO Bob Chapek whose contract is up early next year. Some key takeaways: Chapek and CEO Bob Iger's relationship soured after Iger gave comments to The New York Times about wanting to help Chapek run the company during the pandemic.

Several employees have called Iger to express their dissatisfaction with Chapek over his response to Florida's ""Don't Say Gay"" bill.

Chapek centralized budget power under his right-hand man Kareem Daniel a move that irritated several Disney veterans – as well as Iger.

Like Iger Chapek and Daniel want to speed up the pace of Disney's digital transformation.

""I've watched Bob [Iger] lead this company to amazing new heights and I've learned an enormous amount from that experience"" Chapek said. One month after those comments with everyone stuck at home then-New York Times media columnist Ben Smith published a story after reaching Iger by email. He reported Iger wasn't going to turn Chapek to the wolves as a brand-new CEO while the world was falling apart. Iger told Smith he would stick around to help run the company. ""A crisis of this magnitude and its impact on Disney would necessarily result in my actively helping Bob [Chapek] and the company contend with it particularly since I ran the company for 15 years!"" Iger said in his email. Chapek was furious when he saw the story according to three people familiar with the matter. He had not expressed a need or desire for extra help. He wasn't looking for a white knight. Iger had postponed his retirement as CEO three times already. Chapek felt he was essentially doing it again leaving him as a hapless second banana according to people familiar with his thoughts. Chapek was already reporting to Iger the board's chairman anyway. The Disney board had little interest in starting a brawl especially given the state of the company and the world the people said. Three days after Smith's story was published Disney accelerated its timeline and named Chapek to its board.

""It was a turning-point moment"" said one of the people familiar with Chapek's reaction to Iger's interview with Smith. Since that incident Iger and Chapek haven't been able to mend their relationship according to about a dozen people familiar with the matter who spoke with CNBC for this story. The people asked to remain anonymous because the relationship and discussions about it are private. In the months that followed Chapek began making key decisions about Disney's future — including a dramatic reorganization of the company and outing actress Scarlett Johansson's salary following a dispute over her Marvel movie ""Black Widow"" — without Iger's input. Internal messages about business strategy from both men would sometimes conflict as it became clear the executives weren't speaking with one voice several people noted. While much of the public narrative has centered around Iger's ""long goodbye"" — he departed as chairman in January — Chapek 61 has actually been firmly in control of Disney for more than 18 months. Normal times would have allowed Iger and Chapek to work more closely. Instead the two executives barely spoke to each other. Chapek has a small circle of close confidants with whom he makes major decisions — longtime right-hand man Kareem Daniel chief of staff Arthur Bochner and to some degree Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy whom Iger promoted to the role in 2015 according to people familiar with the matter. Iger hasn't been part of that circle. Late last year just weeks before his departure as executive chairman Iger threw himself a going-away party inviting more than 50 people at his house in Brentwood a suburban Los Angeles neighborhood. He spoke at length about his time at Disney in front of the crowd. Chapek attended but there was little interaction between the two men according to people who attended the party. Guests — including veteran Disney executives and on-camera talent such as broadcasters Robin Roberts David Muir and Al Michaels — sat at two long tables at Iger's house. Iger and Chapek sat at opposite tables. Chapek sat near several of his direct reports including Daniel. Iger sat next to film director and mogul Steven Spielberg. While Iger spent about 10 minutes publicly praising former colleagues he barely mentioned Chapek said the people. ""It was extremely awkward"" said one of the guests who asked to remain anonymous because the party was private. ""The tension was palpable."" Both Iger and Chapek declined to comment on their relationship with each other.

Iger's shadow

Chapek's decision to move away from Iger showed chutzpah but it also put him on an island against a Disney icon who also happened to be the chairman of his company and a large shareholder. He also hasn't been able to benefit from the myriad relationships Iger developed from decades at Disney. Anyone succeeding Iger who had been Disney's CEO since 2005 was going to have a difficult time filling his shoes. Iger was generally beloved by Hollywood and highly respected as a CEO particularly after orchestrating a series of intellectual property acquisitions — of Pixar Marvel and Lucasfilm — which will likely go down in media history as three of the smartest deals ever. Iger 71 has even flirted with running for president of the United States. Chapek meanwhile has a harder exterior and at times according to colleagues struggles with emotional intelligence — which happens to be Iger's strength.

Centralizing Disney leadership

In October 2020 about eight months after he took over as CEO Chapek announced Disney was strategically reorganizing its media and entertainment businesses. This was Disney's second major reorganization in less than three years. The key part of the announcement was the following: ""The new Media and Entertainment Distribution group will be responsible for all monetization of content —both distribution and ad sales — and will oversee operations of the Company's streaming services. It will also have sole P&L accountability for Disney's media and entertainment businesses."" Those two sentences upended how Disney has done business for decades. The change gave Daniel the leader of the new Media and Entertainment Distribution group called DMED internally one of the most important jobs in the history of media. The decision was instantly polarizing leading to a burst of internal frustration among some veteran Disney employees who no longer controlled the budgets of their divisions according to people familiar with the matter. Chapek wants to streamline Disney so content decisions across distribution platforms can be made in synchrony. Instead of division heads running their own fiefdoms Chapek and Daniel can steer Disney by controlling the budgets of each group and deciding where content ends up — streaming or cable or broadcast or movie theaters. Executives can then focus on making content or selling ads or building streaming technology with direction from Chapek and Daniel. Historically the heads of Disney TV or ESPN or Hulu or film would run their entire businesses. Conceptually Chapek's idea actually isn't all that different from what Iger had begun to put in place with the organization of Disney+. In early 2018 Iger met with Robert Kyncl chief business officer at Google's YouTube according to people familiar with the meeting. Before Google Kyncl had worked for seven years at Netflix overseeing content partnerships.

Kyncl told Iger if he wanted Disney to start trading at Netflix-like multiples — which were at the time orders of magnitude higher than Disney's — Iger needed to run operations like a technology company. Google separated its content and distribution divisions. The same roles didn't live within smaller groups the way Disney had been structured for years. Kyncl declined to comment to CNBC about the meeting. If Disney wanted investors to see its burgeoning streaming service as the growth engine in a digital-first world Iger realized he needed to centralize power around Disney+. According to two people familiar with the meeting Iger urgently asked then-Disney head of strategy Kevin Mayer to return from the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas so Iger could show him a new organizational structure which he drew on a whiteboard in front of Mayer. Mayer would become the head of Disney's new direct-to-consumer unit in charge of the company's streaming platforms: Disney+ Hulu and ESPN+. Disney officially reorganized in March 2018. Power struggles followed. Mayer and Disney TV studio head Peter Rice fought about who had the authority to decide which shows aired on Disney+. Rice's principal issue was that content executives could no longer have direct conversations with Hollywood talent and tell them whether Disney would make their show or not. Rice feared losing greenlight power would affect Disney's relationship with Hollywood. If studio executives didn't have the power to approve projects they'd quickly lose credibility with creators who would want to speak with the people at Disney who possessed that authority.

Iger had to solve the disputes by making control decisions on the fly. Mayer won the main argument — he would have greenlight power for Disney+. Mayer left Disney in 2020 to become TikTok's CEO months after Iger chose Chapek as CEO. Mayer and Rice declined to comment for this story. While Chapek didn't consult Iger about his October 2020 reorganization he did cite many of the same principles that Kyncl and Iger discussed in 2018. ""Managing content creation distinct from distribution will allow us to be more effective and nimble in making the content consumers want most delivered in the way they prefer to consume it"" Chapek said in a statement announcing the changes. When he became CEO Chapek went on a listening tour of executives to find out what was working and what wasn't. He heard from both distribution and content executives that the current arrangement had become dysfunctional. Chapek decided to reverse Iger's decision to have greenlighting authority rest with the head of the streaming services. He gave that power back to content heads who have more money than ever before to make programming — Disney plans to spend a record $33 billion on content for fiscal 2022. That's largely pleased Disney's content leaders who can now tell creators directly whether Disney will work with them according to people familiar with the matter. But with Daniel getting P&L control long-term Disney executives also lost the ability to run the businesses of their own divisions. Some creative leaders didn't mind preferring to focus on making content rather than selling advertising or working on wholesale distribution agreements with pay-TV providers. Others didn't appreciate their loss of control over budgets. Kelly Campbell's decision to leave her job running Hulu to lead NBCUniversal's Peacock in October was at least partially motivated by her desire to have more control over a business than what Disney allowed her according to a person familiar with her thinking. Campbell declined to comment for this story. One film executive told CNBC that Disney operated smoothly when Alan Bergman chairman of Disney Studios and Alan Horn former chief creative officer of Disney Studios were in charge of the studio's P&L. Film producers knew standard facts such as a movie's marketing budget or a film's release date. In the new world with Daniel in charge it's much harder to find out answers because the creative point people simply don't know the person said. Others saw Chapek's restructuring as simply pushing the envelope on a trend Iger already started —making it clear to Wall Street that streaming was the company's new priority. By putting Daniel in charge of a variety of different budgets Chapek could more easily steer all of Disney in the same direction. Decisions could be made more quickly. This month Disney put its new Pixar movie ""Turning Red"" directly on Disney+ instead of in theaters first. That decision would have taken ""months"" under Iger's structure with division heads flexing their power and knowledge of the market according to three people who participated in the discussions. Instead the debate took weeks with Pixar executives ultimately agreeing that the movie should go to Disney+ first the people said. ""Turning Red"" is the No. 1 film premiere on Disney+ globally to date based on number of hours watched in the first three days. As with any corporate reorganization the proof will be in the results. Disney has a target of 230 million to 260 million global Disney+ subscribers by the end of 2024 compared with about 130 million Disney+ subscribers today. If Disney can get there Chapek and Daniel can claim success — assuming they also revive the company's shares which have fallen about 30% in the past 52 weeks even as crowds have returned to Disney's theme parks around the world.

Kareem Daniel

Daniel's P&L oversight for all movie TV and film distribution advertising sales technology and other divisions — jobs that used to be done by a cadre of Disney employees with 20 or 30 years experience each — gives him one of the most powerful jobs ever created in media. Disney's fiscal 2021 revenue topped $67 billion and has a market capitalization of about $240 billion. Disney routinely outspends all other global companies by billions of dollars a year on entertainment content.

Iger never agreed with giving Daniel so much control. The former CEO felt stripping division heads of their budget control wasn't the right structure for Disney because the company was too diverse and complex. Daniel is a polarizing figure among colleagues who have worked with him. He's described by five former and current co-workers as smart hard-working and gregarious. He studied electrical engineering and got an MBA from Stanford. He'll slap people's backs and is fun to engage with outside of work three of the people said. He's demanding of his direct reports and holds them accountable the people said. Daniel is Black an extreme rarity among the primary leaders of global media companies. He's the first Black senior executive ever to report directly to the Disney CEO in the history of the company. That carries weight with certain employees who respect the symbolism of a minority leader in such a high-profile role. Like Chapek Daniel has worked in a variety of Disney units including studio distribution consumer products games and publishing Walt Disney Imagineering and corporate strategy. He's been close to Chapek for two decades first working for him as an MBA intern in 2002. When Daniel moved to corporate strategy he again worked with Chapek on a variety of projects in 2007 and 2008. He worked under Chapek in distribution for Walt Disney Studios in 2009 when he was part of the M&A team that bought Marvel Entertainment before following him to consumer products in 2011. Chapek was particularly impressed with Daniel's consumer focus when the two worked together to shorten the theatrical window from four months to three months at the end of 2009 according to a person familiar with the matter. But some of the same people who note Daniel's strengths also told CNBC the job may be too big for him — or almost anyone. ""He arguably has the most important job at Walt Disney outside of CEO and he has almost no experience running any of these businesses that were previously run by people that had decades of experience"" said one former coworker. Chapek disagrees with that assessment according to a person familiar with his thinking. He understands the job is massive in scope but feels that Daniel is suited to handle it given his varied experiences at Disney including as president of consumer products games and publishing and president of operations at Walt Disney Imagineering. Since his promotion announcement in October 2020 Daniel hasn't done any published or televised interviews. He declined to comment for this story.

Ideally Chapek would like consumers to experience a more unified digital Disney experience whether it's logging into Disney+ or buying merchandise from the online Disney store or managing theme park experiences with Disney's Genie service which is a kind of digital concierge. Internally some employees informally speak of this grand challenge of unifying Disney technology and experiences as ""One Disney.""

Disneyland was open for about eight years at the time.

Walt Disney and his team were looking for a location for a second Disneyland theme park.

Because Walt Disney World in Orlando Florida is now so iconic (since 1971) it seems as though it must have always been self-evident that this would be the one and only natural home.

Fun fact: All of Disneyland California can fit inside the parking lot of Disney World’s The Magic Kingdom.

This is just to give you an idea of how massive in scale that Disney World is versus Disneyland.

Because of the year-round weather and the amount of land that Walt Disney was able to purchase (by straw buyers over time) Orlando is the perfect location.

However before deciding on Orlando Florida they looked at more than 500 different locations.

Would you believe that New Jersey was one of them? It was! Further New Jersey was where they looked first.

Walt Disney looked hard at the East Coast. His initial desire was to build it on the East Coast that it would be the equivalent to Disneyland but not an identical clone.

Walt Disney really liked the concept of a West Coast and East Coast balance.

Another moment of truth that could have brought a Disneyland theme park to New Jersey was when Disney moved its weekly television program from ABC to NBC.

Meetings with NBC were held with the hopes (actually NBC’s hopes) of moving Walt’s television show and to build another Disneyland in what they referred to as the “Jersey Meadows” which is located a few miles west of New York City in New Jersey.

The network did a feasibility study which showed that New Jersey would be a great location.

Walt Disney followed up with his own study performed by his own guy named Harrison “Buzz” Price.

Price’s study showed that tourism in New Jersey/New York was different. The length of stay of the guests was shorter in duration versus what they were accustomed to.

Also NBC wanted to be a permanent partner with Disney. ABC had agreed to sell back its investment to Walt Disney within a few years.

Finally here was the biggest hurdle of them all for New Jersey to overcome in order to win the Disney sweepstakes as its next location … the weather.

Any outdoor East Coast theme park could not be open year-round. Disney figured that they would only be able be open for about 120 days of the year.

We located a quote from 1963 from Walt’s older brother Roy O. Disney: “Walt gave the Meadows (New Jersey) proposal a careful look but he finally decided that there would have to be some method of controlling the weather — a vast dome or some such thing. When the financial backers looked into the cost of such an undertaking they lost their courage pretty fast” said Roy Disney.

However University of Texas Longhorns men’s basketball head coach Chris Beard explains that Alabama football’s head coach Nick Saban actually taught him something g that he has used in the Longhorn’s basketball program.

Beard states that Saban taught him how to quickly gather information and disseminate it to his team in a short amount of time a skill necessary in just about every sport.

Saban’s coaching abilities transcend beyond football and his ability to instruct not just players but coaches too is a great example as to what makes him so special. One of the greatest coaches in all of football also has the ability to aid in the coaching of another prominent sport.

In fact Saban is actually known as a big lover of basketball.

On the quick turnaround Chris Beard said he learned a lot from Nick Saban and the Alabama football program on gathering and disseminating a lot of information in a short amount of time. “What you give the players and when is really important” Beard said. #HookEm #MarchMadness — Jeff Howe (@JeffHowe247) March 19 2022

(Luis M. Alvarez / Associated Press)

The Lakers showed no resistance on defense allowing the struggling Washington Wizards to have their way and Kristaps Porzingis to dominate the fourth quarter.

The Lakers have been a horrendous defensive team all season and on a night when LeBron James made history by scoring 38 points to become the NBA’s second-leading scorer with a total of 36947 points over a 19-year career surpassing Karl Malone (36928) the Lakers couldn’t fully celebrate the accomplishment because their defense let them down again.

“You got to have a lockdown defense in the fourth and we didn’t have that tonight” coach Frank Vogel said. “The final three quarters we didn’t defend well enough.”

The Lakers began to slide on defense in the second quarter and kept going downhill during their 127-119 defeat to the Wizards.

They allowed 32 points to the Wizards in the second 35 in the third and 34 in the fourth.

The Lakers’ porous defense allowed the Wizards to make 56.5% of their shots in the third and 63.2% in the fourth. For the game the Wizards shot 51.8% from the field.

Then there was Porzingis.

He used his 7-foot-3 frame to take over the game in the fourth scoring 16 of his 27 points. He was six for seven in the quarter a force the Lakers couldn’t stop.

“Kristaps got it going was taking advantage of what we was doing” Carmelo Anthony said.

As a result of a Lakers defense that entered the game ranked 26th in points allowed (113.8) they have just a half-game lead over the New Orleans Pelicans for the ninth seed in the Western Conference.

Westbrook has another good game

Russell Westbrook leaped and grabbed an offensive rebound over Porzingis his eighth rebound of the game and threw a no-look pass to a cutting Stanley Johnson who was fouled by Porzingis on a layup attempt.

Westbrook smiled a look of joy on his face for the way he and the way the Lakers were playing in building a 14-point lead in the third quarter.

Westbrook followed up his strong outing in Toronto on Friday night with 22 points on 10-for-15 shooting 10 rebounds and eight assists.

“I just try to play and see what's the best way to be able to fit with our group each night” said Westbrook who also had five turnovers. “It can be a combination of different things I am able to do on the floor so I try to do that when I can.”

The deaths of several such foraging elephants has garnered global attention thanks to a recent AP news report tweeted out by Leonardo DiCaprio but local conservationists say they’ve been warning about the problem for a long time.

A former head of the Department of Wildlife Conservation says decisions on where to establish new dump sites often ignore wildlife concerns driven by “short-sighted politically motivated” planning.

But just keeping the elephants out of the dumps isn’t a solution; many of these animals are accustomed to raiding local farms for crops — a habit that they very quickly return to when dump sites are shut down leading to yet another problem of human-elephant conflict.

COLOMBO — It took a tweet from Hollywood superstar Leonardo DiCaprio to bring the issue of trash-foraging elephants in Sri Lanka to global attention. But local conservationists have long been flagging the problem one they say is rooted in “short-sighted politically motivated” planning that continues to take its toll on both elephants and people.

On Jan. 26 Oscar winner and environmentalist DiCaprio tweeted to his nearly 20 million Twitter followers a report by the Associated Press on the growing problem of wild Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) dying after feeding in open garbage dumps. Elephants are revered in Sri Lanka and often feature in cultural and religious events. Yet many of the animals feed alongside stray dogs and crows at these garbage dumps many of which are located near conservation sites and other protected areas that are home to wildlife.

“We conducted a survey around Sri Lanka and listed 54 garbage open garbage dumps visited by elephants” Chandana Sooriyabandara director-general of Sri Lanka’s Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) told Mongabay. “The department has nothing to do with the setting up of these garbage dumps but we have to eventually deal with them as elephants frequent the dumps. We are trying to minimize the impact but it is an uphill task as 70% of Sri Lankan elephants can also be found outside protected areas.”

While the AP reported that elephants were dying after eating plastic trash at the sites it’s not the plastic itself primarily polythene says veterinary surgeon Tharaka Prasad the current director of health at the DWC.

“A number of elephants die each year on these garbage sites but the reason of their death is not the polythene indigestion but food poisoning” Prasad told Mongabay. “Lots of food waste is carelessly discarded. This waste is often tightly sealed inside polythene bags. When the food goes bad inside the oxygenless environment the bacteria can create toxic substances and we often found this the actual reason behind the deaths of garbage-eating elephants.”

Ruminants like cows have several chambers in their digestive system that can result in the accumulation of polythene in their gut which can ultimately be lethal. But an elephant’s digestive system is much simpler and the polythene passes through when the animal defecates. But the plastic isn’t without its risks as it can sometimes result in constipation Prasad said.

‘Short-sighted decision’

In Sri Lanka municipal waste is often disposed of in open garbage dumps by local government authorities. Because these sites are unhygienic and foul-smelling local planners try to locate them in areas away from human settlements. This results in dump sites being established in areas frequented by wildlife including elephants.

“If we take care of the garbage we generate in the urban and semi-urban areas where garbage is generated in large quantities the question of elephants eating garbage or elephants visiting garbage dumps for fodder may not arise” Sumith Pilapitiya former director-general of the DWC told Mongabay. “Garbage should be disposed of in the areas where it is generated and not near nature reserves or areas recognized as habitats for wild animals.”

Pilapitiya said that during his time at the DWC the department often objected to new dump sites being set up in and near conservation areas but was often ignored. He recalled the decision over where to dump waste from Dambulla a town in Central province where municipal planners had narrowed down two potential sites: one in a forest reserve in Digampathana and the other on the Dambulla-Matale road a vacant site but dotted with human settlements. Despite the DWC’s objections the planners decided to set up the dump at Digampathana. Today about 30 elephants regularly forage among the trash there.

The decision also created additional expenses for local authorities who have had to set up an electric fence around the site to keep the elephants out and protect workers and equipment.

“A truly short-sighted politically motivated decision resulted in creating a fresh problem with elephants in Digampathana with additional expenses having to be borne to support that bad decision for electric fences” Pilapitiya told Mongabay. “The best and the cheapest solution is to avoid creating new problems in environment management.”

Eat trash or raid crops

It’s extremely rare for elephants to die while feeding at a garbage dump says elephant biologist Prithiviraj Fernando of the Centre for Conservation and Research (CCRSL).

Fernando a global authority on the species who serves on the IUCN’s Asian Elephant Specialist Group said elephants feed very selectively at garbage dumps. “If you compare the health status (body condition) of elephants at the garbage dumps with the ones found in the parks in the same area the ones at the garbage dumps are in much better condition” he told Mongabay. Short of locating these sites away from elephant habitat the best thing to do is to sort the garbage so the elephants can feed on the organic waste separately he said.

Fernando and colleagues have studied elephant behavior at several dumps in southern Sri Lanka. They found the Uddakandara garbage dump located near Yala National Park is frequented by 26 elephants and the one in Wellawaya in has around 24 elephants. The team also monitored the now-defunct dump in Kataragama where more than 45 elephants used to feed. They calculated that with an average of 20 elephants feeding at 54 dump sites throughout Sri Lanka that gives a population of about 1000 garbage-eating elephants.

The study also found that almost all the elephants visiting garbage dumps are bull elephants. Most of them have gunshot wounds the tell-tale sign of a crop-raiding animal that has been shot at by farmers. This complicates the question of how to keep elephants out of dump sites without driving them back into farmers’ fields.

“If you close these dumps then these elephants will spend the time they are spending at the dump on crop raiding so it will dramatically increase human-elephant conflict resulting in more deaths — of people and elephants” Fernando said.

He cited the Uddakandara and Kataragama sites as textbook examples of what can happen in such cases. The government shut down the Uddakandara dump to stop the elephants from foraging in the trash. The elephants duly returned to raiding crops prompting protests by villagers. Faced with this pressure authorities reopened the dump site and the elephants returned to eating garbage. It was the same story in Kataragama Fernando said except the site remains shut.

“The Kataragama dump was closed and after that the human-elephant conflict in the area dramatically increased together with an increase in crop raiding” he said. “People have to invest more in putting up electric fences to safeguard their crops and houses and both elephants and people are getting killed.”

Fernando added that “In a way these dumps actually reduce direct human-elephant conflict. But these dumps need to be better managed.”

In brief

Vietnam has introduced a new extended producer responsibility (EPR) regime that places responsibility on producers and importers to manage waste associated with the full life-cycle of their products. EPR in Vietnam is implemented via Decree No. 08/2022/ND-CP implementing some Articles in the Law on Environmental Protection (“Decree No. 08“) and Circular No. 02/2022/TT-BTNMT on the Detailed Implementation of some Articles in the Law on Environmental Protection (“Circular No. 02“) both effective 10 January 2022.

EPR in Vietnam is introduced in the form of the following mandatory frameworks:

Recycling framework for packaging waste management (“ Packaging Recycling Obligations “)

“) Recycling framework for products (“ Product Recycling Obligations “)

“) Waste management framework for products that are difficult to recycle or that cannot be recycled (“Waste Treatment Obligations“)

Recycling Obligations

Dan McKee is moving ahead with a plan to ramp up Rhode Island’s supply of power from offshore wind farms that would be developed off the coast of Southern New England.

Legislation introduced in the General Assembly at the request of the McKee administration would require that a request for proposals be issued this summer for another 600 megawatts of offshore wind energy.

The plan comes despite uncertainty over the sale of National Grid’s electric and natural gas operations in Rhode Island. The transaction with Pennsylvania-based PPL Corp. is on hold pending court appeals from the attorneys general in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Any new contracts for offshore wind would have to be signed by whichever company owns the utility business.

Rhode Island is already home to the first offshore wind farm in the nation — a 30-megawatt demonstration project near Block Island that went online five years ago — and National Grid has signed a contract to buy another 400 megawatts of capacity from the Revolution Wind project that is awaiting federal permission to begin construction in Rhode Island Sound.

If the new procurement goes forward as planned it would mean that more than 80% of Rhode Island’s electricity would be renewable putting the state within reach of a proposed target of getting all of its power from wind solar and other non-fossil fuel sources by the end of this decade.

Offshore wind is key to making that goal as well as to a more ambitious objective of reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors of the economy including heating and transportation by 2050. In small and densely populated Rhode Island there are no other in-state renewable energy options that would be able to deliver the same amount of power.

How the increase in offshore wind supplies could affect rates is unclear but judging by recent contracts in Rhode Island and other Northeastern states it could potentially save consumers money in the long run.

Even though Rhode Islanders are paying hundreds of millions of dollars in above-market costs for the Block Island Wind Farm the Revolution project by displacing oil-burning power plants and other more expensive generators is expected to yield net savings of $90 million — or about 50 cents a month for the typical ratepayer. And contracts for larger projects in Massachusetts have come in with even lower prices than the Revolution agreement.

Plan for more offshore wind first announced in 2020

It was McKee’s predecessor in the governor’s office Gina Raimondo who put forward the 100% target a year and a half ago describing it as the most aggressive renewables initiative in the nation. Not long before Raimondo left Rhode Island to become U.S. secretary of commerce she announced the plan for the 600-megawatt RFP (request for proposals).

But between McKee’s transition from the lieutenant governor’s office the COVID crisis and the proposed sale between National Grid and PPL the procurement stalled.

The delay didn’t sit well with some in the environmental community who believe the state needs to act with more urgency to move away from fossil fuels and ensure that the state can comply with the emissions-reduction mandates put in place with the enactment last year of the Act on Climate.

“We have been dismayed that we haven't heard anything” Kai Salem policy coordinator at the Green Energy Consumers Alliance said at a meeting last fall of the state Executive Climate Change Coordinating Council that was attended by McKee. “We understand there's been a lot of upheaval ... but we have to get that RFP out as soon as possible because we know that offshore wind is crucial in achieving our goals.”

State energy commissioner Nicholas Ucci vice chair of the climate council said the administration was aware of the frustration and that “the governor wanted to push this forward.”

“These procurements let alone the obligation of taking on a contract of this size is significant for a utility whether you’re National Grid or PPL or anyone else” Ucci said. “These are massive commitments on utilities’ parts and that created some challenges.”

The legislation requires the procurement process to start by Aug. 15. Any contracts negotiated as a result would go before the state Public Utilities Commission for approval.

National Grid says it’s still reviewing the legislation and has yet to take a position. But in general the company “is committed to helping Rhode Island and the region meet its clean energy goals and we believe off-shore wind is an integral path to help meet those aspirations” spokesman Ted Kresse said.

PPL says it’s supportive of the procurement included in the legislation.

“PPL looks forward to completing any offshore wind and other renewable energy initiatives that transition from National Grid or arise in the future” spokesman Mark Miller said.

Should the utility be compensated for offshore wind contracts?

One point of contention in discussions surrounding the procurement was whether National Grid — or if the sale goes through PPL — would be compensated for signing any new offshore wind contracts.

The legislation proposes awarding the utility an incentive equal to 2% of the total value of the contract. Over time the payments would total tens of millions of dollars all coming from ratepayers.

It’s the practice in Massachusetts where utilities get a 2.75% incentive. But it’s not the standard in Rhode Island.

National Grid was awarded a 2.75% bonus payment for the Block Island Wind Farm in 2009 to help secure its support for the state law that paved the way for the project. The company isn’t allowed to mark up the price of power from other sources but it was given permission to do so for certain long-term renewable energy contracts. For the Block Island project payments to the company are expected to total more than $19 million over the 20-year contract.

The rationale for the bonus in regard to offshore wind was that National Grid was taking on additional risk by committing to an energy source that was new to the United States at the time. That level of risk could cause a downgrade of the company’s ratings from agencies like Moody’s and lead to an increase in borrowing costs.

But the Revolution contract was awarded under a different state statute that made no mention of bonus payments. And by the time that contract came before the Public Utilities Commission in 2019 there was some evidence about whether National Grid’s fears about the risks associated with offshore wind contracts had panned out.

So when National Grid asked for an incentive that would have totaled $88 million over the contract term the commission ordered proof to justify the request.

After reviewing the evidence the commission determined that no payments were justified citing testimony that Orsted the Danish company planning the project with utility Eversource will bear the development risk and that ratepayers will assume any cost risk. Then-PUC chair Margaret Curran described National Grid’s testimony in support of remuneration as “not credible.”

In their written decision she and the other commissioners said utilities can be mandated to purchase energy and that no incentive is required.

“The PUC sets rates based on law economics and evidence” they said. “It does not hand out a ‘gratuity’ or tip a utility because of its cooperation in signing a contract that poses no risk to the utility to advance state policy.”

The commission made a similar ruling when it later approved a contract National Grid signed to deliver power to Rhode Island from a Connecticut solar farm.

Nevertheless National Grid maintains its position that an incentive is merited in part because of the long lead time in getting offshore wind farms in the water.

Ucci agrees saying that some level of remuneration is reasonable. But he said the legislation which is an amendment to the statute under which the Revolution contract was awarded does have a sunset provision. It cuts off utility incentives for contracts approved in 2027 and beyond. Payments can also be reduced if the utility’s returns in any given year are higher than allowed.

The 2% figure is not set in stone said Rep. Arthur Handy who introduced the bill in the House. He said there may be room to lower the incentive as the bill works its way through the legislative process.

Bill aims to address fisheries impacts and other issues

The legislation also aims to address other areas of controversy and head off conflicts over individual offshore wind proposals before they may arise.

Recent projects planned for the ocean waters off Rhode Island and Massachusetts have run into opposition from commercial fishermen who complain that siting what could eventually be hundreds of turbines in valuable fishing grounds will interfere with their livelihoods.

The bill would require developers to provide information on turbine layouts and locations during the procurement process. And they would have to submit a fisheries mitigation plan. That information has typically been released once contracts have been approved.

“A lot of that material becomes public” Ucci said. “It gives the public an opportunity to see and comment.”

Handy says he hopes the measure will push the procurement process through and help Rhode Island boost its supplies of renewable energy.

“Too often we just let things languish” the Cranston Democrat said. “Making sure we have some harder deadlines will help. Hopefully this will move us forward to get more of this type of energy into the grid.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

""Downtown and skyways are starting to have a noticeable pulse again"" said Patrick Skinner general manager of Wells Fargo Place the tallest office building in St. Paul's downtown.

The 37-story tower is 90% leased and Skinner now expects building usage to be 60 to 65% of pre-pandemic levels by the summer up from 30 to 35% now.

""Within the last couple of weeks we have learned that all of our tenants save for a couple smaller tenants are planning a return-to work-strategy for the near future"" Skinner said.

Before most office employees started working from home in March 2020 about 1500 workers from Wells Fargo the Internal Revenue Service Merrill Lynch Wealth Management and other tenants were in the building daily.

""We are also seeing very encouraging improvement in activity and sales numbers for our restaurant tenants"" Skinner said.

Downtown Minneapolis and the areas around big corporate campuses such as 3M and Best Buy also will get a boost as more companies set plans for a hybrid schedule for workers.

In downtown St. Paul Wells Fargo workers started coming back last week as did the Travelers Companies' 2100 insurance workers in St. Paul. Securian Financial has set Tuesday for the start of its phased return while Ecolab corporate employees will return April 4.

Already the moves are leading to increasing activity on the streets said Joe Spencer president of St. Paul Downtown Alliance.

""Walking around downtown these days you can feel an anticipation and excitement brewing just under the surface"" Spencer wrote in an e-mail. He also pointed to recently opened bars and restaurants like Momento Lost Fox MetroNome Brewery and Hepcat Coffee.

Sunny skies plus the return-to-work announcements renewed St. Patrick's Day events the Minnesota boys high school hockey tournament — all are ""adding up to a feeling that's been missing for most of the last two years"" Spencer said.

The plummeting COVID-19 infection rates in recent weeks have led many Twin Cities employers to set in motion plans to add office days back into the mix.

Travelers is taking a ""flexible approach to work arrangements"" a spokeswoman said. ""This means that some employees have chosen to or have roles that require them to work from the office full time. While others have fully remote positions and some have chosen a hybrid arrangement.""

That's the approach most companies are taking although the details of hybrid plans differ.

3M reopened its headquarters campus in Maplewood last week and announced its ""Work Your Way"" model that lets most workers choose options.

While most lab and manufacturing employees have to work on-site 3M's U.S. office employees including the nearly 10000 in Minnesota were given a choice to return to the office said 3M spokesman Tim Post during a phone interview.

""Working from a 3M office will be another option for 3M's nonproduction employees as they find a schedule that best works for them"" Post said.

Best Buy's approach for most headquarters employees is more structured — three days in the office two at home or another location of their choice the company said. Some employees will be full time at the Richfield campus and other offices some will be fully remote.

Best Buy's new hybrid structure goes into effect the week of April 18.

Deluxe Corp. employees at the company's new downtown Minneapolis headquarters officially started hybrid work last week joining workers at employers such as the city of Minneapolis the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and Ameriprise Financial.

""We are definitely seeing an increase in workday activity especially in the middle of the week Tuesday through Thursday"" said Steve Cramer chief executive of Minneapolis Downtown Council.

The woman Denise remains concerned that she’ll be targeted again after the incident in January.

The saga began when Denise received a text message that she thought was from her bank Wells Fargo.

It read: “Zelle transaction attempted $3500.” She was asked to respond yes or no to verify the transaction.

When she replied no she said her phone began to ring. The man on the other end claimed to be from Wells Fargo.

Denise said he told her that someone was trying to steal $3500 from her.

The man said luckily they caught the issue in time and claimed there was a simple solution.

He gave Denise specific instructions to follow telling her to log into Zelle and transfer the money back to her own account “to reverse the transaction.”

Denise told Washington DC Fox affiliate WTTG that she began to doubt what the man was telling her so she asked him to prove his identity.

“I said ‘I need something where nobody else knows but an inside person.’

“And he said ‘You just made a transaction. You transferred the money from your savings to your checking.’

“And he told me the exact amount. And I thought ‘Well OK.'”

In reality the money was already gone.

Sgt Michael Smith with the Charles County Sheriff’s Office said the caller likely already had access to Denise’s bank account.

He said scammers often get bank account login information from the dark web or through data breaches.

“These people are employed by major operations to get this information to use this information against you” Smith said.

“Sometimes it’s overseas sometimes it’s domestic.”

He said the sheriff’s office was currently investigating a case involving a victim who lost $600000 in a scam.

His advice – if you have one moment of doubt don’t go through with what the scammer is asking.

Denise said she was planning to use the money for home repairs.

“I’m a single mom I work hard every day” she said.

3 The woman managed to get the funds returned to her on March 17 2022. Shutterstock

“That’s a lot of money for me.”

Fortunately for Denise her money was returned on St Patrick’s Day after her story gained media attention.

She said sharing her story has helped “so many people that I am aware of.”

Meanwhile Wells Fargo warned customers of these types of scams.

In a statement the bank said: “It’s disheartening that scammers are actively pursuing and defrauding victims. We never want to see anyone become a victim of a scam and we want to make sure everyone is aware that criminals can spoof a caller ID number so it appears as if a call or text is from your bank.

“To be safe don’t respond. Contact your bank using legitimate sources such as the number on the back of your debit card.

Two executives of Crux Wealth Advisors – Travis Alexander and Chris Campbell – have acquired a two-story brick building at 6506 E. Quaker Road with a rounded façade that wraps around the corner of East Quaker and North Buffalo Street at the Four Corners intersection. The building had been owned by David Hart of Hart Hotels and Orchard Park developer Peter Krog. Alexander and Campbell paid $3.225 million.

Located across the street from Mangia Ristorante & Caffe the 24228-square-foot building is home to Wells Fargo Advisors OP Social Tap & Grill restaurant and Mongoose Research a technology communications consulting firm. Now the 16-year-old building will also house a second local office for Long Beach Calif.-based Crux which is affiliated with Raymond James Financial Services.

""It’s a pretty well-known property and transactions like this don’t come along that often"" said Campbell an Orchard Park native and vice president of Crux who brought the 6-year-old money management firm to his hometown. ""That building is known and referenced when everybody is giving directions.""

Crux will not be taking over the entire building for its office space. After spending nine months negotiating a lease and then a purchase with the sellers – who own OP Social – Crux wants to keep the restaurant in place. The business recently completed a ""massive renovation"" that included a new artisan pizza oven and improvements to the bar to make it more upscale Campbell said.

""We want them to be able to thrive"" Campbell said. ""They’ve got a lot of really awesome ideas about the growth of the restaurant and things they’d like to implement in the future. They’ve been tied to the community for a really long time and their reputation speaks for itself.""

Mongoose which has been hiring 15 to 20 employees a year because of its own growth will also stay Campbell said.

""We’re not coming in there to take over the whole space and do a bunch of renovations"" he said. ""It’s a fairly new building.""

This is the second local real estate transaction for Crux in just over a year after it acquired the one-time Delaware Avenue home of a two-time New York State lieutenant governor in late 2020 for $1.09 million and then unveiled plans for a $2 million renovation.

Construction was delayed for a couple of months by preservation concerns but has been in full swing for the past five months with plans for completion and opening in May.

“We’re continuing to try to foster the ability to have a positive impact on the community” said Alexander founder and CEO of Crux.

Located at 434-438 Delaware Ave. the 9536-square-foot mansion – long since converted to offices – was designed by H.H. Richardson and built between 1869 to 1871. The orange brick and gray sandstone house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and will now have office space for 20 financial advisers and 10 staff members.

""It just falls in line with our expansion initiatives"" Campbell said. ""Our objective is not to have a bunch of offices in locations that are not unique. We want the client experience that we provide to be different and set us apart from everyone else. We also want to make sure that the clients are comfortable and part of that comfort is being known.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vdWNsYWJydWlucy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzMvMjAvbWVucy1iYXNrZXRiYWxsLXVjbGFzLWdhbWUtdGltZS10di1kZXRhaWxzLWZpbmFsaXplZC1mb3ItZnJpZGF50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UCLA's Game Time TV Details Finalized for Friday,"LOS ANGELES – The UCLA men's basketball team will face North Carolina (26-9) in Philadelphia in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament this Friday evening.



UCLA's game on Friday March 25 will begin at approximately 6:40 p.m. PT (9:40 p.m. ET in Philadelphia). The Bruins' contest against North Carolina will be nationally televised on CBS. Ian Eagle and Jim Spanarkel will be calling the action live at Wells Fargo Center with Jamie Erdahl serving as the sideline reporter.



The Bruins' contest will be available on the radio in the Los Angeles area on AM 1150 with Josh Lewin and Tracy Murray calling the action live at Wells Fargo Center.



UCLA (27-7) earned the No. 4 seed in the East Regional when the 68-team bracket was announced last Sunday while North Carolina secured the East Region's No. 8 seed.



UCLA will take on North Carolina after the regional semifinal contest between No. 3-seed Purdue and No. 15-seed Saint Peter's. That semifinal game is set to begin at approximately 4:09 p.m. PT (7:09 p.m. ET in Philadelphia). UCLA's contest will begin after the conclusion of the game between Purdue and Saint Peter's.



The Bruins have not faced North Carolina since playing the Tar Heels in the CBS Sports Classic (in Las Vegas) on Dec. 21 2019. North Carolina won that matchup against UCLA 74-64. The Tar Heels have gone 10-3 in the all-time series against UCLA with the two schools having first played each other in the 1968 NCAA Championship game at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. The Bruins won that title contest 78-55 on March 23 1968.



UCLA has advanced to the Sweet 16 for the fifth time in the past nine seasons and for the second consecutive year. The Bruins won five consecutive NCAA Tournament games last season moving from the First Four to the Final Four – UCLA's first Final Four appearance since 2008.



Most recently the Bruins picked up NCAA Tournament wins against Akron (57-53) last Thursday and versus Saint Mary's (72-56) on Saturday evening.



North Carolina has advanced to the upcoming Sweet 16 with wins against No. 9-seed Marquette (95-63) and No. 1-seed Baylor (93-86 OT) on Thursday and Saturday respectively. The Tar Heels compiled a 15-5 record in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) finishing in a tie for second place with Notre Dame.



The Bruins' upcoming contest against North Carolina will mark UCLA's first games in Philadelphia since the 2009 NCAA Tournament when the Bruins defeated VCU in the first round before losing to Villanova in the second round.

The Green line of SSDs lives at the bottom of WD’s product stack as their value entrant. Previously we have looked at WD’s mid-range Blue line as well as their high-end Black line so it will be nice to round out the set with the Green.

WD Green SN350 1TB NVMe SSD

The WD Green SN350 1TB comes in a single-sided M.2 2280 (80mm) form factor.

The WD Green SN350 PCB layout is very similar to the Blue SN550. Both drives are DRAM-less and they pair a single NAND package with a custom WD controller. The two drives diverge in the type of NAND; the SN350 1TB is based on QLC NAND rather than the TLC from the Blue line drives. Both the controller and NAND are produced in-house and branded as SanDisk.

The rear side of the drive has nothing except some silkscreened logos and regulatory markings.

WD Green SN350 SSD Specs

The WD Green SN350 line of SSDs is available in an odd trio of sizes; 960GB 1TB and 2TB. Here are the specs of each:

I say the sizes are odd because there is both a 960GB drive and a 1TB drive with vastly different specs. The 960GB drive is TLC-based though is rated for lower performance and endurance. My 1TB review model is QLC based along with the larger 2TB model. Rated performance specs on the two larger SN350 drives are respectable with the 1TB at 3200 MB/s read and 2500 MB/s write.

Endurance on the entire WD Green SN350 line is uniformly terrible. The common endurance point for 1TB NVMe SSDs is in the 500-600TBW range while the WD Green SN350 1TB is only rated at 100TBW. Worse still is the 2TB drive which is also rated at 100TBW despite doubling in capacity. These drives are strictly for light duty only.

Lastly the warranty is listed at 3 years rather than the 5 years on the Blue and Black lines of drives we have previously reviewed.

CrystalDiskInfo can give us some basic information about the SSD and confirms we are operating at PCIe 3.0 x4 speeds using NVMe 1.4.

Test System Configuration

We are using the following configuration for this test:

Motherboard : ASUS PRIME X570-P

: ASUS PRIME X570-P CPU : AMD Ryzen 9 5900X (12C/24T)

: AMD Ryzen 9 5900X (12C/24T) RAM: 2x 16GB DDR4-3200 UDIMMs

Our testing uses the WD Green SN350 1TB as the boot drive for the system installed in the M.2_1 slot on the motherboard. The drive is filled to 85% capacity with data and then some is deleted leaving around 60% used space on the volume.

Next we are going to get into our performance testing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVwaW5nY29tcHV0ZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc2VjdXJpdHkvd2VzdGVybi1kaWdpdGFsLWFwcC1idWctZ2l2ZXMtZWxldmF0ZWQtcHJpdmlsZWdlcy1pbi13aW5kb3dzLW1hY29zL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVwaW5nY29tcHV0ZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc2VjdXJpdHkvd2VzdGVybi1kaWdpdGFsLWFwcC1idWctZ2l2ZXMtZWxldmF0ZWQtcHJpdmlsZWdlcy1pbi13aW5kb3dzLW1hY29zL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Western Digital app bug gives elevated privileges in Windows macOS,"Western Digital's EdgeRover desktop app for both Windows and Mac are vulnerable to local privilege escalation and sandboxing escape bugs that could allow the disclosure of sensitive information or denial of service (DoS) attacks.

EdgeRover is a centralized content management solution for Western Digital and SanDisk products unifying multiple digital storage devices under a single management interface.

It's a proprietary software solution aiming to increase usability and comfort offering powerful content searching filtering categorization options privacy settings collection creation duplicate detection and more.

Considering that Western Digital is one of the world's most successful manufacturers and retailers of digital storage products there are likely a significant number of people using EdgeRover for data management.

A data exposing problem

The vulnerability tracked as CVE-2022-22998 is a directory traversal bug allowing unauthorized access to restricted directories and files. The vulnerability has been given a CVSS v3 severity rating of 9.1 categorizing the flaw as critical.

Western Digital's brief advisory does not provide much detail regarding the vulnerability so it is not clear if it is a DLL hijacking bug allowing local privilege elevation or a bug allowing access to unprivileged data locations.

However Western Digital is advising its customers to update their EdgeRover desktop applications to version 1.5.1-594 or later released last week to resolve these vulnerabilities.

The flaw was discovered by threat researcher Xavier Danest who responsibly disclosed it to the vendor.

Western Digital addressed the security problem by correcting the file and directory permissions to prevent unauthorized access and modification.

It is unclear if the vulnerability has been actively exploited Bleeping Computer has contacted the hardware giant to request more details.

It should be noted that for a threat actor to utilize this vulnerability to steal your data it is likely your system has already been compromised in some manner.

Media collection management apps may appear enticing especially to users who need to organize several terabytes of data from various sources. Still one shouldn't forget that each app comes with its own set of security and privacy risks.

Users worried about the privacy implications of using EdgeRover (Western Digital)

In this case it's convenience vs. security as CVE-2022-22998 could potentially lead to the exposure of the users' entire private media and data collection.

If you're worried about this scenario we suggest that you stick with the default file manager that comes with your OS and keep the number of third-party apps on your system at a minimum.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHVsYXJtZWNoYW5pY3MuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvZzM5NDMwMDQ2L2Jlc3QtZXh0ZXJuYWwtaGFyZC1kcml2ZXMtcHM1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Best PS5 External Hard Drives in 2022 - External Hard Drives for PS5,"Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

The PlayStation 5 (PS5) is one of the best game consoles available right now. Capable of playing the latest games at stunning resolutions and frame rates the PS5 shows users what next-gen gaming has to offer.

Unfortunately it also shows how much storage space next-gen games need with popular titles like Red Dead Redemption II and NBA 2K21 taking up at least 100GB of storage space. While the PS5’s 667GB of usable internal storage may sound like a lot a handful of these big new titles can easily take up all of its storage space.

Luckily there are a few options to expand your PS5 storage space. One of the simplest methods is with a great external hard drive.

What to Consider

When picking the best external storage drive for your PS5 it’s best to keep a few things in mind.

First the PS5 cannot play PS5 games that are stored on an external storage drive. While external drives work great for storage any PS5 game you want to actively play needs to be stored on the internal storage drive. The PS5 can however play PS4 games stored on an external drive.

Second there are a ton of different kinds of external storage drives to choose from but we highly recommend using a solid state drive (SSD). Especially if you plan on playing PS4 games stored on your external drive a fast SSD will offer a much better playing experience than older cheaper hard disk drives (HDD).

Here’s the scoop.

The Port of Everett and Weyerhaeuser Muse LLC owned by Jack and Jin Ng of China City Property LLC have entered into a 10-year lease to restore and reopen Everett’s historic Weyerhaeuser Building as a new community gathering space and commemorate the building’s rich history.

The agreement includes plans to renovate the 1920s-era waterfront icon to serve as The Muse – a new whiskey bar and coffee shop as well as provide meeting space for the valued boating clubs at the Port of Everett Marina. The Port is investing up to $1 million to get the building ready to accept tenant improvements anticipated to begin later this year.

The building is set to open on its centennial in 2023 allowing public access to this unique piece of history for the first time in more than 20 years.

“We are so fortunate that we found a tenant passionate about this building and has agreed to partner with us on the adaptive reuse of this building to get it back open for public enjoyment in a meaningful way” Port of Everett CEO Lisa Lefeber said. “The tenant has also agreed to have the building serve as a museum of the rich history of the building and timber industry on the Everett waterfront.”

The ornate Gothic-style structure was designed by Carl Gould and built in 1923. Though it looks more like a house the one-and-a-half-story building served as the timber company’s administration office. The Weyerhaeuser Building which has moved three times and is in its fourth and final location at the Port’s Boxcar Park still has the 160-ton safe that stored the mill’s payroll as well as the money from company local lumber sales.

The Muse will soon offer a place where you can enjoy a beverage lite bites conversation and waterfront views all while taking a step back to an earlier time.

“It feels like it’s meant to be” said Jack Ng owner of Weyerhaeuser Muse LLC. “This building has been waiting for me for 32 years – straight out of a story “open sesame” and I’m exactly where I’m supposed to be. The Weyerhaeuser Building opened back on March 23 1923. I immigrated to America on March 23 1990 so this project is symbolic for me. As such we are planning a grand re-opening celebration on the building’s centennial on March 23 2023.”

The Port will maintain ownership of the historic structure and is responsible for providing a useable interior space for the tenant while maintaining the exterior. It is estimated to cost approximately $1 million (for which the Port is seeking grant funding opportunities) to bring it to a condition to begin tenant improvements.

The work includes but is not limited to the repair/replacement of all windows to historic standards interior renovations ADA accessibility upgrades utilities upgrades modernization of restrooms and exterior landscape improvements. The Port has structured the rent and profit sharing to cover the Port’s investments to this historic resource and allow this public access amenity to open to visitors.

The Port has future plans to redevelop the 2-acre park surrounding the building and is actively seeking a new partnership to add a waterfront performance venue off the west side of the building.

As Spencer Williams greets me from the Bozeman Montana headquarters of his company West Paw Inc opens in a new tab . my gaze goes right through the glass wall in his office onto the manufacturing line churning out recycled dog toys behind him. Even from a Zoom screen it’s easy to get a feel for the heritage business that got its start in 1996 but really traces back through five generations of Williams’s who have lived and worked in Montana.

Today West Paw remains an ode to the local community a leader in the sustainable pet movement opens in a new tab  and a treat for dog parents looking to buy thoughtfully and transparently made products for their pet. I chatted with Williams about his inspiration to start the company how they’re doing things differently and where he wants to take it next. Today he answers me solo but notes that his pup Niko a six-year-old Poodle is usually there to chime in from his spot on one of the company’s signature dog beds — also made just beyond the glass.

What was your inspiration for starting West Paw?

I knew I wanted to come back to Montana to work and manufacturing really resonated with me because of the impact it could have on the community. Back when I started the company my then-fiancé now wife and I were just crazy for our chocolate Lab. At the time a friend told me about a woman who was a great sewer of cat and dog toys. She had been in business for several years and wanted to sell it. It was the perfect opportunity for me to learn from her so I jumped in with both feet.

Fast forward to today and you’re the first pet product manufacturer to earn a B Corp certification. Can you talk through what it means to be a B Corp and why that was something you wanted to pursue?

We became certified as a B Corp opens in a new tab in 2013. In order to get certified you have to score 80 points or higher on a scale of 200 and you’re rated on five impact areas: Governance Workers Community Environment Customers. A big reason we became a B Corp was that we wanted to be part of a movement to drive change. As one small company in Montana you wonder how much impact you can really have. But when you’re a B Corp you scale that impact because now you’re part of a movement.

In the years since then we’ve also been a co-founder in the Pet Sustainability Coalition opens in a new tab which provides resources and consulting to help encourage more sustainability in our industry. It started with eight co-founding members and now there are up to around 175 members: Everybody from Petco to small independent retailers.

How does this commitment to sustainability translate to the treats that you sell?

I grew up on a ranch and it’s very obvious to me that our food system in this country opens in a new tab is broken. Oftentimes beef prices are through the roof but the producers — the ranchers — are not getting any of the money. One of the things I noticed when touring cutting room floors of slaughterhouses around Montana and Wyoming is that the organ meat often goes to waste. That costs the producers money because it’s good protein that’s getting left behind.

That’s why we use organ meat as the primary ingredient in our treats. We use the heart liver and lungs of bison beef and turkey to help ensure that these healthy proteins that the Earth put a lot of resources into growing don’t go to waste. We also focus on humanely raised sustainably sourced U.S.-origin natural ingredients across the board. They’re better for the dog and better for the farm animal.

What about your toys — how are you doing those differently?

So many dog toys don’t get recycled and are full of heavy metals BPA and phthalates. When we introduced our Zogoflex toy line opens in a new tab 18 years ago we wanted to create a durable safe U.S.-made product that could be recycled through a close-the-loop program. Anybody can recycle any Zogoflex toy through retailers or send it directly to West Paw. Right behind me we grind it up clean it and make brand new toys out of it.

Our new dog toy line Seaflex opens in a new tab  also uses around 11% ocean-bound plastic. That product line is something I’m super proud of because we all know that ocean-bound plastic is a huge issue. We’re really focused on keeping it from getting into the ocean in the first place by capturing it on land cleaning it up and helping get it back into really awesome products that dogs love.

Speaking of does Niko have a toy or West Paw product he loves the most?

His favorite toy is the Seaflex Snorkl opens in a new tab . He can hold one end and I’ll hold the other end to play tug or he just loves to chew on it. Between the Snorkl and his Heyday bed opens in a new tab  he’s a happy dog — but the treats are what make him really good. He’ll do anything for the bison lung. Oh my gosh he suddenly becomes the best-behaved dog on the planet when those are around.

I know sustainability is becoming more important for a lot of eco-conscious pet parents. What are a few ways people can start reducing their pet’s impact?

Their food has a larger environmental impact than anything so I think that’s the first place to start: Are you able to feed them something that’s sustainably raised and organic? Maybe you start with just part of the food a 50-50 mix. Generally speaking more natural foods are going to be healthier for the pet too. Then I’d definitely encourage pet parents to look at their accessories next. It doesn’t take much searching today to find pet products opens in a new tab that are either recyclable or recycled.

Third there’s the packaging. Most treats and dog food are packaged in a multi-layer resin: You might have a layer of foil to keep the fats in the food then you have a layer of polyethylene plastic or something else. These layers stop the recyclability so I’d recommend a single-layer resin (which West Paw recently switched over to!).

What’s next for West Paw?

As a company we’re so grateful for our team here and the fact that we can make our products in Montana. We’re going to continue to grow this brand and hopefully inspire other brands to be more sustainable and create longevity in our business. We’re a 25-year-old company and we want to make sure we go through the next 25 years really strong.

Spurred by a mix of pandemic disruption and personal ambition business ownership in Minnesota is at a 10-year high.

New business formations are rising across the nation. In 2021 for instance business formations in the U.S. topped 400000 each month for the year the first time that has occurred in at least 20 years. Online data on U.S. business formations compiled by the Census Bureau date only to 2004.

""One explanation is the pandemic has really prompted a lot of people to think carefully about what they really want to do in their working lives"" said Dan Forbes an associate professor of strategic management and entrepreneurship at the University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management.

Whatever the reason thousands more Minnesotans took a leap to create their own business over the last two years. Business formations nearly doubled between 2020 and 2022 compared to 2017 and 2019 census data show.

How employers handled work-from-home or on-site operations during COVID-19 could have played a role as well as requirements for workers who had to double as caregivers as the pandemic shut down schools and day-care centers Forbes said.

Other factors include advancements in digital technologies that allow people to work remotely workers shedding the cost of commuting or people wanting to adjust their cost of living by moving to more affordable areas.

In some cases people found entrepreneurial work could offer greater pay Forbes said.

""It helped people realize starting a business in their living room was something that was feasible in a way that under normal times wouldn't even cross their minds"" he said.

Jessica Rowland a house painter saw the number of people remodeling their homes and figured she could hire some help and take advantage of the surge.

Marcus Hulmer decided it was time to launch his own architectural and design company while keeping his full-time job for steady income.

Before the pandemic Brian Slater and Phil Clark had decided to take their passion for fishing and start an apparel company. The pandemic though had them reimagine the plan for where and how that company would play out.

Pat Lambert district director and treasurer for Minnesota SCORE has noticed the wave of new business owners. They have been seeking help through the business education and mentoring nonprofit's four offices across the state and its more than 350 mentor volunteers.

Most of those new businesses are focused on health care especially in-home care for assisted living and life coaching Lambert said.

Retail and e-commerce-focused companies are also rising he said as entrepreneurs find a simpler entry to market with more digital payment systems and online shopping platforms becoming easier to navigate for both business operators and consumers he said.

The remaining bulk of new clients include people launching cafes and food trucks as workers return to traditional office settings Lambert said. The majority of entrepreneurs seeking help are women comprising 60% of clients he said.

Whether the pandemic made it easier to start businesses or just provided time to pursue a dream the rise in new businesses is promising for the state's economy Lambert said.

But he also offers a caution: Half of new businesses fail at the five-year mark and 25% fail after the first year a statistic to keep in mind when considering whether to join the Great Resignation.

Women-operated painting company grows during pandemic-driven spike in remodeling

As more people retreated to their homes at the onset of the pandemic an increasing number decided to splurge on remodeling projects for a home office or to spruce up rooms where they were spending a lot more time.

Nationwide sales for home improvement and remodeling work has increased steadily since spring 2020 according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University and demand within the industry has trickled down to operators across the nation.One of those is Jessica Rowland who before the pandemic was a solo painter.

Rowland decided to seize the opportunity hire a crew and start her own painting and wallpaper installation company.

In June 2020 Rowland officially launched Rowland Paint a Minneapolis company providing interior and exterior painting plus wallpaper installation for residential and small commercial projects.

In less than two years Rowland has expanded her team to five painters and wallpaper installers all of them women.

Sales for Rowland Paint doubled in 2021 since its launch she said. Rowland is hopeful sales will also double or come close to that this year.

Being a women-owned and -operated business has led to some customers intentionally seeking her company's service she said.

""It's really good for residential remodeling right now"" Rowland said. ""Business is really good despite there being obvious supply chain issues. We don't have direct competition for how unique our business is being an all-women team and women-owned.""

Rowland has been a self-taught painter for 10 years but her experience in the remodeling industry dates back to her teenage years when she would assist her father on remodeling projects around the Twin Cities for extra cash.

While working for a real estate agency a few years ago though one of the agents asked Rowland if she could paint a room in a client's home. Other agents followed suit and Rowland steadily built a network of clients.

After operating in the gig economy most of her adult life Rowland realized painting paid better than any other job. It also gave her the ability to control her own work schedule and build her income.

""I came to a realization that I'm a self-employed person"" she said. ""I was so used to trying to get things to work in the moment. It was a way to make money so I kept doing that.""

Rowland soon met other women who wanted the same opportunity.

Dissatisfied with her job in the health care industry's supply chain Katie Woodling contacted Rowland in early 2020. She knew her through her sister and mutual friends and she asked if Rowland needed an extra hand on her next painting project.

Rowland wasn't prepared to pay Woodling or have any employees but told Woodling ""we can see how it goes"" she said.

Almost instantly Woodling became full-time.

""It's serendipitous in the way we're the perfect two people to go next level"" Rowland said.

""At the time we were taking it week by week like everyone was"" said Woodling who now serves as the company's lead wallpaper installer and painter. ""Only in hindsight do I feel like it's a crazy feat we accomplished.""

Initially Rowland operated the business from her apartment. She would use her parents' garage in south Minneapolis to store tools and equipment. Last year though she moved the business into a makers space on East 36th Street in Minneapolis that is owned by a local blacksmith.

Rowland plans to eventually buy her own commercial space.

While business is thriving operating Rowland Paint has not been easy Rowland said.

""I describe what I'm doing to the scene in 'Speed' where Keanu [Reeves] has to get everyone off one speeding bus onto another speeding bus"" she said.

Rowland added workers as she was piecing together the foundations of a company namely benefits and standard operating procedures. Meanwhile Rowland Paint has to finish projects and go after new contracts to keep a steady cash flow.

Recently Rowland had a professional company perform a strength assessment of each member of her team. The results have helped Rowland with delegating certain projects and tasks.

""It's basically building a business while you're running a business"" she said. ""I know it's worth it but it is really tough.""

Ten and Two owners Brian Slater left and Phil Clark posed for a photo at their friend's store in Minneapolis.

Fly fishing pals turn passion into growing outdoor clothing brand

Just before the pandemic hit the U.S. friends Brian Slater and Phil Clark decided to combine their passion for fishing and knowledge of advertising and design and launch a new venture Ten and Two an artistic outdoor clothing and apparel brand.

Both full-time professionals in the advertising industry Slater and Clark started Ten and Two as a side business from their respective homes in the Twin Cities with dreams of making it their main source of income.

The weekend before stay-at-home orders went into effect they had set up their first pop-up store where sales exceeded expectations Slater said. As pandemic shutdowns continued however they realized their plan was not tenable.

""Because we don't have a ton of startup capital and it's just funded by ourselves we were going to build it very slowly and organically by showing up in interesting ways locally build a core following and then let it grow from there"" Slater said. ""We had all these ideas and then COVID happened. Our whole strategy of how this was going to happen fell apart on us.""

COVID-19 disrupted their whole work lives as they moved to a remote set-up for their day jobs. As it turned out the new set-up added flexibility in their routines to commit more time to their passion project. It would just have to operate in a different way.

Using social media platforms like Instagram Slater and Clark focused on their e-commerce sales allowing them to sell not only to consumers in Minnesota but in Texas Colorado and even England. In 2021 the company sold close to 600 units.

Ten and Two also sells ski apparel which accounts for less than half of their overall inventory Clark said.

Fueling growth were partnerships with organizations that strive to protect fish and their ecosystems. In 2020 they were connected to a river conservation group on the West Coast that needed assistance with website design and branding.

That led Slater and Clark to turn Ten and Two into more of a studio that offers marketing and advertising services to similar nonprofits and organizations focused on fish and the environment.

""That's led to a lot more customers and broadened our network of people that come to Ten and Two"" Slater said. ""Without a ton of social spending we've done a decent job of growing our audience and it's become sort of a snowball effect for us.""

Slater and Clark met eight years ago after being introduced by the owner of a fly fishing shop owner who felt they had much in common.

As they fished together they realized they could combine their creative skills from their advertising experience into a new venture.

""We spent a lot of time complaining about how stuff looked in the outdoor space"" Clark said. ""Everything was overly cliché and everything felt the same. If it was a fishing brand it had a fish on the shirt.""

The brand would represent fly fishing and outdoors in Minnesota but in an artistic fashion allowing people to wear the items for casual outings.

""We thought we could own this space and be authentic about it"" Clark said.

Marcus Hulmer in his home office in Mounds View started his own architecture consulting company just before the pandemic started.

Architect launches consultancy firm to scratch a lifelong itch

The hours are long and the journey is stressful.

In the end though the undertaking to build a successful business is something Marcus Hulmer is learning to manage day by day.

""The end goal is to be able to make that your sole source of income or revenue"" said Hulmer president and founder of Hulmer Architecture + Design Consulting which he runs while working full-time at a larger construction company. ""That's how you support your family. Ultimately the main goal of all entrepreneurs is to gain that flexibility of lifestyle.""

For the past five years Hulmer has performed solo design work first as a sole proprietor then upon registering as a small business. His workload through his consulting company began to increase in the past year.

So far Hulmer has worked about seven projects through his startup. He specializes in building sciences and regulatory code application and small projects typically take half a year to complete he said. He puts revenue from those projects back into the business to fund its growth.

""I put my name out there it's my name in the business title"" he said. ""Anything that I do my name is on it so that's something that's nerve-wracking but also invigorating because knowing that you're always going to be putting 100 percent and always trying to do your best job.""

The idea to start his own business began in 2015 when Hulmer took on consulting work for a private contractor. Similar opportunities came his way and as he matured in his job feedback from various clients gave him the confidence to start his own consulting firm.

""Little things forced me to say 'Gosh I can't forgo these opportunities so I need to set up this business and I need to get that in motion'"" Hulmer said.

To get his consulting business off the ground Hulmer contacted staff at SCORE a nonprofit that offers business education and mentorship services just before the pandemic began. He continues to meet bi-weekly with a mentor to discuss the direction of the company which he wants to expand strategically and methodically until it's at a point where he's comfortable to make it his full-time job.

""Right now it's all about trying to learn the business structure and sell the idea of the business"" Hulmer said. ""Once that takes off that's a good problem to have to try to increase your resource.""

As an architect Hulmer said he's constantly doing problem-solving work with building designs. Add in the hours it takes to start a business and he's easily spending between 70 and 80 hours a week between both companies fulfilling his duties to his primary employer first and using whatever time he has available on his business.

""There's obviously a reason why people don't try to [become entrepreneurs] all the time"" he said. ""It takes a lot of preparation a lot of time and a lot of dedication and patience to get there.""

Married with three children Hulmer said balancing his family life a career and a business simultaneously has proven to be very difficult.

""There's this pursuit of building something in an effort to ultimately gain the desired flexibility in life"" Hulmer said. ""That flexibility affords someone the ability to choose when and how to spend time with those you love. However in my case I'm in the service industry and I care about the service I provide so determining the level of sacrifice between family and providing quality dedicated service to clientele is a never-ending balancing act.""",,,,,,

The famous actor seems right at home in the Wild West. Few fans had any doubts that he would pull off his role as Shea Brennan. Still not everyone in 1883 has the vast acting background of Elliott. Tim McGraw and Faith Hill were much more experienced with making music when they were cast in 1883. However Elliott praised McGraw and Hill’s fine work on the Yellowstone prequel.

Faith Hill and Tim McGraw were excited to work with Sam Elliott

Working alongside the legendary Sam Elliott is a dream come true for many actors and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill were no different. The country music stars were also thrilled with Taylor Sheridan’s writing for 1883. “When I read the scripts it’s like ‘There’s no way I’m not gonna do this’” McGraw told Outsider. “Faith [Hill] and I both. ‘There’s no way we’re not gonna do this.'”

Elliott’s involvement in the project served to sweeten the pot in an already enticing project. “Then when Sam Elliott got involved… I mean how do you take this script Taylor Sheridan being a huge Yellowstone fan and then Sam Elliott’s gonna be acting with you?” McGraw continued. “That’s a box that you can’t get out of. You don’t wanna get out of. How do you say no to any of that? And it’s been a fantastic experience.”

Sam Elliott praised Tim McGraw and Faith Hill for their work in ‘1883’

McGraw and Hill play Margaret and James Dutton in 1883. Along with Elliott’s character Shea they embark on the dangerous journey west with their sights originally set on Oregon.

Elliott spoke enthusiastically about his partnership with McGraw and Hill in an interview with Cowboys & Indians.

“I think all of us really in the beginning hit it off” Elliott said. “Yeah there’s probably a certain group of people that thought ‘Oh yeah here’s these country singers and now they’re going to become actors and they’re going to try to pull that off.’ Well they have pulled it off. They’re incredible in this thing. I think the work that Faith and Tim are doing it’s as good as anything anybody else is doing in the show. They’re up to it.”

While McGraw and Hill are indeed country music singers it’s not as if they’ve never acted before. McGraw notably portrayed Sean Tuohy in the film The Blind Side. He has also appeared in The Shack Tomorrowland and Four Christmases according to IMDb. Hill made her debut on the big screen when she played Sarah Sunderson in the 2004 remake of The Stepford Wives.

Will Tim McGraw and Faith Hill appear in Sheridan’s future work?

In addition to 1883 Hill and McGraw also appeared in flashbacks during Yellowstone. 1883 has been renewed for additional episodes and Yellowstone is getting a fifth season. But at the moment Hill and McGraw’s future in Taylor Sheridan’s work remains uncertain. “We’re sort of in limbo like everyone else” McGraw told Variety.

Unfortunately it’s pretty unlikely that Sam Elliott will work alongside McGraw and Hill in future episodes of 1883. Shea took his own life in the 1883 finale having reached the coastline in Oregon and fulfilled his promise to his late wife

All episodes of 1883 are currently streaming on Paramount+.",,,,,,,,,,,,

SAINT PAUL Minn. – With the NCHC set to crown its tournament champion tonight (Saturday) the National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC) and Xcel Energy Center announced they have agreed to a three-year extension for Xcel Energy Center to remain the home of the NCHC Frozen Faceoff. The partnership will keep the NCHC’s championship weekend in Saint Paul through at least 2025.

“We are thrilled to keep the NCHC Frozen Faceoff at Xcel Energy Center in Saint Paul. Xcel Energy Center is one of the finest NHL and hockey arenas in the country providing our student-athletes a great experience and the perfect venue to crown our postseason champion. We’re proud to have our NCHC student-athletes competing at the highest levels in college hockey” said Dr. Andy Armacost President of the University of North Dakota and Chair of the NCHC Board of Directors. “Along with that the city of Saint Paul in the State of Hockey offers our fans a destination location they can plan to attend annually to watch what we believe is the best college hockey in the nation.”

Home to the NHL’s Minnesota Wild Xcel Energy Center has also been home to the Frozen Faceoff since 2018. However the 2022 tournament is only the third Frozen Faceoff held in Saint Paul due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“The NCHC Frozen Faceoff has become the premier college hockey conference championship in the country and Xcel Energy Center is excited to extend our partnership with the NCHC for the next three years” said Jack Larson Vice-President and General Manager of Xcel Energy Center.

The Frozen Faceoff has traditionally seen four of the best teams in college hockey compete for the NCHC Tournament title including this year’s field which features four top-10 teams all of which will play in the 2022 NCAA Tournament. In addition fan events have been held around the Frozen Faceoff including a Fan Skate on Xcel Energy Center ice and Fan Fest hosted by Visit Saint Paul which have enhanced the fan experience.

""The NCHC and its member institutions are appreciative of Xcel Energy Center the Minnesota Wild and city of Saint Paul for their past and now continued great support of the Conference and Frozen Faceoff” said NCHC Commissioner Josh Fenton. “Our conference has been focused on providing great experiences for student-athletes and fans since its inception and the experience of the Frozen Faceoff at Xcel Energy Center is one of the best in all of college hockey. We are extremely excited to announce this partnership extension.”

The NCHC will crown the 2022 Frozen Faceoff champion Saturday night at Xcel Energy Center as Minnesota Duluth battles Western Michigan for the trophy.

Regarded as one of the finest arenas in the world Xcel Energy Center is a one-of-a-kind multi-purpose sports and entertainment facility located in downtown Saint Paul home to more than 150 sporting and entertainment events and roughly 1.7 million visitors each year.

If there's a romantic country scene that comes to mind when people say the words ""scenic Minnesota"" it's here.

And then there are the solar panels. After a 2013 state law called for the creation of community solar gardens — a typical garden amounts to a five-acre spread — Scandia became home to one and then two and now six solar arrays. While some fans of renewable energy cheered their arrival the panels have made other locals wary of what's happening to their prized open land and bucolic charm.

""We call them solar farms which a lot of people feel that's a misnomer"" said Scandia Mayor Christine Maefsky. ""They're industrial devices.""

Tensions flared anew when a local man suggested he could build the town's seventh community solar garden if Scandia would tweak its rules governing where the arrays can be built. Instead of a tweak the City Council may soon implement a one-year moratorium on solar gardens as they consider a balance between solar and preserving the town's rural feel.

It's not just in Scandia. Driven by ever-lower costs and the push for renewable energy solar gardens are on track to more than double across the state. The mushrooming expansion is forcing cities and towns to weigh the rights of property owners and the perceived rights of a community that doesn't want the view to change. Some residents also worry that they're shouldering the burden for urbanites who want solar but don't have the space to install it.

Mike Lubke pulled his son Julian across snow-covered fields on his 80-acre property in Scandia Minn. Mike Lubke wants to build a solar array on his property but the Scandia City Council may decide to pass a moratorium on all solar instead of approve his project.

""It's actually a national issue"" said Brian Ross vice president at the Great Plains Institute and a consultant for communities facing solar's surging growth. ""It's not just Minnesota.""

Searching for solutions

It wasn't uncommon in the early days of solar gardens for the projects to find at least some local opposition but six years after the first one opened near Kasota in September 2015 town boards and local officials still struggle to find an approach that works.

A year ago the Wright County Board of Commissioners enacted a one-year moratorium on solar gardens fearing that the rush of applications was among other issues forever altering prime farmland and filling in a vital economic development corridor along Interstate 94 from Albertville to Clearwater. The moratorium gave the county time to figure out ""fact from fiction about what is actually taking place"" said County Commissioner Darek Vetsch. ""These solar farms kind of came at us fast and furious around 2015 and ordinances were enacted quickly and they didn't necessarily have the language and the research done enough.""

Vetsch said he's not opposed to solar but he's not yet convinced by it either. The moratorium ended with tighter rules for solar garden developers. A new one-mile separation requirement between gardens will help close a tax loophole and has the secondary benefit of preserving open space said Vetsch.

In other places local control has been tough to enforce as the McLeod County Board of Commissioners found last summer when they saw their rejection of a proposed solar garden overturned in court. The Minnesota Court of Appeals said the board's concerns about neighboring property values and the solar garden's use of prime farmland were arbitrary or capricious and ordered the board to approve the 3.5-acre project in Hale Township about 55 miles west of Minneapolis.

The wrangling over setbacks land use and sight lines looks only to continue as Xcel Energy says plans are underway to more than double the state's 426 solar gardens while larger utility-scale solar projects will grow from today's 268 megawatts to 2500 megawatts by 2032. A Metropolitan Council survey last summer found that solar installations were 7 % or 1335 acres of the metro-area farmland or vacant land that got developed from 2016 to 2020.

'Done our share'

The first community solar garden landed in Scandia to much fanfare. Then-mayor Randall Simonson crowed that the site at the busy Minnesota Hwy. 97 and Manning Avenue intersection would showcase the town's commitment to renewable energy. But complaints quickly piled up and the town's solar ordinance was paused amended and then repealed by 2017. A new ordinance in 2019 set height limits and required deeper setbacks and vegetation to obscure the panels.

Today six solar arrays dot the roadsides and intersections here pumping out nearly 20 megawatts. Ten more solar gardens sit scattered throughout Washington County.

""We've got a number of people saying we've got more than enough generating capacity in the city of Scandia"" said Steve Kronmiller who sits on the Scandia City Council. ""We've done our share let somebody else do their share. We want to benefit from our open spaces too.""

Kronmiller said the Scandia viewsheds are an amenity worth protecting: the town bills itself as a tourist destination and has fought for years to have a bike trail extended from nearby William O'Brien State Park to draw more people looking for scenic recreation.

There's also the sense that Scandia is making room for the solar panels that people in Ramsey County are asking for said Kronmiller. The state's solar garden law allows the owner of a solar garden to sell that electricity in the same county or an adjacent one.

These feelings were already in place when local resident Mike Lubke told Scandia officials last summer that he wanted to build the city's seventh solar garden near a pond on his land a five-acre array with room for sheep to graze under the raised panels. His proposal requires an amendment to the city's ordinance to allow solar installations on shore land but rather than change the ordinance city councilors said they would prefer to take a break pass the moratorium and look at all aspects of solar development.

""I understand their viewpoint"" said Lubke. ""Yes [the moratorium] sets us back but I also want to make sure the ordinance is set for the long term and not just my property.""

The city's screening requirements for solar gardens could be more effective if they were more flexible said Lubke so he's proposing some alternate ideas along with a bigger setback from certain roads in town.

He'd even be willing to install a plastic screen like one being used at a solar garden in River Falls Wis.; the light brown screen has prairie grass images printed on it and hangs from the panels disguising the array.

The end result of Lubke's pitch is that if the city changed its ordinance in the ways he's proposed two new Scandia parcels including his would be eligible for solar gardens two other parcels that are already eligible could be expanded and approximately 17 parcels would be eliminated due to the tightened setback rules.

Lines filling up

Some Scandia residents point just down the road to Chisago County for what they consider a disquieting vision of what the future could bring.

Solar gardens started blooming there soon after the 2013 law passed some with little-to-no screening from nearby roads. Spurred on by Xcel Energy's Solar Rewards program the largest solar gardens initiative in the nation the county developed solar so quickly that today there are 38 installations in place or in planning stages.

""We support solar energy in Scandia"" said Maefsky the mayor who has said she's in favor of a moratorium. ""But we also recognize that they have an impact on neighbors and we need to protect neighbors and protect the city as a whole as well as we can so that they don't become intrusive.""

It might be that the electric grid will soon force a pause in Scandia's solar economy. A spokeswoman for Xcel Energy said so many solar gardens were installed in Chisago and Washington counties that the feeder lines and substations in that part of the metro are essentially full.

""We are reaching the point where upgrades are needed in order to interconnect"" said spokeswoman Lacey Nygard. The installation of a new solar garden might require the developer to pay for grid upgrades with the potential for big costs if new infrastructure is required she added.

For now the Scandia city government plans to hold a public hearing on April 5. The City Council could take a moratorium vote soon after.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8va2Znby5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy8xOS91bmQtaG9ja2V5LWZhbHRlcnMtYWdhaW5zdC13ZXN0ZXJuLW1pY2hpZ2FuLW5jYWEtdG91cm5hbWVudC11cC1uZXh0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UND Hockey Falters Against Western Michigan NCAA Tournament Up Next,"SAINT PAUL — Ty Glover scored two goals and the defense blocked 21 shots to help No. 7 Western Michigan defeat fifth-ranked North Dakota 4-2 in the semifinals of the NCHC Frozen Faceoff on Saturday night at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul Minn.

UND (24-13-1) jumped out to an early 1-0 lead but the Broncos (25-10-1) responded with three straight goals to capture their third win in five tries over the Fighting Hawks this season.

Special teams proved to be a major difference with the green and white coming up empty on five opportunities while WMU went 1-for-3. The Broncos nearly had a shorthanded goal as well with Hugh Larkin scoring just after exiting the penalty box to give them a 3-1 lead late in the second.

Brendan Bussi stopped 21-of-23 shots thrown his way but his biggest came midway through the third period when the Long Island N.Y. native made a sprawling save with his pad on Connor Ford to deny the graduate transfer forward of the tying goal. Zach Driscoll finished with 22 stops on the 25 attempts he saw but saw his career-high winning streak come to an end at nine.

Judd Caulfield broke the scoreless deadlock just 11:45 into the game when the junior forward settled down a loose puck in the slot and flipped it over the pad of Bussi to give UND a 1-0 lead. The goal was the seventh in 10 career games against the Broncos and the fourth of the season against WMU.

Less than two minutes later WMU knotted the game at 1-1 as Glover tallied his first of the night after he pounced on a scramble in the crease to tie the contest heading to the first intermission.

Penalties filled the middle frame with UND having three power play opportunities and Western having one. That one chance was all the Broncos needed however as Glover tipped home a Michael Joyaux shot to give WMU a 2-1 lead with just under six minutes to play in the frame.

UND looked likely to head into the third period trailing by a pair following Larkin’s goal with just 31 seconds left but Nick Portz answered with a slapper from just inside the offensive zone past the glove of Bussi to answer with seven ticks remaining and trim the lead to 3-2 after 40 minutes.

The momentum seemed to remain with UND in the middle portion of the final period when the Hawks killed off a five-minute major penalty thanks to five saves from Driscoll but could not level the score. WMU finished off the victory on Max Sasson’s empty-net strike with just over a minute to play.

North Dakota will find out its NCAA Tournament opponent and destination on Sunday evening at 5:30 p.m. on ESPNU.

Ten people died on the afternoon of March 22 2021 when a gunman opened fire at the Table Mesa King Soopers store about 2 miles south of the University of Colorado campus.

“It’s a profound moment for our community” Mayor Aaron Brockett said. “So at the memorial … I’m hoping that we can come together and mourn together but also offer a chance for community and healing so we can be with our neighbors and be with our friends and it can be a moment where we can all help each other.”

Hart Van Denburg/CPR News A memorial for Eric Talley outside the Boulder Police Department. March 18 2022.

Among the shooting victims was Boulder Police Officer Eric Talley the first law enforcement officer to arrive on the scene. On Friday a Boulder patrol car was parked in front of the police department at 1805 33rd St. in Talley’s honor. The public is invited to visit through Tuesday evening. Any items left in the officer’s memory will be given to his family or kept by the police department.

The city of Boulder has announced several other events all of which will take place on Tuesday:

2 p.m.: A Line of Duty Death commemoration will be held at the police department. It’s open to the public and can also be streamed at here.

2:30 p.m. A citywide moment of silence will be observed

4:30 to 6 p.m.: A communitywide Day of Remembrance gathering at the Glenn Huntington Bandshell near the intersection of Broadway and Canyon Boulevard in downtown Boulder.

Tuesday’s forecast for Boulder includes snow and all events will take place regardless of weather. City officials recommend taking alternate methods of transportation like buses bikes or walking.

The Boulder Strong Resource Center at 2935 Baseline Road will be open to the public from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. with counseling massage acupuncture and other services.

“Anybody can walk in. You don’t need an appointment” said spokeswoman Kristina Hernández Schostak noting studies show people often don’t recognize the need for help until one to three years after a traumatic event. “If you’re just starting to feel it now you’re not alone.”

The remodeled Table Mesa King Soopers which reopened in early February will be closed Tuesday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaGljYWdvdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy8xOS9zZXRoLWpvbmVzLXJlYWN0aW9uLXRvLXRoZS1jaGljYWdvLWJsYWNraGF3a3MtdHJhZGUtb2YtYnJhbmRvbi1oYWdlbC13YXMtdGVsbGluZy1oYWdzLXdhcy1hbi1pZGVudGl0eS1waWVjZS1mb3ItdXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Seth Jones' reaction to the Chicago Blackhawks' trade of Brandon Hagel was telling: 'Hags was an identity piece for us',"Before Friday Chicago Blackhawks coach Derek King never had minced words about whether or not to trade Brandon Hagel.

“He better not be” King said Feb. 22. “Hags has got to stay here. You can’t. I mean that’s me. You’ve got do what’s right for the organization and what’s right for the team but Hagel is a big part of this organization.”

Then on Feb. 25 after Hagel’s first-career hat trick against the New Jersey Devils King said: “He’s a big part of this team so we have to hold onto this kid.”

But King’s wishes couldn’t outweigh the king’s ransom the Tampa Bay Lightning was willing to pay for Hagel on Friday: two top-10 protected first-round picks and two rookie forwards Taylor Raddysh and Boris Katchouk.

Said King before Saturday’s road game against the Minnesota Wild: “We talked about it a few weeks ago that (Hagel is) a big part of this organization and the type of character that we want and the type of player we want so I was very shocked … when they called me upstairs to talk to me. I was like ‘Oh maybe it’s me getting traded or something.’ But when they said his name I was shocked I was very shocked.”

The deal also sends fourth-round picks in 2022 and 2024 to the Lightning.

Raddysh and Katchouk were second-rounders in 2016 so combined with the draft picks the Hawks’ haul includes four prospects from the first two rounds for Hagel an entry-level free-agent pickup in 2018 and a pair of fourth-rounders.

“If you look at it on paper you can see why you do it” King said. “That’s a pretty good chunk of change coming back for Hags.

“But great teammate players I think are emotional about it shocked. You’re never ready especially a player like that you don’t want to lose. But again this is a business and we have to move forward.

Hagel missed the Lightning’s morning skate but was set to play Saturday night against the New York Rangers.

The Hawks carried on without him in the matinee at Xcel Energy Center but the Wild swept the four-game season series with a 3-1 win.

Wild right wing Ryan Hartman (38) is congratulated on his goal by right wing Mats Zuccarello while Blackhawks goaltender Kevin Lankinen and defenseman Seth Jones look on in the third period Saturday in St. Paul Minn.

Dominik Kubalík replaced Hagel at left wing on the second line with Jonathan Toews and Kirby Dach.

Kevin Lankinen made his 15th start and first since March 10 and had some standouts among his 31 saves.

“I was seeing the puck well battling just keeping the rebounds out of their sticks pretty much” Lankinen said. “The ‘D’ did a good job keeping my sight clean and letting me see the puck and handle the first shot. It was a good step forward and a lot to build on.”

Frédérick Gaudreau scored the game’s first goal in the first period assisted by Kevin Fiala and Jon Merrill. Seth Jones tied it in the third breaing his 35-game goal drought.

Ryan Hartman was wide open back door to seal it initiated by Kirill Kaprizov winning a board battle and set up by Mats Zuccarello and Hartman slipping behind the Hawks defense.

“Miscommunication in the D-zone” Jones said. “Seems like it has happened a lot this year in the last few minutes of a game.”

“I thought we played well. We grinded it out” King said. “I still would like to see us shoot a lot more. I don’t know I’m just going to have to keep beating it in them.

“Lanks was outstanding. He kept us in the game. We had our opportunities we just had a little (defensive) breakdown on that go-ahead goal.”

Raddysh and Katchouk made their Hawks debuts and defenseman Alex Vlasic made his NHL debut starting on the left side opposite Jones. All three new Hawks were on the ice for puck drop. Raddysh Katchouk and Vlasic wore Nos. 11 14 and 43 respectively.

During the first intermission Raddysh told NBC Sports Chicago’s Eddie Olczyk that he found out he was traded Friday afternoon then had to hurry to catch a flight to Minnesota.

“It’s been kind of crazy” he said. “Got here late last night. It’s been a long 24 hours but I’m excited and I’m looking forward to it.”

Asked about his style of play he told Olczyk: “I’m a two-way guy that works hard and just feeds off energy and I’m hoping to bring some offensive game here and show what I’ve got there.”

Raddysh and Katchouk played fourth line with Sam Lafferty though with the Hawks playing 11 forwards they played shifts with Patrick Kane and Alex DeBrincat.

King also threw both rookies on special teams: Raddysh on the power play manning the bumper role and Katchouk on the penalty kill.

Here are three takeaways from the game.

1. Based on Seth Jones’ response Hawks players likely aren’t thrilled with the Brandon Hagel trade.

It was no secret in the weeks leading up to Monday’s trade deadline that the Hawks would be sellers and the players certainly seemed to be bracing for that eventuality. But the question was who would be shipped off.

No player is going to tell reporters he thinks a teammate should be traded but if forced to choose you’d guess that right after Alex DeBrincat most would have put Hagel on the no-trade list.

He’s a 20-goal scorer at age 23 with a $1.5 million cap hit through the next two seasons. And he’s an energy guy who’s a willing forechecker plays special teams and is well-liked in the dressing room.

“Hags was an identity piece for us I thought” Jones said after the game. “He definitely had a hardworking mentality and did a lot of great things for us. Sucks to see him go.

“We got some good players in return. So hope he has a chance to win a Cup this year in Tampa.”

Jonathan Toews told The Athletic: “You invest a ton of energy and emotion and care with your teammates because you’re all working toward that common goal. Now all of a sudden you realize no one on our team is safe and we could all be going in different directions in the near future — it’s pretty discouraging.”

Just looking at the numbers if the Hawks could swap Hagel — a Buffalo Sabres exile whom they didn’t have to invest any draft capital in — for two first-rounders and a couple of top prospects they do it.

But a front office and players typically have an unspoken contract: If you play the right way (as they love to say) and produce on the ice and you bring character camaraderie and accountability to the locker room you’re regarded as the kind of foundational piece that doesn’t get traded.

You build around that. Teams bond around that.

That’s not to say general manager Kyle Davidson wasn’t right to make the deal — he was — but he and the organization shouldn’t take for granted that they have buy-in from the players. Especially now.

From the top down the Hawks need to acknowledge the positive presence that has been lost address players’ concerns and encourage them to stick with what’s sure to be a painful process.

2. The Hawks got their first look at Taylor Raddysh Boris Katchouk and Alex Vlasic.

Before the game King said he exchanged information with Lightning coach Jon Cooper about the players they’re swapping.

“Boris is probably more bottom-six guy Radds is teetering between that second-line or third-line guy can shoot a puck” King said. “I’ve watched some of their clips. They both look like they’re smart players they know how to play in the D-zone and they work hard. I’ve heard they’re really good-character kids.”

King put them to work right out of the gate: Raddysh played 15 minutes 3 seconds and Katchouk 12:24.

Both played special teams but it’s encouraging that Raddysh took on the power-play bumper role meant for Tyler Johnson who was placed on injured reserve (concussion) Friday and has had hard luck with his health this season.

“Radds and Boris they fit in perfect” King said. “I’d like to see Radds shoot a little more I’ll have a little chat with him. And then Boris brought some energy he’s a little bit like (Sam) Lafferty and I like the size. Once they get settled in couple more games under their belt they’ll be fine.”

As for as Vlasic he played 6:10 as the seventh defenseman and blocked a shot.

“We protected him” King said. “Good-sized body moved well closed on guys got a good stick. The future looks bright for this kid.”

3. Seth Jones was happy to break a 35-game goal drought.

Jones an offensive defenseman hadn’t found the back of the net since Dec. 2 against the Washington Capitals.

Kane sent a cross-ice pass to Jones and then crashed the net. In the past Jones might have been tempted to send a seam back to Kane for a backdoor look but he pulled the trigger for his fourth goal of the season.

“It was a relief” Jones said. “I feel like I was shooting the puck like I would normally do this year just haven’t really seen them go in. It’s nice to get that one. Hopefully I can build on that.”

Added King: “He puts a lot of pressure on his shoulders so when he’s struggling to score he feels it. He’s a solid player.”"
