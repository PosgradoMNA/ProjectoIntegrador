That was also the case last year when Manchester City saw four bids rejected because all fell short of Tottenham's £150 million valuation.

Spurs were demanding such an eye-watering amount because between 2014 and 2021 Kane scored more Premier League goals than any other player.

But his career could have been very different had Burnley been willing to pay just £7m in 2014.

At that time Kane was a 20-year-old with only a handful of Spurs goals to his name.

He had been out on loan to Leyton Orient Millwall Norwich and Leicester without receiving rave reviews.

Nevertheless Burnley's then-manager Sean Dyche was very keen on Kane. But the club's owners were reluctant to spend more than £3m.

Recalling his failed pursuit of Kane in 2014 Dyche told The Fozcast: ""I phoned up about him and at the time I think it was Tim Sherwood immediately said £7m and we were in the market for like £3m.

""I went to the board and they said 'we can't do that'.

""Now you might have even got I don't know five plus add-ons but at the time we were looking at I think George Boyd [who would become] record signing at the time for like £3m so we just couldn't do it.

""But Harry Kane I always thought he was an amazing player and still do now.""

Kane has scored 10 career goals against Burnley including a hat-trick at Turf Moor in 2017.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtZXN0cmliLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL3AwMjIzMjMx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Richard Kelso Obituary,"Let the family know you are thinking of them

Greg Abbott speaks at a news conference in Austin Texas on June 8 2021. Eric Gay/AP

Clinics in Texas have been struggling with the demand for assisting rape victims.

""The numbers have stayed consistently high"" a rape crisis clinic employee told The AP.

It comes as Gov. Greg Abbott pledged to ""eliminate all rapists"" as a result of the state's strict abortion law.

Clinics in Texas say the number of rape cases has remained ""consistently"" high despite Gov. Greg Abbott's assurance that the state's strict abortion law would ""eliminate all rapists"" according to The Associated Press.

Last year Abbott pledged to eradicate rapists after signing the state's abortion bill that bars people from getting the procedure after a fetal ""heartbeat"" can be detected on an ultrasound Insider previously reported. The law has no exceptions for rape or incest — a restriction that abortion advocates and some in the GOP have condemned.

""Let's make something very clear: Rape is a crime"" Abbott said at the time. ""And Texas will work tirelessly to make sure that we eliminate all rapists from the streets of Texas by aggressively going out and arresting them and prosecuting them and getting them off the streets.""

He continued: ""So goal No. 1 in the state of Texas is to eliminate rape so that no woman no person will be a victim of it.""

However Texas clinic employees have expressed the growing number of rape victims has been overwhelming with one facility near Texas A&M University having to deal with a waitlist The Associated Press reported.

""The numbers have stayed consistently high"" Lindsey LeBlanc executive director of the Sexual Assault Resource Center told the outlet. ""We are struggling to keep up with demand.""

As The Texas Tribune reported last month the state's abortion trigger law was set in motion after SCOTUS overturned Roe. v Wade which also includes a provision that says that anyone performing the procedure could face up to life in prison.

According to the AP citing the state Department of Public Safety there have been over 14000 rape-related crimes since last year. Democrats recently slammed Abbott for his comments that insinuated rape victims should take a Plan B to avoid getting pregnant.

""By accessing health care immediately they can get the Plan B pill that can prevent a pregnancy from occurring in the first place"" Abbott said. ""With regard to reporting it to law enforcement that will ensure that the rapist will be arrested and prosecuted.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8yNC9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2FiYm90dC1lbGVtZW50YXJ5LXNlYXNvbi0yLWFiYy1wbGMvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBU2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjIvMDkvMjQvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9hYmJvdHQtZWxlbWVudGFyeS1zZWFzb24tMi1hYmMtcGxj?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Abbott Elementary' is back in session,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8yNC9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2FiYm90dC1lbGVtZW50YXJ5LXNlYXNvbi0yLWFiYy1wbGMvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBU2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjIvMDkvMjQvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9hYmJvdHQtZWxlbWVudGFyeS1zZWFzb24tMi1hYmMtcGxj?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000026740D82C80>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

But those flashes show that public anger across the country once only simmering is now boiling.

The demonstrations surrounding the death of Mahsa Amini — and the government crackdown emerging to stifle them — represent just the latest cycle of unrest to grip Iran since its 1979 Islamic Revolution.

It likely won’t be the last as the Islamic Republic lurches between crises at home and abroad. The window through which the wider world can view them will only become more dim as authorities restrict internet access detain journalists and tightly control all levers of the government’s power.

Protests over Amini’s death have spread across at least 46 Iranian cities towns and villages. State TV has suggested that at least 41 protesters and police have been killed since the protests began on Sept. 17. An Associated Press count of official statements by authorities puts the death toll at at least 13 with more than 1200 demonstrators arrested.

But the tightening crackdown doesn’t come as a surprise given Iran’s modern history.

Iran’s theocracy has viewed itself as under threat from the moment the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returned to Tehran in 1979.

Bombings in 1981 blamed on dissidents killed dozens of top officials. One even paralyzed the right arm of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein launched a bloody eight-year war on Iran in which 1 million people were killed.

In Tehran enmity toward the United States began with the American-backed 1953 coup that cemented the shah’s reign. For Washington the 1979 U.S. Embassy hostage crisis stoked hostility toward Iran.

And the mutual distrust continues today. Since the collapse of a deal in 2015 intended to curtail Tehran’s nuclear ambitions Iran has amassed enough highly enriched uranium to produce an atomic bomb if it chose to do so.

The Iranian government has dismissed the latest protests as a foreign plot rather than an expression of public outrage over the death of a woman detained only because her mandatory headscarf or hijab wasn’t to the morality police’s liking.

Pro-government marches in Tehran and other cities echoed the official line with some marchers chanting “American mercenaries are fighting the religion.”

The government’s decision to restrict Instagram LinkedIn and WhatsApp — three of the last Western social media apps working in the country — has limited the ability for protesters to organize and share their videos with the outside world.

Instead only short clips find their way out including those of security forces firing at protesters and women defiantly cutting off their hair and burning their hijabs. Security forces including motorcycle-riding volunteers with Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard have attacked peaceful demonstrators.

There’s also been footage of apparent demonstrators setting fires flipping over police cars and fighting back against riot police.

These scenes are similar to those that occurred in 2019 after the government dropped fuel subsidies prompting demonstrators to set gas stations ablaze and ransack banks. Rights groups say that the unrest across more than 100 cities and towns — and the government crackdown that followed — killed over 300 people and led to thousands of arrests.

Because of the internet restrictions it remains unclear if the latest protests have eclipsed those of 2019. Exiled opposition groups and Iranian hard-liners have both used the short clips online to paint their own pictures of the unrest as the government largely remains silent.

Independent observers such as human rights activists face threats intimidation and arrest in Iran. Text messages from the government to the public warn of criminal charges for joining demonstrations. At least 18 reporters are known to have been arrested so far in the crackdown according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.

Like other rounds of unrest since 2009 when millions took to the streets as part of the so-called Green Movement to protest a disputed presidential election the latest demonstrations appear spontaneous and leaderless.

Even if a government crackdown eventually quells the protests it likely won’t eradicate the deep-seated rage.

Iran’s economy has cratered and Western sanctions have destroyed the savings of a generation. The value of the currency has plummeted from 32000 rials for a dollar in 2015 to 315000 rials for a dollar in 2022. Iranian youth increasingly try to find new livelihoods abroad at whatever cost. Those left behind struggle to make ends meet.

Iranian politics have grown insular and uncompromising. In the 2021 presidential election all serious contenders were disqualified to allow Ebrahim Raisi a protégé of Khamenei to take the presidency in the lowest turnout vote in the Islamic Republic’s history.

The economic challenges and hard-line political positions are only likely to solidify. Even if Iran agreed to a road map to restore the nuclear deal it likely will face new U.S. sanctions over selling so-called suicide drones to Russia to use in its ongoing war in Ukraine.

A battle over leadership could turn Iran’s focus further inward. There is no designated successor for the 83-year-old Khamenei though some analysts suggest his son Mojtaba Khamenei might be considered by clerics to become the next supreme leader.

Meanwhile the Revolutionary Guard which answers only to the supreme leader has grown increasingly powerful — both militarily and economically — during the recent tensions with the West. The U.S. Treasury said the Guard has smuggled “hundreds of millions of dollars” worth of sanctioned oil into the international market.

Both the theocracy and the Guard have financial and political incentive to continue the status quo. And with no other outlets mass protests by the Iranian public seem likely to continue.

Hero MotoCorp became largest two-wheeler manufacturer (by unit sales) over two decades ago and has maintained pole position since with over 100 million customers today. But the global auto major is busy reinventing itself for the future. Because smart companies always try and stay one step ahead. The sector itself is ripe for transformation. According to Manish Gupta Managing Director & Lead - Products Accenture in India “Transformation has been overdue in this particular sector. In other sectors such as consumer goods retail and also life sciences to a certain extent massive transformation has already happened.”

Like every other business and industry the pandemic brought disruption but Hero MotoCorp leveraged the disruption to drive change that builds resiliency and agility. As customers took to digital during the pandemic Hero MotoCorp pivoted from a traditional dealer-centric model to an omnichannel one. Buying behaviour changed during the pandemic and so have customer expectations and Hero MotoCorp stayed ahead of the change. The two-wheeler segment is also one where electric vehicles have made a significant impact in India and the manufacturing giant is differentiating its traditional products while staying ready to embrace the future that includes electric.

Reema Jain Chief Information & Digital Officer Hero MotoCorp spoke about how Hero MotoCorp is leveraging analytics AI and machine learning in collaboration with Accenture to reach new customers stay on top of industry trends and fulfil its global ambitions even while transforming its supply chain.

Customer Experience is Key

With innovation at the core of its philosophy Jain explained that Hero MotoCorp is continuously working on improving customer acquisition and loyalty strategies by identifying the right digital interventions based on changing customer aspirations.

The sector that Hero MotoCorp operates in today is no longer divided into physical and digital worlds but a ‘phygital’ world where customers seamlessly move across platforms as they interact with businesses. As the pandemic shifted buying behaviour to digital an internal study by the company revealed that 74 percent of two-wheeler buyers are influenced online. This meant that the company needed to deliver the right information to prospective customers even before they reached the showroom and met product specialists.

""We got segmentation right when it comes to the marketing technology stack. For instance if the customer is looking for a practical day-to-day use bike like the HF Deluxe or Splendor we highlight practical features of the bike such as length of the seat mileage an EMI calculator etc. But if millennials are looking at the premium segment and a bike like our Xpulse 200T which is about off-road experiences our content speaks about dirt bike challenges the exclusive membership club for buyers and the Hero Experience Centre that we have recently launched” Jain explains. And while 74 percent of all two-wheeler buyers are influenced digitally she believes the figure is closer to 99 percent for millennials.

Ultimately Hero MotoCorp’s new approach is leading to higher walk-ins and better conversions at dealerships and also contributes to building the loyalty journey. From its GoodLife programme to engaging with customers on the app and at physical service stations Hero MotoCorp is creating key interventions to build customer stickiness with the right digital nudges.

Customer data platform

The customer data platform is at the heart of all of these initiatives. “This platform will stitch our offline as well as our online data together and put together a 360-degree single view of the customer which helps us deliver the right message to the right segment and through the right channel. That will further help us improve the conversion ratio” Jain added. It must be noted that with over 100 million customers across different economic strata and region in India Hero MotoCorp has access to a humungous amount of first-party customer data perhaps second only to the telcos.

With a connected platform and high-quality data being generated Hero MotoCorp will not only be able to serve customers better and drive sales growth but also use this data to feed insights to R&D engineers who are working on product enhancements.

Supply chain transformation

With supply chain at the heart of modern manufacturing and key to keeping costs and complexity under control Hero MotoCorp is also collaborating with Accenture on supply chain transformation.

“We want our supply chain to be very very responsive. We want decision making to be much faster in our supply chain and that can only be enabled if we have strong analytical capabilities which will help our leadership team track performance of the overall ecosystem and thus take quick decisions” explains Jain.

“For example we are implementing concurrent demand and supply planning which should enable scenario-based planning which will help us to enable our financial goals. Machine learning will provide our supply chain users with recommendations in terms of how to deal with particular situations such as changes in material planning and scheduling in response to new customer orders. It will also help us with improved phase-in and phase-out of models with minimum impact on obsolescence in inventory” she added.

Commenting on the digital transformation journey that is driving Hero MotoCorp forward Manish Gupta added “At Accenture we are excited to be collaborating with Hero MotoCorp and being a part of its growth journey. This transformation will also set the baseline for the sector because Hero MotoCorp is the market leader not only in India but globally as well.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIvU2VwLzI0L2FjY2VudHVyZS1leHBlY3RzLWZ5MjMtcmV2ZW51ZS1ncm93dGgtdG8tYmUtOC0xMS0yNTAxMzc1Lmh0bWzSAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdpbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hbXAvc3RvcnkvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMi9TZXAvMjQvYWNjZW50dXJlLWV4cGVjdHMtZnkyMy1yZXZlbnVlLWdyb3d0aC10by1iZS04LTExLTI1MDEzNzUuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Accenture expects FY23 revenue growth to be 8-11%,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIvU2VwLzI0L2FjY2VudHVyZS1leHBlY3RzLWZ5MjMtcmV2ZW51ZS1ncm93dGgtdG8tYmUtOC0xMS0yNTAxMzc1Lmh0bWzSAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdpbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hbXAvc3RvcnkvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMi9TZXAvMjQvYWNjZW50dXJlLWV4cGVjdHMtZnkyMy1yZXZlbnVlLWdyb3d0aC10by1iZS04LTExLTI1MDEzNzUuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673ED43070>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Why is this news? Well first of all there’s the price – way above any rational valuation of Figma. Second there’s the question that we have finally learned to ask about tech mergers and acquisitions: is there a competition or antitrust issue here somewhere?

We’ll come to the price later but at first sight the answer to the second question would seem to be no: the two companies are not direct competitors. Adobe dominates the market in software for creating and publishing digital and printed material – graphics photography illustration animation multimedia/video motion pictures and print. If you’ve ever used Photoshop Illustrator Acrobat Reader or opened a pdf (portable document format) then you’ve used an Adobe product.

Figma in contrast is a smallish company that produces nifty web-based tools to enable teams working on user interface and user experience design projects to collaborate online. None of these tools is a serious competitor for the heavy-duty ones that Adobe markets and indeed the Figma designers have always been ecumenical about what people choose to use in their design work. If a customer uses Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator well that’s fine by Figma. Its focus is on enabling teams of designers to create workflows – using brainstorms whiteboards sticky notes etc – that suit them and their collective projects.

So why would Adobe want to lay out such a mountain of cash to acquire this minnow? The answer is that its leaders are thinking ahead and they see a strategic threat in the making. In the networked world more and more work is being done by geographically dispersed teams who have to collaborate online. And in that context project management and the creation of workflows that are efficient user-friendly and agile is moving centre stage. As James Carville Bill Clinton’s strategist might have said: “It’s the workflow stupid!”

And Figma to all intents and purposes already owns that workflow space whereas Adobe only makes tools that people use. As the veteran analyst Ben Thompson puts it in his newsletter the reason why Adobe is both willing and has no choice but to spend so much is: “Figma is set to be the ‘operating system for design’ which means that in the long run Adobe has to operate on Figma’s terms not the other way around; to put it another way Adobe is not only paying for long-run control of design but also its own independence. That alone is worth a whole bunch of money!”

But even that need doesn’t quite explain the overpayment. The other reason is that Figma was doing quite nicely and had no need to sell itself. So the offer had to be one that nobody could refuse.

At this point those with long memories will hear a bell ringing. Way back in 2009 an interesting messaging app appeared on the net. It was called WhatsApp. From the outset it was clean and efficient and had a simple and honest business model – one year’s free use and then a modest annual subscription. And it grew like crazy.

By 2012 Facebook saw WhatsApp as a serious strategic threat. Internal documents extracted by a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) inquiry in 2020 tell the story. One senior executive writes: “This is the biggest threat to our product that I’ve seen in my five years here at Facebook; it’s bigger than G+ [Google Plus] and we’re all terrified. These guys actually have a credible strategy: start with the most credible social graph (ie the ones you message on mobile) and build from there.” In February 2013 the Facebook board saw a presentation warning that services such as WhatsApp were “a threat to our core businesses both with respect to social graph and content sharing. They are building gaming platforms profiles and news feeds [and] have all the ingredients for building a mobile-first social network.”

With the hard-won wisdom of hindsight we now realise that Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp should never have been allowed

Guess what happened? In 2014 Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg made WhatsApp’s founders an offer they couldn’t refuse – $19bn – and that was way more than any rational valuation of the company. In an internal document the move was described as a “land grab” that “prevents probably the only company that could have grown into the next Facebook purely on mobile”.

With the hard-won wisdom of hindsight we now realise that Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp – just like its earlier purchase of Instagram in 2012 – should never have been allowed. So whether the FTC allows Adobe’s land grab of Figma will be a good test of whether the US government has acquired that wisdom. The deal should be challenged investigated and banned. And if it isn’t then we will know that tech companies still have little to fear from regulators – other than the odd affordable multibillion-dollar fine.

Adobe (ADBE -0.07%) recently announced solid quarterly earnings results that met management's forecast. The software giant also affirmed a bullish full-year outlook that calls for strong sales and earnings gains through late 2022. But the stock still fell hard immediately following the report which also included the surprise announcement that Adobe is making a significant acquisition.

Let's examine why Adobe has decided to shell out $20 billion for Figma a web-based collaborative design platform and whether the market's harsh response to this news was warranted.

Slowing growth

The main benefit a Figma acquisition brings is another growth avenue. The collaborative work and design platform is positioned in an attractive niche that could grow to around $16 billion in annual revenue by 2025. Adobe expects the deal to boost its subscription-based revenue by $200 million this year before reaching an annual pace of $400 million by early 2023. ""The combined company"" executives said in a press release ""will have a massive fast-growing market opportunity.""

That's good news because growth in Adobe's core business has been slowing. Sales rose 15% in the most recent quarter after adjusting for currency exchange rate shifts. Investors had seen over 20% year-over-year gains in earlier phases of the pandemic.

Solid profitability

Figma's financials are fairly impressive too. It is cash-flow positive and boasts a roughly 90% gross profit margin. Furthermore its customers are eagerly renewing their contracts and adding more services. As a result Figma's 150% net dollar retention rate is among the best in the industry according to Adobe.

Adobe is excited about the benefits it could accrue by cross-promoting these complementary services. The company has been looking for ways to extend its cloud platform deeper into the web. This acquisition will achieve that goal faster than it could have managed through organic product development.

The price was right

Adobe isn't going into debt to fund this purchase either. It held roughly $8 billion in cash on its books in early September and is generating nearly $2 billion in operating cash flow each quarter. Those factors will make it easy for Adobe to shell out roughly $10 billion in cash for the purchase. The remainder of the $20 billion will be paid in stock.

It will likely be several years before Figma starts boosting Adobe's annual earnings even if sales growth will accelerate almost immediately. Acquisitions of this size often bring unpleasant surprises as companies try to integrate large operations into their established corporate structure. Okta for example is reeling due to unanticipated costs and logistical challenges from its 2021 purchase of Auth0.

If Adobe can avoid those types of issues then the buyout should deliver solid returns for investors. It will give the company a bigger platform and deeper reach into attractive hybrid-work niches. And owning Figma next year will speed its annual sales growth again just as it was dipping to nearly 10%.

The $20 billion price tag might seem high at first blush especially with economic growth slowing and a recession potentially on the way. But the purchase indicates that Adobe's management sees a long runway ahead for growth in the digital creative sector. It shows that the company is willing to make bold bets to position itself to continue leading in that space.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vdGFnL3doYXQtY2FuLWRvLXBob3Rvc2hvcC1pcGhvbmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Can You Do With Photoshop on an iPhone?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vdGFnL3doYXQtY2FuLWRvLXBob3Rvc2hvcC1pcGhvbmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Air Products to start construction of second liquid hydrogen plant in Rotterdam ROTTERDAM The Netherlands September 21 2022",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA5LzI1LzMtZGl2aWRlbmQtYXJpc3RvY3JhdHMtd2FycmVuLWJ1ZmZldHQtYnV5LW5vdy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Dividend Aristocrats In Warren Buffett's Secret Portfolio You Can Buy Right Now,"A little-known group of Buffett stocks includes three members of dividend royalty with solid growth prospects.

You won't find every stock that Warren Buffett owns listed on Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A 1.00%) (BRK.B 0.79%) 13-F filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. No the legendary investor isn't sweeping anything under the rug. However he does have a ""secret portfolio"" of sorts.

In 1995 General Re acquired an investment firm called New England Asset Management (NEAM). Three years later Buffett led Berkshire to acquire General Re. Since then all of the stocks owned by it have also been owned by Berkshire -- and by extension Buffett.

Quite a few dividend stocks are included among NEAM's holdings. And several of them have impressive track records of 25 or more years of consecutive dividend increases. Here are three Dividend Aristocrats in Buffett's ""secret portfolio"" that you can buy right now.

1. AbbVie: On its way to the top

Berkshire directly owned shares of AbbVie (ABBV 0.22%) as recently as the beginning of 2022. However it completely exited the position in the first quarter of this year. But Buffett still has his toes in the water with the big drugmaker through NEAM's small stake in AbbVie. He should be glad that's the case.

AbbVie hasn't skyrocketed in 2022. But its year-to-date gain of nearly 6% has handily trounced the S&P 500. AbbVie's stock performance has also been much better than Berkshire Hathaway's.

The company has increased its dividend for 50 consecutive years including the period when it was part of Abbott Labs. Since separating from Abbott in 2013 AbbVie has grown its dividend by more than 250%. Its dividend currently yields a little under 4%.

Sales of AbbVie's top-selling drug Humira will almost certainly decline beginning next year with the entrance of biosimilars in the U.S. market. However the company expects to quickly return to growth in 2024. Market researcher EvaluatePharma even predicts that AbbVie will become the world's No. 1 pharmaceutical company based on prescription drug sales by 2028.

2. Air Products & Chemicals: Winning from an unstoppable trend

I don't think Buffett has ever publicly expressed interest in buying shares of Air Products & Chemicals (APD -0.02%). But he already owns a position in the industrial gas supplier thanks to NEAM's tiny stake of only 482 shares.

Low exposure to Air Products has turned out to be a good thing so far this year. The stock is down more than 20%. This decline is primarily due to investors' worries about the economy. Air Products' business continues to hum along. The company even beat Wall Street earnings expectations in all of its quarterly updates in 2022.

Income investors have a lot to like about Air Products. The company has increased its dividend for 40 consecutive years. Its dividend yield stands at nearly 2.7%.

Air Products' future looks bright. Its business is set to win big over the long run from an unstoppable trend -- decarbonization. The company already ranks as the global leader in producing gray hydrogen (which is derived from natural gas). Air Products aims to become the leader in blue hydrogen (made from hydrocarbons with carbon dioxide capture) and green hydrogen (produced from renewable sources) as well.

3. Chevron: One of Buffett's favorites these days

Buffett clearly likes Chevron (CVX 0.22%). Berkshire has significantly increased its stake in the oil and gas giant this year. And his actual position in Chevron is even larger than you might think. Buffett's ""secret portfolio"" has also piled into the stock. NEAM loaded up on Chevron in the second quarter.

Buying more shares of Chevron was a brilliant move. The stock has soared 25% so far this year. At one point in early June it was up more than 50% year to date.

Chevron's total return looks even better factoring in its dividends. The company has increased its dividend for 35 consecutive years. Its dividend yields close to 3.7%.

Even if oil prices drop to $50 per barrel (a 44% decline from the current price) Chevron would still be able to maintain its dividend and buy back shares. The likelihood of that happening doesn't seem great anytime soon. Buffett will probably continue to like this Dividend Aristocrat for years to come.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0ZWFtYm9hdHBpbG90LmNvbS9uZXdzL2x1bmctZG9jdG9yLWNsZWFuaW5nLXByYWN0aWNlcy1zaG91bGQtbm90LWNvbXByb21pc2UtY2xlYW4tYWlyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lung doctor: Cleaning practices should not compromise clean air,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.steamboatpilot.com/news/lung-doctor-cleaning-practices-should-not-compromise-clean-air/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0ZWFtYm9hdHBpbG90LmNvbS9uZXdzL2x1bmctZG9jdG9yLWNsZWFuaW5nLXByYWN0aWNlcy1zaG91bGQtbm90LWNvbXByb21pc2UtY2xlYW4tYWlyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmNsZXZlbGFuZGNsaW5pYy5vcmcvYmVuemVuZS1pbi1zdW5zY3JlZW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Benzene and Sunscreen Recalls: What To Know,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='health.clevelandclinic.org', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /benzene-in-sunscreen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673EC6BF40>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmNsZXZlbGFuZGNsaW5pYy5vcmcvYmVuemVuZS1pbi1zdW5zY3JlZW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVzdHJvbmcuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMTM3NzQ0NzEtYmVzdC1oZWFsdGh5LXBvcGNvcm4tYnJhbmRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 10 Best Healthy Popcorn Brands of 2024 According to Dietitians | livestrong,"The best healthy popcorn brands forego artificial additives so you can feel good about what's in your snack.

How to Choose a Healthy Popcorn

When choosing a healthy popcorn brand there are a few things to keep in mind to make sure you make a healthy choice.

1. Check the Sodium

Most of the sodium Americans eat comes from packaged and prepared foods (such as popcorn) according to the FDA. They classify anything with less than 5 percent of your daily value of sodium to be considered low and anything above 20 percent is considered high.

Too much sodium is linked to things like high blood pressure heart disease and kidney disease according to a November 2019 study in ‌Pediatric Nephrology‌. This is especially true for people who are salt-sensitive.

When you're shopping try to pick popcorn brands with as little sodium as possible.

2. Limit Saturated fat

The American Heart Association recommends limiting saturated fat to no more than 5 to 6 percent of your total daily calories. Too much saturated fat is linked to a higher risk of heart disease according to the Harvard T. H Chan School of Public Health.

""The other thing to check is that it does not have an ingredient with the word 'hydrogenated' or 'partially-hydrogenated.' Hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated oils are trans fats which contribute to plaque in the arteries and heart disease"" McDermott says.

3. Skip Added Sugar

Sugar can hide in almost any food including popcorn. It is not uncommon for pre-packaged popcorn to have added sugar especially if it's a kettle corn variety or if it's flavored with any sort of sweet ingredients.

Most popcorn brands should not have any added sugar at all. If you're choosing kettle corn which is meant to be sweet stick to the lowest amount possible such as 8 grams or less per serving as is in the Boom Chicka Pop Sweet and Salty Kettle Corn described above.

4. Read the Ingredients

Popcorn brands should have just a handful or less of real-food ingredients.

""Generally the more ingredients a product has the more processed it is. So if you see a bunch of ingredients you don't recognize you may want to put the bag back on the shelf"" Hanks says.

5. Pay Attention to Packaging

Many microwavable popcorn bags are lined with Polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) according to a May 2020 study in ‌Environmental Health Perspectives‌.

""These are chemicals that repel water and grease and they are used in paper products designed to hold hot and/or greasy foods"" Manaker says. ""Because popcorn is typically popped with grease (like oil or butter) manufacturers include this chemical to make sure the bag stays intact once the popcorn is popped.""

High levels of certain PFAS have been tied to to the following according to the CDC:

Higher cholesterol levels

Lower vaccine response in children

Higher risk of high blood pressure or pre-eclampsia in pregnant people

Higher risk of kidney or testicular cancer

Changes in liver enzymes

Lower infant birthweight

""These outcomes won't happen to every single person who eats microwavable popcorn with PFAS but the risk may be higher for people who regularly eat it"" Manaker says.

6. Choose Organic or Non-GMO

Corn is the most commonly grown crop in America and most of it is GMO (which stands for genetically modified organism). Most GMO corn is created to resist insects or tolerate herbicides according to the FDA. In 2020 92 percent of the corn planted in the U.S. was GMO.

Organic foods are not allowed to be genetically modified in any way according to California Certified Organic Farmers. This can be beneficial as the risks of genetically modified foods may include things like allergies and antibiotic resistance according to the Center for Food Safety.

Organic foods are also grown without pesticides herbicides or fertilizers some of which have been tied to hormone problems and some types of cancer according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Ultimately it is important to ""take your health and satisfaction into consideration simultaneously"" Holden says. ""If sodium is a concern for you find a popcorn with 5 percent or less. If you're trying to take in less sugar find a brand with 8 grams or less.""

You may also want to try a few healthy popcorn brands before you buy a case too. ""Don't buy the brand that claims to be the 'healthiest' if it means you're not going to enjoy it"" Holden says.

Sandra Bermingham has set up a crowdfunding page to help pay legal fees and continue her six-year fight for compensation against the US owned company.

Her husband Paul died days after returning from a Christmas holiday at a farmhouse they had rented in Gozo Malta in 2016 from the popular site.

The 45-year-old father of two contracted Legionnaires disease from contaminated water said to come from the property's hot tub.

Sandra has been battling since 2016 - but the £4bn company have repeatedly refused to accept any liability for her husband's death.

Paul Bermingham pictured left with his wife Sandra centre and their two children Kate 12 and Darragh died after contracting Legionnaires disease while on holiday in Malta during a two-week break over Christmas in 2015

Sandra said: 'They have not shown any after care or any concern for people who rent homes through their site.

'All they are interested in is getting money from bookings. It has left me speechless how ruthless they are and uncaring.'

Construction worker Paul Sandra and their two children Darragh 10 and Kate 12 had booked a two week stay over the Christmas period in 2015.

A room at the property on the island had a hot tub which was mostly used by the children.

Sandra said Paul only used the hot tub once for a matter of seconds as he found the water too cold.

The children suffered no ill effects but days after returning to their home in Islington North London Paul fell ill.

The family booked the two-bed apartment in Gozo which featured a hot tub (not pictured)

Sandra pictured right suffered a breakdown following the death of her late husband

He was rushed to Whittington Hospital and placed into an induced coma. He died 14 days after returning from Malta.

A coroner at an inquest ruled his cause of death as Legionella Pneumonia.

Legionella are a species of deadly bacteria that are airborne and are mostly found in contaminated water.

WHAT IS LEGIONNAIRES' DISEASE? Legionnaires' disease is a severe form of pneumonia that causes lung inflammation. It is caused by a bacterium known as Legionella. Around 500 people in the UK and 6100 in the US suffer every year. The condition can cause life-threatening complications including respiratory failure kidney failure and septic shock which occurs when blood flow to the vital organs is blocked. Most sufferers become ill by inhaling tiny water droplets from infected sources such as shower heads hot tubs swimming pools or ventilation systems in buildings. Anyone can become infected however at-risk people include the elderly smokers and those with suppressed immune systems such as chemotherapy patients. Symptoms usually develop between two and 10 days after exposure to the bacteria. Early signs include: Headache

Muscle pain

Fever and chills People may then experience: Cough which may bring up blood

Breathlessness

Chest pain

Nausea vomiting or diarrhoea

Confusion Treatment is antibiotics usually in hospital as soon as possible. Prevention involves meticulous cleaning and disinfection of water systems. People can reduce their risk by not smoking as this damages the lungs and makes individuals more susceptible.

Sandra said: 'Paul only went in the hot tub once on New Year's Eve and he was in the water for a matter of seconds. The bacteria is airborne and I believe he was infected soon after he checked in to the farmhouse.

'He was not one to complain but after a few days at home he asked for an ambulance to take him to hospital.

'He was so ill and they had to put him in an induced coma and he never recovered. The hospital did all they could but could not save him. We were utterly distraught that he could be taken from us.

'The holiday was supposed to be a break we could all enjoy but it ruined our family life.'

Sandra was left so distraught at her husband's death that she suffered a breakdown.

She was unable to continue working as a make-up artist and with no savings forced to return to live with her brother in Auckland New Zealand.

She claims Airbnb and their insurers refused to accept any liability – although the Gozo property was removed from their listings once they were informed about Mr Bermingham's death.

The San Francisco based company which started in 2008 has seven million listings for rent on their site and has logged over 150 million rentals.

Since 2016 Mrs Bermingham 54 has been battling Airbnb for compensation for her husband's death.

She is seeking £1.2m for loss of earnings which have been calculated on how much she and her husband would have earned until retirement.

But despite law firms acting on her behalf she says she has been repeatedly stalled by the US home rental firm and their insurers.

'At every turn they have tried to frustrate me and do not want to accept any liability for my husband's death and the turmoil that has been caused in my family's life' she said.

'On one occasion when I tried to speak with their lawyers I was told they were all on holiday. This is a major multi-billion-dollar company and they claim there was no one available to speak.'

Mrs Bermingham has not been helped in her claim by the Maltese authorities who have refused to hand over the results of tests carried out on the contaminated water in the hot tub.

The Maltese based insurance company have cited privacy laws in not releasing the results but the cause of death has not been disputed.

Sandra said: 'When we arrived at the farmhouse there was an overpouring smell of chlorine from the jacuzzi. It was so strong that we felt ill. It was also very cold inside and so cold the owners had to bring in some heaters.

Mrs Bermingham has not been helped in her claim by the Maltese authorities who have refused to hand over the results of tests carried out on the contaminated water in the hot tub

'I do not believe the jacuzzi had been properly maintained and it had not been used for some time before our arrival.'

Peter Fenench a Malta based lawyer representing Mrs Bermingham said she needs to raise funds to continue to the legal fight against Airbnb and bring them to court.

Sandra said: 'Airbnb did not investigate this case and never offered any kind of support to my family. No compensation has been forthcoming and I am I on my own to obtain justice for what happened.

'Since I will not give up I need funding for court proceedings to fight Airbnb on Malta for compensation.

'I want the world to know how Airbnb works making tons of money off our backs and waiving any responsibility when things go terribly wrong in the houses they earn their billions with.'

A spokesman for Airbnb said: 'We were heartbroken to learn of this tragic incident at the time and our thoughts remain with the Bermingham family following such an unimaginable loss. We remain in touch with the family's representatives on this matter.

'The safety of our community is a priority and with more than one billion guest arrivals in Airbnb listings to date isolated incidents are exceptionally rare.'

Sandra has a GoFundMe page to help pay her family's legal costs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNudHJhdmVsbGVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RoaXMtZ290aGljLWNoYXBlbC1haXJibmItaW4tYnJpZ2h0b24taXMtdGhlLWNvb2xlc3QtcGxhY2UtdG8tc3RheS1mb3ItaGFsbG93ZWVu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This gothic chapel Airbnb in Brighton is the coolest place to stay for Halloween,"A few more steps and I reach the bedroom. Now the name of the listing ‘The Chapel’ is fully realised. The 15ft ceiling is arched like a small Puritan church while the dark walls make it seem like the tar painted barrel of a boat. In the dark space the bed sheets on the large Victorian-style bed glow dove-white. The effect is gothic but totally romantic at the same time. Rock and roll vs. Victorian aesthetics play tug of war throughout the space as period details are offset by quirky design features. The whole place in fact has its quirks; the wear and tear of years of use becoming part of the experience. Instead of towel hooks a series of knives appear as though thrown into the walls. Heavy trunks are filled with hidden games and books. On closer inspection the chandelier above the bed is made of black lego bricks. At the furthest side of the room a clawfoot bathtub sits under a floor-to-ceiling stained glass window. Having a bath below the open stained glass window looking up at blue sky with bustling street below is quite an experience.

The backstory

Church Street where the flat resides is one of the oldest streets in Brighton. The backstory of the property is shrouded in mystery. Originally built on the site of the former Trinity Independent Presbyterian Church that dates back to 1825 the Airbnb ‘Chapel’ itself is said to have been built in 1875 and may well have been one of the church’s congregation houses or even part of the church itself. It’s very possible the stained glass windows were original from this time.

Food & drink

The flat is furnished with a small kitchen bar with fridge coffee machine sink kettle and teas. Just enough to supply basic needs when staying but clearly operating on the assumption that you won’t be eating at home – many of Brighton's best restaurants are within easy walking distance.

The Buckeyes will wear the all-black alternate jerseys for the fourth time in program history earning wins against Michigan State in 2019 Nebraska in 2018 and against Penn State in 2015 when these uniforms were first used.

Ohio State previewed the all-black look earlier this week:

Here's a look at the alternate jerseys Ohio State has worn in the past.

When has Ohio State worn alternate jerseys?

The first time wearing an alternate jersey was in 2009 against Michigan. The Buckeyes won 21-10.

One season later Ohio State beat Michigan 37-7 in scarlet tops and helmets with gray pants.

On Oct. 29 2011 Ohio State upset No. 12 Wisconsin wearing alternate jerseys.

In 2012 Urban Meyer brought back the scarlet tops against Michigan beating the Wolverines 26-21.

The Buckeyes wore similar jerseys in their 63-14 win against Penn State in 2013.

Ohio State traded scarlet for white on the road against Michigan later in 2013 wearing similar jerseys in losses to Clemson in the 2014 Orange Bowl and at home to Virginia Tech in 2014. They went back to the white versions against Penn State on Oct. 25 and won 31-24 in overtime.

In the 2015 Allstate Sugar Bowl against Alabama Ohio State wore Nike Diamond Quest uniforms to honor the 1968 national championship team wearing a scarlet version against Oregon a few days later to win the first College Football Playoff championship.

In 2016 Ohio State released an interesting design for a 62-3 win against Nebraska.

The black helmets returned against Michigan that season. And Ohio State beat the Wolverines in overtime 30-27.

In 2017 the Buckeyes went gray bringing back the black chrome helmets against Penn State in 2017.

They wore similar jerseys but white against Michigan that season. They won 31-20.

Most recently in 2021 Ohio State released its Nike Color Rush jerseys for a ""Scarlet the Shoe"" against Penn State.

GOOGL,Alphabet Inc,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA5LzI1L2lzLWdvb2dsZS1yZWFsbHktdHJ5aW5nLXRvLWJ1eS1waW50ZXJlc3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Google Really Trying to Buy Pinterest?,"If it is it's likely motivated by Pinterest's unique ability to predict consumer behavior.

Google's parent company Alphabet (GOOG -0.75%) (GOOGL -0.77%) may be considering an acquisition of image-browsing platform Pinterest (PINS -1.52%). And that's because Pinterest possesses something extremely valuable that Alphabet would definitely like to have in a changing advertising economy.

Don't be fooled by a stock price that's down more than 70% from its all-time high. Here's the case for Pinterest and its potential suitor.

Where did this crazy rumor even come from?

Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai spoke at the Code Conference earlier this month. He talked about many things going on with the company including developments in the advertising market and concerns over artificial intelligence. Late in the talk however the interviewer turned the conversation toward mergers and acquisitions (M&A).

When asked if Pinterest was an acquisition target Pichai stammered ""Look I can't comment on a few on any M&A deals."" He then smiled sheepishly at the interviewer's suggestion that he could comment if he wanted to do so.

Perhaps Pichai was simply uncomfortable with the entire interview and struggled for an answer regarding Pinterest for this reason. However the interviewer had just asked Pichai the same question regarding Twitter which he seemingly answered with ease. Alphabet isn't looking to buy Twitter he said. The drama unfolding with Elon Musk has Pichai simply watching with ""popcorn.""

Pichai answered the question on acquiring Twitter. He didn't with Pinterest. And that leads some to believe that Alphabet has indeed reached out to Pinterest about a potential acquisition.

Why Pinterest is a valuable acquisition target

Pichai's comments at the Code Conference is just circumstantial evidence. However it wouldn't be the first time a big tech company would be interested in buying out Pinterest. PayPal Holdings was reportedly trying to buy Pinterest for $45 billion last year. PayPal's market capitalization was around $300 billion at the time compared to Pinterest's then market cap of around $35 billion.

Both market caps have fallen mightily -- PayPal is down to about $105 billion whereas Pinterest is worth about $16 billion. And when it comes to Pinterest its stock has been crushed because of slumping user metrics. It was once believed that Pinterest could potentially attract billions of users like Meta Platforms. However the company peaked at 478 million monthly active users way back in the first quarter of 2021 and has since steadily declined to where it is today at just 433 million monthly active users.

On the surface Pinterest's relevance is dwindling which hardly seems like a platform worthy of PayPal and Alphabet's attention. However Pinterest has steadily increased its monetization going from $1.04 in average revenue per active user (ARPU) in Q1 2021 to $1.54 in Q2 2022. That's substantial.

Here's what Alphabet and PayPal are likely interested in: Pinterest has steadily increased its monetization thanks to its truly unique perspectives and insights into consumer behaviors. Year after year the company proves it knows what people want with its annual Pinterest Predicts report -- the report was proven to be 80% correct in 2021.

For Alphabet's part it generates most of its revenue through advertising. But the game is changing for advertising stocks. Consumers are increasingly concerned about privacy and governments are regulating more. For this reason Alphabet intends to do away with third-party cookies in 2024. But that risks making its ads less effective and that would consequently lead to lower ad rates.

Acquiring Pinterest and its consumer insights could dramatically help it remain more effective at advertising while also doing away with tracking.

For PayPal investors often forget it has a merchant side of its business -- 35 million active merchant accounts as of the second quarter of 2022 up from 32 million in the same quarter of 2021. Part of the company's strategy is to provide data on consumer intent to merchants so they can better know what to prioritize. This is exactly what Pinterest could have provided had the deal gone through.

Pinterest is still a valuable company

In the end we don't know for sure if Alphabet is really intent on acquiring Pinterest or whether we'll never hear rumblings of this rumor again. However I believe we have seen that Pinterest's business has value even if it's struggled to create value for shareholders since going public in 2019.

That said I believe Pinterest is still a stock worth buying today despite its user struggles. Its ARPU growth demonstrates its value to advertisers likely due to its perspectives on consumer trends. That could make Pinterest an even more attractive platform if the global economy goes into a recession; advertisers would likely decrease spending overall and concentrate spending on platforms where returns are the best. And Pinterest would be a top contender for those concentrated dollars.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibG9vbWJlcmcuY29tL29waW5pb24vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAyMi0wOS0yNS9sYXJyeS1wYWdlLWtpdHR5LWhhd2stMy1sZXNzb25zLWZyb20tYS1nb29nbGUtYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtcy1mbHlpbmctY2FyLWZhaWx1cmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Larry Page Kitty Hawk: 3 Lessons From a Google Billionaire's Flying Car Failure,"Why did this happen?

Jerod Harris/Getty Images

Google CEO Sundar Pichai faced tough questions from staff in a fiery all-hands meeting this week.

He said workers shouldn't ""equate fun with money"" in response to questions about cost-cutting.

Pichai denied Google was on a path of ""aggressive cost saving"" amid difficult economic conditions.

Google's CEO has denied the company is embarking on ""aggressive cost saving"" and told staff they should not ""equate fun with money"" at an all-hands meeting this week CNBC first reported.

The search giant's spending was under scrutiny at the company-wide briefing in New York where Sundar Pichai said growth would be ""constrained"" going forward.

Pichai was asked why Google was ""nick-and-diming employees"" by cutting travel budgets and moving away from ""rapidly hiring and spending"" despite it having ""record profits and huge cash reserves"".

""I remember when Google was small and scrappy"" Pichai said CNBC reported. ""We shouldn't always equate fun with money. I think you can walk into a hard-working startup and people may be having fun and it shouldn't always equate to money.""

Google's owner Alphabet reported a 14% fall in profit for the second quarter of this year to $16 billion compared with the same period last year but revenues jumped 13% to just over $69 billion.

Pichai said the company was acting responsibly during one of the most difficult economic periods this decade and urged that staff pull together to help weather the storm.

""I'm a bit concerned that you think what we've done is what you would define as aggressive cost saving"" he said CNBC reported. ""I think it's important we don't get disconnected. You need to take a long-term view through conditions like this.""

A Google spokesperson told the broadcaster: ""Sundar has been speaking to the company consistently over the last few months about ways we can be more focused.""

The spokesperson added the company's ""leaders are working to be responsible and efficient in all that their teams do"" and that ""ensuring that our people are working on the highest impact/highest priority work.""

Google did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

Jerod Harris/Getty Images

Google CEO Sundar Pichai faced tough questions from staff in a fiery all-hands meeting this week.

He said workers shouldn't ""equate fun with money"" in response to questions about cost-cutting.

Pichai denied Google was on a path of ""aggressive cost saving"" amid difficult economic conditions.

Google's CEO has denied the company is embarking on ""aggressive cost saving"" and told staff they should not ""equate fun with money"" at an all-hands meeting this week CNBC first reported.

The search giant's spending was under scrutiny at the company-wide briefing in New York where Sundar Pichai said growth would be ""constrained"" going forward.

Pichai was asked why Google was ""nick-and-diming employees"" by cutting travel budgets and moving away from ""rapidly hiring and spending"" despite it having ""record profits and huge cash reserves"".

""I remember when Google was small and scrappy"" Pichai said CNBC reported. ""We shouldn't always equate fun with money. I think you can walk into a hard-working startup and people may be having fun and it shouldn't always equate to money.""

Google's owner Alphabet reported a 14% fall in profit for the second quarter of this year to $16 billion compared with the same period last year but revenues jumped 13% to just over $69 billion.

Pichai said the company was acting responsibly during one of the most difficult economic periods this decade and urged that staff pull together to help weather the storm.

""I'm a bit concerned that you think what we've done is what you would define as aggressive cost saving"" he said CNBC reported. ""I think it's important we don't get disconnected. You need to take a long-term view through conditions like this.""

A Google spokesperson told the broadcaster: ""Sundar has been speaking to the company consistently over the last few months about ways we can be more focused.""

The spokesperson added the company's ""leaders are working to be responsible and efficient in all that their teams do"" and that ""ensuring that our people are working on the highest impact/highest priority work.""

Google did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

Other issues

Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently heard the issues of the company employees at the company’s all-hands meet where he tried to answer their questions. The questions were related to cost-cutting done by the company on employees’ travel and entertainment budgets productivity and potential layoffs among other matters as per a report by CNBC.He was also pitched a question that wanted an explanation on Google’s “nickel-and-diming employees” by reducing the travel and swag budgets at a time when “Google has record profits and huge cash reserves”.Pichai said that the company is being “a bit more responsible through one of the toughest macroeconomic conditions underway in the past decade” and that it;s important for them to pull together as a company to get through moments like this.On cost cutting he said: “I remember when Google was small and scrappy. Fun didn’t always — we shouldn’t always equate fun with money. I think you can walk into a hard-working startup and people may be having fun and it shouldn’t always equate to money.”On why the company has shifted from “rapidly hiring and spending to equally aggressive cost saving” Pichai said “I’m a bit concerned that you think what we’ve done is what you would define as aggressive cost saving. I think it’s important we don’t get disconnected. You need to take a long-term view through conditions like this.”He further said that Google was still pursuing investments in long term projects like quantum computing that it’s important to be “to be smart to be frugal to be scrappy to be more efficient” in uncertain times.Employees also wanted to know why the company wanted them to return to the office and not connect in-person or travel.His answer to this question was: “I do understand some of the travel restrictions at a time like this and RTO and people wanting to see each other definitely is not ideal. If you haven’t seen your team in a while and it’ll help your work by getting together in person I think you can do that. I think that’s why we are not saying no to travel we are giving discretion to teams.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLmNvbS9ub2RlLzIxNjg5MDYvYnVzaW5lc3MtZWNvbm9tedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google Cloud partners with Saudi Aramco to launch a new data center in the Kingdom: Top official,"RIYADH: Google Cloud has partnered with Saudi Arabian Oil Co. to distribute its cloud services in the Kingdom. The cloud platform will be launching its first data center in the region soon said a senior company official.

According to Abdul Rahman Al Thehaiban managing director of Turkey Middle East & Africa Google Cloud the new cloud solution will allow organizations around the region to grow and scale their offerings while delivering digital products and services faster.

Al Thehaiban further said that the collaboration will expand cloud services demand in the Kingdom which is forecast to reach a market opportunity of up to $10 billion by 2030 according to a statement issued by Aramco.

HIGH LIGHTS • The cloud computing platform is currently setting up an office in the Kingdom where it plans to increase the local content and transfer its know-how. • It has also partnered with SDAIA to launch a new initiative called Elevate which aims to empower women globally to pursue careers in AI and machine learning.

“Our objective is to launch a data center in Saudi that’s expected to be announced soon and to have some distribution for Aramco’s recently announced company called Context” Al Thehaiban told Arab News on the sidelines of the Global AI Summit in Riyadh.

He added that the oil behemoth would be the reseller for Google Cloud solutions in the Kingdom.

The cloud computing platform is currently setting up an office in the Kingdom where it plans to increase the local content and transfer its know-how.

It has also partnered with the state-run Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority to launch a new initiative called Elevate which aims to empower women globally to pursue careers in AI and machine learning.

The initiative launched during the Global AI Summit held in Riyadh will train more than 25000 women over the next five years.

The program offers a four-month curriculum where participants can access free training sessions designed to train them with the skills and experience needed for roles like cloud architect data engineer machine learning engineer or cloud business specialist.

While the global AI industry has grown at a rapid pace women remain underrepresented. According to a UNESCO study women represent 12 percent of international AI researchers and 8 percent of professional software developers.

The study also revealed that only one fifth of employees in technical roles in major machine learning companies are women.

“The objective of this is really to train local talents making sure that we bring them up to the standards of what Google Cloud can provide” Al Thehaiban said.

Google Cloud has also widened its scope by addressing environmental water and agricultural challenges posed by climate change.

It collaborated with SDAIA the Ministry of Environment Water and Agriculture and Climate Engine to launch the Earth observation and science program.

“Climate change is all about data collection we keep track of the nitty-gritty details of the climate application and then through certain algorism we monitor the prediction and how it can be beneficial in issues related to sustainability” he said."

The headline development is the Flagship Suite a seat that sits somewhere between the airline’s current Flagship Business class and Flagship First in terms of luxury and experience with a privacy door a ‘chaise longue’ relaxed seating option and more personal storage space.

The B787-9 Flagship Suite is based on Adient Aerospace’s Ascent platform optimised for Boeing cabins customised in conjunction with Teague and trimmed in fabrics from Tapis. For the narrowbody A321XLRs it has been suggested that the Collins Aurora seat has been chosen.

The new long-haul cabins will have more premium seating installed than on their current counterparts – indeed 45% more – with the B787-9s due to be fitted with 51 Flagship Suites seats and 32 premium economy seats. The Airbus A321XLR aircraft will feature 20 Flagship Suites and 12 premium economy seats.

Those Premium Economy seats are also new and custom-designed for more privacy than the current model with double the amount of in-seat storage space. The model? Customisation makes it difficult to say but it appears to have much in common with the ZIMprivacy model.

Retrofits too

American also intends to retrofit its Boeing 777-300ER fleet with Flagship Suites. These 20 aircraft will be refreshed with the new interior schemes starting in late 2024 to include 70 Flagship Suite seats and 44 Premium Economy seats.

American will also retrofit its Airbus A321T fleet with new cabins to align those 16 aircraft with the rest of its A321 fleet. American will continue to offer lie-flat seats on its transcontinental routes departing New York and Boston along with its Northeast Alliance partner JetBlue Airways.

“We are enhancing the customer experience across their entire journey with American” said Julie Rath American’s VP of customer experience. “The arrival of new long-haul aircraft and the customised seat design of the Flagship Suite seats will offer customers a truly private premium experience on our long-haul fleet.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1teXN0ZXJpb3VzLW5vaXNlcy1pbnRlcmNvbS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines Passengers Report Mysterious Noises On Flight Intercom,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1teXN0ZXJpb3VzLW5vaXNlcy1pbnRlcmNvbS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMjQvaG93LWFpcmxpbmVzLXBsYW4tdG8tZW5kLW9uZS1iaWxsaW9uLXRvbnMtb2YtY2FyYm9uLWVtaXNzaW9ucy5odG1s0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjIvMDkvMjQvaG93LWFpcmxpbmVzLXBsYW4tdG8tZW5kLW9uZS1iaWxsaW9uLXRvbnMtb2YtY2FyYm9uLWVtaXNzaW9ucy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The airline race for a breakthrough fuel to cut one billion tons of carbon is just starting,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMjQvaG93LWFpcmxpbmVzLXBsYW4tdG8tZW5kLW9uZS1iaWxsaW9uLXRvbnMtb2YtY2FyYm9uLWVtaXNzaW9ucy5odG1s0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjIvMDkvMjQvaG93LWFpcmxpbmVzLXBsYW4tdG8tZW5kLW9uZS1iaWxsaW9uLXRvbnMtb2YtY2FyYm9uLWVtaXNzaW9ucy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000267412F7A30>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Whether you want a little extra legroom or to experience a truly better class of service upgrading your flight can be complicated. Not only do upgrades work differently for each airline but there are also multiple ways to score an upgrade with some airlines.

To help you understand how to get upgraded to first class or perhaps just a better seat here's a list of our airline-specific upgrade guides:

These airline-specific guides give you a lot to compare. Even if a free upgrade isn't possible for your flight there may still be ways to snag an inexpensive upgrade. So here are some suggestions on how to get an upgrade to first class an exit row or a seat with more legroom.

Use your miles for free upgrades on flights

JetBlue Mint. ZACH GRIFF/THE POINTS GUY

When flying many major airlines you can use your miles to upgrade. But every airline handles upgrades with miles a little differently. Some like American and United charge a co-pay on most mileage upgrades (though United waives the co-pay for elite members). Meanwhile Delta offers mileage upgrades at a fixed rate of about 1.07 cents per mile.

In some situations the number of miles required to upgrade your seat is significantly less than what you might need to redeem for an award flight. Redeeming miles for an upgraded seat can be a great use for your miles if you only have a small mileage balance with an airline.

Redeeming miles for upgrades can also be a great use of transferable currencies such as Bilt Rewards or Chase Ultimate Rewards since you can transfer the amount you need to top off your account.

Consider a bundle for a free upgrade

You could buy an upgrade to the exit row. SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY

Once you wade into the world of low-cost airlines you'll find that you can select better seats on them as part of purchasing a bundle. Purchasing a bundle just for a seat with extra legroom is seldom a good idea. But if you were planning to check a bag or wanted priority boarding you may find that purchasing those items a la carte is more expensive than purchasing a bundle of add-ons.

Frontier's ""The Works"" bundle includes items such as a carry-on bag and a checked bag and allows you to select any seat on the plane including seats with extra legroom. Allegiant and Spirit offer similar bundles though Spirit sells its unique Big Front Seat separately. When considering a low-cost carrier think about the add-ons you might purchase and how that decision might help you get a cheap or free upgrade to a better seat.

Take advantage of elite status for a free upgrade

KYLE OLSEN/THE POINTS GUY

In the 1990s and 2000s it was typical for domestic first-class cabins on American Delta and United to mostly seat business travelers with elite status. In those days that was how to get free upgrades on flights.

Over time the airlines turned the dials of yield management to make money off those seats they were giving away for free. First-class seats sell for a lot less money today than in decades past. Airlines now fill their first-class seats primarily with customers who booked a first-class fare.

However there are still plenty of opportunities for a free upgrade to first class. This is especially true if you fly unpopular routes or fly at non-peak times. You can also increase your chances of finding a free upgrade by using services like Expert Flyer (owned by TPG's parent company Red Ventures) to scan for flights with a greater chance of an upgrade.

There are many reasons it can be better to have top-tier elite status on one airline versus mid-tier status on multiple airlines. Upgrades are one of these areas since the upgrade waitlist is organized by status level.

Pay for the seat you want

KYLE OLSEN/THE POINTS GUY

Many business travelers begrudgingly admit a new mantra is in play when it comes to airline travel: ""Buy the seat you want."" It's an acknowledgment that complimentary upgrades are harder to come by than ever and someone else is often willing to pay for the first-class or exit row seat you used to get for free.

Luckily a few credit cards offer annual travel credits you can use to reduce your out-of-pocket costs. Chase Sapphire Reserve is a good example with a very easy-to-use $300 travel credit per account anniversary year. To a lesser degree the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card is another option with its annual $300 travel credit but you must use the credit through the Capital One travel portal.

Bottom line

If more comfort is important to you the next time you take to the air make sure you do your research before purchasing a ticket. Across all the major domestic U.S. airlines you'll find a wide range of upgrade procedures. So learn about airline upgrade policies and procedures before clicking the purchase button for your next flight."
AEP,American Electric Power,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vaW93YWNhcGl0YWxkaXNwYXRjaC5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8yNC9hbWlkLWEtbWFzc2l2ZS1hbWVyaWNhbi1jbGVhbi1lbmVyZ3ktc2hpZnQtZ3JpZC1vcGVyYXRvcnMtcGxheS1jYXRjaC11cC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amid a massive American clean energy shift grid operators play catch-up. • Iowa Capital Dispatch,"For the better part of the past century the American electric power system evolved around large mostly fossil fuel power plants delivering electricity to residences businesses and industry through a network of transmission and distribution wires that collectively came to be called the electric grid.

But as the threat of climate change driven by carbon pollution becomes more dire and as technological advances make wind solar and battery storage ever cheaper options for powering homes and business states corporations and voters are increasingly pushing to aggressively decarbonize the grid.

Power generation resulted in more than 1.7 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions in 2020 according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration and accounted for about a quarter of all U.S. carbon emissions. Transportation contributes another 27% and policies to speed up electric vehicle adoption including in the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act rely on the electricity needed to charge all those battery-powered cars being produced cleanly.

Thirty states and Washington D.C. have active renewable or clean energy requirements and three other states have voluntary renewable energy goals per the National Conference of State Legislatures. And major corporations — from Amazon Target and Microsoft to Boeing and Google — are also increasingly becoming major green power consumers.

That collective momentum has led to a flood of renewable energy development — thousands of projects billions of dollars in capital and thousands of jobs — but getting that electricity to customers is more complicated than just building solar panels and wind turbines.

Millions of American electric customers are in territories managed by entities called regional transmission organizations or independent system operators which are tasked with managing the flow of electricity across the grid running electric markets ensuring reliability and overseeing new interconnections..

And while grid operators say they’re doing their best to manage the renewable transition while ensuring reliability and keeping costs stable critics contend they’ve been caught flatfooted and are only just now coming to grips with the new demands of a changing power system on their markets and interconnection queues. That’s creating a bottleneck that’s holding up thousands of projects that could help create a cleaner and more resilient grid and tripping up state clean power goals.

Running the grid

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) created standards for regional transmission organizations in a 1999 order in part to spur better regional grid management and more competitive wholesale electric markets.

There are currently seven regional transmission organizations or independent system operators operating in the United States right now. The biggest PJM is one of the largest wholesale electric markets in the world and coordinates the movement of electricity in all or parts of 13 states and Washington D.C. a territory that numbers 65 million people. Roughly two-thirds of American electric customers live in an area where service is managed by a regional transmission organization (RTO) or an independent system operator (ISO) according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

In the West and Southeast customers are generally served by traditional utilities that are typically vertically integrated (meaning they’re responsible for generating transmitting and distributing electricity to their customers) who do their own planning and trade power with each other but not as part of an organized market like in an RTO said Seth Blumsack a professor of energy policy and economics at Penn State.

The differences between an RTO and ISO are largely technical with the FERC setting out specific requirements for RTOs.

“They functionally do the same thing nowadays” said Jeff Dennis managing director and general counsel of Advanced Energy Economy a trade group that represents more than 100 companies working in energy efficiency demand response energy storage solar wind hydro nuclear electric vehicles biofuels and smart grid technologies.

“There are sort of three reasons they matter: markets transmission and reliability” said Casey Roberts a senior attorney with the Sierra Club who focuses on regional transmission organizations. “Those markets and how they’re designed determine what revenue generators earn and how often they run.”

Because they’re charged with managing the grid and ensuring reliability RTOs and ISOs also oversee new connections for power generators. And across the country they’ve been buried in the past several years by an avalanche of interconnection requests mostly from wind and solar and increasingly battery storage developers in part spurred by how cheap those generation sources have become and also as a result of states’ clean energy policies.

“A number of these RTOs have decision systems that were designed for a bygone era of the grid” Blumsack said. “They were sort of designed when your market participants were transmission owners big generation owners utilities. As you have mandates for new technologies and all these new market actors emerging it’s been hard for some RTOs to integrate them.”

The queue blues

The most conspicuous example of that dynamic has been the interconnection queues in which thousands of projects mostly wind and solar languish while waiting for approval to connect to the grid. There’s been little regional and interregional transmission expansion in the past decade said John Moore director of the Natural Resources Defense Council’s Sustainable FERC Project. For example wind energy is abundant in parts of the Midwest and West but it needs long-range transmission lines to get it to population centers that comprise the bulk of the electric load.

“With all of those pressures on the grid it was to some extent predictable but unfortunate that we’re at this point — with a big backlog and delays for renewable projects” Moore said.

Developers also in many cases can’t get good information on the costs of that connection and any associated grid upgrades they’ll be required to pay for prior to application Roberts and other critics say leading to developers filing for multiple projects just to find the best place to site a single solar array for example.

“Usually developers don’t start putting steel in the ground until they have the results of their interconnection study” Roberts said. “Sometimes the interconnection costs can be more than 50% of the project cost.”

Many grid operators have struggled to manage their interconnection queues. For example the Midcontinent Independent System Operator or MISO which encompasses parts or all of 15 states stretching from Minnesota to Louisiana has hundreds of mostly wind and solar projects in its interconnection queue that amounted to a capacity of more than 118000 megawatts as of Sept. 19. However MISO got an interconnection reform plan approved by the FERC earlier this year that is intended to streamline the process.

But nowhere has the problem been more pronounced than within PJM which is headquartered near Philadelphia.

“They exist in many many places in the country” said Dennis of Advanced Energy Economy. “PJM has just been the worst example in recent years.”

As of early September PJM had more than 2500 projects in the queue with a total capacity of more than 22500 megawatts according to Ken Seiler PJM’s vice president of planning. For some perspective that’s more than the maximum output of all the power generation in the PJM region right now (about 185000 MW).

“Here’s the crazy thing about the interconnection backlog that PJM finds themselves in” said Lorig Charkoudian a Democratic member of the Maryland House of Delegates whose district is just outside Washington. “PJM would tell you that what they do what they take pride in is they forecast and they plan. Here we have a situation where you could have absolutely forecast this moment if you wanted to.”

Charkoudian an economist points to examples like PJM rules that have since been overhauled but initially penalized renewable energy sources trying to participate in PJM’s capacity market. She also criticized the grid operator’s previous restrictions on battery storage as hindering Maryland and other states with aggressive plans to decarbonize.

“You knew this moment was coming you had a structure in place that was unworkable.

Forecasting is what you do. Fix it. And fix it 10 years ago” she said.

Reforms to the rescue?

PJM and other RTOs say they are.

“The existing planning queue was designed to process larger centralized generation resources that were far fewer in number” said Seiler the PJM vice president of planning. “It was also not designed to weed out the many speculative projects that may not have the financing or other means necessary to bring the project to completion.”

A new interconnection process developed by a PJM task force starting in 2021 has been filed for approval with the FERC and will shift to a “first-ready first-served basis rather than first come first-served.” The new framework also includes a “cluster” approach to studying interconnection costs reducing the number of additional studies required when projects are modified and streamlining interconnections for projects “that do not contribute to the need for network upgrades.”

“Along with the process revisions PJM studied more projects than all other RTOs combined in 2020 leading to 30000 MW worth of generation completing the study process and having executed final agreements in hand. Despite this only 1500 MW worth of generation has gone commercial in 2022 as developers face additional challenges beyond the interconnection study process” Seiler said.

For some renewable developers environmental advocates and state politicians though it’s an imperfect fix. For one PJM is proposing to freeze its queue for two years to work through the backlog creating delays for projects that haven’t been filed yet. (By comparison MISO is pushing to cut its interconnection application process to about a year without any freeze on new requests.) Going forward PJM envisions processing new interconnection requests within two years.

In comments to the FERC the Organization of PJM States which represents state public service commissions in PJM territory called the reforms a “step in the right direction” and a “considerable improvement to the existing processes which is hindering some states’ ability to achieve their policy goals.”

However while the group encouraged FERC to approve the plan it said it was “deeply concerned that even under PJM’s proposed reforms a project entering the queue today may not be able to achieve commercial operation until nearly 2030.”

‘A potential roadblock’

Aside from the queue problems critics say capacity markets like PJM’s intended to ensure there’s enough available electricity to handle spikes in load are tilted toward fossil fuel generators and allow old inefficient and polluting power plants to limp along rather than be retired as well as charge electric customers for capacity they don’t need.

“In terms of what the role is RTOs are both critically important for the clean energy transition but also without reform of their markets a potential roadblock to the clean energy transition” Dennis said.

RTO markets Dennis said were designed 20 to 25 years ago around the generation of the time primarily coal gas and nuclear power plants.

“The resources that we will rely on in the future have different technical and operating characteristics” he said. “That’s really where we are in a market like PJM. We’re trying to evolve these rules.”

Seiler the PJM vice president said the organization is “committed to a reliable energy transition as cost-effectively and reliably facilitating state decarbonization policies (and other state policies) through our competitive markets operations and planning processes.

“This is at the heart of almost everything we do today.”

‘Steps in the right direction’

For renewable energy developers and advocates though there are signs that RTOs are working better with states to help them meet their goals.

MISO recently approved more than $10 billion for 18 transmission projects comprising more than 2000 miles of transmission line in the upper Midwest including in Michigan Wisconsin Illinois Indiana Iowa Minnesota Missouri and the Dakotas. The plan “represents the most complex transmission study effort in MISO’s history” the grid operator said and will provide a host of benefits for the grid.

“Carbon-free and clean energy goals set by MISO member utilities state and municipal government policies and customer preferences continue to drive growth in wind solar battery and hybrid projects” MISO said. “As the region faces both a changing resource fleet and increased prevalence of extreme weather events the ability to move electricity from where it is generated to where it is needed most becomes paramount.”

PJM also reached a novel deal with the Board of Public Utilities in New Jersey which has set an ambitious goal for offshore wind energy development (7500 megawatts by 2035) that will allow a “first-of-its-kind competitive transmission process” administered by PJM which is expected to drive down costs of getting that wind-generated electricity to customers as long as New Jersey handles the bill within its own borders.

“The provision enables a state or group of states to propose a project to assist in realizing state public policy requirements as long as the state (or states) agrees to pay all costs of any state-selected build-out” PJM said in a news release.

Then there’s what Dennis of Advanced Energy Economy called an “aggressive agenda” by the FERC itself to help smooth the renewable transition for grid operators and developers alike.

A recent FERC order for instance directs RTOs and ISOs to remove barriers to electric market participation for energy storage a crucial technology to balancing the intermittent nature of wind and solar power.

And two other proposed major rules deal with transmission and interconnection respectively.

“Who pays for transmission is one of the biggest barriers to getting transmission built” Dennis said. “FERC is trying to streamline that by determining who the beneficiaries are in a standardized way.” The hope is the change will head off one of the most common objections by states to new transmission — that their residents are paying for it without getting enough benefit Dennis said.

The proposed interconnection rule is aimed squarely at expediting the queue backlogs for connecting new electric generation to the grid.

“At the end of 2021 there were more than 1400 gigawatts of generation and storage waiting in interconnection queues throughout the country. This is more than triple the total volume just five years ago. Projects now face an average timeline of more than three years to get connected to the grid” FERC said in a June news release.

The main components are:

a “first-ready first-served” cluster study process in which large interconnection studies encompassing multiple generating facilities rather than individual ones

imposing firm deadlines and penalties if transmission providers fail to complete studies on time

allowing multiple generators to share a single interconnection request and co-locate on a shared site.

better modeling for how “non-synchronous” generating facilities like wind solar and storage will actually perform when they connect to the grid.

“They’re definitely both steps in the right direction” said Roberts the Sierra Club attorney. “It’s really important for FERC to set a baseline for transmission and interconnection that will work better for consumers. “",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlY2xpbWF0ZW5ld3Mub3JnL25ld3MvMjUwOTIwMjIvZXh4b24taG91c3Rvbi1zaGlwLWNoYW5uZWwtY2FyYm9uLWNhcHR1cmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exxon's Long-Shot Embrace of Carbon Capture in the Houston Area Just Got Massive Support from Congress,"Pipe Dreams: Sixth in a continuing series on whether capturing carbon is a climate solution or a dangerous distraction.

Imagine a clean energy future and you might picture giant turbines twisting in the wind or electric vehicles zipping quietly down the highway. Fossil fuels become relics or disappear altogether.

ExxonMobil has a different vision. In this story of the future oil refineries continue to distill crude. Fossil fuel-burning power plants churn away too.

Oil and gas aren’t the problem Exxon chief executive Darren Woods has said. The problem is their carbon pollution. So last year Exxon proposed a herculean industrial effort for the Houston area that would allow the region’s fossil fuel infrastructure to continue operating at full throttle for decades while steadily lowering its climate emissions.

Using a technology called carbon capture and storage Exxon said it could collect 50 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually from industrial smokestacks by 2030 and double that amount by 2040. The company would then compress the gas and deliver it through hundreds of miles of new pipelines to injection wells drilled beneath the Gulf of Mexico where the climate-warming gas would remain locked away forever in porous rock.

Exxon is proposing to create an entirely new industry built to capture carbon and reinject it all so that energy companies can keep on pumping and burning oil and gas. The $100 billion mega-project would tie together dozens of facilities owned by 12 of the world’s biggest corporate polluters including oil majors like Chevron power generators like Calpine and chemical giants like Dow. It would also require substantial government financing Exxon said.

Exxon and others have already made strides in securing this support. Since the company released its proposal Congress has given the Energy Department $20 billion to spend on carbon capture and clean hydrogen projects and authorized another $250 billion in loan guarantees for these and other emissions-cutting technologies. Lawmakers also increased the value of a carbon-capture tax incentive such that if Exxon and its partners meet their 2030 goals for Houston they would stand to reap more than $4 billion every year from taxpayers for up to 12 years. The prospect of these multibillion-dollar government handouts has riled many climate advocates.

“Paying them to do this is paying a ransom on the planet” said Corey Williams who until recently served as the research and policy director at Air Alliance Houston an environmental advocacy group.

“We’re not penalizing them we’re considering paying them” he added. “That to me couldn’t be more backwards.”

Many analysts and environmental advocates received Exxon’s announcement with skepticism. Some critics see the company’s commitment to carbon capture as a form of greenwashing a disingenuous gesture toward lowering emissions serving as cover for the real investments in oil and gas. Exxon’s only publicly announced investment in carbon capture this year has been a $400 million expansion of an operation in Wyoming compared with a projected $22.5 billion in total capital expenditures. The company has also said it expects to sell even more oil and gas five years from now than it does today.

Even if the world’s current capacity for capturing carbon were increased by a factor of 10 it would equal only 1 percent of global CO2 emissions. What’s more over the last several decades only a few dozen carbon capture operations have been built and collectively they capture far less CO2 than what Exxon said it could achieve over just eight years. Nearly every attempt to build these types of projects has hit delays failed to reach targets or simply never been completed.

The Houston region is home to one of the greatest concentrations of heavy polluters in the country but most of the emissions come from refineries and power plants which are among the most expensive applications for carbon capture technology. Every project needed for the Houston hub as the proposal is known would need to be unprecedented in nature and scale.

Exxon Chevron and others have proposed some of the first projects that could begin to make up the hub but they have yet to publicly commit anything beyond small initial investments despite raking in what could be record profits this year: Exxon earned $17.9 billion from just April through June.

Williams and other community advocates also worry that the carbon capture projects if built would do little or nothing to limit the release of cancer-causing air pollutants like benzene and heavy metals that spew from the refineries and petrochemical plants into surrounding neighborhoods. The people who live in these neighborhoods are predominantly Latino and the air they breathe is some of the dirtiest in the nation.

The hub might not deliver the climate benefits Exxon claims either. The carbon capture equipment would require vast quantities of power. Even if that electricity were generated by emissions-free sources many advocates and experts argue it would be more effective to simply send that power into the grid and displace fossil fuels altogether rather than run carbon capture operations.

Many of the Houston projects would involve converting natural gas into hydrogen a clean-burning fuel while capturing the associated CO2. But research indicates that upstream methane leaks in natural gas systems which remain widespread can reduce or negate the climate benefits of using the fuel to make hydrogen.

In short many experts say Exxon’s vision is an extreme long-shot—some would say bad-faith—proposal for the largest-ever deployment of a technology that has failed to prove itself at scale despite billions of dollars of public subsidies and private investments and decades of effort.

Still many policy experts have come to believe that some amount of carbon capture will be needed to meet climate targets and the Biden administration has made the technology a key part of its climate policies. So the Houston hub perhaps the biggest and boldest plan to capture carbon from smokestacks is drawing significant attention from major corporations and the federal government.

The hub inched closer to reality last month when Congress passed a major climate and tax bill that includes the substantial expansion of a federal carbon capture tax credit. The change could push many of the proposals including one announced this year by Exxon for its Baytown refinery across the economic threshold of profitability. Some academic modelers are now projecting a 13-fold increase in carbon capture by the end of the decade because of this tax credit expansion.

Oil and gas executives reacted to the bill’s passage with “wild enthusiasm” said Charles McConnell energy officer and director at the University of Houston’s Center for Carbon Management and Energy Sustainability who is serving as an academic adviser to Exxon and the other companies pursuing the hub. “To say any more would probably be more than I care to share.”

This lucrative incentive comes on top of the billions of dollars that last year’s infrastructure bill sent to the Department of Energy to help build carbon capture projects and clean hydrogen hubs. And when that money begins flowing next year a good portion is widely expected to land in Houston.

More Money for Carbon Capture Than Ever Before

Early last year Exxon’s top executives were in the uncomfortable position of playing defense. An upstart hedge fund had launched a campaign to replace several of the oil company’s directors trying to convince shareholders that fresh blood was needed to reposition Exxon’s business to address climate change. The hedge fund presented data about an inevitable transition away from fossil fuels and how Exxon’s investments were failing to anticipate that trend. The shareholder vote was scheduled for late May. A few weeks before the critical vote Exxon’s management floated a counter-narrative about its bright future that revolved around the Houston hub.

On the day the company announced the proposal Woods and Joe Blommaert who was then chief of Exxon’s low carbon business wrote a column for The Wall Street Journal arguing that the Houston hub would help the nation meet its climate targets and serve as a model for the world. As the central pillar of Exxon’s low-carbon strategy it would build on the company’s expertise “managing hydrocarbon molecules” as executives like to say rather than attempting to enter entirely new businesses like wind or solar energy.

“Based on Energy Department numbers we estimate there is adequate capacity along the Gulf Coast to store around 500 billion metric tons of CO2” they wrote. Tens of thousands of new jobs would be created in the process they said and thousands of existing jobs would be preserved.

The success of their proposal however was contingent on government funding. And Exxon executives and lobbyists had already been working to line up support from public officials.

The week before the announcement Woods had presented the hub proposal to Houston’s mayor Sylvester Turner in a phone call according to emails obtained in a public records request. The day after Exxon went public with the carbon capture plan Turner followed with his own press release praising the effort as “the type of bold ambition and investment we will need to meet our climate goals.”

Within weeks the commissioners of Harris County home to Exxon’s Baytown refinery and many of the industrial facilities along the Houston Ship Channel passed a resolution in support of the company and the proposal too.

Exxon’s shareholders nevertheless voted to replace three corporate directors in May. But the vote did not change the company’s pursuit of the Houston hub.

Most of the financing Exxon needed from government would come at the federal level where its lobbyists began discussing the Houston proposal with members of Congress and agencies last spring according to lobbying disclosures. One Exxon lobbyist pitched the hub to officials at the Department of Labor according to emails obtained in a records request claiming it would create “tens of thousands of new jobs.”

In May of last year Woods met with Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and discussed the company’s efforts on carbon capture and storage. To build the hub Exxon would need the department to expand or amend its loan programs according to a presentation given to state regulators last year by Erik Oswald vice president of strategy and advocacy at Exxon’s low-carbon business.

Charisma Troiano an Energy Department spokeswoman declined to elaborate on what was discussed at the meeting with Exxon saying only that “the department and the secretary meet with a lot of companies interested in carbon capture given the recognition that it is needed to reach President Biden’s net zero by 2050 goals.”

After a lobbying blitz from Exxon and many others Congress soon allocated more money to carbon capture and storage than any government anywhere has to date and much of it closely matched what Oswald said his company needed for the Houston hub. The infrastructure bill that passed last year for example created a new Energy Department program that will provide $2.1 billion in loans and grants for building carbon dioxide pipelines and authorized billions more for clean hydrogen and carbon capture demonstration projects. The bill also directed the Interior Department to issue regulations within a year that would open offshore areas to CO2 storage another step Exxon needed. Days after the bill was signed the company secured the mineral rights beneath a swath of federal waters off Houston that align closely with where Exxon has said it would inject the hub’s CO2.

Last month the climate legislation passed by Congress included a significant expansion of a carbon capture tax credit as well as a new clean hydrogen production tax credit. While the new value of the carbon capture credit isn’t as high as what Exxon has sought—$100 per metric ton—it comes close increasing the value by about 70 percent to $85 for every metric ton of CO2 captured and stored underground. That places the value not coincidentally just above the estimated cost of applying carbon capture to hydrogen production and close to the cost for several other applications.

This tax credit change is likely the most important subsidy of all for the Houston hub: 50 million metric tons of carbon dioxide could work out to more than $4 billion annually. Companies have until 2033 to begin construction to qualify for the credit and are eligible to receive it for 12 years.

The bill also authorized the Energy Department to offer $250 billion in loan guarantees for projects that would help energy facilities “avoid reduce utilize or sequester air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases.” This closely matched a request in Oswald’s presentation last year. Of the eight items he listed as “what’s needed” from government the infrastructure and climate bills delivered all or part of six.

In March of this year while the climate bill’s fate was uncertain Exxon announced the first proposal for the hub a plan to make hydrogen with natural gas while capturing the process’s emissions at its Baytown refinery complex. Chevron soon followed with its own proposal a CO2 storage project in state waters off the Gulf Coast. Two weeks later BP and Linde a chemical company that is among the 12 supporting corporations said they would team up to produce low-carbon hydrogen and “support the storage of carbon dioxide captured from other industrial facilities—paving the way for large-scale decarbonization of the Texas Gulf Coast industrial corridor.”

Exxon declined to make anyone available for an interview but spokesman Todd Spitler emailed a statement that pointed to several carbon capture proposals the company has announced around the world most of which are in the early planning stages as evidence of its intentions to deploy the technology.

Earlier this year Woods spoke directly of the company’s carbon capture efforts at a major oil industry conference in Houston.

“It’s not unlike the things that our industry has done and our company in particular has done as we move around the world is building some of these industries grassroots from scratch” he said. “We’ve got an opportunity to essentially build a new business here from scratch working with the government and with industry.”

‘If You Can’t Do it Here’

Buffalo Bayou was once a swampy mosquito-infested creek that seeped through Houston to Galveston Bay. Its shallow waters couldn’t accommodate oceangoing vessels so local leaders aiming to build a true inland port embarked on a series of projects beginning in the late 19th century to dredge and widen the waterway.

Today the Houston Ship Channel is lined by a nearly unbroken 20-mile stretch of refineries storage tanks and petrochemical plants. They comprise all the industrial pieces needed to convert hydrocarbons into the fuels fertilizers and plastics that feed the modern economy. Their smokestacks and flares form an industrial skyline of white plumes and orange flames belching greenhouse gases into the thick Gulf Coast air and toxic pollution into residential neighborhoods. Depending on the wind their stench can hang heavy above the houses carrying a foul smell of sulfur and crude even a hops-like tang.

Exxon’s Baytown refinery and petrochemical complex is the largest of these sprawling over 3400 acres four times the size of Manhattan’s Central Park. It is one of the country’s biggest sources of carbon dioxide pollution pumping out more than 11 million metric tons in 2020 the last year for which data is available according to figures reported to the Environmental Protection Agency.

This concentration of polluting industry happens to sit next to some of the best geology for storing carbon dioxide underground: Formations beneath the Gulf of Mexico could hold more than 100 billion tons of CO2 according to one study. Add in the fact that the companies already hold many pipeline rights of way and enjoy the permissive oversight of Texas regulators and you have what many experts say is the ideal place to build a major carbon capture hub.

“If you can’t do it here commercially you can’t do it anywhere” said McConnell of the University of Houston who has been advising Exxon and the other hub companies. McConnell led the Energy Department’s Office of Fossil Energy from 2011 to 2013 and he said his experience there is not lost on the companies as they seek federal funding. The United States and the world remain far off track for the larger goal of zeroing out greenhouse gas emissions by midcentury. Many experts have charted pathways for achieving zero emissions within the power sector by building massive amounts of renewable energy and light-duty transportation through electrification. But billions of tons of carbon pollution are emitted every year by the manufacturing of iron steel cement chemicals and many other products central to society. These sectors account for roughly one-sixth of global CO2 pollution and currently carbon capture and storage is one of the few tools for reducing them. “It’s not an option” McConnell said. “It’s a requirement.”

Some supporters of the technology also argue that applying carbon capture to a select number of fossil-fueled power plants could make the electric grid much more efficient and reliable than if it depended entirely on renewable sources. Because wind and solar power are intermittent an all-renewable grid would require building tremendous capacity to meet peak demand far more than what might be needed most of the time. There are substantial hurdles to building so much renewable energy production including opposition from communities where it would be sited and backlogs in permitting.

One of the people who makes this argument is Brad Crabtree who is now the Energy Department’s assistant secretary for fossil energy and carbon management the position McConnell once held.

“When you retrofit for example a power plant with carbon capture it has a special value in the broader decarbonized grid that often doesn’t get fully recognized” Crabtree said. “It can result in efficiencies elsewhere” driving down costs system-wide he added.

Before he joined the Biden administration Crabtree was the director of the Carbon Capture Coalition a collection of energy companies unions and environmental groups that advocates supportive policies. Now he is overseeing billions of dollars in federal funds created by those policies to help build demonstration plants pipelines and storage sites much of which could be done by coalition members.

McConnell said the Houston companies are serious about building the hub and have developed rigorous plans for doing so. “These guys know what they want to do” he said.

Substantial hurdles to developing a major hub remain including uncertainty about long-term liability associated with storing CO2 underground and securing the permits and investments needed to build pipelines. Still McConnell said the new higher tax-credit value means companies can now start running business modeling for specific projects.

“That’s what’s exciting” he said. “That’s what is going to put the tailwinds into the sail here. I think you’ll see a lot of interesting business developments. They won’t all move forward but it’ll be interesting. This is a big deal.”

Is Carbon Capture Viable?

Carbon capture and storage might be one of the best technologies for reducing emissions from certain polluting industries but there is substantial debate about which sectors those are. And just because it might be needed doesn’t mean it’s viable.

As of last year 27 carbon capture operations were running globally capable of preventing some 37 million metric tons of pollution according to the Global CCS Institute. Four more were under construction and another 102 in various stages of planning. Even if every one of those planned projects were completed all of the world’s carbon capture plants would prevent about 150 million metric tons of pollution annually or less than one-half of 1 percent of global CO2 emissions which amounted to about 36 billion tons last year.

Economics would suggest that the most cost-effective plants will be built first. Policy experts on the other hand want to focus on the most intractable sectors like cement that have few alternatives for cutting emissions. Houston’s industrial polluters by and large do not fit in either category.

Refineries are one of the largest sources of carbon emissions in the Houston region according to EPA data and they are among the most expensive to retrofit with carbon capture technology. They also hold a precarious position in the global transition away from fossil fuels. Declining demand would mean fewer refineries raising the question of why the nation would invest tens of billions of dollars to lower the emissions from facilities that might close soon.

“If we really think about what is the world that we need to make in order to achieve and stay at net-zero emissions within the next couple of decades I don’t really personally see a role for the ongoing dependence on fossil fuels at the kind of intensity that that would indicate” said Emily Grubert an associate professor of sustainable energy policy at Notre Dame who recently completed a year leading the Energy Department’s office of carbon management which conducts research into carbon capture. She added that while some diminishing volumes of oil and gas will likely be needed to produce materials or fuels for decades “for like bulk oil production and refining and transportation fuels in particular we are not going to succeed at decarbonization if that’s still a thing.”

The largest source of emissions around Houston in 2020 were coal- and gas-fired power plants. Grubert and many other experts say that because the costs of wind and solar generation have fallen so rapidly—and with the costs of battery storage now declining too—there is no compelling case for spending billions to retrofit these power plants rather than shutting them down. Building new wind and solar farms is simply cheaper and perhaps more reliable.

Utilities and the federal government have already spent many billions of dollars trying to launch commercial-scale carbon capture power plants. Only one was completed in the United States and it happens to be outside Houston—attached to a coal plant that was the second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the region in 2020 after Exxon’s Baytown refinery.

Five years ago NRG Energy began operating the Petra Nova carbon capture plant with nearly $200 million in Energy Department support and more in local tax breaks. By some measures the project was a success. It captured more than 90 percent of the carbon dioxide that passed through the system according to an Energy Department report.

But the project was designed to capture only a fraction of the coal plant’s emissions and according to the report it failed to reach its overall capture target because of numerous problems that arose including equipment outages and difficulties delivering the gas to its ultimate destination a nearby oil field. Ironically the project’s finances depended on using the captured CO2 to squeeze oil out of the ground and generate cash from the sales which helps explain Petra Nova’s largest failure.

In 2020 as oil prices crashed the project ceased capturing any carbon emissions. It hasn’t restarted since.

‘I Don’t Really Feel Like it’s Solving the Problem’

The Ship Channel has spawned an almost entirely industrial landscape. But just past the fence lines in many cases are the homes and schools of the area’s mostly Latino residents.

Valero’s Houston refinery for example borders two sides of the Manchester neighborhood. About 200 yards from the gate are a playground and community center. On the wall is a mural showing smiling children playing below industrial stacks topped with bright orange flames like a dystopian dream. One of the goals of the Houston hub effort is to keep refineries like Valero’s operating for decades albeit with new emissions-capturing equipment.

“With carbon capture I don’t really feel like it’s solving the problem” said Leticia Gutierrez the director of government relations and community outreach at Air Alliance Houston which campaigns for cleaning up the area’s air pollution.

To start capturing 50 million metric tons which is about one-third of the region’s industrial emissions might not deliver the climate benefits it would appear to.

Many of the projects including Exxon’s Baytown proposal and that of BP and Linde would convert natural gas into hydrogen while capturing CO2 emissions. The clean-burning hydrogen could replace natural gas used at the refineries and might fuel ships or heavy-duty trucks. Exxon has said the Baytown project could reduce the refinery’s emissions by “up to 30 percent” or about 3 million metric tons per year while also selling hydrogen to help others lower their emissions.

But academic research has shown that any benefits achieved by capturing CO2 can be offset by leaks of natural gas which consist primarily of methane a far more potent greenhouse gas. Even if these projects reduced carbon dioxide emissions they could increase methane emissions negating the larger goal.

Carbon capture equipment is also extremely energy-intensive. One utility in Wyoming for example said in regulatory filings that operating equipment at coal plants there would consume more than one-third of the plants’ electrical output a phenomenon known as “parasitic load.”

For the Petra Nova operation near Houston the company built a new natural gas turbine to power the carbon capture system which required nearly 15 percent as much electricity as was generated by the coal unit it was attached to. That natural gas turbine also sent its own carbon dioxide and all its other emissions straight into the air.

This power consumption raises one of the core arguments against the technology: If you power carbon capture systems with fossil fuels you generate additional pollution. If you power the systems with renewable energy you consume precious clean power that could be put to other uses. Either way you are effectively driving emissions higher at least somewhat in an elaborate attempt to reduce them. This hardly seems efficient.

For the people who live close to the industrial development however carbon dioxide is not the most important pollutant. The region’s refineries and chemical plants spew toxic chemicals like benzene which drive cancer risks far higher for workers and nearby residents. According to an analysis last year by ProPublica the greater Houston region has “the third-biggest hot spot of cancer-causing air in the country.”

Gutierrez grew up nearby and still lives in the area where she has raised three children. Her son developed asthma when he was a child she said and she found that his symptoms would clear when they would visit family in Mexico in the mountains outside Monterrey.

Gutierrez herself has developed headaches and rashes of which her family has no history she said. The companies have said the hub’s use of carbon capture and hydrogen fuel could reduce some air pollutants from the area’s power plants and trucks such as soot and sulfur oxides but it is unclear how it would reduce the emissions of toxic pollutants.

Exxon declined to answer detailed questions about the projects.

“People sometimes ask me why I don’t move” Gutierrez said while giving a tour of the area earlier this year. She stays because she loves her house she tells them and her community. Anyway she said she couldn’t afford to buy anything similar on Houston’s westside where the air is cleaner.

Few if any residents have heard of the hub proposal Gutierrez and other community advocates say but people in the communities around the Ship Channel are skeptical of any plan presented by Exxon or other corporations to clean up the industry. It is unclear whether they would welcome it. One thing for sure is that the companies haven’t come to ask.

It’s a surprising finding considering the bike was originally designed for hunters campers and other outdoor enthusiasts that wanted a powerful but (relatively) lightweight electric two-wheeler.

The bike was inspired by the classic Honda Motra itself a popular recreational mini-bike from the 1980s.

Far from a heavyweight electric adventure bike the 145-pound (65 kg) Huck Overland is a smaller and more nimble ride. It comes with a 3 kW nominal and 6 kW peak-rated motor and carries a 3 kWh battery rated for 40 miles (64 km) of range.

As founder and CEO Brett McCoy explained to Electrek it’s not just hunters and fisherman that have taken to the Overland:

I’ve been shocked at how many people in larger cities like NYC LA and Miami have jumped on this model as a daily commuter. Apparently the rugged Mad Max look is in for city riders too.

Huck Overland

Like Huck Cycles’ other models the Overland is street legal and comes with a VIN and manufacturer’s certificate of origin. That’s one of the advantages of handling manufacturing locally in North Carolina starting from welding up the bare frames and handling every step of the assembly. As the manufacturer Huck Cycles can ensure regulatory compliance.

Not everyone will need to register the bikes as they have a speed-limited “moped mode” that lets them classify as a 49cc scooter or moped in many states. In other states a motorcycle endorsement may be required and the bikes may need to be registered as motorcycles. In that case unlocking the higher-speed capability lets riders make the most out of the bikes after registering them as full motorcycles.

It’s a move we’ve seen other companies like ONYX explore as well making it easy for riders to stay legal and operate their bikes responsibly within the confines of varying state laws.

With multiple speed modes Huck’s bikes can hit speeds of “45+ mph” with that plus sign likely doing some heavy lifting. Owners have reported exceeding that 45 mph figure with room to spare.

As urban rides these approximately $5800 machines offer a legal upgrade over 28 mph electric bicycles without entering full heavyweight electric motorcycle territory. They’re essentially a re-imagination of the 1970s heyday of 50cc mopeds.

Huck Cycles uses local North Carolina manufacturing to build its electric mopeds.

As popular as the Overland has proven for city riders the Huck Rebel remains the company’s best seller after debuting several years ago.

With a more traditional moped design it uses a top-tank style frame with the contents of the “tank” being replaced by a 3 kWh battery. The more recognizable styling is likely better suited for riders that aren’t seeking out that Mad Max vibe offered by the Overland.

The $5400 Rebel actually has footpegs instead of pedals meaning many of my more pedantic readers will be blowing up my comments section soon to chastise me about misusing the “ped” part of the word “moped.”

As it happens most states have moped laws that include what we sometimes call “nopeds” or bikes like these that are moped-sized but feature pegs instead of pedals. And thus the word moped has grown and evolved over time now largely used for a class of vehicles between heavyweight e-bikes and lightweight electric motorcycles with or without pedals.

Whatever you call them Huck’s electric two-wheelers certainly capture the classic moped charm while applying a 21st-century twist.

But for those that want something a bit bigger the Huck Stinger pushes the brand into light electric motorcycle territory with a larger and more capable bike.

Expected to be priced in the $6500 to $9500 range depending on the loadout the Huck Stinger will be arriving in Q4 of this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMjQvdmVybW9udC1uZXctbWV4aWNvLWNhbGlmb3JuaWEtdXMtc3RhdGVzLXdpdGgtbGVhc3QtYWlyLXBvbGx1dGlvbi5odG1s0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjIvMDkvMjQvdmVybW9udC1uZXctbWV4aWNvLWNhbGlmb3JuaWEtdXMtc3RhdGVzLXdpdGgtbGVhc3QtYWlyLXBvbGx1dGlvbi5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These 7 states have the least air pollution in the U.S.,"Breathing cleaner air is vital to your long-term health: It's essential for healthy lungs improves cognitive function and can even make you happier.

The Natural Resources Defense Council also says cleaner air helps avoid an estimated 370000 premature deaths in the U.S. each year and leads to 189000 fewer hospital admissions for cardiac and respiratory illnesses such as heart diseases asthma or pneumonia.

In short you can expect numerous benefits from living in an area with clean air. That's good news for residents of several states according to a new U.S. News and World Report analysis which ranked all 50 states according to how polluted they are and the risk that pollution poses to their population's health.

The ranking is based on 2019 data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency which measured the total toxic chemical pollution generated in each state and the risks of long-term chronic health effects — such as cancer and birth defects — posed to each state's population per capita.

Those measurements accounted for air and water emissions from manufacturing electric power generation mining and hazardous waste treatment according to the U.S. News and World Report. They didn't account for pollution from transportation agriculture or small facilities like dry cleaners and auto body shops.

Here are the seven least polluted states according to the ranking:

Vermont New Hampshire South Dakota New Mexico Wyoming California Rhode Island

Vermont comes in first as the least polluted state in the nation a fitting title for ""The Green Mountain State"" that is known for its pristine natural attractions. That ranking is consistent with other 2022 analyses: The American Lung Association (ALA) says Vermont's cities are among the cleanest by air quality in the country and have low levels of the most harmful and widespread types of air pollution.

The state's Burlington-South metro area in particular is one of only two U.S. cities that rank as the cleanest for the worst types of air pollution which include particle pollution and ozone air pollution.

New Hampshire's status as the second-least polluted state may come as somewhat of a surprise. In 2022 the ALA said the state's air quality got ""mixed grades."" Overall New Hampshire showed improvement in the ozone air pollution category but three counties experienced higher long-term particle pollution — which is deadly — compared to the previous year according to the ALA.

Another surprise is California's high ranking considering that many of its cities rank among the country's most polluted according to the ALA. California may have more stringent emission standards than most states but factors like wildfires and drought have been found to worsen the state's air quality.

What's not surprising is the state ranked as the most polluted in the U.S.: Louisiana. Several pieces of research point to the state's poor air quality. For instance a 2020 analysis by the Environmental Integrity Project found that Louisiana is home to four of the top ten ""super polluter"" chemical plants in the U.S. A 2019 ProPublica investigation also found that the number of plants in Louisiana with high emissions has actually increased since the 1980s despite the overall number decreasing nationally.

""Since the filing of this lawsuit my firm has been inundated with calls from former and current Amex employees from all around the country who read the allegations of the complaint and couldn't believe how accurately they described their own experiences with the company"" attorney David Pivtorak told FOX Business.

On Aug. 23 Pivtorak filed a class action on behalf of former Amex employee Brian Netzel and potentially thousands of other similarly situated employees following what the complaint described as ""an avalanche of bad things coming to White people in that company once George Floyd was killed.""

The lawsuit alleges that Amex implemented ""anti-racism"" policies throughout its corporate structure in the wake of Floyd's death that ""gave preferential treatment to individuals for being Black and unambiguously signaled to White employees that their race was an impediment to getting ahead in the company.""

AMERICAN EXPRESS SLAPPED WITH LAWSUIT ALLEGING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WHITE EMPLOYEES

In an amended complaint three new class representative plaintiffs allege discrimination similar to that which Netzel described.

Netzel told FOX Business at the time his complaint was filed that Amex's racial policies flooded the workplace with ""a tremendous amount of animosity."" He alleged White employees were unfairly punished or passed over for promotions while some Black employees were promoted merely to meet racial quotas and that some felt empowered to ""root out in McCarthy-era fashion people who didn't agree with this overall philosophy.""

Stocks In This Article: AXP $242.30 1.32%

In his original complaint Netzel alleged that his female manager who is Black would ""aggressively harass and berate White employees"" and that Amex was not only aware of her behavior but provided financial incentives to executives to reduce the number of White employees.

One of the new plaintiffs who resides in a different city than the original plaintiff claims to have been subjected to racial harassment and discrimination from that same manager. Another alleges to have been harassed and denied a promotion on racial grounds by a different manager. All three of the new plaintiffs say they were forced to resign from well-paying positions in the company to escape its racially toxic environment.

EX-AMERICAN EXPRESS EMPLOYEE SPEAKS OUT ON ‘WOKE’ CORPORATE AMERICA: ‘SHAME ON YOU’

""It's hard to put into words how racially toxic that working environment must have been from top to bottom where you can just hear it in these people's voices. I only hope that more employees come forward to challenge these abhorrent practices because that is how we will finally bring the wrongdoers to justice"" attorney Pivtorak said.

Amex did not provide comment on the amended complaint but denied the claims of the original suit with a spokesperson telling FOX Business at the time: ""The allegations made about our company in the lawsuit are false and without merit. We have a longstanding commitment to living our company values which include fostering a diverse and inclusive culture where all colleagues can thrive.""

""Advancement hiring and compensation within our company is based solely on individual qualifications business and leadership performance. Any claim to the contrary is wrong and we do not provide any incentive for behaviors that discriminate against or favor any group of employees"" the spokesperson added.

Amex has faced previous allegations of discrimination. Nick Williams a White male who served eight years as a manager of business development at Amex until he was suddenly let go in March 2021 turned down a six-figure settlement offer after refusing to sign paperwork forbidding him from speaking out against the credit card behemoth.

Not sure where to start? Read our guide to Amex transfer partners!

We saw a very similar transfer bonus bonanza from Amex this time last year. Typically these transfer bonus promotions are available to just one or two partner programs at a time. To have 12 ongoing transfer bonuses at once is unbelievable.

Transferring your miles is key to getting the most value and these transfer bonus promotions make that case even stronger – it's like getting free airline miles or hotel points. Transferring to an Amex airline partner during one of these bonus periods is one of the absolute best ways to use Amex Membership Rewards points.

How to Put These Bonuses to Use

It's never a wise move to transfer points without a points redemption in mind as these transfers are a one-way street: Once you send your points to a partner airline or hotel you can't get them back to your Amex account.

But with this many transfer bonuses available there are some truly great redemptions on the table. On most of these airlines you can book travel as far out as August 2023 which means you can capitalize on a bonus for a future trip.

Here are just a few options that come to mind:

Virgin Atlantic offers one of the cheapest ways to book Delta One Suites to Europe for 50000 miles each way. With a 30% transfer bonus you'd need just 39000 points to do it.

You could also book roundtrip flights to Tokyo in ANA First Class through Virgin Atlantic. It's one of the best deals in the world of points and miles and this transfer bonus makes it even better. With a 30% transfer bonus you'd need only 85000 points to make it happen.

Believe it or not British Airways has one of the cheapest ways to get to Hawaii. You can fly American Airlines from the West Coast to all four major Hawaiian islands for just 26000 Avios roundtrip. Factor in this 25% transfer bonus and you'd need just 21000 points to make it happen.

Bottom Line

This is an incredible offer for your Amex points. Whether you're planning a trip to Europe Hawaii or anywhere in between there's a way to get even more value out of your miles.

But make your plans fast as almost all of these transfer bonuses run only though Friday Sept. 30 which gives you just a few more hours to take advantage.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzI0L3doZW4tZ2lhbnRzLWVudGVyLWNvbnN1bWVyLWZpbmFuY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Apple and Goldman Sachs are faring in consumer finance,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2022/09/24/when-giants-enter-consumer-finance on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzI0L3doZW4tZ2lhbnRzLWVudGVyLWNvbnN1bWVyLWZpbmFuY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3JhbXNleXF1YmVpbi8yMDIyLzA5LzI0L2J1c2luZXNzLWNsYXNzLXNlYXRzLXdpdGgtZG9vcnMtYW5kLW5ldy1haXJwb3J0LWxvdW5nZXMtbGF0ZXN0LWFpcmxpbmUtbmV3cy1mb3ItZmFsbC0yMDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Business Class Seats With Doors And New Airport Lounges: Latest Airline News For Fall 2022,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.forbes.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /sites/ramseyqubein/2022/09/24/business-class-seats-with-doors-and-new-airport-lounges-latest-airline-news-for-fall-2022/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002674099B6A0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3JhbXNleXF1YmVpbi8yMDIyLzA5LzI0L2J1c2luZXNzLWNsYXNzLXNlYXRzLXdpdGgtZG9vcnMtYW5kLW5ldy1haXJwb3J0LWxvdW5nZXMtbGF0ZXN0LWFpcmxpbmUtbmV3cy1mb3ItZmFsbC0yMDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiwgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcmVzcy5ibXdncm91cC5jb20vZ2xvYmFsL2FydGljbGUvZGV0YWlsL1QwNDA0MDM5RU4vd29ybGQtcmVjb3JkLWluLXRoZS1tZW4tcy1ldmVudC1jb3Vyc2UtcmVjb3JkLWluLXRoZS13b21lbi1zLXJhY2UtYW5kLTQ1LTAwMC1jaGFtcGlvbnMtYXQtdGhlLWJtdy1iZXJsaW4tbWFyYXRob24tMjAyMj9sYW5ndWFnZT1lbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,World record in the men's event course record in the women's race and 45000 champions at the BMW BERLIN ...,"+++ Eliud Kipchoge (KEN) runs the marathon in 2:01:09 hours to post a world record +++ 2:15:37 for Tigist Assefa (ETH) significantly improves the course record +++ 45000 athletes competing in the capital city +++



Berlin. The 48th BMW BERLIN-MARATHON proved to be one for the history books. Ideal conditions saw remarkable records set in the women’s and men’s events. The winners were all the 45000 athletes who completed the 42-kilometre distance encouraged and cheered on by countless fans along the route.

“Congratulations to all the athletes who mastered the BMW BERLIN-MARATHON 2022 and produced an outstanding sporting performance” said Stefan Teuchert Head of BMW Group Germany. “The BMW Group is title partner for the 11th time and is proud to be contributing to the success of this special event in the capital city which brings together so many people from all around the world. We would like to express our gratitude to everyone whose passionate involvement makes the BMW BERLIN-MARATHON such a unique event: our partner SCC EVENTS the 7500 volunteers and all the fans along the route.”

From the word go 37-year-old Kipchoge left no-one in any doubt that he is in great form and has his sights firmly set on his personal best which is also the world record. The two-time Olympic champion completed the first half of the race in under an hour. He was unable to maintain this speed all the way to the finish line but the timer on the BMW i4 pace car stopped at 2:01:09 hours – exactly half a minute quicker than Kipchoge’s previous world record time at the BMW BERLIN-MARATHON 2018. The Kenyan runner has now triumphed four times in Berlin and shares the title of record winner with Ethiopia’s Haile Gebrselassie.

“The fans along the route in Berlin are the best it was wonderful to be running here again. Of course I am overjoyed with my time – and very pleased with my preparations and my team as I would never have managed it without them” said Kipchoge who had another message to send: “Let’s all keep running. Together there is nothing we cannot achieve.”

The performance given by Ethopia’s Tigist Assefa was no less impressive. The 28-year-old had started the race as an outsider with a personal best of 2:34:01 before running the race of her life to win in 2:15:37 hours. This result pulverised the previous course record (2:18:11 Gladys Cherono KEN) and was the third-fastest time ever run by a woman in the marathon.

Assefa was followed by Rosemary Wanjiru (KEN) and Tigist Abayechew (ETH) in second and third places while the men's podium was completed by Mark Korir (KEN) and Tadu Abate (ETH). The best German runner in the men's event was Haftom Weldey (2:09:06) who crossed the line in eleventh place while the fastest German woman was Florentine Beese (2:46:07).

In the women’s handbike event there was a German top-three lock-out to celebrate. Katrin Möller triumphed ahead of Yvonne Pijahn and Annett Zenker-Urban. Victory in the men’s event went to France’s Joseph Fritsch. Vico Merklein and Johannes Herter from Germany crossed the line in second and third positions.

The fastest man in the wheelchair race was Marcel Hug. The Swiss racer crossed the line ahead of Daniel Romanchuk (USA) and David Weir (GBR). Catherine Debrunner (SUI) won the women’s event with Manuela Schär (SUI) and Susannah Scaroni (USA) completing the podium.

As title partner the BMW Group supported the BMW BERLIN-MARATHON with 55 course and organisational vehicles. These included the fully-electric BMW i4 BMW iX and BMW iX3 (electric power consumption combined: 18.9 – 18.5 kWh/100 km; CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km as per WLTP) cars as well as the BMW CE 04 electric scooter manufactured at the BMW Group Plant Berlin."

The United States team retained the Presidents Cup at Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte North Carolina after surviving a spirited comeback from the International Team winning the golf tournament by 17.5 to 12.5 and securing the Americans’ ninth overall victory in a row.

Xander Schauffele rolled in the decisive putt in his match against Canadian Corey Conners on the 18th hole to clinch the US team’s overall victory sparking scenes of jubilation on the green from Schauffele and other players whose matches had finished.

The Presidents Cup is a biennial competition between Americans and an international team open to players outside the United States and Europe. The US team has now won 12 out of 14 Presidents Cups in history losing only one overall tournament.

US captain Davis Love III sent out two of his heavy hitters Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth in the opening two matches in an effort to prevent International Team momentum building. Spieth delivered for Love as he beat Australian Cam Davis with three holes to spare but Thomas surrendered an early lead to lose on the final hole to South Korean Si Woo Kim.

Patrick Cantlay and Tony Finau added more points to the board for the United States while Colombian Sebastián Muñoz shocked world No.1 Scottie Scheffler to give the International Team an inkling of hope along with Japanese team veteran Hideki Matsuyama’s tied match with Sam Burns.

Much of the build-up to the competition was dominated by how the teams and overall tournament had been affected by players joining the Saudi-backed LIV Golf series and thus being ineligible to compete in this year’s edition.

Eight of the International Team’s 12 players made their Presidents Cup debut this year and six US players were also participating for the first time.

The 2024 Presidents Cup is set to take place at the Royal Montreal Golf Club in Canada from September 24-29 of that year. The same venue hosted the 2007 edition of the competition.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS91cy1sZWFkcy1wcmVzaWRlbnRzLWN1cC1raW0tMTA1NzI4Mjg1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US leads Presidents Cup as Kim gives Internationals a spark,"The day started out with memories of 2017 at Liberty National where the Americans dominated so thoroughly they nearly clinched the Presidents Cup on Saturday.

By the time 20-year-old Tom Kim slammed his cap to the ground in a wild celebration and Cameron Davis finished with three straight birdies for another comeback win all anyone could think about was the 2012 Ryder Cup at Medinah.

The Americans still lead by four. It just felt much closer.

Kim a young talent with a massive personality delivered the first big moment for the International team. He gave his team a spark with a 55-foot eagle putt after driving the 11th green. And on the final hole he made a 10-foot birdie putt in a 1-up victory over Patrick Cantlay and Xander Schauffele.

He took a few steps back as the ball neared the hole dropped his putter and slammed his cap to the ground in a raucous celebration.

“I wanted that putt more than anything in the world” Kim said.

In two matches Saturday Kim and K.H. Lee took out world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler and Sam Burns and he and Si Woo Kim beat the formidable Cantlay-Schauffele tandem.

The International team split the foursomes matches in the morning and won the fourballs session 3-1. It was enough to cut into a big deficit enough to give the underdogs hope.

The Americans sure didn’t sound as though they had a 11-7 lead going into the 12 singles matches — typically their strength — as they go for a ninth straight victory.

“If anything we’ve got to refocus and we’ve got a lot of (ticked) off guys that want to come out really strong tomorrow” Jordan Spieth said.

No one on the American team was at Medinah for the 2012 Ryder Cup except for Davis Love III the captain at both.

The Americans were leading big all week that year until Ian Poulter birdied the last five holes that gave Europe a load of momentum that it carried into Sunday. Trailing 10-6 the Europeans staged the greatest comeback by a visiting team in Ryder Cup history.

“They got some momentum today” Love said. “They started making some putts and we’re going to have to turn around tomorrow and come out hot and try to get the momentum back.”

No one was more reliable than Spieth and Justin Thomas a juggernaut on this mighty U.S. team. They won two matches Saturday without ever seeing the 16th hole except for riding in a car to cheer on teammates.

They became the first American tandem to go 4-0 in team matches since Tiger Woods and Steve Stricker in 2009 at Harding Park.

Thomas figures he had to make only 10 putts over 30 holes in two matches because Spieth was doing so much damage on and around the green. Even on their last hole Saturday afternoon with Thomas in tight for a 5-foot putt that would have won it Spieth chipped in from the front of the green.

“I legitimately think I picked my coin up more than I hit putts” Thomas said. “So yeah my partner’s pretty good.”

At that point the Americans had an 11-4 lead.

On the course Sungjae Im and Sebastian Munoz were up big in match they would win in 16 holes against Tony Finau and Kevin Kisner the only time in 18 matches this week that an International team didn’t trail at any time.

The Americans were ahead in the other two. The rout was on and then it wasn’t.

Schauffele gave his team a 1-up lead with a 40-foot putt from short of the 15th green only for Si Woo Kim to make a 4-foot birdie on the par-5 16th to square the match. Si Woo Kim also made a 5-foot par putt to stay tied on the 17th a putt that had Tom Kim so nervous he covered his eyes and peeked through his fingers.

And then Tom Kim stole the show.

International captain Trevor Immelman noticed Kim some 35 yards behind everyone else in the group 235 yards from the green with a 2-iron in his hand. Behind the 20-year-old Korean was a group of American stars — Thomas Spieth Collin Morikawa all major champions — also watching. What a stage.

“And this kid pures a 2-iron to 10 feet and makes the putt” Immelman said. “To me that’s impressive stuff.”

Not to be overlooked was Davis a bright spot on the International team and one of eight rookies for Immelman because of some four players who gave up the Presidents Cup for Saudi-funded LIV Golf.

The match was tight but Burns and Billy Horschel never led by more than 1 hole. Davis holed a 12-foot eagle putt on the 16th to square the match. On the next hole Davis drilled a 15-foot birdie putt for the first lead of the match.

Davis and Scott each had about 10 feet for birdie on the final hole and Burns hit his approach to 4 feet for what looked to be a certain birdie. Davis made a third straight birdie another point for the International team more momentum for Sunday.

“I kind of went numb to be honest” Davis said. “I was in a situation where I was going for it. But I just got in a groove that made golf feel easy for once.”

The foundation kicked off its 21st annual 5K Run and Walk in New York City on Sunday Sept. 25 2022 to honor our nation’s fallen first responders for their great sacrifice and dedication.

This year’s event founded in honor of all of the lives lost on Sept. 11 2001 also spotlighted the 13 military men and women who were killed during America's withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021.

Tunnel to Towers chairman and CEO Frank Siller originally modeled the run after the route his fallen brother firefighter Stephen Siller took through the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel to Ground Zero on the morning of 9/11.

Now tens of thousands of participants show up every year to join in the remembrance of Stephen Siller and other brave first responders who lost their lives in service to others.

In an interview with Fox News Digital Siller noted the event’s ""incredible"" growth over the past 21 years ever since it began in 2002 with nearly 1000 runners.

This year the event welcomed at least 35000 people — and closed out with a performance by country music star Dierks Bentley.

Siller believes the event has become so popular because of the unique route of the run — and the thousands of families who continue to memorialize their own loved ones.

""It is so patriotic"" he said.

""I don't think anything is more beautiful"" he added.

Despite the passage of years Siller said the nation continues to recall the heroism of first responders on 9/11 — while events like the one on Sunday continue to honor the sacrifices of so many Americans.

""The Tunnel to Towers Foundation will not rest"" he said. ""We only get bigger and bigger every year.""

""We have thousands more people [who] joined us this year than on the 20th year which gives me great encouragement and great enthusiasm — and it inspires me and everyone involved with us to work even harder.""

Participants who celebrated in Lower Manhattan post-run shared with Fox News Digital their similar feelings of pride and unity.

""It’s just a day when it doesn’t really matter what you are"" Hofstra University lacrosse player Teigue Norman said post-race.

""We all just come together for a better cause.""

Fourteen-year-old Jordan Pieszchata of New Jersey reflected on how 9/11 first responders ""never stopped"" when they were called into action — a message she wanted to share with other runners on Sunday.

""Don’t stop"" she said after completing the run.

""Never give up. They didn’t give up — nor should you.""

Running trio Brian Spahn of Chicago Logan Welge of St. Louis and Matt Muliadi of Indonesia teamed up to take on the run with plenty of pride.

""This is really special and a great event to remember the people involved"" Welge said.

""[First responders] are cheering you on the whole time but they’re the ones we should be cheering for"" he added.

""We’re just a couple of Midwest kids here to support New York"" Spahn said.

""We’ve got to keep this country strong and stay together — one nation under God.""

Seton Hall University athletes John Luders and Abby Wingo who ran on Team Shamrock agreed that witnessing the participation of other firefighters while honoring those who have fallen is ""really moving.""

""It makes you want to sprint the whole thing"" Wingo said. ""It’s just so much bigger than anybody.""

""No matter what you believe in where you’re from we all come together and do this.""

Two London Fire Brigade firefighters Ben and Kyle traveled all the way from the U.K. to run in the race on Sunday along with 25 others from Paddington Fire Station they said.

""It feels like a great big family"" Kyle said. ""It’s a really great atmosphere.""

""Americans know how to organize a run"" Ben said. ""We’ve got to keep coming every year and raise awareness for what the amazing firefighters in New York do.""

New York City fire riders Greg Fagan Sal Banchitta and club president Jim Finnell — who are responsible for escorting runners through the tunnel every year during the run — said it’s a job they’ll never quit.

Retired U.S. Navy service warfare officer Jim Leahy who said he attends the Tunnel to Towers event every year shared his own patriotism.

""We’re big supporters of the event and the country"" he said. ""God bless America.""

Army veteran Earl Granville who lost his leg serving in Afghanistan in 2008 took on the run while carrying along an American flag.

Granville commented that events like the Tunnel to Towers 5K remind Americans that the first casualties of the War on Terror were 9/11 first responders.

""This is what America’s about"" he said.

""We’re coming together through a tragedy but we should always be together.""

But those flashes show that public anger across the country once only simmering is now boiling.

The demonstrations surrounding the death of Mahsa Amini — and the government crackdown emerging to stifle them — represent just the latest cycle of unrest to grip Iran since its 1979 Islamic Revolution.

It likely won’t be the last as the Islamic Republic lurches between crises at home and abroad. The window through which the wider world can view them will only become more dim as authorities restrict internet access detain journalists and tightly control all levers of the government’s power.

Protests over Amini’s death have spread across at least 46 Iranian cities towns and villages. State TV has suggested that at least 41 protesters and police have been killed since the protests began on Sept. 17. An Associated Press count of official statements by authorities puts the death toll at at least 13 with more than 1200 demonstrators arrested.

But the tightening crackdown doesn’t come as a surprise given Iran’s modern history.

Iran’s theocracy has viewed itself as under threat from the moment the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returned to Tehran in 1979.

Bombings in 1981 blamed on dissidents killed dozens of top officials. One even paralyzed the right arm of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein launched a bloody eight-year war on Iran in which 1 million people were killed.

In Tehran enmity toward the United States began with the American-backed 1953 coup that cemented the shah’s reign. For Washington the 1979 U.S. Embassy hostage crisis stoked hostility toward Iran.

And the mutual distrust continues today. Since the collapse of a deal in 2015 intended to curtail Tehran’s nuclear ambitions Iran has amassed enough highly enriched uranium to produce an atomic bomb if it chose to do so.

The Iranian government has dismissed the latest protests as a foreign plot rather than an expression of public outrage over the death of a woman detained only because her mandatory headscarf or hijab wasn’t to the morality police’s liking.

Pro-government marches in Tehran and other cities echoed the official line with some marchers chanting “American mercenaries are fighting the religion.”

The government’s decision to restrict Instagram LinkedIn and WhatsApp — three of the last Western social media apps working in the country — has limited the ability for protesters to organize and share their videos with the outside world.

Instead only short clips find their way out including those of security forces firing at protesters and women defiantly cutting off their hair and burning their hijabs. Security forces including motorcycle-riding volunteers with Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard have attacked peaceful demonstrators.

There’s also been footage of apparent demonstrators setting fires flipping over police cars and fighting back against riot police.

These scenes are similar to those that occurred in 2019 after the government dropped fuel subsidies prompting demonstrators to set gas stations ablaze and ransack banks. Rights groups say that the unrest across more than 100 cities and towns — and the government crackdown that followed — killed over 300 people and led to thousands of arrests.

Because of the internet restrictions it remains unclear if the latest protests have eclipsed those of 2019. Exiled opposition groups and Iranian hard-liners have both used the short clips online to paint their own pictures of the unrest as the government largely remains silent.

Independent observers such as human rights activists face threats intimidation and arrest in Iran. Text messages from the government to the public warn of criminal charges for joining demonstrations. At least 18 reporters are known to have been arrested so far in the crackdown according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.

Like other rounds of unrest since 2009 when millions took to the streets as part of the so-called Green Movement to protest a disputed presidential election the latest demonstrations appear spontaneous and leaderless.

Even if a government crackdown eventually quells the protests it likely won’t eradicate the deep-seated rage.

Iran’s economy has cratered and Western sanctions have destroyed the savings of a generation. The value of the currency has plummeted from 32000 rials for a dollar in 2015 to 315000 rials for a dollar in 2022. Iranian youth increasingly try to find new livelihoods abroad at whatever cost. Those left behind struggle to make ends meet.

Iranian politics have grown insular and uncompromising. In the 2021 presidential election all serious contenders were disqualified to allow Ebrahim Raisi a protégé of Khamenei to take the presidency in the lowest turnout vote in the Islamic Republic’s history.

The economic challenges and hard-line political positions are only likely to solidify. Even if Iran agreed to a road map to restore the nuclear deal it likely will face new U.S. sanctions over selling so-called suicide drones to Russia to use in its ongoing war in Ukraine.

A battle over leadership could turn Iran’s focus further inward. There is no designated successor for the 83-year-old Khamenei though some analysts suggest his son Mojtaba Khamenei might be considered by clerics to become the next supreme leader.

Meanwhile the Revolutionary Guard which answers only to the supreme leader has grown increasingly powerful — both militarily and economically — during the recent tensions with the West. The U.S. Treasury said the Guard has smuggled “hundreds of millions of dollars” worth of sanctioned oil into the international market.

Both the theocracy and the Guard have financial and political incentive to continue the status quo. And with no other outlets mass protests by the Iranian public seem likely to continue.

ANNs use analog information processing units that collectively interact through interconnected non-linear functions (Supplementary Fig. 1). The fundamental building block of an ANN is a perceptron51 which consists of a linear combination of weighted analog input signals (Supplementary Fig. 2). The analog computation result serves as an input to an activation function that computes the perceptron’s non-linear output behavior with soft and hard classifications. The soft classification is observed by using a sigmoid activation function z \(=\frac{{e}^{y}}{1+{e}^{y}}\); where y is a linear signal and serves as an input to the activation function and the output z is a non-linear analog signal between 0 and 1. The hard classification is observed by using a step activation function; where the output z is a discrete signal receiving only 0 and 1. In considering an adaptation of this model to gene regulatory networks inside individual living cells it is worthwhile to note that biological pathways often operate in a non-linear fashion and exhibit logarithmic and power law input–output relations where outcomes are dictated by relative fold-changes rather than absolute levels285253. Therefore to implement ANNs in living cells we define a log-based version of a perceptron termed the perceptgene (Fig. 1a) whose logarithmic input–output operation makes it more suitable for the non-linear nature of biochemical reactions and gene regulation. The perceptgene implements a logarithmic classifier that asymptotically partitions all input values into two classes of output data points (Fig. 1a right).

Fig. 1: Perceptgene theory and implementation. a The Perceptgene model raises each analog input (x i ) to the power of its corresponding weight (n i ) then multiplies these power-law products to obtain \(y=B\cdot \prod {x}_{i}^{{n}_{i}}\) where B is a bias that shifts y into the desired range and finally computes the output using \(z=\frac{{\beta+e}^{{{{{{\rm{ln}}}}}}(y)}}{1+{\beta+e}^{{{{{{\rm{ln}}}}}}(y)}}\) with z ∈ [β1] β is a minimum (i.e. basal) level. Depicted on the right are power-law and multiplication function and perceptgenes with sigmoid and step activation functions. b The power-law and multiplication circuit for IPTG and aTc inputs. Combinatorial promoter (P lacO/tetO ) is encoded on a high-copy-number plasmid (HCP) and is regulated by LacI and TetR repressors.

In the perceptgene design operating in the logarithmic domain the perceptron’s linear operations of scalar multiplication and summation are transformed to exponentiation (power-law) and multiplication respectively (Fig. 1a). The perceptgene’s sigmoid activation function is described by Michaelis–Menten kinetics at steady state2837 (\(z=\frac{{e}^{{{{{{{\rm{ln}}}}}}}(y)}}{1+{e}^{{{{{{{\rm{ln}}}}}}}(y)}}\) where y is a scaled protein concentration) and also operates in the logarithmic domain. In order to make the perceptgene operation more compatible with the realities of gene expression we added basal expression β to the activation function (\(z=\frac{{e}^{{{{{{{\rm{ln}}}}}}}(y)}+\beta }{1+{e}^{{{{{{{\rm{ln}}}}}}}(y)}+\beta }\)β « 1) (Fig. 1a). As we discuss below the perceptron’s high-level operations e.g. weighted multi-input functions classification and gradient descent for learning algorithms4648 are supported by the perceptgene’s log-based computing. Further discussion on perceptron and perceptgene models is provided in Supplementary Notes Perceptual computing models (Sensitivity noise and non-linearity analysis).

The perceptgene output is computed as a linear combination in the logarithmic domain (i.e. multiplication) of the weighted inputs and the bias in comparison to the threshold of the activation function (“Methods” Perceptgene abstract model). In the perceptgene implementation the weights are mainly determined by the Hill coefficients and design topology (e.g. feedback loops). The bias is set by the ratio between the maximum protein (transcription factor) level and the binding affinities of protein-protein/protein-DNA reactions. The fold change of perceptgene output is set by the basal level which in turn determines the threshold of the activation function. Practically we demonstrate our ability to fine-tune perceptgene biological parameters including Hill coefficients using well-known strategies for modifying gene regulatory networks (Supplementary Notes Design principles of neuromorphic gene circuits).

To implement the perceptgene in living cells we first created a synthetic gene circuit that combines power-law and multiplication functions (Fig. 1b). The power-law function encodes weighted inputs by assigning for each input a particular weight and the multiplication function aggregates the analog values of the weighted inputs. Our circuit inputs are small molecule inducers: isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and anhydrotetracycline (aTc) which bind LacI and TetR repressors respectively. The repressors regulate their own production with auto-negative feedback loops via the P lacO and P tetO promoters28. These auto-negative feedback loops implement the input’s power-law functions and increase the dynamic range28. To implement the multiplication function we connected combinatorial promoter (P lacO/tetO )54 encoding LacI and TetR operators to the auto-negative feedback loops. The IPTG/aTc regulation of P lacO/tetO promoter via constitutively expressed LacI and TetR implements a conventional Boolean AND logic gate54 but the regulatory topology described here auto-negative feedback converts the promoter’s operation into a logarithmically classifier (Eq. 2.13 Supplementary Notes).

Experimentally the IPTG/aTc transfer function has an input dynamic range of two orders of magnitude for each input (Fig. 1c). Our minimized biochemical model reveals that the power-law coefficients are determined mainly by Hill coefficients describing inducers binding to transcription factors and repressors binding to promoters (Eq. 2.17 Supplementary Notes). Motivated by this analysis we modified one of the auto-negative feedback loops by replacing P lacO (which has two LacI binding sites) with P lacO1 (which has only one LacI binding site) (Supplementary Fig. 17b). The reduced cooperativity of P lacO1 resulted in a measured 50% increase in IPTG’s power-law coefficient i.e. its input weight (Fig. 1d). For a negative feedback loop our mathematical model shows that the IPTG Hill coefficient is inversely proportional to the number of repressor binding sites in P lacO and P lacO1 (Eq. 2.20.9 Supplementary Notes). Experimentally the output of the modified power law and multiplication circuit (using P lacO1/tetO ) exhibits a three-dimensional linear plot in log-scale coordinations (Fig. 1d) with a NonLinearity degree of 1.33 (Table 1). The NonLinearity degree of gene circuit is computed as the ratio between two slopes – the slope of the input-output transfer function within the linear range and the slope of a linear curve with the same input dynamic range and maximum fold change of the gene circuit (Supplementary Notes NonLinearity degree). The kinetics of this optimized power law and multiplication circuit remained stable over the course of approximately ten hours (Supplementary Figs. 92 and 93).

Next to implement the full perceptgene we connected the power-law and multiplication function to a customizable activation function. Specifically we selected P BAD /AraC activation and hence encoded AraC downstream of P lacO/tetO  which in turn regulates perceptgene output via promoter P BAD and Arabinose inducer (Fig. 1g). A perceptgene with P BAD /AraC activation can be readily customized to perform different computational tasks (e.g. minimum maximum and average) by modifying mainly Arabinose concentration (Supplementary Fig. 22b). Arabinose levels tune the P BAD /AraC Hill coefficient by converting the transcriptional repression function of free AraC to transcriptional activation of the AraC/Arabinose complex55. Experimentally with low Arabinose levels the circuit converts an analog pattern of two inputs (IPTG and aTc) into a non-linear function with a NonLinearity degree of 3.8 (Table 1) that allows performing soft classification (Fig. 1h). Our experimental results correlates well with a detailed biochemical model (Fig. 1i and Supplementary Fig. 24).

We then analyzed the computational capabilities of this perceptgene and closely related variants. By extending existing neural computing analysis of perceptrons56 we proved that the smooth minimum maximum and average functions can theoretically be encoded in the operation of perceptgenes using a log-transformed negative rectifier log-transformed positive rectifier and log-transformed linear activation functions respectively (Supplementary Notes Smooth logical functions).

In terms of the perceptgene activation function for low Arabinose induction levels P BAD promoter exhibits a shifted and biased log-transformed negative rectifier (Supplementary Fig. 22d); log(AraC) below a threshold (u 01 ) result in promoter expression proportional to log(AraC) while concentrations above this u 01 threshold result in an asymptotically high output (Supplementary Fig. 32c). Theoretically the log-transformed negative rectifier used in this design can compute the minimum between the u 01 threshold and log(AraC) (“Methods” Smooth functions). When the log(AraC) is a linear combination of the weighted IPTG and aTc inputs as indicated by this design the min{u 01 log(AraC)} operation can be transformed for a minimum between IPTG and aTc inputs with an offset proportional to aTc (“Methods” Smooth functions). After graphing the two inputs and the preceptgene output at the logarithmic scale where the inputs are normalized by their respective dynamic ranges and the output is normalized by the offset above smooth minimum computation is revealed with a standard error of 10% (Fig. 1j Supplementary Fig. 34 and Supplementary Table 13).

Next we implemented a perceptgene with an activation function encoding a shifted and biased log-transformed positive rectifier using a modification of the P BAD /AraC system (Supplementary Fig. 22d). In particular P BAD implements a positive rectifier for high Arabinose concentrations and low AraC levels (Supplementary Fig. 32c). For this positive rectifier log(AraC) below a u 02 threshold result in a low constant P BAD activity while log(AraC) concentrations above this value elicit promoter expression proportional to log(AraC). Here we control AraC level with the Lux and Tet systems (Fig. 2a–d) since we wanted to expand the set of regulatory elements that could be incorporated into multi-perceptgene networks. The inputs to this circuit are aTc and acyl homoserine lactone (AHL). aTc induces expression as above while AHL binds transcriptional activator LuxR forms AHL-LuxR complex and activates promoter P lux (Fig. 2a).

We focused on finding the best AHL/aTc regulation that matches the input dynamic range of P BAD /AraC for implementing the positive rectifier function. For AraC expression we incorporated P lux/tetO  a combinatorial promoter with LuxR and TetR operators54. For TetR/aTc regulation we used the same topology as above. To obtain a LuxR/AHL power-law response we built a graded auto-positive feedback loop28 using a weak P lux mutant that broadens the input dynamic range (Supplementary Fig. 26). Similar to the analysis of auto-negative feedback our biochemical model of auto-positive feedback revealed that the power-law coefficients are determined by the Hill coefficient and binding affinity of LuxR to promoter P lux (Eq. 2.37 Supplementary Notes). We built a library comprising seven different P lux mutant by introducing random mutations to the LuxR operator which alter LuxR binding affinity to P lux (Supplementary Figs. 27 and 87). The mutant P luxTGT achieved the best match with the input dynamic range of P BAD /AraC under high Arabinose levels. Experimentally the measured AHL/aTc transfer function of P lux/tetO exhibits a power-law and multiplication output response with an input dynamic range for both inputs roughly of two orders of magnitude (Fig. 2b). This transfer function correlated well with our detailed biochemical model (Fig. 2c). To create the full perceptgene we encoded AraC activator under P lux/tetO  which in turn regulated the P BAD promoter (Fig. 2d). Experimentally with high Arabinose levels the perceptgene converts an analog pattern of two inputs (aTc and AHL) into a nonlinear function (Fig. 2e) with a NonLinearity degree of 2 (Table 1).

Similar to the analysis of the minimum computation we observed that a two-input perceptgene with an activation function of a log-transformed positive rectifier (Fig. 2d induced with high Arabinose) can compute the maximum between two log-transformed analog numbers that are related to AHL and aTc inputs with a particular offset that is related to AHL only (Supplementary Fig. 36). Our analysis demonstrated that a log-transformed positive rectifier function with an input of log(AraC) which is regulated by a linear combination of the weighted AHL and aTc signals as indicated by our design can compute the maximum between the two signals themselves with an added offset that is related to one of the signals (“Methods” Smooth functions). Therefore after graphing the AHL and aTc input signals and perceptgene output at a logarithmic scale normalizing the input signals to their respective input dynamic ranges and normalizing the output signal by the offset that is related to AHL only smooth maximum computation is revealed with a standard error of 23% (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Table 14).

The third classification function that we implemented with a single perceptgene was a log-transformed average of two analog inputs IPTG and AHL offset by a constant bias (Fig. 2g). The IPTG and AHL inputs simultaneously regulate combinatorial promoter P lux/lacO 54 via graded auto-negative and auto-positive feedback loops. The average operation can be implemented using a perceptgene with a linear activation function and total weights of 0.5 for both inputs. In this circuit (Fig. 2g) we designed the perceptgene’s AraC activation function to be linear over the input dynamic range with a slope that yields a total weights of 0.5 (Supplementary Fig. 38). For the IPTG input we used P lacO1 /LacI auto-negative feedback with an input weight of 0.95 (Supplementary Figs. 39 and 40). To ensure that AHL’s weight matches the IPTG weight we created a new mutant lux promoter P luxAAT (Supplementary Fig. 27) and incorporated it into a graded positive feedback system. The resulting AHL input weight is 0.85 and closely matches that of IPTG (Supplementary Fig. 40). We then had to compensate for the high IPTG and AHL input weights by fine-tuning the AraC activation function to exhibit a sufficiently shallow slope in the log–log domain. First we used very high Arabinose concentrations to obtain a P BAD /AraC activation function with a low Hill coefficient (Supplementary Fig. 22). Then our mathematical analysis revealed that for AraC levels slightly lower than the binding dissociation constant of AraC to P BAD  along with high Arabinose concentrations the activation function’s slope is approximately 0.5 (Eq. 3.23 Supplementary Notes). Experimentally with these AraC levels and a high Arabinose concentration the circuit indeed calculates the log-transformed average of AHL and IPTG (Fig. 2h with NonLinearity degree around one (Table 1) offset by a normalized value of −¼ with a standard error of 9% (Fig. 2i Supplementary Fig. 41 and Supplementary Table 15). As with the power law and multiplication circuit the average circuit output also remained stable over the course of approximately ten hours (Supplementary Fig. 94). Further analysis validating the smooth minimum maximum and average functions is provided in Supplementary Notes Calculations of parameters for a single perceptgene (Supplementary Table 19). We also quantified the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the three circuits based on single-cell measurements (Supplementary Notes Noise Analysis in Neuromorphic Circuits). We observed that SNR for the power law and multiplication stage is reduced when replacing auto-negative feedback regulation with auto-positive feedback regulation and that the addition of the activation function (AraC) tends to coalesce the SNR distributions of all three circuits to roughly the same values (Supplementary Fig. 98).

We then assembled combinations of the above perceptgenes into more complex circuits that implement higher-order functions using principles of deep ANNs including feedforward networks44. We first designed a two-layer perceptron network that implements a three-input soft majority function whose output is “1” (i.e. larger than half of the maximum fold change) when two or more of its three inputs are “1” (Fig. 3a). Our simplified mathematical analysis showed that when considering input values of 0s and 1s we can evaluate the design parameters of this perceptron network using a set of linear equations (Table 2). For this analysis we use linear-domain perceptron activation functions that are approximated as piecewise linear with three regimes (constant low level when perceptgene input is lower than γ L  linear as a function of input and constant high level when perceptgene input is higher than γ H ). When the inputs to the first perceptron are both low its output should be low enough such the second perceptron cannot be activated regardless of its input value (Table 2 row 1 for state [000] and row 2 for state [001]). Similarly when both inputs to the first perceptron are high its output should be high enough to activate the second perceptron regardless of its input value (Table 2 row 7 for state [110] and row 8 for state [111]). However when only one of the first perceptron inputs is high its output should be insufficient to activate the second perceptron by itself (Table 2 row 3 for state [010] and row 5 for state [100]) but high enough to jointly activate the second perceptron if its input is high (Table 2 row 4 for state [011] and row 6 for state [101]).

The mapping from a perceptron network design to a perceptgene network implementation of the majority function involves transformation to the logarithmic domain (Fig. 3b). The implementation comprises two cascaded perceptgenes and a GFP output (Fig. 3c). The perceptgene of the first layer of the cascade has AHL and IPTG inputs a topology similar to the perceptgene in Fig. 2g and T7 RNA polymerase output. The second layer perceptgene inputs are T7 RNA polymerase from the first layer perceptgene output and the majority function’s third input (aTc). T7 RNA polymerase is modified to include two amber stop codons which normally block translation57. Expression of amber suppressor tRNA supD which is regulated by aTc unblocks T7 RNA polymerase translation and activates T7 promoter (Supplementary Notes Design of 3-input majority function) which activates the GFP output signal.

Our choices of specific weights for implementing the majority function were guided by the simplified linear-domain analysis in Table 2 and a conversion of this analysis into the log-domain (Supplementary Table 21). These analyses essentially yielded the same constraints (Supplementary Table 20 Vs. 21). We determined that the circuit from Fig. 3c can compute majority even with asymmetric weights for AHL and IPTG (Supplementary Fig. 46e with error of 11%). For P lacO1  the IPTG measured input weight was 0.93 (Supplementary Fig. 49). Through random mutations we found a mutant lux promoter P luxM56 which when incorporated into a graded positive feedback system exhibited AHL input weight of 0.48 (Supplementary Fig. 49) and a sufficiently wide input dynamic range (larger than three orders of magnitude Supplementary Fig. 88). This resulted in a design constraint for bias B 1 such that γ L1 -min(0.450.93) < B 1 < γ L1 (Supplementary Table 20). Empirically B 1 is determined by the ratio between the maximal level of AraC and the binding dissociation constant of AraC to P BAD . Hence to satisfy the above constraint we fused an ssrA degradation tag58 to AraC resulting in a decrease in B 1 by two orders of magnitude from 0.15 to 0.0025 based on simulation results. For the constraint on the input dynamic range of the fist perceptgene activation function we find that its level should be less than the combined total weight for the AHL and IPTG inputs (γ H1 − γ L1 < n 1 + n 2 ).

For the parameter constraints on the second perceptron we find that the system has a solution only when the internal weight of T7 RNA polymerase is greater than the weight of P tetO /aTc (Supplementary Table 20 m > n 3 ) reflecting the intuition that T7 RNA polymerase represents the accumulated value of two inputs to the majority function. With TetR-based negative feedback regulation the experimentally measured aTc input weight is 0.7 (Supplementary Fig. 50) while T7 RNA polymerase is a monomer activator with weight of 1. However as our analysis shows on the one hand the weight of aTc should be larger than the input dynamic range of the second perceptgene activation function (n 3 > γ H2 − γ L2 ) which is approximately equal to 1 (i.e. P T promoter has a single binding site for T7 RNA polymerase). On the other hand the weight of aTc should not exceed the weight of T7 RNA polymerase satisfying the constraint m > n 3 . Therefore we incorporated dual SupD binding sites on T7 RNA polymerase57 which increases aTc input weight by approximately 1.5 (Supplementary Fig. 46) to reach a weight of 1.05. Finally to ensure that the bias and a single high input of the second perceptgene could not activate its output we reduced the bias by incorporating a low affinity ribosome binding sequence for T7 RNA polymerase.

After satisfying the various constraint-driven design decisions discussed above by using a high concentration of Arabinose of 0.25 mM that supports near-saturating levels of P BAD activation the initial version of the soft majority function yielded a system where output for two of the eight AHL/IPTG/aTc input cases were incorrect (left side of Fig. 3d). To address this problem we focused on improving the performance of the soft majority function by fine-tuning Arabinose a readily accessible method to alter mainly circuit weight but also bias specifically modifying P BAD response (Supplementary Fig. 22b). We measured the performance of the soft majority function under administration of a set of lower Arabinose concentrations. For each individual Arabinose level we measured the response to eight different AHL/IPTG/aTc combinations (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 51) which allowed us to compute the overall cost function59 (i.e. error) for that P BAD /AraC weight (Fig. 3e). Here the cost function computes the logarithmically mean squared error (\(\left\langle C\right\rangle=\frac{1}{2N}{\sum }_{i=1}^{N}{\left({{\log }}(\frac{{z}_{{Di}}}{{z}_{i}})\right)}^{2}\)) (Eq. 6.18 Supplementary Notes) where N is the number of samples (also called the batch size) z Di is the desired output for each state and z i is the observed output for these states. The best performance was observed for an Arabinose level between 0.03125 mM and 0.0625 mM that corresponds to an intermediate P BAD /AraC weight (Fig. 3e right side). The experimental results fit the computation of soft majority function. These results correlated well with our computational models of the majority (Supplementary Fig. 47) and cost functions (Fig. 3f Eqs. 6.16 and 6.17 Supplementary Notes).

Next we studied whether our circuit’s performance may potentially be optimized using a customized backpropagation learning algorithm based on gradient descent5960. Our backpropagation algorithm evaluates how incremental changes in weights for any perceptgene in the network affect overall system performance (i.e. cost function). This evaluation is used iteratively to determine how to update weights in a gradient descent fashion (Fig. 3g). In the first step of the algorithm the outputs for each of the eight majority function input conditions for both the first layer perceptgene as well as the second layer (i.e. full circuit) are measured experimentally (Supplementary Figs. 57 and 59). The eight output values for each perceptgene are normalized based on the highest level measured and basal expression (Supplementary Table 26). Then these experimentally derived output values are used in conjunction with a chain rule formula to determine the derivatives of the cost function with respect to changes in the two current weights. These derivatives yield suggestions for the next weights to test (Eqs. 6.21 and 6.22 Supplementary Notes). The algorithm cycles through the weights one at a time by evaluating the sign of the partial derivatives of the cost function \(\left(\frac{\partial {{{{{\rm{C}}}}}}}{\partial {{{{{\rm{n}}}}}}}\right)\) with respect to this particular weight n. Based on the sign of the partial derivative the algorithm updates the weight to the next nearest available value61. The algorithm contains two phases; in the first phase we update m weight and in the second phase we update n 1 weight. The algorithm repeats this process until either all output values reach their desired binary values or the cost function reaches a local minima.

Using this backpropagation algorithm we followed the trajectories in a two-dimensional weight space with the P BAD /AraC and P lux /AHL weights. The P BAD /AraC weight is chosen from a set of six different pre-selected Arabinose levels and the weight of P lux /AHL is determined by selecting one of a small library of four genetic variants of the LuxR operator (Supplementary Figs. 49 and 56). The four P lux mutations exhibit different weights (0.1 0.2 0.27 0.45) within the operating dynamic range of P lux /AHL [0.1875–3 μM]. We exhaustively measured the soft majority function response to eight different AHL/IPTG/aTc combinations across the six different Arabinose concentrations and four P lux mutations in triplicates (a total of 8 × 6 × 4 × 3 = 576 samples). This allowed us to pre-compute an overall cost function for each P BAD /AraC and P lux /AHL weight combination (Fig. 3h). In emulating a backpropagation algorithm we started at the corner of the weight space with the lowest values of P BAD /AraC and P lux /AHL weights and iteratively updated these weights. Based on the sign of the weight derivatives the available higher or lower weight was chosen. The next weight value is either a P lux genetic variant available in our pre-existing library or an Arabinose inducer concentration from an a priori determined set of inducer values. The optimization trajectory culminated in a solution that provides the desired majority function binary output values after three iterations of P lux and Arabinose weight tuning using information from 8 × (3 + 3) = 48 samples. Further experiments and analysis validating the backpropagation algorithm is provided in Supplementary Notes Gradient descent and backpropagation algorithms in living cells (Supplementary Table 27 and Supplementary Fig. 60).

For our final perceptgene network we implemented an analog-to-digital converter (ADC; Supplementary Fig. 61) useful for a variety of intracellular and extracellular biosensing applications. The conversion of analog information into digital encoding is a classification problem that is efficiently solved by ANN architectures62 (Supplementary Notes Design and implementation of 2-bit log-ADC). We evaluated three designs starting from a perceptgene adaptation of a classical ADC perceptron network62 a second design that adds two inhibitory regulatory links and a third design that improves the fidelity of the digital output signals. In our first design (Fig. 4a) individual perceptgenes convert the analog input into digital bits starting from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB). While the analog input signal is routed to all perceptgenes the computation from the MSB also contributes a negative weight to the LSB. This effectively subtracts the higher order bit from the LSB’s analog input signal (Supplementary Figs. 62 and 63). We designed a gene network that uses transcriptional interference63 to perform subtraction (Supplementary Fig. 65). We first checked whether P lux promoter activity can be subtracted from P BAD promoter activity by arranging the promoters in a convergent orientation64. However experimental analysis of this subtraction method revealed that in addition to observing the desired increase in the input threshold required for output promoter activation there was also undesirable repression of maximal promoter activation (Supplementary Fig. 65). Such repression can affect ADC performance for high input by displaying (10) instead of (11). To alleviate repression of maximal promoter activation caused by the transcriptional interference we introduce a second regulatory element TetR which represses a hybrid version of the convergent P lux promoter (P lux/tetO  Supplementary Fig. 68). In the revised ADC design TetR is regulated by the MSB to nullify the subtraction of the MSB from the LSB only for high input levels.

The input “x” is an analog signal the outputs are digital bits: most significant bit (MSB) and least significant bit (LSB). b The modified perceptgene design of 2-bit ADC based on analyzing gene networks. A subtraction of the MSB from the LSB using transcriptional interference (denoted by “−1”) is required. c Genetically encoded two-bit ADC. The circuit converts AHL concentration into LSB and MSB. Positive feedback regulation of AHL via mutant P luxM56 promoter linearizes the response. The MSB encoded on an MCP is computed by the P lux promoter which regulates mCherry and TetR. The LSB encoded on an HCP receives the linearized AHL which activates P BAD promoter and expresses GFP. The MSB subtractor (MSB sub encoded on an HCP) regulates P BAD promoter via transcriptional interference (P lux/tetO  oriented in the opposite direction to P BAD ). d Measured and simulated response of a 2-bit ADC (Arabinose = 0.4 mM). Red triangles show the measured MSB mCherry. Green circles show the LSB GFP with P lux/tetO promoter purple diamonds show the GFP with P lux (Arabinose = 0.4 mM). The P lux/tetO and P lux configurations of the convergent promoters are shown below the graph. e Design of a 2-bit ADC using three perceptgenes two of which are used for computing the LSB; LSB low is activated only under low AHL concentrations and LSB high is activated only under high AHL concentrations. The MSB topology is similar to Fig. 4b. f Genetic implementation of the 2-bit ADC from Fig. 4e. In comparison to Fig. 4c we removed TetR replaced P lux/tetO with P lux to obtain LSB low  and implemented LSB high using P rhl promoter that is activated by high levels of AHL. g Measured and simulated response of the 2-bit ADC from Fig. 4f (Arabinose = 0.06 mM). h Measured and simulated response of the ternary switch (Arabinose = 0.4 mM).

The revised ADC gene circuit comprises four main elements: the AHL input stage the MSB the MSB subtractor and the LSB (Fig. 4b c). For the AHL input graded positive feedback with LuxR increases the input’s dynamic range as above (Supplementary Fig. 26). To compute the MSB AHL activates expression from P lux encoded on a medium copy number. Computation of LSB involves AraC activation of P BAD as well as down-regulation by transcriptional interference63 from convergent promoter P lux/tetO  which is oriented in the opposite direction to P BAD . This transcriptional interference implements subtraction of MSB from the LSB for intermediate levels of AHL but not for high levels of AHL. This resulted in four distinct outputs states for the two-input ADC (green and red lines in Fig. 4d). An experiment using the initial circuit design in which P lux promoter (without tetO operator) replaces transcriptional interference promoter P lux/tetO shows low LSB levels under high AHL concentrations (purple line in Fig. 4d). Further experiments are provided in Supplementary Notes Synthetic Data converters (Supplementary Figs. 64–70).",,,,,,,,,,,,

Both sides have confirmed the evolution but declined to comment. It’s understood that both sides have agreed to continue to work together but on a project-by-project basis now that their previous deal is ending.

Winfrey and Apple TV+ are already currently collaborating on the documentary “Sidney” about the life of iconic Oscar-winning actor Sidney Poitier. That project directed by Reggie Hudlin is through Apple Original Films and debuted this past Friday on Apple TV+.

Winfrey and Apple also continue to collaborate on “Oprah’s Book Club” which is available on both OprahDaily.com and Apple Books.

Under the pact first signed in 2018 Winfrey and Apple were to create programs that will be released as part of Apple’s original content lineup.

Popular on Variety

But even at the time it seemed unclear how this deal would fit into Winfrey’s already busy media empire. The cable channel she formed with Discovery Communications OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network developed and produced hit shows like “Queen Sugar” from Ava DuVernay. Winfrey renewed her contract with Discovery through 2025 although Discovery increased its stake in OWN to 95% in December 2020.

More recently some of Winfrey’s most high-profile TV events — the interviews “Oprah with Meghan and Harry” and a special with Adele — aired on CBS.

At the time of the 2018 deal sources told Variety that Apple’s deal with Winfrey did not conflict with the Discovery agreement and that Winfrey remained exclusive in an on-screen capacity to OWN with limited carve-outs.

Winfrey also continues to be active through her Harpo Productions banner which produced “Sidney.” Its other recent output includes “The Color of Care” a documentary for Smithsonian Channel and the upcoming Hulu series “Black Cake” from Marissa Jo Cerar (“Wome of the Movement”).

At Apple TV+ Winfrey partnered with Prince Harry for the doc series “The Me You Can’t See.” Winfrey also hosts “The Oprah Conversation” and “Oprah’s Book Club” for the streamer.

Puck News first reported news of the end of the Apple TV+/Oprah Winfrey deal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGFybmV3c29ubGluZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA5LzI1L2RvZXMtYXBwbGUtaW5jLXN0aWxsLW93bi0zNjAwLWFjcmVzLW9mLWZvcmVzdC1sYW5kLWluLWJydW5zd2ljay1jb3VudHktbm9ydGgtY2Fyb2xpbmEvNzg5NTg5OTAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Does Apple still own 3600 acres of forestland in Brunswick County?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.starnewsonline.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /story/news/2022/09/25/does-apple-inc-still-own-3600-acres-of-forest-land-in-brunswick-county-north-carolina/7895899001/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000267438872B0>, 'Connection to www.starnewsonline.com timed out.

IOS 16 brought a multitude of features including the ability to edit iMessages changes to lock screen notifications enhancements to Apple Wallet and the ability to use SharePlay from messages.

The new update is available for the iPhone 8 second generation SE and later models. It is sized at 2.8 GB. The release of iOS 16 follows the usual cycle of new iOS versions being launched in the fall.

The adoption of this new update was reported to be ahead of that of iOS 15 though the number is still low compared to the adoption of iOS 14. First-day adoption rates of iOS 16 were affected due to updates no longer being forced on users. iPhones offer two software update choices in its settings: the ability to keep using the previous iOS version with security updates or to upgrade directly to the newest iOS version.

There have been a number of changes from iOS 15. Lock screen customization was improved with users now allowed up to four small widgets to be added below the time. With the “Now Playing” screen moved to the bottom of the screen the new “Live Activities” feature has more space to showcase ongoing sports games or deliveries.

Additionally users can edit or undo a message for up to 15 minutes after it was sent. Deleted messages can be recovered for up to 30 days past deletion. Users can also invite others to work on projects in Numbers or Pages where the activity will be shown in Messages.

Additionally Mail allows for scheduled sending of emails and for users to undo sent emails. Mail management has also been made easier and less clunky with the option of setting reminders for emails.

IOS 16 introduced a new feature called the iCloud Photo Library that allows the sharing of photos with family; a photo can be saved directly from the Camera App to the iCloud folder. Changes are also reflected in the shared album if a user edits a photo.

The old password system is being replaced by a new “passkey” system. The passkey system allows one to log in or create new accounts without the need to create memorize or store a password. Apple’s implementation of the passkey system builds on years of work done by the FIDO Alliance.

A new Safety Check feature allows users to turn off all services and apps used in the phone in the event of an emergency. Apple stated that the feature will make it easier to stay private and/or protect personal data and safety for example when leaving abusive relationships.

In Apple Maps the company introduced the ability to add multiple stops a feature already available in Google Maps but will now be welcome to Apple users. Apple Maps also includes a transit card feature that allows one to replenish a transit card or see the cost of a trip.

Though the update has been seen positively users noted that there are still bugs that need to be fixed. Syncing issues battery drain touchscreen delays and interface problems were reported.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FwcGxlLXNheXMtZXhjaXRlZC1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nLWlwaG9uZS0wNDU1NTQzNTUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple says it will manufacture iPhone 14 in India,"FILE PHOTO: The Apple logo is seen at an Apple Store in Brooklyn New York

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Apple Inc said on Monday it will manufacture its latest iPhone 14 in India as the tech giant moves some of its production away from China.

The company launched the flagship iPhone 14 at an event earlier this month where it focused on safety upgrades rather than flashy new technical specifications with the exception of a new adventure-focused watch.

""The new iPhone 14 lineup introduces groundbreaking new technologies and important safety capabilities. We're excited to be manufacturing iPhone 14 in India"" Apple said in a statement.

Analysts at J.P.Morgan expect Apple to move about 5% of iPhone 14 production from late 2022 to India which is the world's second-biggest smartphone market after China.

Apple could make one out of four iPhones in India by 2025 JPM analysts said in a note last week.

We are a group of concerned Iowans farmland owners academics non-profit leaders and environmental advocates who have urged the Iowa Utilities Board to reject permit applications for carbon dioxide pipelines that would run across Iowa. We recognize that climate change is driven by emissions of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide and we support clean safe sustainable and locally controlled and locally owned energy. But we can do better than the proposed pipelines. Science indicates that they are poor investments and unlikely to have a meaningful effect on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

We filed a letter on July 29 2022 with the Iowa Utilities Board and laid out four science-based objections to the projects proposed by Summit Carbon Solutions Navigator CO2 Ventures and Archer Daniels Midland partnered with Wolf Carbon Solutions. Our objections are based on publicly funded scientific and engineering studies; links to these studies can be found in our letter to the board.

Soil degradation reduced crop yields. Iowa State University scientists recently published a study that examined crop yields in areas of fields affected by underground oil pipeline construction. They found that subsoil compaction reduced corn yields by 15% and soybean yields by 25% for at least several years after pipeline completion. Farmers are aware of these effects and are reluctant to allow degradation of their land by pipeline construction. To date at least 40 county boards of supervisors in Iowa have filed objections to the proposed pipelines.

Another View:CO2 pipeline technology is safe and beneficial

Minor reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Capturing carbon dioxide generated during the process of fermentation at ethanol plants and then transporting it by pipelines through Iowa and other states and storing it underground would have trivial effects on our nation’s carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. in 2020 were 110 times greater than the amount that might be captured at all our nation’s ethanol plants under the most favorable projections.

Carbon dioxide emitted from tailpipes would greatly exceed what pipelines would transport. The use of ethanol in our cars contributes to greenhouse gas emissions which exacerbate our ever-increasing climate crisis. Tailpipe emissions from U.S. vehicles in 2020 using gasoline blended with 10% ethanol (E10) were almost 25 times greater than the 43 million metric tons of carbon dioxide that could potentially be captured at all the nation’s ethanol plants. Because vehicles using ethanol rather than regular gasoline typically get 4% to 5% fewer miles per gallon of fuel consumed due to the lower energy content of ethanol carbon dioxide emissions per mile traveled are as high or higher for ethanol blends as for pure gasoline.

Corruption of the ideal of private sacrifice for public good. The power of eminent domain which allows private land to be condemned is granted to governments carefully and must be executed carefully. This process should be used only for projects serving substantial public interest. Given the link between soil health farm productivity and forest and grassland integrity a very large benefit to the public should accrue to offset the damage incurred from building private carbon dioxide pipelines through the fields and timber of hundreds of Iowa citizens. Because the carbon dioxide transported by pipelines from ethanol plants for underground storage would hardly dent U.S. greenhouse gas emissions while incurring substantial damage to private land we believe insufficient public benefit would accrue from allowing private pipeline projects to proceed using eminent domain.

There are better opportunities for Iowa to reduce greenhouse gas emissions than through the construction of carbon dioxide pipelines. We ask that concerned citizens speak out against the proposed pipelines and file their objections with the IUB.

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

In response to geopolitical strife energy prices went through the roof. Across Europe the price of natural gas more than doubled and in places there were even bigger increases in heating oil. The price of crude oil more than tripled. This fed an inflationary surge across the rich world cutting real incomes. There was no end in sight.

At the height of the crisis Willy Brandt West Germany’s chancellor summed up the official response in many countries. “We’ll have to get dressed a little more warmly this winter” he said “and maybe the next two or three winters. But we aren’t going to starve.” His government like others focused on efforts to cut fuel consumption—by imposing speed limits telling people not to drive on Sundays and asking factories to turn down furnaces. Sweden and the Netherlands introduced petrol rationing; Italy imposed a curfew in bars and restaurants. Few governments doled out money. In 1973 the real value of Britain’s benefits bill barely budged."

Her alliance which also includes Matteo Salvini’s League and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia claimed about 43% of the vote according to projections for RAI the public broadcaster. That would give the bloc at least 114 seats in the Senate where 104 votes are required for a majority.

Meloni emerged from the political fringes after leading the opposition to Mario Draghi’s technocratic administration which stabilized the country over the past 18 months following the trauma of the pandemic. Yet the charismatic 45-year-old has little experience of governing and she would be taking office at a perilous moment for her country.

Italian government bonds extended their slide after the vote. The spread between Italian and German government bonds a barometer of debt risk widened slightly to 237 basis points. Italian stocks were little changed.

The next Italian government will face a series of overlapping crises as the energy shortages triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine fuel rampant inflation and undermine growth. The hit to Italy’s finances and the prospect of more interest-rate hikes from the European Central Bank have pushed the yield on Italy’s 10-year bonds to more than 4.3% compared with less than 1% in December.

“We haven’t arrived” Meloni told supporters in the small hours of Monday in a sober speech at a hotel in downtown Rome. “This is a starting point. And tomorrow we will have to show what we are worth.”

Once the final results are in the next step in the constitutional process will see President Sergio Mattarella consulting with party leaders before almost certainly nominating Meloni to form the next government. That process could still last weeks. The new parliament which has been downsized to 200 senators and 400 lower house lawmakers will meet for the first time on Oct. 13.

Meloni cut her teeth in politics as a far-right activist in the 1990s and her campaigning is still marked by fiery attacks on the European Union immigrants and LGBTQ groups. But she has also tried to reassure voters and investors that she will keep Italy’s mammoth debt under control and won’t question the country’s foreign alliances or support for Ukraine.

“The question is whether they will deviate from Draghi’s reform plan which will impact whether the money will keep flowing from the EU” said Geoffrey Yu a senior FX strategist at Bank of New York Mellon in London.

Markets were reassured by preliminary results showing Meloni’s coalition would fall short of a two-thirds majority of seats in parliament which would have allowed the alliance to change Italy’s constitution.

Meloni is likely to have a strong hand in government as she looks to reverse some of the reforms that Draghi had introduced in an effort to boost growth. Seeking significant revisions could put at risk a spending plan for about 200 billion euros ($198 billion) of pandemic recovery funds from the European Union.

Draghi has spent about 66 billion euros to help families and businesses but has resisted political pressure to expand the budget deficit. That could be one of the first dilemmas with which a Meloni government has to wrestle. The right-wing bloc has also opposed reforming the obsolete tax system and freeing up competition two key reforms pledged by Draghi to qualify for the EU funds.

The new government will have to quickly come up with a budget plan before the end of the year to be presented both to the parliament and the European Union. Italy’s economy is likely to grow only around 0.4% next year compared to a 2.4% prediction released in April.

“This result is broadly in line with expectations and should be read as relatively market friendly” said Francesco Castelli head of fixed income at Banor Capital adding that attention will now focus on who will be appointed to key government posts. Castelli warned however that investors would be “unwilling to tolerate euroskeptic rhetoric and quickly click on the sell button.”

The result marks a meteoric rise for Meloni’s group the Brothers of Italy. The party claimed over 25% of the vote compared with 4% in the last election in 2018.

Enrico Letta’s Democratic Party Meloni’s main opponent in the campaign came second with 19% of the vote and is set to lead the opposition. Giuseppe Conte’s anti-establishment Five Star Movement registered a late surge to claim around 16% and is likely to be another important force in the opposition.

As she looks ahead to potentially taking office toward the end of next month Meloni will be keeping a close eye on her coalition ally Salvini whose party underperformed with about 9% of the vote. Salvini saw himself as Italy’s next prime minister in 2019 when his party led the polls with 34% and he has only reluctantly accepted that he has to play second fiddle to the Brothers of Italy.

“It won’t be long before the government will be tested by internal tensions” said Giorgia Serughetti a professor of politics at Milan University. “The poor support for the League was not expected. We should get ready for a government led by Meloni but with a high degree of internal turbulence.”

Throughout the campaign Salvini has taken a more aggressive line on increasing borrowing to help Italians get through the energy crisis and he has questioned the effectiveness of sanctions against Russia.

In her election night speech Meloni thanked both him and Berlusconi for their support and the spirit in which they had campaigned as she paid tribute to her team.

“You start by doing what is necessary and then you do what is possible” she said quoting St Francis. “And you’ll end up achieving the impossible”

The new apartment complex called The Uptown features 60 mostly one-bedroom apartments for tenants aged 55 and older. The apartments are for mixed-income households with rents ranging between $794 and $1495 per month. Around 42 apartments are classified as low-income according to developer The Szanton Company.

A large crowd gathered for the grand opening of the redeveloped Moses and Columbia Block Buildings on the corner of Front and Summer streets on May 8.

“There’s a housing shortage here and everywhere in Maine so the fact that we have one unit still available before we even open our doors speaks to the need for housing” said The Szanton Company Vice President Amy Cullen.

Around 10 existing units were already open in the Moses and Columbia building with Szanton adding four more units there Cullen said.

Applications for The Uptown opened in January with the apartments filling up in about one month leaving just one unit available at the time of the grand opening. The new tenants started moving into The Uptown on May 10.

“There is a housing crisis in the state and Bath is no exception” said Bath City Council Chairperson Mary Ellen Bell. “The Uptown project builds density in the downtown recreates underutilized space and provides attainable housing for some of our older residents.”

The newest addition of the building that connects to the renovated Columbia and Moses housing block sits on what used to be an empty lot that was once home to the Bath YMCA. Szanton bought the historic Moses and Columbia blocks back in 2020 with construction beginning in the summer of 2022 according to Cullen.

“The rehab of the existing historic building Moses and Columbia block that this project contains had a lot more work than we expected” Cullen said.

Most of the new tenants come from the Bath area with some coming in from out of state.

“For years to come these affordable homes are going to be a remarkable and lasting tribute to those who have worked so hard for affordable housing in this City of Ships” said MaineHousing Director Daniel Brennan.

The away side secured the try bonus-point in a rampant first half – Thomas du Toit Ben Spencer Joe Cokanasiga and Matt Gallagher all scoring tries – with only Jamie Blamire’s double providing respite for their opponents.

The returning Finn Russell was imperious from the tee nailing all four conversions to give his side a commanding 28-10 lead at half-time.

Sam Stuart’s try after the interval was reward for a spirited display from the home side who stopped Bath from notching any points to add to their first-half haul – but there was no comeback for the crowd to savour with Bath moving second.

Russell was restored to the starting line-up for the visitors his first start since picking up a groin injury in the Champions Cup defeat by Exeter last month.

It took less than five minutes for his side to open the scoring Du Toit scooping up a loose ball and dotting down for his 11th try of the season.

The onslaught continued with the Falcons unable to stop the yellow tide early on.

Spencer was next to score taking the ball from a ruck in the 13th minute and weaving his way through the posts also surviving a TMO review.

The hosts should have cut the deficit seven minutes later when Cameron Hutchison broke through the line to force a two-on-two situation but his offload to Guy Pepper was sloppy and the chance was gone.

And they were punished in the 28th minute when Cokanasiga went over on the right wing – Russell nailed the tricky conversion to extend the lead to 21-0.

Blamire finally provided some cheer for the North East faithful nine minutes before the break scoring from a maul in the right corner but the usually reliable Brett Connon sent his kick wide.

Bath’s bonus point was secured when Gallagher finished off a superb team move before Blamire doubled his tally from another maul with the last play of the half to give the Falcons some hope going into the interval.

After a lengthy period of pressure the hosts finally grabbed their third try through Stuart. Connon added the extras for the first time on the night to reduce the arrears to 11 points.

The reverse fixture was one of the Falcons’ closer games this season only losing by eight points on the opening weekend of the Premiership and they were proving a nuisance in the second period here limiting Bath’s attacking chances and crafting openings of their own.

But as has been the case all season a lack of ruthlessness and their habit of having to chase the game cost them in the end.

Phil Dowson says Saints will travel to Bath on Saturday 'fully loaded from an intent and physicality point of view'.

The black green and gold have already secured a home play-off semi-final in the Gallagher Premiership after cruising to a 90-0 win against Gloucester last Saturday.

That means Saints could take the chance to rest players against Bath but Dowson was giving little away in terms of his team selection when asked after the Gloucester game.

He did however insist they will not be taking the trip to The Rec lightly.

""It (team selection) is not something I've considered hugely"" the Saints boss said.

""Bath are obviously a very good side particularly at home and we've got to try to maintain the momentum and keep pushing our performance.

""We've only talked this season about our performance and not necessarily the results so we'll keep pushing for those sorts of things.

""We go to The Rec fully loaded from an intent point of view and from a physicality point of view and see where we end up.""

Saints may have secured a top-two spot but Dowson added: ""They don't hand out any medals or trophies for that so we make sure we acknowledge that and make sure it drives our energy moving forward.""

Saints had suffered back-to-back defeats prior to last weekend as they lost to Harlequins and Leinster.

And Dowson was delighted with the way his side bounced back as they continued a strong season in style with the 14-try demolition of Gloucester.

Sharanjit was officially ‘installed’ with a celebration event on Wednesday 8th May in the grounds of the Newton Park campus.

The first female Chancellor of Bath Spa University (BSU) and only the second Chancellor in the institution’s almost 20-year history Sharanjit will act as an ambassador for the university on a local national and global stage.

A former BBC World News anchor as well as a leading business and politics reporter her career took her all over the world for almost a quarter of a century.

She now regularly moderates high-level debates for the United Nations multilateral and financial institutions and advises companies and educational institutions on media strategy and diversity.

Living between Bath and her native Singapore Sharanjit is also a Trustee for the Bath Fashion Museum and a Board member at the Holburne Museum. She said she is delighted to become part of the Bath Spa University community to represent the values of students and staff worldwide.

Educated in North America with an undergraduate degree in Journalism and a Master’s in English Sharanjit says she understands what a privilege it is to study have an education and to be curious about the world.

She said: “I stand here because of the socially uplifting power of education that has transformed my life. My late father Kernail Singh Leyl was born in Singapore to a poor immigrant family and was one of eight children.

“He excelled academically and made it to the country’s most prestigious school. He did it through sheer grit and hard work.

“So determined was he to be educated that he studied by streetlamp at a time when Singapore was a developing country and didn’t have reliable electricity coverage.

“Through all his efforts he won scholarships and became the first person to go to university in my family which has led to a completely different life for my brothers and me. It’s a story that truly exemplifies the transformative power of education.

She said her father’s story isn’t a far cry from many of the students at Bath Spa University.

“Over 40% of the BSU student population are among the first in their family to go to university just like my father did. About a quarter of our students are from ethnic minorities like me and many more are working their way through university holding down one or more jobs so they can afford to have an education.

“It shows the sheer grit and determination of the students here at BSU who are so much like my father students whom I’m inspired by and so proud to represent and truly embodying the spirit of Bath Spa University – The Sunday Times University of the year for Social Inclusion.”

Bath Spa University’s Vice-Chancellor Professor Sue Rigby welcomed Sharanjit to the BSU community during the ceremony with pledges music and performances from students and staff.

Sharanjit will be presenting certificates to some students at BSU’s summer graduation ceremonies as well as attending numerous informal and more formal events throughout the academic year."

Something went wrong please try again later.

A medal won by Rangers legend Jim Baxter is expected to fetch up to £5000 at auction next month.

The nine-carat gold gong was given to the player nicknamed “Slim Jim” following the Light Blues’ 2-0 Scottish League Cup final win over Kilmarnock in front of 82063 fans at Hampden Park in October 1960. Baxter had signed for the Ibrox club from Raith Rovers in June of that year and it was his first senior honour.

The historic piece of football memorabilia will go under the hammer at a special McTear’s auction – More Than A Game: Sporting Medals & Shirts – in Glasgow on October 14. The medal is being sold by Rangers fan Douglas Gray who was a page boy when Baxter married hairdresser Jean Ferguson in Coatbridge in 1965.

The medal was gifted to Douglas’s mum who wore it as a charm bracelet for many years. James Bruce McTear’s sporting specialist said: “The medal was the first of 10 won by Jim Baxter during his time at Rangers and that in itself gives it added significance. We expect there will be a lot of interest when it goes under the hammer.”

In his first season at Ibrox Baxter helped Rangers win the League Cup and Scottish League title. In that season they also became the first British club to reach a major European final – losing to Fiorentina in the two-legged European Cup Winners’ Cup final.

Baxter retired from football in 1970 following a second spell at Rangers. He died in 2001 aged 61 and in 2003 a statue was erected in his honour in his hometown – Hill of Beath.

What is ethylene oxide?

Ethylene oxide (EtO) is a gas that is colorless and odorless. It has two main purposes – as a building block to make products such as antifreeze or to sterilize things.

In the case of Becton Dickinson’s (BD) Columbus east plant the company uses EtO to sterilize certain medical products. According to BD’s website EtO is the only effective method of sterilization without damaging certain sensitive medical products.

BD began using EtO at its Columbus east plant 920 E. 19th Street in 2005.

BD’s facilities produce more than 35 billion essential medical products each year the company’s website states and BD is 20 times more efficient at removing EtO per cubic meter of air than is currently required by the Clean Air Act.

There are roughly 100 of these commercial sterilizers in the United States. However the EPA is concerned over the amount of EtO emissions coming from BD and recently held a community meeting in Columbus to share information on the matter.

EPA’s concerns

Bethany Olson with EPA’s Community Partnerships and Programs noted that the EtO coming out of the BD facility is air pollution only; there’s no indication and EPA officials do not believe the chemical is going into the water or onto the ground in any way that would be causing a risk.

“In 2016 we learned that EtO was more dangerous when it's breathed in” Olson said. “As soon as we learned that we started gathering information to better understand how EtO was potentially causing risk in some communities. Over the last two years we collected more detailed information from the facilities that use EtO to understand where exactly in which specific communities that risk is the highest.”

That work was completed this spring Olson said and EPA has been working with companies and state environmental and public health agencies to reduce emissions from these types of facilities.

There are two types of EtO emissions – controlled emissions and what’s known as fugitive emissions – those that don’t get captured by control emissions. The EtO coming from BD are fugitive emissions Olson said.

“This is EtO that escapes through other places leaks gaps even doors and windows” she added.

BD does currently have controls in place to capture EtO.

“We do not believe that there are short-term risks from this chemical in your community. This is an important point” Olson said. “The science we have done only finds long-term risks over a lifetime of exposure. What we have learned though is that EtO can cause cancer when people are exposed over long periods of time. Specifically it can cause breast and lymph or blood cancers.”

A map from EPA shows that for areas around the BD Columbus east plant the estimated lifestyle cancer risk is 100 in a million or greater from breathing air containing EtO emitted from the facility. However that risk is assuming an individual is constantly breathing in that level of EtO in the air nonstop for a lifetime.

“For someone who lives near an EtO facility in a residential area we would assume that people spend 100% of their time – which means 24 hours a day seven days a week for 70 years – breathing in EtO in the area where there is risk” Olson said. “For someone who handles EtO within a facility we assume that people are exposed while they're at work for eight hours a day 250 days a year for 35 years.”

Olson noted it’s unlikely an individual would be around the chemical for that entire length of time. Scientists purposefully use the most conservative numbers when calculating risks.

“The bottom line is that this is intentionally conservative in order to protect the most sensitive individuals” she said.

Certain individuals are most likely more at risk including workers those living closer to the facility in question and infants and children who are naturally more susceptible to illness she said.

Olson said the only way to really reduce this risk is by reducing emissions from BD. The chemical cannot be easily removed with home air filters and you can’t completely reduce your risk by staying inside.

EPA expects to propose two updated actions later this year – one focused on air pollution that addresses the risk where people live and the other on EtO where it’s used in sterilization facilities where people work.

“The existing regulation was written and put into place at a time when we didn't yet fully understand a lot about how toxic ethylene oxide is and how it creates risk in communities” said EPA Region 7 Air and Radiation Division Director Dana Skelley. “…We've learned a lot in the last few years and we're putting that knowledge to work on a new air pollution regulation.”

A public comment period of at least 60 days will take place in the fall and it will take one year to finalize the rule. Facilities will then have about three years to come into compliance.

BD’s perspective

According to BD Vice President of Public Relations Troy Kirkpatrick BD has programs in place to ensure compliance with EPA Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Food and Drug Administration regulations and permit requirements.

The previously mentioned fugitive emissions were not previously regulated Kirkpatrick noted and BD has found new methods of EtO capture and control technologies to “significantly reduce” the fugitive emissions.

BD is voluntarily investing $18 million to install new equipment in the post-sterile warehouse section of the facility in Columbus.

“These new systems have been proven to reduce emissions by 95% in other BD facilities and we expect similar results in Columbus” Kirkpatrick said. “The permits have been approved and the upgrades are already in process with planned completion within 8-12 months. While this investment is not required by EPA or Nebraska DEE after the system is operational the facility is expected to be below the EPA’s 100 in a million risk threshold in all residential areas around the facility.”

Kirkpatrick added that EPA’s new risk methodology focuses exclusively on emissions from commercial sterilizers but not the other sources of EtO which include other industrial use of EtO the combustion of fossil fuels decomposition of organic matter cigarette smoke and EtO produced by the human body.

“While EPA is continuing to do research to better understand background levels of EtO EPA data from a study they conducted between Oct. 1 2018 through March 31 2019 shows average background levels of 0.2 to 0.4 micrograms of EtO per cubic meter of air” he said. “This means that background levels in regular outdoor air across the country is more than 10 to 20 times higher than the EPA’s risk threshold. And concurrently emissions from our Columbus facility as modeled by EPA are 2.5 to 5 times lower than what is found in ambient air even before any upgrades to the facility.”

BD has provided expert opinions on EPA’s concerns regarding EtO emission levels in Columbus and the agency’s study in general including from Michael Dourson a board-certified toxicologist and president of Toxicology Excellence in Risk Assessment.

Dourson pointed out in a statement that EtO is used to make everyday household items and is the product of grilling outdoors running a diesel engine and many other activities. EPA’s threshold is so low that it does not account for the EtO already present in the air from man-made and naturally occurring sources Dourson said.

“By not accounting for these sources the relatively small amounts added to the environment by industry might raise alarms in many areas where there need not be any. All of this has made EPA’s process quite difficult to accept by scientists knowledgeable about these hypothetical risks” Dourson said.

He noted the levels of EtO emitted by the facility are not high enough to impact a person who breathes air with the highest concentration continuously for a lifetime.

“For example in Columbus Nebraska the reported emissions from BD’s facility are 0.08 ug/m3 or less. This is less than what occurs in other places in the country without industry as determined by EPA and also much lower than what your body produces” Dourson said.

“…EPA’s risk values are hypothetical and do not reflect a medical finding. Rather the intent of these values is to identify an area of potential concern in order to prioritize actions at the community level. The essential point here is that the levels of EtO in your area are not going to lead to an increase in cancer risk but the EPA risk values allow your community to understand emissions and track further progress for emissions reductions if this is important to you.”

Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger preach a ""value investing"" philosophy centered on identifying and buying underpriced assets. Billy Beane of ""Moneyball"" fame says their teachings are equally relevant in the ballpark.

""If you look at everything Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger say if you take the word 'investing' out and put 'baseball' in every sentence still works"" Beane said at the Tipalti Illuminate tech conference last week according to The San Francisco Business Times.

Spotting bargains

Beane the former general manager of the Oakland Athletics pioneered the use of statistical analysis in baseball. He and his team realized that stats such as foot speed fastball velocity and batting average were overvalued by other teams. Meanwhile older injured or unproven players were undervalued by the market.

Those revelations allowed the Oakland A's to bring in misfits and recruit virtually unknown players on the cheap — and then outperform its richer rivals despite having a fraction of their payroll. Author Michael Lewis profiled Beane in ""Moneyball"" and Brad Pitt played the baseball executive in the movie adaptation of the book.

As for Buffett and Munger they're the chairman and vice-chairman of Berkshire Hathaway — a $600 billion conglomerate that owns business such as Geico and See's Candies and holds multibillion-dollar stakes in public companies such as Apple and Coca-Cola.

A pair of value investors

Both Beane and Buffett prize hard numbers have the patience and discipline to resist overpaying and possess the conviction and contrarian steak required to not conform or cave under pressure.

The two men excel at analyzing prospective investments to determine their future value and aren't afraid to back their bets with millions of dollars.

""Moneyball is really a value-investing book"" Seth Klarman told David Rubenstein in an interview for the Carlyle cofounder's newly released book ""How to Invest: Masters on the Craft.""

""It's about finding value in athletes in baseball players — but those principles apply across areas"" the billionaire investor and Baupost Group CEO said.

Klarman has been heralded as ""the next Warren Buffett"" including by the Berkshire chief himself.

His Baupost fund holds a stake in RedBall Acquisition Corp. a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) co-chaired by Beane which reportedly tried and failed to take the Boston Red Sox public in late 2020 and early 2021.

Beane is clearly a longtime admirer and acolyte of Buffett. ""The hardest thing to find is a good investment"" he tells Lewis in ""Moneyball"" quoting the legendary investor.

Moreover Buffett evolved a value-investing framework established by his college professor and former boss Benjamin Graham. Beane got his grounding in baseball stats or ""sabermetrics"" from Bill James a data whiz and sports historian.

""We're like Warren Buffett and that guy right there is Benjamin Graham"" Beane once told Lewis pointing to the stack of books written by James on the author's lap.

The Omen line-up has long been HP’s most powerful gaming setup and that’s no different here. This laptop comes with a Full HD 16.1-inch display that’s ideal for movies TV and content creation (alongside gaming of course). And with an entire 1 TB of storage you’ll have ample opportunity to install whatever you need.

Users can add a Microsoft 365 Personal or Family Plan at checkout but there’s sadly no discount offered there for doing so.

The laptop has a 4.6 stars out of 5 average rating on Best Buy with praise for the power on offer and the battery life as well as how good the display was. One reviewer ran a series of benchmarks too and was mighty impressed by it.

Frankly I thought moving parts could easily trap tiny kitty paws. And without daily scooping you lose vital information—if a cat isn’t urinating that’s a telltale sign that something bad is happening internally. A difference of a few days could be tragic. I have to keep a close eye on one of my own cats Huxley for this reason.

Now that I’ve tested two automatic litter boxes made with the safety comfort and health of cats in mind I’ve come around to the idea of letting a machine do most of the dirty scooping—at least as long as the pet parents are keenly observant and their kitty likes it.

I have two cats. Even though Huxley is the one whose health is a concern he is not impressed by robots and chooses the $5 storage tub with an opening cut out for easy access. Eely-Rue on the other hand walks right into whatever robot box I bring home that week without concern.

Curious Cat

Photograph: Whisker

Whisker’s Litter-Robot 4 is the company’s fourth iteration of its famous box (we also liked the 3 Connect). This one comes with a much larger entry and sleeker design. Considering that it’s essentially a vessel for clumps of poop and pee I don’t hate looking at it in my living room. There are even two little dim lights you can turn on to illuminate the opening. It was an unbearably cute feature like a bathroom sign. (For more cute cat toilets I suggest peeking at some of the older Litter-Robots which looked like something out of a Star Wars cat cosplay.)

Probably the closest competitor to the Litter-Robot is Leo’s Loo Too litter box (8/10 WIRED Recommends). I also loved how it looked and it’s becoming clearer that cat companies are starting to take home design into account. Leo’s Loo Too is equipped with safety features and connects to an app that displays the cat’s bathroom schedules and weight and the Litter-Robot 4 has similar features.

Weight sensors detect cats as long as they weigh at least three pounds. Laser monitors stop a cleaning cycle if a cat jumps back into the drum or even stands on the step; I put my arm into it without touching anything and it stopped then too. With any electronics there’s a chance of malfunction and after a month it started cleaning multiple times per day when no cat was using it. The company told me it’s aware of these “ghost cycles” and that they will be fixed via a firmware update."

Erins Own 0-21

LAST SEASON THE concession of four goals proved the undoing of Blackrock at the semi-final stage as their Cork hurling ambitions were ended.

They redressed that statistic in some style this afternoon keeping a clean sheet at the back and firing home three classy finishes to the net in the second half courtesy of Tadhg Deasy Michael O’Halloran and Robbie Cotter to advance to a third Cork decider in six seasons.

The 2020 champions were good value for this triumph Clare native Louis Mulqueen at the helm as they booked their spot in the final with nine points to spare over Erins Own.

It was a game defined by those second-half strikes to the net but also one illuminated by a pair of terrific point-scoring displays by the Cork senior forwards on opposing sides.

Robbie O’Flynn was heroic in defeat for Erins Own as he amassed 0-12 seven of those from play while Alan Connolly notched 0-9 from his full-forward berth for Blackrock six shots despatched between the posts from play. The critical difference was the considerable support Connolly received with Deasy (1-4) Cotter (1-3) and O’Halloran (1-2) all sharp and alert in the Blackrock forward line.

In contrast the reliance on O’Flynn to deliver up front for Erins Own was glaring. He struck four points from play in the opening period and hit eight out of the team’s ten second-half points assuming free-taking duties after the interval. Substitute Brian Ramsey raised two white flags late on the only other Erins Own player to score in the second half while Blackrock’s rearguard held firm on the couple of occasions that Erins Own looked on the cusp of grabbing a goal.

This pair held some familiarity with each other. The group stages brought them together in 2020 Blackrock winning by four points and in 2021 Erins Own winning by two points.

The third instalment saw the stakes raised pitching them into a meeting in the knockout arena with Erins Own chasing a first final spot in six years and Blackrock aiming to nail down their third final showing in six campaigns.

There was contrasting approaches to this game as well Erins Own securing the safe passage direct to the semi-final and free of action for four weeks since the group games concluded while Blackrock bounded into this tie a fortnight after a breathless quarter-final win in a penalty shootout over Imokilly.

Backed by the wind Erins Own constructed the early scoreboard advantages 0-5 to 0-3 in the 7th minute and 0-9 to 0-7 clear after 23 minutes. But Blackrock knocked over five of the last seven points in the first half to edge ahead by one at the break.

Then they pounced in the second half for those critical goals creating space impressively as they isolated Connolly and Cotter inside. The first arrived in the 34th minute as John O’Sullivan did superbly to intercept a puckout pop a pass into the path of Deasy who raced clear and drilled home for the game’s opening goal.

The second goal occurred nine minutes later as Shane O’Keeffe fetched a long delivery shrugged aside the defensive challenges to lay it off and O’Halloran whipped in a fiercely-struck shot.

And then Blackrock rounded off the win in style with four minutes left in normal time. It featured a delightful touch by Cotter to control a long ball in the air spin the ball away into space and collect before lashing home the score that rounded off Blackrock’s afternoon.

The champions from the previous season Midleton Sarsfields Glen Rovers and Imokilly would have been ahead in the pecking order of contenders for the title but along the journey that quartet fell by the wayside Midleton and Sarsfields not even making it through to the knockout stage.

That illustrated again how level the playing field has become unlike in Waterford where Ballygunner have been ruling the roost and recently completed the nine-in-a-row down there.

Whilst that is a remarkable achievement it cannot be good for the overall state of the game in that county one club being totally dominant and the rest miles behind. In fact it has almost been a given in recent times that the ‘Gunners are going to end up as champions.

Thankfully that is not the case here on Leeside things are much more open and next Sunday’s last four are all there on merit.

The Barrs are a welcome entry into that category again and a lot of neutrals would not mind if they ended a famine that has now reached 29 years since they last lifted the trophy.

Newtownshandrum have been on the outside looking in since their glory days between 2000 and 2009 but they have always been regarded as a side that can make life very difficult for the best of opponents.

During their period of dominance Erin’s Own were never too far away and in the subsequent years since they won back-to-back titles in 2006 and 2007 they have been always been closer to the top of the pile than anywhere else.

And it’s a measure of their resilience and the dedication of their players that a number of their players from those winning years are still back-boning the team the Murphy brothers ‘Hero’ Eoghan Shay Bowen and Stephen Cronin all truly great club servants.

The Rockies are probably the slight favourites now to regain the crown that they won in 2020 and that is based on the fact that their unit of players have already climbed to the top of the mountain and know what the requirements are to reach that lofty height.

That gives them no guarantee of course and in truth all the four teams contesting Sunday’s two games at Páirc Uí Chaoimh will believe that their time is coming again. The Barrs have been very impressive at times in getting to this stage of the championship and their confidence must be high after victories over Blackrock Sars and Douglas.

In that win over the Rockies at the group stage they exhibited tremendous powers of recovery finding themselves nine points in arrears before the first quarter had run its course before mounting a superb comeback.

They were not overly impressive in seeing off Douglas but they found a way when it mattered as the game aged and dug deep to get the win.

BLEND

There is a nice blend to the side a mix of very experienced players alongside the youthful exuberence of quite a few of the minor team that triumphed two years ago.

Erin’s Own avoided a potentially dangerous quarter-final tie by taking the direct route to the last four and that was a fine achievement in itself gaining that one spot that was on offer.

They will be underdogs going in against the Rockies on Sunday but Martin Bowen has instilled a proper mentality into his players giving them the belief that they are as good as any of the opponents they encounter.

The Rockies are looked upon as having more firepower up front with Alan Connolly Michael O’Halloran Tadhg Deasy Robbie Cotter who was in sublime form against Imokilly and the O'Keeffes.

However Robbie O’Flynn is an outstanding forward for Erin’s Own Conor Lenihan has been showing up well and Eoghan Murphy still poses a dangerous threat if he gains possession.

Newtown are delighted to be back chasing hard again and defeating the Glen the last time out will have been a major confidence booster.

They are believing again down there and there is an assembly of some very good hurlers making that happen.

FIGHTING CHANCE

Tim O’Mahony is really starting to blossom now Jamie Coughlan remains one of the best club forwards in the county Cathal Naughton brings a wealth of experience to the side Conor Twomey and the younger Cormac O’Brien add to the prowess contained in the side and one thing is certain they won’t be found wanting if it comes down to a real dogfight against the Barrs.

The perception thus far is that the championship has not really ignited that the standard has not reached any great heights at times.

At the same time quite a few of the games have provided exciting finishes and there have been some strong performances from some of the younger players Cotter for the Rockies Eoin Downey for the Glen Brian Roche for Bride Rovers in the ‘A’ championship young O’Brien for Newtown Ben O’Connor and Ethan Twomey for the Barrs.

That’s what Pat Ryan is looking for younger guns putting up their hand to add freshness to Cork set-up.

This is the real business end of the campaign now time to really prove your credentials when the stakes are getting much higher.

A Rockies-Barrs final would be a very attractive proposition for many but Newtown and Erin’s Own have their own history from their past jousts.

What is needed most of all on Sunday is two cracking games that go down to the wire raising the height of the bar for Cork club hurling.

Without any great conviction we’ll predict an all-city southside final a throwback to other times.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNoZXhhbWluZXIuY29tL3Nwb3J0L2dhYS9hcmlkLTQwOTY5MDQwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mulqueen: Cork need to be looking at forwards like Robbie Cotter and Tadhg Deasy,"Blackrock hurling manager Louis Mulqueen hailed the talents of Robbie Cotter and Tadhg Deasy after Sunday’s Cork Premier SHC nine-point victory over Erin’s Own.

He was reflecting on his team’s performance and said the two attacking forwards could play their part in the Cork senior hurling squad.

They contributed 1-3 and 1-4 respectively to a scoreline where 3-18 out of 3-21 came from open play.

‘Looking at Robbie’s form this year I am not telling other people their job but Pat Ryan needs to be looking at people like Robbie. He has got the feet and the eye. It is just for his confidence to come.

“I think Tadhg Deasy is going in that direction too. They are good young lads coming on the scene. I am only seeing it in my first year. Cork have a lot of talent coming though.

“What I like lately is there is a bit of physicality in this championship. I think that will stand to Cork senior hurlers as you go along. There are lots of hits out there. There is no-one looking for frees. Everybody is taking them and giving them. That is the way Munster hurling is. When you look at Clare Tipp Limerick it is a big physical game. Cork are now going in that right direction.” Even though Blackrock eased past Erin’s Own following a powerful second-half he felt there is still work to do.

“It was workmanlike we got over the line. I wouldn’t still be happy with the hurling we are playing. That wouldn’t win a county final. We got three good goals in the second-half which gave distance between a very determined team that hung in all the time. It was point for point. We scored and they would come back and get a point or two.

“It was a tight game up until we got the first goal. Then we got a bit of daylight. Then we got a second goal and then you knew you were a little bit more comfortable. We felt if we played today we were going to win.

“I wasn’t overly happy with the first-half. They were getting all the breaks. Our plan was to win the puck outs but they were getting the breaks when we should have been getting scores.

“We needed to reassess that at half-time. The ball wasn’t going quick enough into Alan (Connolly) and Robbie (Cotter) but when it went in the second-half they did the damage.

“It was a job well-done. Not overly happy that we have played to our potential yet. We have serious work to do to match whoever comes out of the second semi-final.

“We got out of a group of death. We won a very good quarter-final and a tough semi-final. We still have to play if we want to win a county final.” Their quarter-final win over Imokilly after penalties stood to them.

“Erin’s Own had no game going into today. If you look at ours we had great battles. They were fought to the wire. our fellas knew there was stuff in the tank. There was energy there. The Imokilly game was a roller-coaster of emotions. And that really helped. Our lads have learned from the games.”"

The son of a dry-goods store owner growing up in Philadelphia Schwarzman recalled his first trip to the Start-up Nation as a 14-year-old.

“Israel has an incredible entrepreneurial community” Schwarzman 75 said. “Of course it had to because when it started there was almost nothing there. Everything had to be invented by somebody.”

That same year back in the US he started his first business – a lawn-mowing operation employing his younger twin brothers to mow while he brought in the clients.

Today with an estimated net worth of $35 billion Schwarzman is CEO of Blackstone one of the world’s leading investment firms. His first major donation to Israel was in 2018 when he gave the National Library $10 million. Last year Blackstone opened its first office in the Jewish state.

Schwarzman who is known to joke about his interfaith marriage with Christine Hearst a Roman Catholic fund-raises for an array of Jewish and Catholic causes such the Archdiocese of New York and the American Jewish Committee. He sat down with The Jerusalem Post for a Rosh Hashanah interview.

A few years ago you made a generous donation to a library in Israel. Have you given any other philanthropic support to Israel? What do you look for when making such philanthropic decisions?

I gave to the National Library for a variety of reasons one of which is my friendship with Jacob Rothschild who was organizing this project. I thought it was a good project to name a part of the library as a space for educational programs and activities for Jewish and Arab schoolchildren and educators. It’s a place where they can learn together and share cultures. They keep sending me pictures. I guess the project will be done sometime this year.

My first trip to Israel was in 1964. I spent a month there on a trip my grandfather paid for as his bar mitzvah gift to me. I was really fascinated. It was a new country at that point. I kept looking for the trees that we gave money in Hebrew school to have planted in Israel. But I saw a lot of desert and was wondering where all my trees were.

That was an interesting start. My grandfather and my father supported an orphanage in Jerusalem. A few years ago I gave them money to build a new gymnasium and locker room. I named it after my grandfather and father. I remember as a child watching my grandfather packing up [donations] for Israel. I would ask him ‘What are you doing?’ He told me we have an obligation to support other people who aren’t as fortunate as we were. So I’ve continued that support as a third generation.

Last year Blackstone opened an office in Israel to invest primarily in Israeli growth companies. What is the opportunity you see for Blackstone in Israel?

Israel is one of the most innovative cultures in the world. Israeli technology is one of the fastest growing of any place. We are very interested in that kind of growth. We opened our office at the top of evaluations for those types of companies. We found that there was a good deal of competition some of which didn’t even care what they paid.

I said at the time we probably won’t get very much done quickly and that will be a wonderful thing for us because prices will come down and people will want to be with a stable large firm like ourselves where we can help people develop businesses. We are quite lucky in terms of when we chose to open in Israel because prices are really collapsing now and we are able to provide capital to some of the Israeli companies. Israel is a winner in the new tech company area.

You have invested around the world through many market cycles. How do you view the current economic landscape? Are you concerned about a recession?

The current landscape is challenging. Markets try to rally and each time they do the Federal Reserve makes an announcement saying ‘I don’t think you’re listening to us. We’re going to raise rates quite high to decrease inflation.’

If the Federal Reserve is serious about that the US is going to need a very significant slowdown. It’s already happening in Europe and China. It’s really up to the Federal Reserve to figure out what happens. To achieve its stated objective it would be difficult to avoid a recession.

Last year your book What It Takes was published in Israel. What do you hope Israeli readers learn from it?

Israel has an incredible entrepreneurial community. Entrepreneurs always have a difficult time starting but they always have faith in their idea (which is why they start) only to find they have to scramble to be successful. That’s the experience I’ve had in my life doing repeated things.

I’ve been told the book is perfect for people who want to try to do new things and want to be successful. It teaches leaders how to conceptualize what they’re doing how to deal with and learn from failure how to hire people and how to be mostly stable through the extreme ups and downs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9jb21wYW5pZXMvbmV3cy9ieWp1cy1wYXlzLTIzNC1taWxsaW9uLXRvLWJsYWNrc3RvbmUtcmVsYXRlZC10by1hYWthc2gtZGVhbC1yZXBvcnQtMTE2NjM5ODExOTc2NDMuaHRtbNIBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL25ld3MvYnlqdXMtcGF5cy0yMzQtbWlsbGlvbi10by1ibGFja3N0b25lLXJlbGF0ZWQtdG8tYWFrYXNoLWRlYWwtcmVwb3J0L2FtcC0xMTY2Mzk4MTE5NzY0My5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Byju's pays $234 million to Blackstone related to Aakash deal: Report | Mint,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9jb21wYW5pZXMvbmV3cy9ieWp1cy1wYXlzLTIzNC1taWxsaW9uLXRvLWJsYWNrc3RvbmUtcmVsYXRlZC10by1hYWthc2gtZGVhbC1yZXBvcnQtMTE2NjM5ODExOTc2NDMuaHRtbNIBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL25ld3MvYnlqdXMtcGF5cy0yMzQtbWlsbGlvbi10by1ibGFja3N0b25lLXJlbGF0ZWQtdG8tYWFrYXNoLWRlYWwtcmVwb3J0L2FtcC0xMTY2Mzk4MTE5NzY0My5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000026743902860>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Edtech firm Byju’s has cleared $230 million payment that was due to private equity investment firm Blackstone for acquiring a majority stake in test preparatory firm Aakash Educational Services according to sources privy to the development.

Byju’s had acquired Aakash in April for about $950 million.

“Byju’s paid $230 million to Blackstone for acquiring a stake in Aakash” the source told PTI.

While it cleared payments that were due to the founder of Aakash in July the payment of Blackstone was deferred based on a mutual agreement.

Founders of Aakash and Blackstone continue to hold a minority stake in the firm.

Acquisition of Aakash has been positive for Byju’s business.

Payment to Blackstone and non-closure of $800 million funding round due to non-payment of committed investment from Sumeru Ventures and Oxshott have been two main issues that raised questions on Byju’s business performance.

Byju’s co-founder and CEO Byju Raveendran at the time of announcing the result had said that the contractual commitment of the two investment firms is still there but the fund has not come and these entities have not made any investment in the last six months.

Byju’s booked a loss of ₹4588 crore for the fiscal year ended March 31 2021 19 times more than the preceding fiscal.

The losses in the 2020-21 fiscal widened from ₹231.69 crore in 2019-20. Revenues during FY21 dropped to ₹2428 crore from ₹2511 crore in FY20.

But in the following fiscal ending March 31 2022 the company said revenue soared four-fold to ₹10000 crore but it did not reveal profit or loss numbers for that year.

Byju’s said the losses widened in FY21 mainly on account of deferment of some revenue and losses incurred from WhiteHat Jr.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVxdWl0eXBhbmRpdC5jb20vYmxhY2tzdG9uZS1zZWxscy00MDAtbW4tc3Rha2UtaW4taW5kaWFuLXJlaXQtZW1iYXNzeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Blackstone Sells $400 Mn Stake in Indian REIT Embassy,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.equitypandit.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /blackstone-sells-400-mn-stake-in-indian-reit-embassy/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000267439022C0>, 'Connection to www.equitypandit.com timed out.

But how good is it to buy and hold companies that just hold shares of other good companies? For example investors of Tata Investment Corporation (TIC) found the last one month to be exceedingly rewarding with 60 per cent returns . The stock has also returned over 90 per cent in the last year. Prior to this run-up TIC similar to many other holding companies in India was trading at a significant holding company (holdco) discount for years. Holdco discount refers to the markdown in value of underlying assets owned while valuing a holding company. This markdown can be attributed to reasons such as inefficiencies due to extra corporate layer interests of promoters and minority shareholders not being aligned lower liquidty of the stock etc.

In the case of TIC this discount was a little over 55 per cent a month back and around 60 per cent a year back. It has now reduced to 26 per cent post this run-up. Thus it is primarily the expectation of value unlocking to reduce the discount at some point in time in future that makes a case for owning holding company stocks.

Holdcos in India

Amongst the top 2000 companies by market cap in India there are around 15 well-known holdcos (excluding bank holding companies such as Equitas Ujjivan ). In this context we are restricting our definition of holdcos to companies that don’t have significant standalone operations and derive almost their entire value from their underlying investee company. These holdcos are all part of business groups with investments primarily in group entities (except TIC which has significant investments in non-Tata group companies as well)

Out of these 15 companies the holdco discount ranges from as high as 85 per cent (Bombay Burmah and Kalyani Investments) to a premium of 30 per cent (Rane Holdings) ( see infographics). A premium is a rare instance though and could either be due to market perception of the actual value of unquoted investments (usually carried at cost in books) or could be a case of mispricing by the market. Further except in the case of Rane TIC and Hexa Tradex in all other companies the holdco discount is above 50 per cent. Over the last one year there has only been a marginal improvement in holdco discount at an aggregate level (see infographics). The simple average holdco discount for these 15 companies is at 57 per cent now while it was at 60 per cent same time last year.

Now coming to the important question – are discounts in excess of 50 per cent justified in valuing a holdco? Further what justifies holdco discount as high as 85 per cent? In the developed markets there is hardly an example of such high holdco discounts. In the Indian context in most cases holdcos are entities through which promoters can retain majority control of the underlying investee group company. In developed markets promoters rare as they are use differential voting rights to exercise control and the case for a holdco to retain control is not common.

The reason for low appetite for holdcos in India could be investor perception that promoters may not be interested in value unlocking of holdcos as they may primarily want to wield control over group companies via holdcos.

Does that mean there is no opportunity for investors in holdcos? Far from it. There are two ways in which investors can benefit from buying holdcos bought at sufficient discounts. Even if holdco discount remains intact if underlying investee company continues to perform well and its shares do well then the holdco too can provide similar returns tracking its performance. Add to it the prospects of holdco discount shrinking over a period of time; investors could then get to make compounded returns. For example if the underlying asset moves up by 50 per cent in a specific period and during the same time the holdco discount shrinks from 80 per cent to 50 per cent the holdco investor gets to make 275 per cent returns. Thus while there is no guarantee of returns there may be merit in considering holdco companies trading at extreme discounts provided other fundamental factors support the investment case.

Investors need to note that in considering a holdco company the primary way to value it is based on underlying value of its holdings. While holdco companies have income in the form of dividends and interest income from their investments (equity and preference share investments) these are not material in most cases as dividend yields in India are low by global standards. Thus the income the holdco receives from subsidiary/associate companies may not be reflective of its value although this appears to be the way markets are valuing companies where discounts are as high as 80 per cent. Ratios like PE or P/B may not be much helpful.

Other things being equal tracking the holdco discount comparing it with historical average and extremes is important. Over the last year as mentioned above the trends in holdco discount have been mixed with discounts reducing for some and increasing for others. In some cases the discount rates have stayed in a narrow range through the year as well. Thus it appears the volatility of the last year shift of market mood in favour of value stocks have not made much of a difference in this space for now at an aggregate level.

Guidebook for investors

Keeping the above factors in mind here are a few ways in which investors can approach holding cos :

One have a long-term view. If success in investing is a game of patience then success in investing in holdcos is a game of ultra-patience. TIC’s own long-term investors would have realised this as the shrinkage in company’s holdco discount happened after many years. Another example is Hexa Tradex (now in the process of getting delisted with promoters buying out minority shareholders) which has given 5x returns in the last 10 years and a stunning 26x returns from Covid lows! Hexa Tradex is a holdco whose value is mainly derived from its investments in Jindal Steel and Power.

While these returns are assessed with full benefit of hindsight the analysis highlights the opportunities in buying holdcos at extreme discounts as well as the need for patience. Since its listing in 2012 after being demerged from a Jindal group company Hexa Tradex only in recent short period (January 2021-August 2021) outperformed the investee company resulting in shrinkage of holdco discount.

Two assess the business and the valuation of the underlying investee company. There may not be any benefit in buying a holdco company at deep discount if the underlying investee company is overvalued. The best time to buy would be if the investee company is undervalued and the holdco discount is higher than historical average.

Three analyse the corporate governance track record of the promoter group.Are their business activities and disclosures transparent? Do they have a good track record of addressing minority shareholder concerns? This needs to be an uncompromising factor in buying holdcos. While promoters with good corporate governance track record may want to continue to use holdcos to wield control over group companies one can atleast be hopeful that they would be more receptive to minority shareholder suggestions for value unlocking.

For example Sundaram-Clayton which is the holding company of TVS Motors announced an internal restructuring exercise early this year to unlock value and also return excess cash to shareholders. While the holdco discount remains high such initiatives lend confidence that promoters will factor creating value for minority shareholders as well over the long term. Consistency in such actions can result in compression of holdco discounts.

Four keep an eye on the regulatory landscape. For example according to a closed-end PMS fund that aims to tap opportunities from higher-than-warranted holdco discounts opportunities may arise in this space as promoters feel the heat of the change in regulatory landscape. In their opinion the thrust by MCA and SEBI on higher compliance requirements time and again could prompt promoters to consider delisting their holding companies leading to value unlocking.

Five  something that has happened in promotor groups many times in the past is that as ownership requires to get split across multiple family members restructuring and value unlocking may become inevitable at some point in time. This has happened in groups like Bajaj (twice) and Reliance. Thus for an ultra-long-term investor this too is a factor that may work in favour.

Six have an exit plan. If the holdco discount has shrunk significantly below historical norms in a short span of time or has gone into a premium in the absence of any catalyst then there may be some mean reversion in the discount. One must be alert to booking profits as well. For example today investors in TIC must assess whether it is worth holding to stock any more when the holdco discount has reduced significantly.

Taking a leaf out of US markets

While we have many best practices of our own adopting best practices from other markets can help address some of the distortions in our markets like the way it exists in holdco valuations. The value in these companies remaining unrealised benefits no one and rather may also cause distortions in the pricing of the underlying investee company as many investors shun the indirect route of investing via holding company in favour of directly investing in the underlying company even if it’s overvalued.

Tracking stock

The concept of tracking stock that exists in the US helps overcome this distortion there. A tracking stock is a form of equity that tracks specific segments or division in a company. These are traded in exchanges like any other equity instrument. For example if regulations allow this promoters can issue tracking stocks that reflect economic interest in the underlying investee company to the minority shareholders. The tracking stock can be issued without voting rights or lower voting rights and that way promoters can continue to control the group companies while minority shareholders can benefit from value unlocking. The instrument of tracking stock was extensively used by billionaire and media mogul John Malone. His business empire under the Liberty brand has a long successful track record of value creation through acquisitions/investments and consolidating his control while distributing economic ownership via tracking stock.

EDGARTOWN — Alvia Wilson has heard the carping from some TV talking heads and politicians since Florida Governor Ron DeSantis flew 48 migrants to Martha’s Vineyard recently: Her island home is being pilloried as an exclusionary haven for the white rich and elite.

Wilson resides in the other Vineyard where many of the 20000 year-round residents struggle to make ends meet housing is desperately scarce and increasingly unaffordable and the growing number of immigrants is rapidly diversifying the population.

She and her husband a landscaper made the difficult decision to split up their family to live with relatives and others after the landlord increased the rent on their three-bedroom home to $2600 a month. Credit-card bills aren’t being paid Wilson’s phone was disconnected and she is worried that her car will be repossessed.

“I’ve lived on the island for the majority of my life and this is the worst I’ve seen it” said Wilson a US citizen and native of Jamaica who is staying in Falmouth while she seeks housing on the island. “I am an immigrant. I work hard. I’ve never been arrested. I became a citizen. I never looked for handouts. But I need help.”

The ploy by DeSantis a Republican who might run for president brought national attention to the island where residents rushed to aid the 48 migrants many of whom said they had been lured aboard chartered flights in Texas with false promises of jobs and housing in Massachusetts.

Beyond the spotlight many islanders bristled at the suggestion — circulated in conservative media — that they had quickly turned their backs on the migrants mostly Venezuelans who arrived unannounced Sept. 14 and were transferred to temporary housing on Cape Cod two days later. The opposite occurred; locals immediately mobilized to help.

“I was frustrated because a lot of people were saying things that weren’t true that we’re just white rich people here and have no diversity. People don’t see our struggles” said Maura Morrison case manager for Harbor Homes of Martha’s Vineyard an umbrella organization for the island’s homeless prevention programs.

It’s a struggle that Morrison a single mother with two children can relate to personally: She cannot afford to buy a home on the island where she was born and raised. Although the Vineyard’s population grew by 24 percent from 2010 to 2020 its housing stock increased by only 2 percent.

In addition the Vineyard’s average weekly wage of $1094 in 2020 was 70 percent of the state average and its median home price — now approaching $1.3 million — was more than double the state’s according to an assessment of the island’s housing needs.

“We have people living in the woods who call me all the time looking for shelter” said Morrison who also serves as the Dukes County homeless prevention coordinator.

Exacerbating the problem has been an increase in summer rentals listed on websites such as AirBnb housing advocates said. These transactions have been lucrative enough to prompt some homeowners to take their properties off the market during the colder months further shrinking the pool of available rentals.

And as the wealth gap widens on the Vineyard racial and ethnic diversity also is increasing.

Nearly a quarter of the year-round population is now multiracial according to the latest census.

The island’s year-round Black population also increased during that time jumping 67 percent to 798 people in 2020 from 477 people in 2010 nearly three times the growth rate of white residents. And in the summer when the island’s population can soar to 200000 throngs of Black families continue to vacation here as they have for decades.

The Vineyard’s schools also are a barometer of change.

The number of public school students receiving help with English has more than doubled since 2016 to 472 students in 2021 from 210 six years ago according to information provided by Dukes County manager Martina Thornton. A total of 94 percent of those pupils hear Portuguese in the home a reflection of the island’s burgeoning Brazilian community.

Morrison was startled by the changes she saw three years ago when she returned to live on the Vineyard.

“When I was in school I could count on my hand about five African Americans and a small handful of Brazilians in the whole high school” Morrison said.

The growing diversity reflects a much different Vineyard than the image concocted by some on the national stage. Fox News host Tucker Carlson for example issued this sarcastic tweet after the migrants’ arrival:

“For hundreds of years Martha’s Vineyard has suffered from the soul-crushing effects of its own whiteness. Island residents understood there was only one cure. They badly needed diversity. Relief finally arrived from an unlikely source yesterday: Ron DeSantis.”

In another example a plane circled the island Monday towing a banner that read: “Vineyard Hypocrites” an apparent reference to the migrants’ transfer from Edgartown to Joint Base Cape Cod where more humanitarian resources and shelter were available.

Sue Diverio executive director of Harbor Homes said that she like Morrison feels the crunch of Vineyard living.

“I make a good salary but I can’t afford to buy a home here” said Diverio who is paying rent to share a home with another woman. “And if you can find something year-round that’s amazing.”

One of Diverio’s clients a former model named Suzanne said she lived in her car for three weeks once was placed in protective custody by island police and is working to regain her footing at Harbor Homes’ transitional housing for women.

The housing crisis “stultified me. I couldn’t imagine that there could be this many homeless” Suzanne said. “Even if you had the money you couldn’t find a place unless you knew somebody.”

Diverio and Morrison praised the island’s response to the migrants’ arrival.

“Everybody jumped on board. Everyone was called to action. People donated resources were given and there were no issues” Morrison said.

To Esther Reid 55 a native of Jamaica who works as a waitress the migrants’ reception mirrored her experience over 22 years on the island.

“Oh God it’s always been very welcoming” said Reid who is from Oak Bluffs. “They’re very helpful on this island.”

For the Rev. Vincent “Chip” Seadale rector of St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church in Edgartown the response was “a thing of wondrous beauty.”

The migrants were sheltered at the small church for two nights while an outpouring of aid — food clothing and offers of medical help — prompted police to request that no more donations be brought to the site.

“The islanders all understood we have a role to play in supporting each other” Seadale said. “They knew what to do right away. We used all the experience we’ve gained over many years.”

“A lot of that has to do with the island mentality” the rector added. “We can’t get off-island to get many of the things that the rest of America takes for granted. We have to do it ourselves.”

For Seadale the perception that “we’re all rich we’re all liberal” on the Vineyard is baffling. In reality he added “no one is all anything.”

Army Cpl. Joseph J. Puopolo 19 of East Boston was accounted for in August according to a statement Friday from the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency.

It was the news his family — including his now 99-year-old sister Elizabeth Fiorentini — has been awaiting for decades Fiorentini’s grandson and Puopolo’s grandnephew Richard Graham said in a telephone interview Saturday.

“We have all heard about him and we all knew of him and we all knew he was a war hero. We always hoped we’d find him” he said. “But I never thought my grandmother would be here for it.”

Fiorentini had not seen her brother since she was in her 20s and had mixed reactions on hearing the news that his remains had been identified.

“In her mind it was like he died again” Graham said.

Puopolo an artilleryman with the 8th Army was reported missing in action on Dec. 2 1950 after his unit attempted to withdraw from Kunu-ri North Korea following the Battle of Ch’ongch’on according to the military. Four former POWs reported in 1953 that Puopolo had died at a POW camp in February 1951.

After the war the sides exchanged remains but not all could be identified and those were buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu the agency said.

A set of previously unidentified remains were disinterred in December 2019 and identified as being those of Puopolo through dental and anthropological analysis mitochondrial DNA analysis and circumstantial evidence the agency said.

The family hopes to hold a burial service for Puopolo in another month or so either in a family plot in Malden or the veterans’ cemetery in Bourne Graham said. Puopolo was one of six children all of whom had large families of their own and as many as 60 or 70 relatives might show.

“He has not been forgotten” Graham said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

These data were presented at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) 2022 World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC).1 With a median follow-up of 45.3 months however this trend was not evident in the all-randomized stage II–IIIA or intent-to-treat population which included patients with stage IB disease.

Findings from the first prespecified interim analysis of overall survival showed the highest magnitude of overall survival in patients whose tumor cells had PD-L1 expression of at least 50% and who received the PD-L1 inhibitor authors of the study reported.



Enriqueta Felip PhD

“This overall survival analysis shows a promising trend in favor of atezolizumab over best supportive care in the stage II–IIIA population with PD-L1 expression of at least 1% and a clinically meaningful improvement in the stage II–IIIA population with PD-L1 tumor expression of at least 50% with overall survival improvements observed across most subgroups” said Enriqueta Felip PhD Head of the Thoracic Cancer Unit Oncology Department at Vall d’Hebron University Hospital Barcelona. “We will continue to follow patients in this study as data mature.”

For the IMpower010 trial patients with stage II–IIIA NSCLC underwent complete surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Dr. Felip and colleagues then randomly assigned them to receive immunotherapy with atezolizumab or no further treatment.

A previous analysis of disease-free survival showed a significant benefit with adjuvant atezolizumab vs best supportive care in resected NSCLC following platinum-based chemotherapy. Based on these findings atezolizumab was approved as adjuvant treatment after complete resection and platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with stage II–IIIA NSCLC and PD-L1 tumor expression ≥ 1% in several countries including the United States China and Japan. In the European Union Canada Switzerland and the United Kingdom atezolizumab was approved for stage II–IIIA NSCLC and PD-L1 tumor expression > 50% (with EGFR/ALK-positive disease excluded in the European Union).

Data presented during the 2022 WCLC evaluated overall survival and safety with 13 months of additional follow-up to the previous interim analysis of disease-free survival.

Greatest Benefit in PD-L1–High Tumors

With a median follow-up of 46 months the interim analysis demonstrated a trend toward improved overall survival among patients with PD-L1–positive (tumor expression of at least 1%) stage II–IIIA NSCLC (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.71). At 5 years 76.8% of patients in the atezolizumab arm were alive compared with 67.5% of patients in the control arm. According to Dr. Felip however no separation in the curves was observed for the intent-to-treat population or the all-randomized stage II–IIIA populations (HR = 0.95).

Among patients with PD-L1–positive stage II–IIIA disease a subgroup analysis of overall survival showed a trend toward improved survival in nearly all subgroups regardless of tumor histology or stage. The importance of the PD-L1 biomarker was most pronounced in patients with PD-L1 expression of at least 50% (HR = 0.43). Patients with PD-L1 expression between 1% and 49% had a hazard ratio of 0.95 whereas those with PD-L1–negative tumors had a hazard ratio of 1.36.

KEY POINTS Interim analysis of the phase III IMpower010 trial of atezolizumab vs best supportive care in resected non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) showed an overall survival trend favoring atezolizumab in patients with stage II–IIIA disease and PD-L1–positive tumors (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.71).

Patients treated with adjuvant immunotherapy had an overall safety profile consistent with the previous analysis and no new safety signals were observed.

IMpower010 will continue to the final disease-free analysis with further overall survival analyses of at least 10 years’ follow-up.

“In patients with 50% or higher PD-L1 tumor expression excluding [those with EGFR and ALK aberrations] median survival was not reached in either of the treatment arms” Dr. Felip reported. “At 5 years the overall survival rate was 84.8% for patients with stage II–IIIA disease and PD-L1 expression of at least 50% vs 67.5% in the control arm.”

Patients treated with adjuvant immunotherapy had an overall safety profile consistent with the previous analysis and no new safety signals were observed. “These data support the previously reported positive benefit-risk profile of adjuvant atezolizumab” Dr. Felip concluded.

Red Bull announced in the build-up to the Miami Grand Prix that Newey would leave the team early next year calling time on his 19-year tenure as Red Bull’s design chief.

‘Are you sure you’re going to say no when he knocks on the door?’

Amassing 12 titles with the Milton Keynes squad Newey’s tally for both the Drivers’ and Constructors’ titles sits at 25 with a list that includes McLaren’s last championship successes.

Newey won the double with McLaren and Mika Hakkinen in 1998 and retained the Drivers’ Championship the following season.

But despite his cars winning championships at Williams McLaren and Red Bull McLaren CEO Brown says he has no interest in signing the 65-year-old.

Speaking to Sky Sports in the wake of Newey’s announcement Brown declared: “Our plans are to keep doing what we are doing I’m really happy with everything that Andrea [Stella] the whole technical team are doing.”

He doubled down on that in the Beyond the Grid Podcast saying: “We’re very happy with what we have.

“Obviously he’s the most successful designer of all time. It’s fascinating that he’s left but let’s see what he does.”

Dutch pundit Mol calls bull on that.

“I think that’s such bullshit” he told Ziggo Sport’s Race Café.

“Are you sure you’re going to say no when he knocks on the door? What team would say if Newey knocked on the door ‘No don’t do that!’ That’s not going to happen.”

‘He’s not going to Ferrari I’ll stick my hand up for that’

As for what’s next for Newey that’s been the hot debate since the Miami announcement with reports claiming Ferrari are leading the running to sign the design guru.

He’s reportedly had at least one talk with a representative of the Scuderia with Sky’s Craig Slater claiming those who know the Briton say it is a “genuine” possibility.

Mol though reckons retirement is the most likely option for the “tired” designer. “He’s not going to Ferrari anyway I’ll stick my hand up for that” he continued.

“I think he’s totally in the clear if you see what he says. You can only take his word for it with Ferrari. He really isn’t going to Ferrari to be very busy again and travel around the world 24 weekends a year.”

When the Ferrari rumours were put to Newey he said while he is “flattered” that 2025 Ferrari signing Lewis Hamilton wants to work with him for now he has no plans for his future.

“I think Mandy my wife and the dogs we’ll probably go travelling we’ll probably get a motorhome or something go down through France and just enjoy life” he said.

“And then maybe at some point I don’t know when I’ll be standing in the shower and say ‘Right this is going to be the next adventure’. But right now there is no plan.”

Russ Curtis a spokesperson for nonprofit organization International Bird Rescue said the organization has recovered sick pelicans in Southern California too. Since April 20 the organization has cared for more than 235 pelicans at its wildlife rescue centers in Fairfield in the Bay Area and San Pedro in Los Angeles.

“They’re in really poor physical shape. They’re starving and they haven’t gotten enough nutrition” Curtis said in an interview with KQED. Some of the injuries are from fishing lines and hooks.

“When there’s not the fishing stock that they can find they take chances around fishing piers and fishing boats and places where there are people with fishing tackle” he continued.

Sick birds have been spotted off Alameda Point in the Bay Area which is a roosting ground for brown pelicans. But many were found in places where people don’t usually find these stocky large seabirds. On city streets and parking lots for example. One bird in Santa Cruz attempted to walk into a bar Curtis said. The majority of pelicans at the Fairfield center came from the Monterey and Santa Cruz areas.

It’s not clear why the birds are having trouble finding food.

“It’s still a mystery” Curtis said. “We haven’t had any conclusive proof of what’s really going out in the wild right now.”

The Los Angeles Times reported there was a similar spike in malnourished brown pelicans along California’s coast in 2022 with no clear cause. International Bird Rescue reported other spikes in starving brown pelicans in 2010 and 2012.

During these prior incidents International Bird Rescue cared for pelicans for weeks.

“We’re not going to release them back out to an area where there is not proper fish stock for them to feed on” said Curtis. “They would just rebound and probably come back into care at some point.”

While they wait for more information Curtis said wildlife rescue centers like theirs — which rely on public donations — are feeling a financial squeeze.

“At this point we’re going through about 500 pounds of fish a day just at this center and that’s about $1000 a day” he said.

Curtis said the public can help by keeping an eye out for unwell brown pelicans.

“As you enjoy the warm weather and you’re at the beach or along the coast if you see a pelican that’s out of place or might have a fishing line injury if you see something say something” Curtis said. “Let your local animal control know that there’s a bird in distress and let’s get it into care as soon as we can.”

If you see an injured or unwell pelican you can reach International Bird Rescue’s Bird HelpLine at 866-SOS-BIRD or get help by calling your local animal control.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlL3dpZG93LWJyb3duLXMtZGFuYnVyeS1uZXctb3duZXItZmFjZWxpZnQtMTk0NTEyNzEucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New owner taking over Danbury's Widow Brown's roadhouse plans 'lovely facelift',ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.newstimes.com/news/article/widow-brown-s-danbury-new-owner-facelift-19451271.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlL3dpZG93LWJyb3duLXMtZGFuYnVyeS1uZXctb3duZXItZmFjZWxpZnQtMTk0NTEyNzEucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3RoZWhpbGwuY29tL2hvbWVuZXdzL2FkbWluaXN0cmF0aW9uLzQ2NTk0MTgtYmlkZW4tdG8tbWVldC13aXRoLWJyb3duLXYtYm9hcmQtcGxhaW50aWZmcy1kdXJpbmctd2Vlay1vZi1lbmdhZ2VtZW50LXdpdGgtYmxhY2stY29tbXVuaXR5L9IBkwFodHRwczovL3RoZWhpbGwuY29tL2hvbWVuZXdzL2FkbWluaXN0cmF0aW9uLzQ2NTk0MTgtYmlkZW4tdG8tbWVldC13aXRoLWJyb3duLXYtYm9hcmQtcGxhaW50aWZmcy1kdXJpbmctd2Vlay1vZi1lbmdhZ2VtZW50LXdpdGgtYmxhY2stY29tbXVuaXR5L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Biden to meet with Brown v.

Las Vegas Boulevard the epicenter of American gambling is dominated by New York landlords.

Now a big company from Las Vegas wants a bite of the Big Apple.

New York real estate heavyweight Related Companies announced recently that it’s partnering with Wynn Resorts to pursue a casino license with plans for a project in Related’s Hudson Yards development in Manhattan.

Their news release did not provide specifics on the project saying only it would be a “resort entertainment and gaming destination along the Hudson River” and that it would be near the sprawling Javits Center convention facility.

But Wynn’s venture marks a reversal of sorts from what Las Vegas has seen in recent years: New Yorkers snapping up property in Southern Nevada’s most lucrative stretch of real estate.

Of course Las Vegas has long been a destination for out-of-town developers house flippers and commercial-property landlords. (I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve written about Southern California firms buying apartment complexes here.)

But when it comes to the Strip one city in particular has emerged as the main source of buyers lately.

New York-based Vici Properties a Caesars Entertainment spinoff vastly expanded its holdings in Las Vegas when it acquired casino giant MGM Resorts International’s real estate spinoff in a $17 billion-plus deal.

As part of the buyout which closed this spring Vici acquired several MGM-operated properties along Las Vegas Boulevard including The Mirage Park MGM New York-New York Luxor and Excalibur.

Before that Vici also acquired casino operator Las Vegas Sands Corp.’s real estate on the Strip — The Venetian Palazzo and The Venetian Expo — for $4 billion in a deal that closed in February.

All told Vici now owns 660 acres of real estate along the Strip “the most economically productive street in the world” the company said this spring.

Another major landlord from New York is investment giant Blackstone whose portfolio includes Bellagio Aria and Vdara. It purchased those three for more than $8 billion combined and leased them back to MGM Resorts.

It also owns two other MGM-operated properties — Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand — in a joint venture with Vici.

Blackstone had kicked off a real estate buying spree in Southern Nevada after the economy crashed a decade or so ago and it owned and operated The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas for years.

It bought the flashy hotel-casino in 2014 for $1.73 billion and sold it for $5.65 billion. The sale which closed in May marked the “most profitable single asset sale ever” for Blackstone’s real estate business the company previously said.

Meanwhile New York’s Dreamscape Companies acquired the off-Strip Rio for $516.3 million in 2019 and New York investment firm Gindi Capital after it teamed up to buy Showcase Mall several years ago purchased more property along Las Vegas Boulevard in 2019 for $172 million.

Last month Clark County commissioners approved Gindi’s plans for a new three-story retail complex spanning more than 300000 square feet on that roughly 9.5-acre site — which Gindi had acquired from Spectrum Group Management another New York firm.

Related Wynn’s casino partner in New York is no stranger to Las Vegas either. Among other ventures here it partnered on the development of World Market Center downtown’s massive furniture-showroom hall that was acquired in 2017 by (drum roll) Blackstone.

Time will tell whether other Las Vegas firms plant a flag in New York. But odds are a company there is bound to buy something here first.

Of course most people know about the high rollers and casino whales extremely rich individuals who love nothing more than gambling millions of dollars in a single session.

However the richest people at casinos are usually not the gamblers but the casino owners themselves.

Out of all these owners there are a few who are at the very top of the US casino business.

These individuals are some of the wealthiest people in the States and many of them own multiple resorts that are worth billions of dollars.

Some were born into the business others only got involved with casinos much later in life.

However all are extremely ambitious and have built a reputation as some of the best businessmen and businesswomen in the country.

1. Sheldon Adelson – $33.5 Billion

Adelson made and lost millions of dollars multiple times in his adult life.

He only really established his fortune after launching Comdex a Las Vegas computer trade exhibition in 1979.

Adelson began building his casino empire the Las Vegas Sands Corporation in 1989 when he purchased the Sands Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas for $128 million.

After honeymooning in Venice Adelson decided to demolish the Sands and build a new casino-hotel in its place. The Venetian opened in 1999 and cost $1.5 billion to construct.

Adelson took his casino empire to Asia in the early 2000s building Sands Macau the island’s first Las Vegas-style casino in 2004.

During the same year Adelson decided to take Las Vegas Sands Corporation public. After he did his net worth reportedly grew by $1 million every hour for two years!

Other developments soon followed including The Venetian Macau which opened in August 2007 and cost $2.4 billion.

In 2010 Adelson outdid himself building the Marina Bay Sands resort in Singapore. At a cost of $5.5 billion it was the most expensive building in the world.

These resorts continued to make fantastic amounts of profit for Adelson earning him a top ranking on Forbes’ Annual “Biggest Winner” List in 2013 after his casinos added an estimated $15 billion to his net worth during the year.

In September 2020a few short months before his death Sheldon Adelson was estimated by Forbes to be worth an incredible $33.5 billion.

Adelson died in January 2021 at the age of 87. He is survived by his wife Miriam Adelson who still owns more than half of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation gambling empire.

She has a current net worth of $27.7 billion.

2. Tilman Fertitta – $7.9 Billion

Image: Wikimedia Commons

Tilman Fertitta initially made his money during Houston’s real estate boom in the 1980s. He then moved on from real estate and became an investor in seafood restaurants owned by the Landry family.

Fertitta became the sole owner of these restaurants in 1988 and has steadily grown the business portfolio by purchasing a number of well-known restaurant chains such as Bubba Gump Rainforest Cafe and Joe’s Crab Shack.

In 2005 as his restaurant empire continued to grow Fertitta moved into the casino business by buying Golden Nugget Hotel and Casinos for $295 million.

This bought him both a casino in Laughlin Nevada and the famous Golden Nugget in Las Vegas one of the oldest casinos in Sin City.

Since purchasing the property Fertitta has spent over $300 million renovating it. This included constructing a new hotel tower and expanding the casino floor itself.

Fertitta has opened three more Golden Nugget casinos including one that replaced Trump Marina in Atlantic City.

Fertitta bought this property at a massively discounted $38 million nearly a tenth of the $316 million Trump Enterprises was asking for before the 2008 financial collapse.

3. Phil Ruffin – $3.1 Billion

Image: Twitter/LindaSuhler

Phil Ruffin built his wealth through owning a chain of convenience stores. He then moved into the hotel business and finally in 1995 when he was 60 years old the casino industry.

He began his casino empire by buying the Crystal Palace Resort in the Bahamas.

Three years later Ruffin bought his first US-based casino taking over The Frontier Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.

The Frontier had been struggling for years because of a long workers’ strike that was being performed by members of the Frontier’s staff.

Ruffin resolved the strike in a few short hours and remodeled the casino for $20 million dollars.

He would ultimately go on to sell the 36-acre property for more than $1.2 billion in what was the largest per-acre price in The Strip’s history.

Ruffin currently owns two of Las Vegas’ most iconic casinos Treasure Island and Circus Circus. Both of these properties have undergone extensive renovations.

Ruffin now aged 87 is still fully committed to his casinos. So much so that he told Forbes that he has no intention of retiring and aims to “die at his desk.”

4. Lorenzo and Frank Fertitta III – $2.6 Billion

Image: Forbes

The two Fertitta brothers who are third cousins of Tilman Fertitta each have a net worth of $2.6 billion and have had shockingly similar career paths.

They both got their start in the casino business from an early age thanks to their father Frank Fertitta Jr. who launched Station Casinos in 1976.

Station Casinos began as a casino for locals to enjoy and has become one of the largest local casino operators in Las Vegas.

Having worked for Station Casinos as young men Lorenzo and Frank led the company to its first IPO after their father retired in 1993.

They raised $294 million and became principal shareholders and co-founders of Station Casinos Inc. in the process.

Both Frank and Lorenzo were early investors in the UFC purchasing the fight promotion company for $2 million dollars in 2001.

In 2016 the brothers sold their shares for an estimated $4 billion.

Station Casinos Inc. now owns numerous hotel-casinos including Red Rock Casino and Spa in Las Vegas and Sunset Station in Henderson Nevada.

The company also manages a large number of casinos for other owners.

5. Elaine Wynn – $1.7 Billion

Image: The Wall Street Journal

Nicknamed the “Queen of Las Vegas” Elaine Wynn is a woman who along with ex-husband Steve transformed the Las Vegas casino industry.

The two of them launched Mirage Resorts in 1973 which would go on to build some of Las Vegas’s most iconic casinos including The Mirage Treasure Island and Bellagio.

These developments were among the first to offer the full range of glitz and glamor that Las Vegas casino resorts have become known for.

In 2000 following their great success the couple sold Mirage Resorts to Kirk Kerkorian for $6.4 billion.

The Wynns wasted no time in launching their new venture Wynn Resorts.

Their first property the flagship hotel and casino Wynn Las Vegas was opened in April 2005 and cost $2.7 billion to construct.

Wynn Resorts now operates a total of six hotel-casinos two in Las Vegas three in Macau and one in Boston.

Elaine and Steve divorced in 2010 evenly splitting their 38% stake in Wynn Resorts.

In 2018 Steve Wynn resigned as CEO of Wynn Resorts and sold the majority of his shares following accusations of sexual misconduct from Wynn Resort staff members.

This has made Elaine the second largest shareholder of Wynn Resorts and one of the most powerful casino owners in the world."

A reception with the artist is set for 5 to 6:30 p.m. Oct. 1. Call 302-645-0551 or email peninsulagallery1@gmail.com for details.

The Peninsula Gallery team is thrilled to be hosting a show with Phillips one of Delaware’s most prolific artists. Lasting Impressions features 40 brand-new impressionist paintings.

Phillips’ work is reminiscent of 19th-century painters who used the richness of light and color to create an atmosphere that could almost be touched. The works in Lasting Impressions vary in subject matter. From simple floral still lifes to grand country homes and elegantly staged pottery Phillips’ pieces capture the beauty of average objects. His paintings remind the viewer to appreciate the way light falls on a roof panel or the shadow cast by a teacup on a bunch of cherries.

“Rick is an exquisite artist with an outstanding reputation. The works he has produced for this show are just as beautiful as ever solidifying his place as one of this region’s finest talents” said Carol Boyd-Heron Peninsula Gallery co-owner.

Hailing from the Susquehanna Valley in Pennsylvania Phillips now resides in Delaware and calls Claymont home. After graduating with honors from the Art Institute of Pittsburgh he excelled as an illustrator working for more than 25 years with public relations firms and advertising agencies in the Mid-Atlantic region. His accomplishments include commissioned works for Bank of America Campbell Soup Company and Glaxo SmithKline Pharmaceuticals.

In the mid-‘90s Phillips changed his career path from illustration to fine arts. He combines his ability to paint quickly and boldly with his interest in 19th century impressionism. His fine art is a part of many private collections including that of President Joe Biden. Phillips teaches at Delaware College of Art and Design the Darley Arts Center and Tyler Arboretum.

“In the city in the country or working on a still life of antiques and florals I get to the heart of my subjects with loose and bravura brushstrokes elegant and evocative color and a unique sense of mood. My portfolio includes images of barns fields and farmhouses as well as more nostalgic subjects like the rugged bicycles I remember as a child” said Phillips.

Works from the show can be previewed at peninsula-gallery.com and are available for presale.

The gallery is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday to Saturday and 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Sunday in the Village Shoppes at the Beacon Inn 520 East Savannah Road Lewes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhc3Rpbmd0YWJsZS5jb20vMTAyMzgzMi90aGUta2V5LXN0ZXAtY2hvYmFuaS1qdXN0LXRvb2stdG93YXJkLWdsb2JhbC1leHBhbnNpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Key Step Chobani Just Took Toward Global Expansion,"The Key Step Chobani Just Took Toward Global Expansion

It's been an eventful few years for Chobani. In 2019 it released its first oat milk and oat milk yogurts with plans to further expand its product line to include coffee creamers per CNBC. ""Our ambition has always been to go outside of yogurt and we're really prepared for it"" said Chobani President and Chief Operating Officer (COO) Peter McGuinness.

According to a filing with the Security and Exchange Commission the company released in November 2021 Chobani holds 20% of the market share for yogurt. But in March 2022 McGuinness and a large portion of the company's executive team left the company (per The Wall Street Journal).

Over the weekend a viral tweet emerged showing that the Minnesota Wild were selling authentic jerseys with ads on them at their team store. ESPN’s Greg Wyshynski poked around and learned that the NHL and Fanatics was giving teams the option of selling jerseys with ads on them.

Sunday during Washington’s first preseason game of the year against the Buffalo Sabres we learned where the Capitals fell on the decision.

The Capital One Arena team store was selling jerseys with ads. Capitals Reddit user WaffleOnABike and former Capitals blogger (In2Caps) posted a photo of the jerseys and gave me permission to share.

“In the main store all the Adidas Authentics — that I saw and I went through racks — had the ad including home and alternate blue” @WaffleOnABike said. “The Fanatics replica jerseys did not have the ads.”

This was also true for some of the merch vendors across Capital One Arena.

“It was pretty sporadic” WaffleOnABike said. “I saw some booths selling Adidas Authentic with ads and others not so presume that they’re just cycling through old inventory first to ultimately go all ads?”

On the blue W alternate jerseys the ad patch was navy blue with white text. It could be seen on the COA team store Instagram Story.

The Capitals have not yet named a jersey ad sponsor for away games. The Caesar Sportbook patches will only be worn at Capital One Arena because gambling is legalized in DC.

The 2022-23 regular season marks the NHL’s first season with jersey ads.

When flying many major airlines you can use your miles to upgrade. But every airline handles upgrades with miles a little differently. Some like American and United charge a co-pay on most mileage upgrades (though United waives the co-pay for elite members). Meanwhile Delta offers mileage upgrades at a fixed rate of about 1.07 cents per mile.

In some situations the number of miles required to upgrade your seat is significantly less than what you might need to redeem for an award flight. Redeeming miles for an upgraded seat can be a great use for your miles if you only have a small mileage balance with an airline.

Redeeming miles for upgrades can also be a great use of transferable currencies such as Bilt Rewards or Chase Ultimate Rewards since you can transfer the amount you need to top off your account.

Consider a bundle for a free upgrade

Once you wade into the world of low-cost airlines you'll find that you can select better seats on them as part of purchasing a bundle. Purchasing a bundle just for a seat with extra legroom is seldom a good idea. But if you were planning to check a bag or wanted priority boarding you may find that purchasing those items a la carte is more expensive than purchasing a bundle of add-ons.

Frontier's ""The Works"" bundle includes items such as a carry-on bag and a checked bag and allows you to select any seat on the plane including seats with extra legroom. Allegiant and Spirit offer similar bundles though Spirit sells its unique Big Front Seat separately. When considering a low-cost carrier think about the add-ons you might purchase and how that decision might help you get a cheap or free upgrade to a better seat.

Take advantage of elite status for a free upgrade

KYLE OLSEN/THE POINTS GUY

In the 1990s and 2000s it was typical for domestic first-class cabins on American Delta and United to mostly seat business travelers with elite status. In those days that was how to get free upgrades on flights.

Over time the airlines turned the dials of yield management to make money off those seats they were giving away for free. First-class seats sell for a lot less money today than in decades past. Airlines now fill their first-class seats primarily with customers who booked a first-class fare.

However there are still plenty of opportunities for a free upgrade to first class. This is especially true if you fly unpopular routes or fly at non-peak times. You can also increase your chances of finding a free upgrade by using services like Expert Flyer (owned by TPG's parent company Red Ventures) to scan for flights with a greater chance of an upgrade.

There are many reasons it can be better to have top-tier elite status on one airline versus mid-tier status on multiple airlines. Upgrades are one of these areas since the upgrade waitlist is organized by status level.

Pay for the seat you want

KYLE OLSEN/THE POINTS GUY

Many business travelers begrudgingly admit a new mantra is in play when it comes to airline travel: ""Buy the seat you want."" It's an acknowledgment that complimentary upgrades are harder to come by than ever and someone else is often willing to pay for the first-class or exit row seat you used to get for free.

Luckily a few credit cards offer annual travel credits you can use to reduce your out-of-pocket costs. Chase Sapphire Reserve is a good example with a very easy-to-use $300 travel credit per account anniversary year. To a lesser degree the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card is another option with its annual $300 travel credit but you must use the credit through the Capital One travel portal.

Bottom line

If more comfort is important to you the next time you take to the air make sure you do your research before purchasing a ticket. Across all the major domestic U.S. airlines you'll find a wide range of upgrade procedures. So learn about airline upgrade policies and procedures before clicking the purchase button for your next flight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL2luc2lnaHRzL2FpcnBvcnQtbG91bmdlcy1iZXN0LWNvZmZlZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Which Airport Lounges Have The Best Coffee?,"I love great coffee. I enjoy it at home and I especially enjoy it when traveling. Of course coffee has the benefit of having caffeine but for me it’s so much more than that — enjoying coffee is a ritual for me and on some level I consider good coffee to be art. A hotel or airline offering solid coffee is always memorable for me so I wanted to talk about that a bit as it relates to airport lounges.

The Fiji Airways Lounge Nadi has amazing coffee

After flying Fiji Airways business class from Los Angeles to Nadi I headed to the FIji Airways Lounge Nadi Airport. Not only is this open to Fiji Airways business class passengers but it’s also a Priority Pass lounge.

This is a surprisingly impressive lounge especially when you consider it’s open to Priority Pass members. It’s nicely furnished (though dark) and has an exceptional food selection. However what really stood out to me was the barista-made coffee.

Fiji Airways Lounge Nadi Airport

There are servers roaming the lounge offering coffee and I ordered a cappuccino. I was even asked for my milk preference and there were several options. I think this was probably the best coffee drink I’ve ever had in an airport lounge. Not only was it beautifully presented but the taste was truly perfect — it was smooth not at all bitter and the temperature was perfect.

Cappuccino in Fiji Airways Lounge Nadi Airport

I rate this coffee 10/10 and that’s not even accounting for this being an airport lounge.

Other airport lounges with great coffee

Coffee is an airport lounge amenity I really value so that got me thinking about what other lounges have great coffee. A few stand out to me…

Australia is of course known for its coffee culture so I find that Qantas First Lounges have phenomenal coffee whether in Los Angeles Melbourne Singapore or Sydney.

Qantas First Lounge Singapore latte

Air New Zealand Lounges also have barista-made coffee. What’s cool is that you can order (and customize) your coffee on a tablet and you can even choose whether you want it in a to-go cup or not.

Here in the United States I’d say that United Polaris Lounges offer great coffee as they have a barista setup.

Among membership lounges in the United States you can’t beat Alaska Lounges which also have barista-made coffee.

Among Priority Pass lounges I’d say the best coffee I’ve otherwise had was at the Primeclass Lounge Muscat which had excellent barista-made options as well.

Among credit card lounges in the United States you can’t beat the Capital One Lounge Dallas which not only has barista-made drinks but also has cold brew and iced latte on tap.

Bottom line

I was delighted to find among the best coffee I’ve ever had at the Fiji Airways Lounge Nadi. If you want exceptional barista-made drinks make sure you stop in here when passing through the airport. It’s especially impressive when you consider this lounge is also open to Priority Pass members.

This got me thinking about the lounges with the best coffee drinks so the above are some of my favorites. I’d love to discover more as I obviously haven’t been to all lounges in the world.

What’s your favorite coffee you’ve had in an airport lounge?"

Citing unscheduled maintenance onboard the company is altering the route of the Oct. 15 Oct. 29 Nov. 12 Jan. 21 Feb. 4 and Feb. 18 departures.

Sailing from Galveston the week-long cruises initially included visits to Jamaica Grand Cayman and Mexico but will now sail to Belize Honduras and Mexico.

“We have had to implement a work schedule to address an unexpected issue on Carnival Vista and will be conducting maintenance on the ship during your cruise which means the ship will unable to sustain the maximum cruising speed required to operate your itinerary” the company explained in a statement sent to booked guests.

Consequently Carnival added it will be necessary to replace the visits to George Town and Montego Bay with calls to Belize and Isla Roatán.

“With this modification we will be able to extend our hours in Cozumel to give you extra time ashore” the statement noted.

While pre-purchased Carnival shore excursions for Grand Cayman and Jamaica will be refunded to their original form of payment the impacted passengers will also receive a $50 per person onboard credit.

The benefit is restricted to a maximum $100 per cabin and will be credited to the guests’ Sail & Sign accounts.

“We regret not being able to deliver the original itinerary and apologize for this unexpected change” Carnival said.

According to the company’s statement guests are also able to reschedule or cancel their bookings and request refunds of the cruise fare and any pre-purchased items.

Fernandez no longer offering thrill rides games at school carnivals,"HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - Next year’s Punahou Carnival will not have any E.K. Fernandez thrill rides or games.

And neither will carnivals at other schools. Iolani and Mililani High have also been informed of the change.

In a letter sent out to families Punahou School said the highly anticipated carnival will be open to the public next year but rides will be limited to kiddie rides.

In a statement E.K. Fernandez President Scott Fernandez told Hawaii News Now that their “capacity to produce the Punahou Carnival at the same size and pace is no longer available” and not in their control. He said they are only able to provide to the school what is within their current capacity.

“In the past 24 hours after this story broke we have received many inquiries from the public expressing concerns about our reduced footprint at the Punahou Carnival” Fernandez said. “And our response is these are the consequences of governmental action over the past two years.”

Fernandez said the company along with other “non-essential” businesses that were shut down at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic saw a lot of business fallout including insufficient revenue resulting in layoffs.

“If the government doesn’t do more to help companies like ours recover this new normal will become permanent” Fernandez said.

While the Caribbean is still dealing with damage left behind by Hurricane Fiona the next storm has already entered the Caribbean basin threatening more disruptions in the coming days.

Three ships have canceled their call to Grand Turk in the Turks and Caicos due to the damage sustained to the pier during Hurricane Fiona. Carnival Cruise Line has released new itineraries for these three cruise ships.

Carnival Ships Drop Grand Turk

Carnival Cruise Line has changed the itineraries for three ships due to call in Grand Turk next week. Carnival Freedom Mardi Gras and Carnival Sunrise will not be calling to the island. The cancelation is due to the significant damage sustained to the dock earlier this week when Hurricane Fiona hit the area.

The damage to the pier was mainly to the pier extension which makes it possible for larger cruise ships to dock in Grand Turk. Before cruise ships sail to Grand Turk again an engineering assessment and safety inspection will be done to ensure the structure’s integrity before it can be used.

You can watch a video of the damage to the Grand Turk dock below:

Hurricane Fiona passed Grand Turk on Tuesday September 20 2022 as a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 115 miles per hour (185 kilometers per hour). There has been a significant impact on the local infrastructure but fortunately no injuries or loss of life.

In a letter to guests booked onboard Carnival Sunrise the cruise line explained the situation: “Due to Hurricane Fiona the pier structure in Grand Turk is currently under repair and it will be necessary to replace our call there with a visit to Bimini The Bahamas.”

“Pre-purchased Carnival shore excursions for Grand Turk will be automatically refunded to your onboard Sail & Sign account. Carnival tours for Bimini will be available for purchase on board. We apologize for this unexpected change and thank you for your understanding. We look forward to welcoming you aboard for a FUN and memorable cruise.”

Carnival Sunrise will be sailing from Miami on September 24. There will be a call to Nassau on September 25 and a call to Half Moon Cay on September 26 which will be 30 minutes longer than previously scheduled.

The following day will be a day at sea instead of the call to Grand Turk while the next day which was a day at sea initially will now be a call to Bimini in the Bahamas.

For Carnival Freedom the call to Grand Turk on September 29 has been replaced by a day at sea while a call to Nassau has replaced the original day at sea on September 30. The same change has been made to the Mardi Gras itinerary changing the day at sea to September 29 and a day in Nassau on September 30.

Will Guests Be Compensated for the Itinerary Changes?

One question that often comes up when cruise lines incorporate changes to itineraries is whether guests receive any compensation. Unfortunately for them this is not the case here. As the reason for changing ports does not lie with Carnival the cruise line will not be offering compensation.

As a general rule cruise lines can make itinerary changes if and when they please without offering guests a reason. Carnival Cruise Line’s Brand Ambassador John Heald made this clear on September 24:

“The main change to the itineraries is the replacement of Grand Turk which had some pier damage. Now I have had a few people ask why we are not giving any compensation for this. One lady felt that $100 OBC should be given and another asked for a dinner for four to be provided at the Steakhouse. I have explained that respectfully this will not be given.”

Itinerary Changes Always Possible

When one takes a cruise a change of itinerary is always possible. Of course not everyone will be pleased with the outcome when cruise lines make changes. In particular the choice of replacement port is always up for debate.

However space in cruise ports is often booked up well in advance and the speed needed to cover the distance to popular ports such as Cozumel is also factored in. Therefore cruise lines will need to take advantage of their options.

“We can’t just show up on Mardi Gras in Cozumel and tell the Climbing Wall of the Seas or the Scarlet Norwegian to bugger off so we can dock. What I am saying is that when hurricanes come through the Caribbean all the cruise lines have to find spaces for displaced ports and Nassau has space for many ships” Heald continued.

After a relatively quiet start to hurricane season this week seems to be the start of more active storms passing through the Caribbean basin.

Tropical Storm Ian has already entered the area and is likely to increase in strength over the coming days. Cruise companies will undoubtedly implement even more itinerary changes if the current projections come through. If that does happen Cruise Hive will keep you informed of all the important changes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8yNC9qZWxseS1iZWxseXMtOXRoLWFubnVhbC1jYW5keS1wYWxvb3phLWJyaW5ncy1jYXJuaXZhbC1yaWRlcy1hbmQtY3JhZnQtdmVuZG9ycy10by1mYWlyZmllbGQv0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzI0L2plbGx5LWJlbGx5cy05dGgtYW5udWFsLWNhbmR5LXBhbG9vemEtYnJpbmdzLWNhcm5pdmFsLXJpZGVzLWFuZC1jcmFmdC12ZW5kb3JzLXRvLWZhaXJmaWVsZC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jelly Belly’s 9th annual “Candy-Palooza” brings carnival rides and craft vendors to Fairfield,"Popular music set the mood as guests enjoyed popcorn hot dogs and sweets on the lawn of the Jelly Belly factory in Fairfield for its 9th annual “Candy Palooza.”

Fairfield is no stranger to celebrating candy and sweets as the Jelly Belly factory tour and recently-added museum remains a staple for tourism in Solano County making it the perfect setting for craft vendors food and carnival rides. Vendors offered custom goods like blankets plushies keychains tumbler coffee cups and even LEGO mini figures.

One vendor sold custom lightsabers to promote his business Kyber Cave which specializes in making replica sabers similar to the ones used in “Star Wars.” The vendor Van O’bryan said the “Candy Palooza” was a great spot to promote the business and sell his merchandise since it was much more accessible than other conventions.

“I do a lot of conventions” O’bryan said “but this is local so people can come out and see us. It’s good advertising.”

Cadence Putnam who makes homemade stuffed animals based on sea life also got the word out about her crafts.

“I got lots of nieces and nephews” Putnam said “I made this stuff for them and my family told me I should start selling them.”

The event also offered fresh food carnival rides a bounce house and even a photo opportunity with the Oscar Mayer “Weinermobile” parked in the middle of the venue.

Putnam said she really enjoys how much the event brings people together in Fairfield and Solano County as a whole.

“It’s one of the few places to see the community coming together” she said. “It’s nice to see people out doing things again.”

“Candy Palooza” returns Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m."

China's third aircraft carrier has started mooring trials the country's state broadcaster announced on Friday. This indicates smooth progress for the carrier's construction and tests since its launch in June analysts said.Celebrating the upcoming 10th anniversary of the commissioning of the country's first aircraft carrier the Liaoning on Sunday China Central Television (CCTV) announced on Friday that the country's third aircraft carrier the Fujian is conducting mooring trials as planned.Over the last few days the Fujian has been undergoing equipment installation and calibration work with related test missions being conducted at the same time according to a separate report by CCTV on Friday.Having a displacement of more than 80000 tons and being the country's first carrier equipped with electromagnetic catapults and arresting devices the Fujian was launched in Shanghai on June 17 Official reports said at the time that after the launch the carrier would start mooring trials and sea trials.The latest development indicates that the Fujian's construction and tests are going smoothly a Beijing-based military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Friday.As a general pattern in shipbuilding mooring trials are conducted when a vessel is moored at port and include the testing of onboard equipment and machinery and their compatibility with each other the expert said.According to the CCTV report equipment installation and calibration work or outfitting is currently underway and this could shorten the time needed for this phase the expert said noting that the next phase in the plan is sea trials which will likely start in the next year or so.Outfitting work includes the installation of equipment such as fuel pipes gas pipes electric devices and weapons systems Song Zhongping a Chinese military expert and TV commentator told the Global Times in a previous interview.Since this is China's first large aircraft carrier equipped with catapults the outfitting work might take longer than usual to make sure everything is done properly Song said.In another development the Liaoning which is about to celebrate its 10th anniversary of service recently conducted an exercise in the Bohai Sea and CCTV for the first time released footage showing a fully loaded Liaoning with 24 J-15 fighter jets two Z-8 helicopters and a Z-9 helicopter on its flight deck.This is the highest number of J-15s displayed onboard the Liaoning. Over the past decade the number grew from one to five eight 13 and now 24 showing the growing capabilities of the carrier group observers noted.It took five years for the Liaoning to host 1000 takeoff and landing operations for J-15s and it took only two and a half years for the next 1000 such operations China Youth Daily reported on Thursday.China now has more carrier-based fighter jets as well as more pilots that can fly the jets Zhang Xuefeng a Chinese military expert told the Global Times on Friday.China is also much more experienced in operating and supporting aircraft on carriers Zhang said. It is complex and challenging to operate and support more than 20 fighters than only one or two he said.In the future the numbers of carrier-based aircraft will continue to increase as will the types of carrier-based aircraft which will greatly enhance a carrier combat group's systematic and comprehensive combat capabilities Zhang said.The Liaoning and the country's second aircraft carrier the Shandong recently held exercises in the Yellow Sea and the South China Sea another report by CCTV said.As China enters the 10th year of aircraft carrier operation all three of its carriers are rapidly increasing their capabilities observers said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvcGFuZGVtaWMtdHJhdmVsLW5ld3MtYmVzdC1haXJsaW5lcy0yMDIyLWN1c3RvbWVyLXNhdGlzZmFjdGlvbi9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFkaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvcGFuZGVtaWMtdHJhdmVsLW5ld3MtYmVzdC1haXJsaW5lcy0yMDIyLWN1c3RvbWVyLXNhdGlzZmFjdGlvbg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The airports that travelers dread,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.cnn.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /travel/article/pandemic-travel-news-best-airlines-2022-customer-satisfaction/index.html (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673E4D9BA0>, 'Connection to www.cnn.com timed out.

Another thing I never do is check a bag. In case you're new here I famously wrote in a newsletter earlier this year that I would ""rather die than check a bag."" A flare for the dramatics (I am a Leo after all) I simply lack the patience required to retrieve checked baggage following a flight.

However I recognize that some of you prefer to check bags when flying. While I promise to only judge you slightly for doing so checking a bag does not necessarily have to inconvenience you beyond the time you spend waiting for it to arrive on the luggage carousel after deplaning. Unless of course you miss your flight and your bag has already been checked.

One common scenario occurs when you check a bag but miss your flight and therefore have to rebook yourself on a new flight or cancel altogether.

Another time this often happens is when you miss a connecting flight because your original flight was delayed.

How can you retrieve your checked luggage? Most airlines will try their best to reroute a passenger's bag to their final destination.

This guide details how five major U.S. airlines handle these scenarios and what happens to checked luggage when a traveler fails to board a flight as planned.

Domestic versus international requirements

To start you should know that there are different regulations regarding checked bags on domestic and international flights. If you were to miss a domestic flight after checking your bag the airline should be able to transfer your bag to any other domestic flight since every bag is screened.

However federal regulations for international flights known as Positive Passenger Bag Match (PPBM) or sometimes Passenger Bag Match (PBM) require airlines to off-load checked bags if the passenger is not onboard. Of course there are few exemptions to this rule such as if a bag is misconnected and needs to get to a passenger's final destination.

This explains why if a passenger is missing for an international flight and they have a checked bag there will probably be a delay in you receiving your bag since the airline has to manually pull that bag from the cargo hold.

Keep these rules in mind when reading the below airline baggage policies.

Delta Air Lines

CRAIG HASTINGS/GETTY IMAGES

If a Delta passenger checks a bag but misses their flight the resulting situation depends on the reason why they missed their flight.

""Presumably if it is due to being late they wouldn't have been able to check their bag anyways as there is a cut-off for that"" a Delta spokesperson said. However if a Delta passenger checks their bag and is rebooked on a new flight due to their own volition their bag will be re-routed to the new flight's final destination.

However if either the customer or Delta cancels the flight any checked bags will be returned to baggage claim where the customer can expect to retrieve them. This is also the case for those who miss their connecting flights.

""The bag would continue to the destination it is ticketed for but if for some reason the customer has a very tight connection and doesn't make it there is a possibility that could be the same for the bag"" Delta told me.

For what it's worth Delta has invested in bag tracking technology since 2016 and it became the first airline to allow travelers to track their checked bags in real-time via the Fly Delta App.

United Airlines

""If a customer is re-booked or re-routed we do our best to re-route the bag tag so it travels with them"" a United spokesperson confirmed.

If you are connecting on a United flight and miss that connection likely your bag will also miss that connection — which is probably a best-case scenario.

But if for some reason your bag does not end up at your final destination with you United encourages passengers to file a delayed baggage claim which you can read about here.

As a reminder United flyers can use the United mobile app to track their bags in real-time from the time they check in at their departure airport to the time it arrives at their destination airport; this includes on layovers and connections. Just note that you'll need either your confirmation number or bag tag number to do so.

Alaska Airlines

Unlike the other carriers Alaska's policy for checked baggage differs on international versus domestic flights.

""Internationally we are required to pull a bag if the guest does not board"" according to an Alaska spokesperson. ""Domestically there is no such requirement and actions may be based on multiple factors like timelines and proximity between connecting flights.""

Keeping in line with the other carriers though Alaska says that checked bags will be re-routed to one's final destination pending it was transferred in time in the case of missed domestic flights.

""It's generally quicker for a guest to connect than their bag but...the bag would travel on to the final destination if it was transferred in time even if the guest was not"" a spokesperson said.

American Airlines

In perhaps the most straightforward policy of the mentioned carriers American Airlines has one rule for missed flights and one for canceled flights.

""If the customer misses their flight and catches another their bags will automatically be routed to their final destination and can be picked up from the luggage claim"" a spokesperson said. ""If a flight is canceled checked bags will be returned in the departure airport's luggage claim.""

Southwest Airlines

Generally speaking checked baggage on domestic Southwest flights will make it to a customer's final destination listed on a baggage tag.

Even so should baggage make it to the carousel without its traveler companion Southwest travelers should look for their baggage at Southwest's baggage service office at the final airport location to claim it upon arrival.

Bottom line

Travelers hope to arrive at their destinations with their bags and airlines want the same. Therefore airlines will do their best to reroute a passenger's bag to its final destination.

Sometimes though that's not logistically possible given the constraints of customers with tight flight connections and little time for error. If you arrive at your destination without your bag your best bet is to check the local baggage service office for your carrier at your final airport. This should be located near the baggage claim area or the ticket counter.

Also be sure to download the mobile app for each carrier as those can also help you track your bags. If you want even more reassurance consider purchasing and using Apple AirTags which allow you to track your bags via Bluetooth.

Earlier this year Hovione announced a partnership with a Danish firm that has developed a whey protein–based excipient meant to enhance spray-dry dispersions. Hovione saw in Zerion Pharma’s Dispersome a means of advancing its services addressing bioavailability in drug formulation. Zerion launched in 2019 saw a clear advantage in teaming with a well-established pharmaceutical services firm recognized as a leader in spray-drying services.

A few months later Nanoform Finland a nanoparticle engineering specialist based in Helsinki announced a partnership with the specialty drug firm Pharmanovia which will apply Nanoform’s nanoparticle technology and formulation know-how to improve the bioavailability of drugs in its product line.

Zerion and Nanoform are among the growing number of firms trying to deal with problems related to drug bioavailability. Their approaches are welcomed by industry observers given the increased urgency of such problems and the relative sparsity of technological innovation.

Bioavailability a measure of the portion of an active drug substance that enters the body’s circulation and affects the drug’s target may not be the steepest challenge faced by developers of new therapeutic compounds. But it may well be the most pervasive. By many estimates 70–90% of new small-molecule oral drugs have problems related to solubility and absorption.

These problems have been exacerbated in recent years by the increasing complexity of drug molecules especially in the oncology arena according to Peter Bigelow president of xCell Strategic Consulting. The speed with which innovators need to move forward in development has also resulted in a growing market for particle engineering and design he says.

“Because speed is kind of the most important objective of so many of these programs changing the chemistry is not something they have the luxury to do” Bigelow says. “A sponsor company will say ‘I can’t take a year off to come up with a new synthetic route. So you’ve got to make this route to work.’ ”

Bioavailability services first emerged among providers specializing in formulation rather than at contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) whose primary service centers on the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). But the field has shifted over the last decade with the broadening of service offerings among CDMOs and the emergence of a one-stop-shop approach.

Beyond API manufacture

One of the most popular techniques for improving bioavailability is spray drying a method for converting poorly soluble APIs into an amorphous dispersion by dissolving the API and a polymer exipient in an organic solvent and evaporating the solvent with heated gases. Hovione was an early adopter investing in its first spray-drying capacity in 2004 but not with an eye toward improving bioavailability of customers’ drug candidates.

“This is a good example of taking the right decision for the wrong reason” says Guy Villax who stepped down as CEO of the family-owned company earlier this year but remains on its board. “I was out in the market looking for business. I came across two inquiries that needed spray drying. We decided if customers were ready to make commitments we were willing to invest.”

To be successful you need more than the hardware. Filipe Gaspar chief technology officer Hovione

The contracts involved work on Captisol a solubilizing agent whose manufacture required spray drying as an isolation technique. “There was nothing strategic in terms of addressing poorly soluble molecules” Villax recalls. But as a result of those early contracts Hovione was in position to provide solubility services—notably for hepatitis C drugs—as the market grew.

Hovione significantly increased its spray-drying capacity in 2009 when it acquired a Pfizer plant in Cork Ireland that included what at the time was the world’s largest solvent-based pharmaceutical spray-drying tower.

Other CDMOs have added services more recently. Fabbrica Italiana Sintetici (FIS) adopted spray drying in 2017 when it opened a new facility at its headquarters plant in Montecchio Italy. FIS also provides micronization a process of physically and mechanically breaking up drug crystals and lyophilization a freeze-drying means of manipulating particle size. Its sister company Brenta is a nanotechnology specialist offering formulation services that address API absorption and bioavailability.

“FIS is a drug substance manufacturer; we are not in drug product” says Luca Parlanti the firm’s marketing director using industry terms for active chemicals and finished drugs. “However we recognized the increasing relevance of particle-size solid-state technology in general. It is important for a provider like ourselves to offer a forward integration into areas that bridge drug substance and formulation.” Particle engineering is a method of addressing not only bioavailability but also processability Parlanti says “because solid-state properties may impact the flow of a drug in the formulation process.”

Broad portfolios

Lonza one of the largest contract API manufacturers has extended services into particle design via acquisition. The company acquired Capsugel a formulation services specialist in 2016 3 years after Capsugel bought Bend Research a leader in spray-dry dispersion services. The Capsugel deal also netted Lonza micronization services but the Swiss firm recently divested assets notably a plant in Quakertown Pennsylvania that was acquired by investors and set up on its own as Microsize.

Lonza announced last month that it would introduce X-ray powder diffraction technology an analytical tool to improve jet-milling micronization at its formulation services operation in Monteggio Switzerland.

The company’s sale of the Pennsylvania plant is the latest transaction for a business dating back to 1994 when it began as Powdersize. It changed hands twice—purchased first in 2013 by Microsize’s current CEO TJ Higley and then by Capsugel. Higley left after the Lonza acquisition and returned to head the company this year.

Higley says Microsize maintains its heritage of micronization which he characterizes as a first line of attack in addressing bioavailability. He says the advantages of micronization include ease of process development and scale-up an increase in particle surface area processing at ambient temperatures and overall low cost compared with its primary alternative spray drying.

Higley sees Microsize in a strong position. “The market is capacity constrained” he says. “There is plenty of work out there plenty of demand.” Some drugmakers have responded by setting up in-house particle design centers “but there are huge limitations because people aren’t experts at it.” Nor are the in-house facilities typically capable of processing APIs from gram scale up to clinical and commercial scale he says. “I would say people are bringing early small-scale micronization in-house” Higley says. “So at some point they are going to need to outsource.”

Catalent another big services firm that has amassed particle design services has bioavailability assets that date back nearly a century. “Catalent has been in the business of increasing oral bioavailability for oral delivery of active ingredients since the RP Scherer business was formed in 1933” says Cornell Stamoran vice president of corporate strategy referring to a company formed by Robert Pauli Scherer inventor of the rotary die encapsulation process used to formulate soft gelatin capsules. “I have a lab notebook in my office of one of the first R&D people on their second or third project which was increasing bioavailability of fish oil.”

Scherer was purchased in 1998 by Cardinal Health which spun out its pharmaceutical services business as Catalent in 2007. Catalent has since acquired Pharmatek Laboratories a drug services firm with spray-drying capabilities and Juniper Pharmaceuticals an expert in spray drying nanomilling and hot-melt extrusion—a method of melting a substance and forcing it through a die to form a new structure; it is widely employed in plastics and has more recently been adapted to pharmaceutical particle design applications.

Thermo Fisher Scientific a pharmaceutical services firm that took a leadership position in formulation services with the acquisition of Patheon in 2017 has also built a portfolio of bioavailability technologies. It added small-scale spray-drying dispersions with the purchase of Agere Pharmaceuticals in Bend Oregon which was formed in 2016 by the former CEO of Bend Research. Thermo Fisher added commercial-scale spray drying at a plant in Florence South Carolina shortly after acquiring the site from Roche in 2016.

The Roche site also added micronization to Thermo Fisher’s tool kit. And the company invested in small-scale hot-melt extrusion capacity in Bend before scaling up the technology at its plant in Cincinnati.

Both Catalent and Thermo Fisher have introduced systems to assess the most effective approach to formulation in early-stage drug development including the selection of techniques to address bioavailability. Catalent has a program OptiForm that is based on a predictive modeling regimen it acquired from GSK in 2010. And Thermo Fisher introduced a predictive modeling tool called Quadrant 2 that guides drug developers in choosing particle design approaches.

New wave

Meanwhile there are indications that improved approaches are coming to the market. Based on research that began at the University of Copenhagen Zerion has developed a technology that uses proteins to increase small-molecule drug solubility and that constitutes an alternative to known polymer excipients in spray-dry dispersion applications. “We researched all sorts of different materials including mesoporous silica amino acid peptides and cellulose nanofibers and eventually also proteins” says Korbinian Löbmann who is now Zerion’s chief science officer. The firm zeroed in on proteins.

“We tested all the different proteins we could get our hands on and out of all that research we identified that whey proteins worked particularly well not only for amorphous stabilization but also solubility enhancement” Löbmann says. The whey protein also allowed significantly higher drug loading—up to 70% of the weight of the particle as opposed to an industry standard of 30% at the high end.

Researchers filed a patent on behalf of the university and formed Zerion. The company has a partnership with Arla Food Ingredients a specialist in whey protein processing that has developed a means of purifying β-lactoglobulin from whey protein isolate for which the largest market is infant formula.

Interest in the protein excipient Dispersome has materialized says Zerion CEO Ole Wiborg and the firm now has contracts with four major drug companies. And then there is the partnership with Hovione.

“We were approached by Hovione and this was very positive” Wiborg says. We could see there was a lot of synergy between what we offer and what Hovione offers. And Hovione is if not the best then one of the best at spray-dry amorphous dispersion.”

Moreover Wiborg says Hovione opens the door to small and midsize companies the primary pharmaceutical innovators which have been more difficult to identify and connect with than the majors.

Hovione also sees benefits for both partners whereby it gets access to a sophisticated new technology and boosts market access for a start-up says António Dinis Hovione’s director of sales and marketing. The deal establishes Hovione as “the sole partner for promoting the technology into the pharma marketplace” he says.

The arrangement is the first in which Hovione has gained new technology through a partnership he adds. It may not be the last given the industry’s problems with bioavailability. “Hovione is actively pursuing opportunities to enhance our technology offering to address these problems” Dinis says. “Hovione will from now on be much more open to partnering with companies that help us bring more solutions to our customers.”

Nanoform which spun out of the University of Helsinki in 2015 has innovated a nanocrystalization approach to particle design by employing supercritical carbon dioxide. The company’s controlled expansion of supercritical solution technology produces particles as small ​as 10 nm but more typically within a range of 100–300 nm without the use of solvents excipients or polymers.

The technology works by dissolving APIs in supercritical CO 2 and controlling the pressure through a flow process to achieve supersaturation which leads to crystallization or precipitation according to Christopher Worrall Nanoform’s vice president of US business development. The reduced size increases particles’ surface area thereby increasing the dissolution rate and thus bioavailability.

Nanoform signed its first contract last year for a drug produced according to the Finnish Medicines Agency Fimea's good manufacturing practice standards and has a goal of signing three such contracts this year.

Tweaks and transformation

Despite the paucity of wholly new approaches to particle design efforts are underway to improve workhorse approaches such as spray drying. Deanna Mudie a principal scientist at Lonza’s operation in Bend says Lonza has been experimenting with methods to facilitate amorphous dispersion of so-called brick-dust APIs—poorly soluble drugs with high melting points.

“When drugs have poor solubility in organic spray-dry solvents you end up with a very low throughput and also high organic solvent usage which of course is not environmentally friendly” Mudie says.

One approach is to install a heat exchanger before the spray-drying step to increase a drug’s solubility in an organic solvent. The company is also applying environmentally friendly solvents such as acetic acid to processes to reduce the use of standards such as acetone methanol and in some cases environmentally impactful solvents such as dichloromethane.

“In general we have had that focus on improving spray drying over the last 5 years” Mudie says. “There is a big push because we have seen a trend toward the brick-dust APIs.”

While CDMOs have tended to bring on board tried-and-true methodologies for addressing bioavailability adding such services can have a transformative impact. At Hovione research in particle design has grown from a small research group of five chemists in 2005 to a multidisciplinary division with 70 scientists including chemists chemical engineers biologists and mathematicians.

“To be successful you need more than the hardware” says Filipe Gaspar Hovione’s chief technology officer and head of its particle design group. “You need the software the people the knowledge in R&D the marketing effort. It is the coordination of a lot of disciplines.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Often Digital Transformation is confused with Digitization or Digitalization. At other times parts of Digital Transformations are implemented in a slipshod manner resulting in continued chaos rather than presenting a solution.

Dr. George Westerman Principal Research Scientist J-WEL Workforce and Learning Senior Lecturer MIT Sloan School of Management described it best: “when digital transformation is done right it’s like a caterpillar turning into a butterfly but when done wrong all you have is a really fast caterpillar”.

What is the difference between Digitization Digitalization and Digital Transformation?

Digitization is the process of converting a manual process to a digital one. For instance some “paperless offices” move scanned copies of physical papers. These scanned copies still go through the earlier process. We have faster movement of the papers (“faster caterpillars”) but no improvement in process per se. The file still moves from one office to another waiting for signatures and inputs and the sender has to email the scanned document to the next person in the hierarchy or to other departments such as finance or legal for approval. The elimination of paper has moved files faster but the process remains unchanged.

Digitalization is the improvement of a manual process using technology. For instance all departments and people in an organization are connected and have access to an application that allows them to see the status of various items in the workflow. They understand where a particular file is stuck. Once a person has completed his work on an item it automatically moves to the next required person for inputs and next action. The caterpillar (paper/files) will move even faster but it is still a caterpillar. Adoption of databases enterprise resource planning (ERP) tools and Human Resource Management Information System (HR MIS) systems lead to digitalization. They do not always lead to Digital Transformation.

Digital Transformation requires as the name itself suggests “transformation”. The caterpillar doesn’t become a faster caterpillar it needs to transform (or metamorphose) into a butterfly. Digital Transformation needs to create value for the end-user or business. It needs a human-centric approach. It needs to add value and make the various stakeholders at the heart of the change. Let us see this using an example.

As part of my personal medical insurance (no names as this is not to single any entity) I get semiannual free health checkups. I had one completed during the first weekend of September. The process was phygital (Physical + Digital) one could book online and get a confirmation from the health insurer over call before the actual checkup. I got a phone call SMS and email confirming the visit. The blood samples were taken and the report was to be shared in a few days. I got an email sharing my previous health report (taken 6 months back).

The system did not for unknown reasons capture the visit and health checkup. After a few follow-ups the medical insurance call centre executives informed me they had no new reports and were not aware the health checkup was complete! I still await the update on what went wrong.

Has the medical insurance company been transformed or did digitalization just make it a faster caterpillar?

A digitally transformed experience would make the customer at the centre of transformation. There would be a handshake or feedback after the experience and a check if the health checkup was completed or not. In case the health checkup was not completed (medical professional unavailable) it should be rescheduled. In case the medical professional misplaced the blood samples an apology and request to take a fresh sample may be taken. Customers realize that errors happen. However the system in place was unable to transform into a customer-centric avatar.

As we look at digital transformation too often we are focused on faster caterpillars. We do not envision the butterfly.

In the public sector space (like in many other businesses) grievance handling remains a sore issue. Let us consider an example of an aged lady with a Below Poverty Line (BPL) card in a remote village. She has not received her old age pension. She could go from official to official figuring out what the status is.

Now let us imagine what digital transformation can bring to the table. The lady could call a pension grievance phone number. A voice bot (or human) would answer her call and understand her grievance – she had not received her old age pension for the past few months. The voice bot would capture her details and promise an update in a couple of days.

After a couple of days the voice bot would call back and confirm the status. In case the issue was solved on record “and” confirmed by the lady it would be closed. If the lady had continued concerns the system would automatically escalate to higher levels and ensure resolution. She would be annoyed that it was wrongly marked as resolved but would be impressed that the next steps in the resolution would be done without any additional effort from her end. A confirmation handshake/feedback would continue to be taken and acted upon till the matter is resolved.

Proactive citizen centric requires a transformation mindset which focused on the essence that resolution to the satisfaction of the end user is imperative. True transformation redefines the value offered and ensures end-user delight.

As we move towards more exercises in digital transformation we look forward to more butterflies not faster caterpillars!

George Mastrocostas’ Aniko Group has snapped up a Mermaid Beach development site with plans for a multi-tower residential based mixed use village.

On the banks of the Nerang River opposite Pacific Fair the 1.134 hectare Gold Coast Highway parcel is costing c$30 million.

The Mermaid Beach development carries a c$1 billion end value.

Vendor Singapore listed HB (or Ho Bee) Land outlaid $22m in 2012; it also developed the scheme similar to what Aniko which is Gold Coast based is planning.

CBRE’s Mark Witheriff and Daniel Doran with Colliers’ Brendan Hogan and Adam Rubie were the agents.

Mermaid Beach is six kilometres south of Surfers Paradise.

$1b village planned

Comprising 16 lots also with frontage to Pacific Fair Drive – an access point to the shopping centre – and Seaview Avenue the agents marketed the property as a lifestyle precinct master-plan site.

Aniko is intending a hotel and dining precinct plus c5000 square metres of A-grade office space.

About 1000 dwellings will be contained mostly within four towers designed to rise 25 30 40 and 45 floors.

Melbourne based Plus is the architect.

“A site of this scale would normally take years to amalgamate but we are now ready to go with a development that will create a vibrant new coastal community and leave a legacy that we believe will stand the test of time” Mr Mastrocostas said (story continues below).

Artist’s impression of HB Land’s Mermaid Beach proposal.

Earlier this week we reported a developer outlaid $45m for an ex-timeshare complex at Broadbeach – between Mermaid Avenue and Surfers Paradise.

On 2070 square metres that block was marketed for its potential to make way for two c30 level towers.

HB to focus on land

HB listed the asset to focus on its Australian land estates.

In Queensland this includes two sites acquired in mid-2020 at Ripley Valley south west of Brisbane where 570 dwellings are planned and Bli Bli near Maroochydore which came permit-ready for a 95-lot subdivision.

The group also holds low density housing blocks at Park Ridge about 30km from Ripley Valley and Gympie 70km north west of Bli Bli.

HB made a major investment in Melbourne last November picking up the 68.4ha Aitken Hill conference centre at Craigieburn for a speculated $142m.

Not long earlier the developer paid the Deague family $80m for four ex-farms in the neighbouring Mickleham – all up 45.6ha – with plans for a 609-lot subdivision.

Elsewhere in the Victorian capital the company is planning low density estates at Tarneit (with c755 plots) and Officer (c119).

Demi Busatta Cabrera collected more than $103000 between Aug. 1 and Sept. 9 — her best round of fundraising by far to defend the seat representing House District 114 that she won handily two years ago.

Her prior best round of fundraising this election cycle was last September when she amassed $67000.

A month and a half before the Nov. 8 election the freshman Representative from Coral Gables held about $372000 between her campaign account and political committee People Above Politics to fend off her comparatively underfunded challenger Democratic lawyer Adam Benna.

Several political committees donated to Cabrera’s campaign over the last month including the lobbying arms of the Everglades Water Trust Capital City Consulting and Florida Justice Association which each gave her $5000.

A Stronger Florida a political committee chaired by Rubin Turnbull and Associates Director of Operations Celeste Camm gave $4500.

In terms of sheer numbers no industry donated to Cabrera more since Aug. 1 than the health care sector. She received $3000 from Nashville-headquartered company Wellpath $2500 from Centene Management Co. and Orange Park Nursing LLC $2000 from Davita and insurance giant Humana and $1500 from pharma mammoth Pfizer.

Miami-based Independent Living Systems Florida Ambulatory Surgical Centers South Florida Vision Florida Medical Association Dade County Medical Association Council of Florida Family Practitioners and Florida Society of Anesthesiologists donated $1000 apiece.

Other non-medical trade groups and unions chipped in as well. Dade County Firefighters Local 1403 gave Cabrera $6000 her second-biggest contribution over the period. The Florida Engineers Political Action Committee gave $1000.

Cabrera’s largest check was for $7500. It came from Tampa-based holding company TECO Energy a subsidiary of Canadian multinational company Emera Inc.

Other noteworthy contributions included $5000 form Dosal Tobacco $4000 from Associated Builders and Contractors $4000 from companies belonging to Clewiston agriculture behemoth U.S. Sugar Corp. $3500 from NBCUniversal Media $2500 from Anheuser-Busch and $1000 from American Airlines.

Cabrera got ample help from the Republican Party of Florida which gave nearly $11000 worth of in-kind aid for campaign staff and research costs.

She also spent about $8500. Of that $1000 went to the campaign of Ivette Arango O’Doski who is running for the Coral Gables City Commission. Cabrera gave another $1000 to the failed judicial campaign of Renier Diaz de la Portilla younger brother to Miami City Commissioner Alex Diaz de la Portilla and former state Sen. Miguel Diaz de la Portilla.

The preponderance of Cabrera’s spending $4300 went to Tampa-based campaign communications and consulting firm SimWins one of several companies and individuals Coral Gables City Commissioner Jorge Fors Jr. named in a defamation lawsuit he filed with the 11th Judicial Circuit Court Thursday.

Fors is suing Cabrara’s husband Kevin Marino Cabrera among others for partaking in a “civil conspiracy” to malign his public image ahead of the Nov. 8 election. The two men are competing in a runoff for the District 6 seat on the Miami-Dade County Commission.

Benna meanwhile raised just over $12000 between Aug. 1 and Sept. 9 through his campaign account and political committee Sunshine Priorities thanks to a blend of grassroots and organizational gains.

He also got a boost from the Florida Democratic Party which contributed $12400 worth of in-kind aid for campaign staff salaries payroll taxes and research costs.

He had more than $85000 remaining as of Sept. 9.

Nearly 40 people donated to Benna’s campaign with some checks coming in for as low as $1. Matthew Lonk senior director of sales at Orlando-based solutions company Stax Payments donated $1200. Former Miami Herald publisher David Lawrence founder and Chair of The Children’s Movement of Florida contributed $150.

He also accepted $2000 from government affairs firm DC-SOFL and $1000 each from Miami-based Affiliated Healthcare Centers and Tallahassee-headquartered political committee The Ballot Box PC.

Benna appeared to take a break from campaign spending throughout August and in early September. He reported spending just over $300 all of it on fundraising fees.

When it comes to the energy sector Chevron (CVX 0.22%) is probably one of the most boring companies you can find. And that's actually a huge selling point today since energy prices have already rebounded strongly from their low point during the darkest days of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. Here's why this integrated energy giant should be on your short list if you are looking at buying shares of an oil company today.

1. A little up a little down

The energy sector is highly cyclical with often dramatic oil and natural gas price moves leading to equally shocking stock price moves for industry participants. That's not good or bad it just is. However if you don't take this fact into consideration when investing in an energy stock you are likely to be surprised when the tides inevitably turn.

Right now oil and natural gas prices are relatively high so a lot of energy companies look like rock stars. If history is any guide that won't last forever and you'll want to own a stock like Chevron that tends to be less volatile over time. Sure that means it won't participate as much on the upside but saving yourself from huge losses can easily make up for that.

A comparison will help. Kosmos Energy (KOS -1.30%) a small offshore oil driller is up around 4% since the start of 2020. Chevron is up 28%. That period however saw a pandemic-period decline of around 90% in Kosmos Energy's shares followed by a price increase of more than 430%. Chevron's decline was big at around 50% but that's a far cry from 90% and clearly helped it outperform its smaller peer over the total time frame despite a more muted 85% upside performance. Sometimes slow and steady really does win the race.

2. Something to lean on

One of the keys to Chevron's long-term success is its conservative approach. That starts with its integrated business model which includes oil and natural gas production midstream assets like pipelines processing and refining businesses and of course gas stations that dispense fuel to end customers. Essentially it's diversified across almost the entire energy industry value chain.

Although oil and natural gas prices are the main driver of performance some areas of the business (specifically refining) tend to benefit from low energy prices. So there's something to offset the pain of low commodity prices. This however is just part of the story.

The company's conservative nature flows all the way through to its balance sheet. At the moment Chevron's debt-to-equity ratio is the lowest among its closest peer group at 0.17 times. That would in fact be low for any company. But what it gives Chevron is the freedom to take on debt during difficult times so it can continue to invest in its business and support its dividend.

3. Collecting checks

Dividends are more important than you might think. Chevron is a Dividend Aristocrat with 35 years and counting worth of annual dividend increases behind it. That's an incredible record given the ups and downs the energy sector has seen over that time span. Clearly returning value to investors via a growing dividend is important to the company.

That in and of itself is a good thing. But as an investor being able to collect a sizable dividend (the current dividend yield is around 3.6%) during periods when emotions are driving Chevron's stock lower can't be ignored. Those quarterly checks will help to keep you invested so you can benefit from the inevitable industry upturn. Remember that performance comparison with Kosmos Energy above. If you jumped out during the downturn you would have missed the full cycle benefit of owning a company like Chevron.

Times are good but it won't last

Chevron's earnings totaled $11.6 billion in the second quarter of 2022 up from nearly $3.1 billion a year earlier. That's a testament to just how good things are today in the energy business. Other energy companies are doing just as well but you shouldn't expect these incredible results to last for very long. History is very clear here; a downturn will eventually arrive and push financial results and energy shares lower again. If you are looking at energy stocks today this is the worst-case scenario you should be preparing for with your stock picks. A conservative integrated energy giant Chevron is probably one of the best positioned to deal with the inevitable headwinds that will come.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYWtlcnNmaWVsZC5jb20vbmV3cy9iZXJyeS1kcmF3cy1maXJlLWZvci1vZmZlcmluZy10by1idXktdXAtaG9tZXMtaW4tbWNraXR0cmljay9hcnRpY2xlX2UxMTQzMzNlLTNiYTAtMTFlZC04ZTQ3LTk3NGYzZmY5YzlhYi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Berry draws fire for offering to buy up homes in McKittrick,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

Some 1200 people attended the unexpectedly emotional gathering.

Heidelberg's famous Church of the Holy Spirit a 600-year-old edifice in the town's historic city center was the scene of an unusual religious service on Sunday where some 1200 congregants came together to pray and contemplate (and enjoy) a performance of US pop star Taylor Swift's songs as part of a special liturgy.

Staged under the name ""Anti-Hero — Taylor Swift Church Service"" organizers at the Protestant church said the event was conceived to attract younger people as well as to focus on the profound religious convictions expressed in many of Swift's songs.

Swift — who was not at the service but rather on her latest European tour — was raised in the American ""Bible Belt"" and has never hidden her Christian beliefs often integrating these into her music.

This was what inspired church organizers. ""The Church of the Holy Spirit has always been a place of encounter and exchange. That's why a pop-music religious service fits so perfectly"" said Heidelberg Pastor Christof Ellsiepen. ""With it we are giving space to the questions and issues that occupy the younger generation.""

A contemplation of the gospel according to Tay-Tay

Though the idea might suggest a wild concert atmosphere it was largely one of quiet devotion.

Parish Pastor Vincenzo Petracca quoted numerous lyrics and traced Swift's biography emphasizing her attachment to and understanding of Christianity in everyday life.

Petracca acknowledged that Swift's songs are open to numerous interpretations but highlighted the strong Christian — and political — messages she integrates into her songs which address the subjects of women's rights racism and gender equality among others.

The pastor noted however that such topics have made Swift the object of criticism in conservative Christian circles especially among Evangelicals in the US who have branded her ""anti-Christian.""

Swift herself has chastised ""hypocritical faith"" that puts dogma before people. The pastor emphasized as well that ""her faith knows doubt and inner-conflict.""

""Theologically speaking she points to the justness of God"" says Petracca adding ""For her faith and action are inseparable.""

A congregation moved to tears and dancing in their pews

Throughout both Sunday services — two were staged in order to accommodate the large number of people who attended — the congregation which was notably younger and and more female than is often the case were treated to live performances of six Swift songs.

These were performed by Tine Weichmann — a singer from Hamburg and now a professor of popular church music in Heidelberg — and her band. Behind them a rainbow-colored sign reading ""Everybody is welcome!""

One of the most emotionally stirring moments of the service came when Weichmann and her band performed ""Soon You'll Get Better."" Swift wrote the song for her mother who had been diagnosed with cancer.

The lyrics she penned speak to desperation and the healing powers of medicine — and of prayer: ""Holy orange bottles each night I pray to you / Desperate people find faith so now I pray to Jesus too.""

Pastor Petracca who admitted the Church of the Holy Spirit was ""built for Gregorian liturgical music and not for Taylor Swift"" said of the service ""I stared into beaming faces — and during the song that Taylor wrote for her cancer-stricken mother many had tears in their eyes.""

But no Swift-themed service would be complete without an uplifting communal outburst of joy which is exactly what happened when the band struck up the concluding hymn ""Shake It Off!"" This brought the entire congregation to their feet singing and dancing before breaking into furious applause.

""Anti-Hero"" was just the latest in a series of ""City Church Rock 'n' Pop"" services started in 2015.

This June the Church of the Holy Spirit has invited guests from across Europe to take part in a street dance service that will be held at the same time as its ""Church Battle"" dance competition.

Sign up to receive the newsletter in your inbox each Wednesday night.

Utah will be home to 30 of the 350 temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints once construction is complete on all announced temples. The Deseret News recently spoke to the church’s Utah Area president Elder Kevin W. Pearson to talk about the state and temples after the media open house tour for the Taylorsville Utah Temple.

“Utah’s really still the breadbasket of the church” he said in an interview that touched on membership growth and activity and temple covenants and blessings.

Elder Pearson helped lead the media tour which kicked off a public open house that ends on May 18. The Taylorsville Temple will be dedicated on June 2.

Elder Pearson 67 who earned a Harvard MBA and was the CEO of a health care information technology and research company has a broad perspective on the church having served as a General Authority Seventy since 2008 when he was called while serving as president of the Washington Tacoma Mission. He previously served as president of the Pacific Area president of the North America West Area counselor in the Europe East Area presidency and area assistant in the North America Southwest Area.

Deseret News: What is the “State of the Union” for the Utah Area?

Elder Pearson: You’ve got roughly 2.2 million members of the church here. You’ve got some of the most active members in the church here. We have 645 soon to be 650 stakes in Utah. So there’s a tremendous amount of strength in Utah. I’m working with some of the strongest membership of the church.

This is really still where the bench strength is in terms of leadership. Probably still 52-plus percent of all senior couples that serve in the world come out of Utah. About 28-29-30% of all the young missionaries come out of Utah. So Utah’s really still the breadbasket of the church. It is a global church to be certain but the church globally is facilitated by the faithfulness of the members of the church.

Now 21 temples operate in Utah of 30 that are announced (for the state). Where do you think that comes from? It comes from the fact that members of the church have been so faithful in keeping the commandments that they have been blessed and prospered. They’ve prospered in the land to use Book of Mormon language and because of that their faithfulness in paying tithings has created extraordinary opportunity now. You think about April 6 1830 and the organization of the church then with six members to where we are today and what it took in terms of sacrifice to build Kirtland (Ohio) and Nauvoo (Illinois) and now the extraordinary abundance that the church has been blessed with is a direct function of the faithfulness of members of the church. It is extraordinary to go from location to location and witness that.

Almost every stake you go to you think ‘This has got to be the most faithful stake on on the earth’ but it’s just over and over and over. Now having said that there are struggles there are challenges for members of the church. The Salt Lake Valley is sort of declining in membership as people move out to the southwest and to Highland and on the other side of the lake and other places. So there are challenges but there are areas where the church is just exploding. We cannot possibly build buildings fast enough. And there are other areas where it’s like ‘OK this used to be an enormously strong area. Now it’s it’s changing.’ So Utah’s very dynamic is the point I’m trying to make. The church is very dynamic in Utah. It’s not monolithic in terms of the experience you have in any given stake or ward but it still continues to be the stronghold of the church. And it’s just a joy to serve here.

Deseret News: During the April general conference many of the talks were about temple covenants about finding stillness about following Jesus Christ’s teachings about the two great laws of loving God and loving others. What did you take away from conference?

Elder Pearson: If members listened carefully with all of these temples being announced and built — there seems to be one open house after another in Utah — I just hope that the members of the church don’t get casual about the extraordinary significance of having a House of the Lord.

We want to make sure that people are less excited about the architecture of a new building and ‘Boy I wonder what the color scheme is in this temple’ and a lot more focused on ‘What promises am I making what are those covenants?’ — the covenants of obedience and sacrifice and chastity and the gospel and consecration. We make very real promises to our Heavenly Father and the Savior and they are absolutely serious about those.

We’re hoping that members of the church will be ever more increasingly serious and focused on their own covenants. What we’re hoping is that these new temples will help members become ever more focused on putting the Savior and their covenants at the very center of their lives and not just having those an aspect of their lives. We hope the increased proximity of temples will help them with that. The proximity we hope will increase significantly the frequency that people get to the temple. The hope is that there will be a transformational mindset that whenever people see or think about the temple they’ll think about the Savior and they’ll think about the sacred promises they’ve made and they’ll be even more determined and committed to keeping them in every aspect of their life. We hope that members will come to cherish and honor those commitments and covenants above any and all other commitments in their lives. I think that’s the essence of the messages you would have heard over the weekend in conference.

We’re going to teach that. We’re going to continue to teach that everywhere we go at President Russell M. Nelson’s behest so that children will grow up knowing what promises are and what they mean and that they’ll be increasing in their capacity commitment and determination to make and keep sacred covenants in the temple and keep them all their lives.

Deseret News: What are the blessings that come from keeping those commitments in that focused way and making them central and making Christ central in one’s life?

Elder Pearson: My wife’s parents would be an example of this. They were Norwegian and they sold everything they had to come to the U.S. so they could be sealed in the temple. The blessing they wanted was an eternal family. First and foremost that is the blessing. For my wife June and I it’s to be sealed together for forever. The blessing is it changes the way we live our lives it changes the way we think about our marriage that we’re in it for the long term. We don’t let short-term roadblocks or bumps in the road upend us. That is a blessing. It shapes the way we live our lives. For many of members of the church in the past they would get to the temple once in their life and that was it but they went for that one blessing and that assurance.

For us in our day and time the blessing of the temple is that you can come and you can you can rise above the noise. You can rise above the lack of civility. You can rise above the disregard for sacred things and you can come to a space where you are literally a guest in the house of the Lord and you can feel more powerfully the influence of the Holy Ghost. You can feel a sense of peace and assurance in your life. Life is not perfect and there are many challenges that people face but they can come here and feel the blessing that because they’ve made covenants with the Savior in the end all will be well.

That is a day-to-day week-to-week month-to-month blessing that people can have in their lives that’s different than coming for the one blessing of being sealed for time and all eternity and never having an opportunity to go to the temple again.

In addition to that the temple is a place of revelation and a place to feel close to the Lord and to get the answers to challenges or questions or difficulties that you’re facing to gather up strength. All of those things are available in the temple. If you’re listening to our prophet in the days to come we are going to need that more than ever before. So I think the blessings available in the temple are constant but they’re also changing in terms of the times in which we live.

That’s something we hope we can help communicate effectively to the members of the church. Now you can come for daily blessings and weekly blessings and not only the singular hope of eternal families.

Selain pemuda mahasiswa juga kaum intelektual yang harus punya nalar kritis.

Tetapi sekali lagi tulisan ini tidak sepenuhnya menyadur pikiran-pikiran Soe Hok Gie karena berbeda era tetapi paling tidak judul di atas akan menjadi ingatan kita tentang story and history apa yang pernah di lakukan oleh Soe Hok Gie. Setidaknya kita kagum dengan sosoknya yang punya nalar kritis di tengah sistem pemerintahan dan politik yang despotis.

Tulisan ini sesungguhnya mengingatkan kita kepada sosok seorang aktivis mahasiswa yang menghabiskan waktunya naik gunung yakni Soe Hok Gie penulis muda yang kritis yang menyukai seni sastra dan budaya hingga menulis sebuah puisi sehalus kabut Mandalawangi. Ini membuktikan bahwa Soe Hok Gie adalah sosok yang memahami seni dan budaya sesuatu yang universal tanpa batasan.

Nah berangkat dari judul tersebut di atas sepertinya ini disematkan kepada sosok-sosok aktivis saat ini yang masih menyandang predikat sebagai mahasiswa. Pertanyaan awal adalah siapa itu mahasiswa dan apa perannya?

Pertanyaan tersebut sesungguhnya cukup menggelitik sekaligus menampar ”muka” bagi mereka yang tidak memahami esensi sebagai mahasiswa apalagi bagi (mereka) yang masih menganggap dirinya sebagai mahasiswa. Terjemahan secara harfiah mahasiswa adalah mereka yang terdaftar di perguruan tinggi dan sedang mengikuti proses belajar mengajar—jelas berdasarkan Undang-Undang Perguruan Tinggi.

Tetapi memahami mahasiswa tidak cukup dengan pengertian secara gramatikal. Kenapa? Karena pada diri mahasiswa melekat pembeda dengan masyarakat lainnya. Jawabannya sederhana mahasiswa adalah masyarakat ilmiah.

Menyandang predikat masyarakat ilmiah bukanlah hal yang mudah sebab di dalamnya ada kata ”ilmiah”. Dan ini butuh pertanggungjawaban serius bagi mereka yang ”berani” menyandang predikat ini. Sebagai masyarakat ilmiah tentu di harapkan basis-basis pikiran setidaknya beralaskan pada pengetahuan selain tanggung jawab yang lain sebagai agent of control.

Frasa tentang ”mahasiswa” memang tidak mudah sebab peran dan fungsi mahasiswa menjadikan mereka sebagai kelas sosial yang tinggi. Tetapi sebagian kita bisa melihat bagaimana peran dan fungsi mahasiswa saat ini. Dan sekali lagi apa itu mahasiswa? Pertama student activity. Mahasiswa atau kelompok mahasiswa ini lebih memilih jalur akademik—yang sibuk dengan urusan kuliah dan berjibaku dengan tugas-tugas kuliah dan berpikir bagaimana selesai tepat waktu—dan bisa kerja (work oriented).

Kedua mahasiswa gentlemen C. Mahasiswa model ini terjebak pada aliran filsafat ”lebih baik daripada”. Artinya mereka bangga kalau sudah memperoleh nilai C ketimbang tidak lulus sama sekali. Tetapi kelompok ini sedikit kritis ia meyakini hope itu adalah kemerdekaan walau sedikit cuek dengan kondisi yang ada.

Ketiga mahasiswa 5K (kampus kamar kos kampung kawin). Mahasiswa model ini sedikit tidak memiliki sense of crisis sulit diterjemahkan ia mengambil peran sebagai apa.

Mahasiswa 5K (kampus kamar kos kampung kawin). Mahasiswa model ini sedikit tidak memiliki sense of crisis.

Keempat mahasiswa isolasi (ibadah sosial dan demonstrasi). Kelompok ini tentu lebih memilki kepekaan (sense of crisis) karena peran sebagai mahasiswa melekat dengan kuat pada pribadinya. Peran sebagai kontrol sosial tak cukup tetapi ia memainkan peran-perannya secara pikiran dan politik baik sebagai agent of change agent of modernize atau agent of development.

Konsep Tri Dharma Perguruan Tinggi (pendidikan penelitian dan pengabdian kepada masyarakat) sebagai kewajiban bagi mahasiswa tetapi peran-peran sosial jangan diabaikan seperti bersuara lantang di jalanan menolak kebijakan pemerintah yang tidak prorakyat seperti kenaikan harga BBM. Dan perguruan tinggi memberi ruang untuk itu sebagai sarana tumbuh berkembangnya pengetahuan.

KOMPAS/HERU SRI KUMORO Unjuk rasa mahasiswa di depan Gedung Parlemen Senayan Jakarta Kamis (7/10/2021). Mereka antara lain menyuarakan agar Pancasila menjadi hukum tertinggi. Selain itu mereka juga menyuarakan berbagai kondisi terkini seperti mulai adanya usaha pembungkaman terhadap kebebasan berpendapat.

Simbolisme pengetahuan

Perguruan tinggi adalah simbolisme dari pengetahuan karena di sana proses transaksi pikiran terjadi. Dialektika pengetahuan terus-menerus dilakukan untuk menemukan esensi manusia berpikir dan itu ada di kampus.

Dalam sejarah disebutkan bahwa perguruan tinggi itu dibangun oleh beberapa soko guru (penopang) di antaranya pertama mimbar akademik yang merupakan sarana bagi sivitas akademika untuk menyampaikan pendapat saran kritik sebagai bentuk kebebasan pengetahuan dan menjaga atmosfer akademik.

Kedua kebebasan akademik yang merupakan sarana bagi sivitas akademika untuk terus-menerus mengembangkan potensi diri yang bukan hanya pengetahuan itu diperoleh secara kognitif tetapi juga dengan empirisme. Kebebasan akademik sebagai bukti bahwa kampus itu tak terbelenggu dengan kekuasaan apalagi dengan kepentingan politik tertentu.

Ketiga kebebasan keilmuan. Ini sarana bagi sivitas akademika untuk secara kontinu mengembangkan pengetahuan tanpa harus dibatasi.

Menjadi aktivis tidak cukup dengan suara lantang di jalanan tetapi harus dialas melalui pikiran-pikiran yang bersumber dari pengetahuan tentunya dengan banyak membaca buku.

Me-review ketiga variabel tersebut di atas maka dapat disimpulkan bahwa sejarah perguruan tinggi adalah sejarah tentang kemerdekaan kebebasan dan pengetahuan. Hanya saja sering kali kita menjumpai sosok yang mengatasnamakan diri sebagai mahasiswa plus aktivis tetapi berjauhan dengan buku. Ini kemudian menjadi aneh sebab menjadi aktivis tidak cukup dengan suara lantang di jalanan tetapi harus dialas melalui pikiran-pikiran yang bersumber dari pengetahuan tentunya dengan banyak membaca buku.

Buku politik pesta dan cinta kalau dipahami secara mendalam sesungguhnya frasa ini tersematkan kepada kaum intelektual (mahasiswa). Penyematan ini bukan tanpa alasan bahwa peran politik mahasiswa dari era ke era memang berbeda bukan hanya pada isu termasuk juga dengan penguasa yang di zamannya. Termasuk tragedi ”cinta” yang dialami mahasiswa walau sesungguhnya cinta itu tak selamanya manis tetapi cinta itu adalah kemewahan bagi mereka yang memilikinya.

KOMPAS/FERGANATA INDRA RIATMOKO Mahasiswa mengikuti upacara penerimaan mahasiswa baru di Lapangan Pancasila UGM Yogyakarta Senin (1/8/2022). Pada tahun ini UGM menerima 9.833 mahasiswa baru. Menjadi mahasiswa berarti masuk kelompok masyarakat ilmiah yang diharapkan tidak hanya menimba ilmu tetapi juga kritis menyikapi kondisi di sekitarnya.

Politik heroisme bagi mahasiswa adalah sesuatu yang wajar ketika mahasiswa berhadapan dengan moncong senjata dan tindakan represif penguasa. Walau kadang kita menemukan mahasiswa digebuki oleh penguasa saat demonstrasi mungkin karena pelanggaran kode etik di jalanan kode etik pikiran adalah yang terbebaskan—ini miris ketika negara despotis terhadap generasinya.

Karena itu mahasiswa paling tidak dibekali literasi yang kuat agar terus membaca buku menulis sehingga tidak terjebak pada kejumudan dan kehilangan momentum dalam kehidupannya sebagai mahasiswa. Subastian Tito (mantan Presiden Partai Komunis Uni Soviet sekarang Rusia) pernah mengatakan ”Mahasiswa tanpa idealisme sebaiknya dikubur hidup-hidup.” Ini sarkasme tetapi penting bagi seorang mahasiswa agar lakon-lakon sosialnya tetap diperankan.

Sebab di beberapa negara termasuk Amerika Latin kaum civil society begitu kuat dalam melawan hegemoni kekuasaan—dan saya kira di bangsa ini (Indonesia) memiliki sejarah panjang dalam pergolakan politik di mana peran mahasiswa tak terabaikan. Mahasiswa tak memiliki kekuatan politik dalam bentuk regulasi sebagaimana posisi DPR dan presiden tetapi mahasiswa memiliki pikiran kritis walau jalanan menjadi sajadah panjang bagi mereka untuk berjuang atas nama rakyat. Maka tentu kita rindu teriakan “Hidup mahasiswa!”

Pesan penutup: ”Kemiskinan sejatinya bukanlah semalam tanpa makan melainkan sehari tanpa berpikir” (Ali Syariati).

Pola jatuh cinta pria dan wanita memiliki perbedaan. Pola jatuh cinta keduanya bahkan kerap kali bertolak belakang.

Wanita dinilai dapat mengungkapkan emosinya secara verbal. Sementara pria cenderung lebih sering memendam emosinya.

Jika Anda penasaran seperti apa perbedaan pola jatuh cinta antara pria dan wanita simak penjelasannya di bawah ini yang dilansir dari laman bustle.com.

1. Pria mengalami perasaan cinta lebih cepat

Selama ini mungkin Anda berpikir bahwa wanita yang mengembangkan perasaan dan jatuh cinta terlebih dahulu tetapi dalam banyak kasus justru menunjukkan hal sebaliknya.

Hal itu diutarakan oleh pakar kencan dan pendiri Double Trust Dating Jonathan dan David Bennett.

""Pria cenderung jatuh cinta dan mengungkapkan perasaan cinta lebih cepat daripada wanita meskipun percaya bahwa wanita jatuh hati lebih cepat"" ujar mereka kepada Bustle.

Alasan lainnya berkaitan dengan biologi. Para peneliti berpendapat bahwa secara evolusi wanita harus lebih berhati-hati agar tidak jatuh cinta pada seseorang karena mereka perlu memilih pasangan terbaik.

2. Wanita sulit mengontrol perasaannya

Ilustrasi. Perbedaan pola jatuh cinta pria dan wanita (Foto: iStock/gustavofrazao) Ilustrasi. Perbedaan pola jatuh cinta pria dan wanita (Foto: iStock/gustavofrazao)

Ketika jatuh cinta wanita mungkin ingin selalu berada dekat pria yang ia sukai. Saat sendiri mungkin wanita juga akan melihat foto atau mendengarkan suara pria yang ia sukai dengan menelepon.

Namun hal berbeda terjadi pada pria yang sedang jatuh cinta. Mereka bisa lebih santai dan lebih mampu mengontrol perasaannya.

Pria cenderung dapat menyimpan rasa cinta dan emosinya sedangkan wanita cenderung lebih sensitif dan mampu mengungkapkan perasaannya.

Itulah mengapa wanita kerap kali dianggap lebih baperan dalam masalah percintaan.

3. Pria sering merasa kalau cintanya tidak berbalas

Meski pria umumnya kerap menyatakan perasaan cintanya lebih dulu tetapi pria juga sering merasa kalau cintanya ada kemungkinan tidak berbalas.

Dalam penelitian tersebut pria dilaporkan kerap jatuh cinta pada pandangan pertama dengan persentase cinta yang tidak berbalas lebih tinggi.

Persepsi pria yang berlebihan tentang minat seksual wanita mungkin menjelaskan alasan mereka akhirnya melaporkan perasaannya sering tak berbalas.

4. Wanita lebih tertarik pada karisma

Ilustrasi. Perbedaan pola jatuh cinta pria dan wanita (Foto: iStockphoto/whyframestudio) Ilustrasi. Perbedaan pola jatuh cinta pria dan wanita (Foto: iStockphoto/whyframestudio)

Pria umumnya tertarik pada penampakan visual tetapi wanita lebih tertarik karena karisma. Sebagai contoh pria yang suka dengan wanita feminin akan tertarik dengan wanita berambut panjang.

Sementara wanita dapat tertarik melalui karisma yang dipancarkan dari seorang pria. Contohnya wanita lebih mudah jatuh hati kepada pria yang suka melakukan kebaikan dan bersifat humanis.

Meski demikian penelitian ini bisa jadi tidak sepenuhnya benar.

5. Wanita cenderung mudah berubah pikiran

Wanita terbawa perasaan dengan perlakuan baik sekecil apa pun. Namun ketika hubungan yang dijalani tidak sesuai dengan ekspektasinya wanita bisa gampang berubah pikiran.

Sementara pria justru butuh beberapa alasan logis untuk memantapkan perasaannya. Saat segala sesuatu sudah sesuai dengan kriteria pria akan mengikat dan menjaganya agar tidak lepas.

At the outset of the campaign Global Citizen called on world leaders major corporations and philanthropic foundations to End Extreme Poverty NOW and invest $600 million into the future of women and girls; close the annual $10 billion climate financing shortfall; deliver $500 million to help African farmers respond to the global food crisis; reallocate IMF Special Drawing Rights to provide urgent relief from debts unjustly crushing economies and defend advocacy. Though the campaign's outcomes and commitments represent progress for the most urgent needs facing humanity and the planet there is still much work to be done ahead of the G20 and COP27 in November.

""Amidst all the doomsday messages we hear today hope lies in the fact that millions of citizens are rising up to take action more than any other point in history. 10 years ago Global Citizen was just an idea – and 10 years from now we'll see a generation of global citizens running for office starting companies and transforming communities. The media is pushing us to the extreme left or to the extreme right but the solutions lie in the center. Ending extreme poverty is not a partisan issue and those most in need can not be treated like political pawns. Our job is to not let our leaders forget that. If you are lucky enough to live in a democracy use your voice!"" – Hugh Evans Co-Founder and CEO Global Citizen

""We have a limited window of opportunity to act decisively to lift millions of people out of poverty promote inclusiveness and equality and safeguard the health of our planet. Each one of us has a sacred and moral obligation to bequeath to the next generation a healthy planet free from poverty conflict discrimination hunger and disease. I call on the youth of the world especially and in particular the youth of Africa to play an active role in achieving the SDGs. The world needs your creativity knowledge reach and energy to help find innovative solutions to the challenges facing our world."" – H.E. Nana Akufo-Addo President of Ghana

""It's great to join you for the 10th year of this festival. Thank you for building this movement and making big things happen. Last month I signed the biggest climate bill in history – the biggest ever: $369 billion to slash emissions by nearly half improve health advance justice build a clean energy economy and create generations of good paying jobs. And this past week the Senate ratified historic Kigali amendment to phase down the use of super-polluting hydrofluorocarbons. This is a whole new chapter for America and for the planet. And we have to do a lot more. I pledged $11 billion a year to help poor countries fight climate change. Working with Congress and with your help we can get this done."" – Joe Biden President of the United States of America via video address.

""Global Citizens I hear you loud and clear! Europe is answering your call. We must put an end to hunger. We need to defeat deadly diseases like AIDS or malaria. We must take care of our girls and women! We must also take care of our planet. I call on all world leaders to step up! And I count on you to drive us forward."" – Ursula von der Leyen President of the European Commission

""Poor countries [are] paying the price for wealthy nations' errors. So I'm standing here today speaking directly to the leaders of wealthy nations who received billions of dollars from the International Monetary Fund through Special Drawing Rights for COVID-19 relief. Make good on your promise of reallocating some of those funds. Honor your word and provide at the very least the $100 billion promised for adaptation for climate vulnerable countries. I am also here to call on multilateral institutions like the World Bank to act. The only way ahead is a just green energy transition. And my friends our time is running out."" – Mia Mottley Prime Minister of Barbados

“Live sports are the only way for companies to get a faster reach and build up"" said Arnab Roy vice president and head marketing Coca-Cola India and Southwest Asia. However Indian Premier League (IPL) has become very expensive to advertise on he added.

According to a five-year global partnership it signed in 2019 Coca-Cola will be the official sponsor for all ICC events including the T20 World Cups for both men and women and the Men’s Cricket World Cup in India in 2023. “With ICC we feel good about how much we are paying and we think it is a very effective investment. It is one of our pretty long-standing partnerships and we continue to build that relationship. We’ve got tremendous value not just in India but in other markets as well"" Roy said.

However the advertising rates are likely to go up for IPL. “And we think it’s very expensive. At the end of the day it is about a return-on-investment-driven game. We’ve not made a decision whether we want to advertise in IPL or not"" he said.

Meanwhile the company has finalized its activation plan for the ICC T20 World Cup which will be held in Australia with a digital-first approach. “This is going to be an experiment with ideas such as the stump camera to give fans exclusive access to match footage and content"" Roy said. Coca-Cola India’s billion-dollar brand Thums Up is launching the ‘Stump Cam’ campaign featuring Jasprit Bumrah and Umran Malik and former Australian great Brett Lee. It seeks to amplify Thums Up’s initiative by offering exclusive match moments.

Roy refused to share the company’s advertising budget for India but said: “We will not cut down on marketing spends as the category is all about marketing. It has been a fantastic year from a business standpoint so far.""

The firm has also invested in other sports. For instance it launched an isotonic drink brand Limca Sportz having Neeraj Chopra as the brand ambassador. Besides it has launched a marketing initiative global meals experience platform titled ‘Coca-Cola is Cooking’ wherein it will collaborate with food companies to serve dishes along with its aerated beverages.

And first-time Guests visiting from the state of Texas are especially in for a shock because of a decision Walt Disney made more than 80 years ago.

There are exceptions to every rule but on the whole true Texans can be some of the most welcoming and friendliest people you’ll meet. (Again there are those exceptions.) It comes with the territory–literally and figuratively. Texans love chatting up strangers and they love their “Friday Night Lights” a phenomenon that takes over the state every autumn at high school football stadiums across the massive Lone Star State (some 268000 square miles of it) and speaking of football Texans love their Cowboys though that’s not the only NFL team you’ll find deep in the heart of Texas.

Most Texas households have at least one truck (whether they own cattle and horses or not) and it’s often the “Texas Edition” version of that particular truck.

They love their Whataburger their Schlitterbahn tubing on the Guadalupe River Buc-ee’s and barbecue. They love chatting up strangers and “blessing their hearts.” And Texans love their Dr. Pepper.

For a lot of them Dr. Pepper isn’t just another beverage. It’s one of the many long-standing traditions in the state some of which must be explained more than once to non-Texans. (But that’s ok because Texans are well-versed in striking up conversations with people they didn’t know existed only moments before.)

Dr. Pepper hails from the Central Texas town of Waco and was first manufactured and sold in 1885. (There’s even a Dr. Pepper Museum in Waco.) But it would be several years before non-Texans finally met Dr. Pepper up-close and in person at the 1904 World’s Fair.

People from Texas really like their Dr. Pepper and they’re in for a big shock the first time they visit the Walt Disney World Resort and discover that the famous Texas-favorite beverage simply isn’t available in any flavor in the parks. And that presents a big problem for some Texans; they love it that much! And for the life of them they simply don’t operate with a mindset that would choose Coca-Cola over Dr. Pepper; it just doesn’t make sense to them.

But the absence of Dr. Pepper at Disney World isn’t an oversight a misunderstanding or a snafu. On the contrary Guests find Coca-Cola products at the Disney World Resort thanks to a partnership created by Walt Disney himself about 80 years ago. According to Disney Parks Blog Walt Disney made the decision to partner with Coca-Cola in 1942 years before the world had ever seen a Disney Park.

His love affair with the soft drink manufacturer began that year with an appearance by Walt disney on a radio program owned by the beverage maker:

“Our relationship with Coca-Cola started in 1942 when Walt Disney first appeared on the Coca-Cola radio program ‘The Pause That Refreshes on the Air.’ In fact back in 1950 Disney’s television special “One Hour in Wonderland” was sponsored by The Coca-Cola Company! And when Disneyland opened on July 17 1955 our friends at Coke were right there alongside us sponsoring Refreshment Corner on Main Street U.S.A.”

The partnership most likely began as more of a necessity as Walt needed more funding to build all he wanted to build at Disneyland. To that end he garnered support from corporate sponsors for individual attractions. For example when Disneyland opened in 1955 Coca-Cola sponsored the Coca-Cola Refreshment Corner and Pepsi-Cola sponsored the Golden Horseshoe.

But alas Dr. Pepper has yet to have the good fortune of Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola but there’s always room for improvement. So for now Texans will have to bring their own bottles of Dr. Pepper into the parks or take a vow of abstinence from Dr. Pepper while they’re at the Walt Disney World Resort. (But if you bring glass bottles of Dr. Pepper you’ll shed tears as you mourn their loss as they’ll be confiscated since glass bottles are prohibited at Disney World.)

Sorry Lone Star Staters. The absence of Dr. Pepper at Disney World can surely seem unmagical unimaginable and perhaps even unwelcoming. So if you’re heading to Disney’s Central Florida parks soon (or to Disneyland in California) prepare for a shock. We can only hope this post lessens the sting of that shock.

And while we’re talking about things Texans won’t find at Disney World it’s worth noting that the closest Buc-ee’s is more than 70 miles from the Walt Disney World Resort and if it’s an H-E-B you’re looking for well you just need to keep on going–second star to the right and straight on till Texas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9uZXdzL3JlYWwtbGlmZS1zdG9yaWVzL2ktZ3Jldy11cC1wb29yLWNvY2EtMjgwNzAyNzHSAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy5taXJyb3IuY28udWsvbmV3cy9yZWFsLWxpZmUtc3Rvcmllcy9pLWdyZXctdXAtcG9vci1jb2NhLTI4MDcwMjcxLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'I grew up so poor Coca-Cola was a luxury - now I make £300k a month on OnlyFans',"Sophie Dee grew up on a 'rundown' council estate and could only have a taste of Coca-Cola at Christmas - but now she's one of the richest OnlyFans models in the world

A woman who grew up on a council estate and could only afford to drink Coca-Cola as a Christmas luxury now lives in a multi-million pound home - after raking in £300000 a month as an OnlyFans model.

Sophie Dee 38 has just landed herself on the first-ever Forbes Top 50 content creator list as one of the richest OnlyFans creators in the world and boasts over 12 million followers on social media. The model owns a total of three luxury properties drives a £120000 Porsche and is constantly jetting off around the world on pricey holidays - but her lifestyle these days is a stark contrast to the way she grew up in South Wales.

She said: ""We pretty much survived on welfare throughout my childhood. My family lived on a rundown council estate. We never had name brand products in the house – even a bottle of Coca-Cola was a treat reserved for Christmas – and we had to put coins into the back of the TV when we wanted to watch it.

""I went to school in my brother's hand-me-downs and everyone knew that we were poor. I'm from a tiny village – it's about a mile long – and everyone knows everyone's business.

""Now I want for nothing and it feels amazing to be on the Forbes list of top content creators because it's a validation of sex work. Sex work is work maybe this will finally make people understand that.""

After kickstarting her career Sophie moved from Wales to the US where she currently lives in Las Vegas with her boyfriend Tyler 36 and their nine rescue pets - including six cats and three dogs.

And the model admitted that part of the reason she left her hometown was because of the vile comments people would make about her job as she said people would ""call her names"" and ""stare"" at her in the street.

She added: ""The whole family – my dad step-mum and brother – hated it when I started out. No father wants this for his daughter but dad has since come around to the idea and understands that this is a real job.

""Before I left the UK people in our village would stare and call me names saying I was a s**g. It was horrible but it actually helped better prepare me today for the challenges of becoming a public figure on social media – people can be really demeaning online.""

Sophie no longer wants for anything thanks to her hefty paycheque but has insisted she doesn't like to splash out on expensive clothes just for the sake of it - as she'd rather wear second-hand designer items than buy them new.

""You're more likely to see me sporting a look from Shein than Prada"" she explained "" I don't like spending full price for luxury fashion goods I think it's something that has stuck with me since childhood. When I do buy them it's typically second-hand.""

The model has also admitted that starting her OnlyFans career wasn't plain sailing as she struggled with her income when she was starting out and even had one month where she had to get by with just $200 (£184).

And even though she now has enough cash to retire before she turns 40 Sophie says her upbringing has made her so conscious about her finances that she intends to keep working until she's ""old and grey"".

She said: ""When I first started out my monthly earnings were all over the place. One month I'd make $600 then $1000 and once I scraped by just $200.

""I'm careful with my cash too putting a lot of money in stocks bonds my pension crypto and in business ventures. I recently launched a website that handles promo for models called Shoutout Express – it became so big that we are launching a new version Gig Social and it has cost me $300000 to build.

""When you grow up poor there's a feeling that sticks with you. I have enough money to retire several times over but I never stop stressing about it and I'll never stop trying to make more. I'm pretty sure I'll be working until I'm old and grey.""

England-Chisholm caught two passes — the first of them being a 71-yard touchdown in the first quarter the other being the 98-yarder in the fourth — to help the Blue Raiders (3-1) seal the upset.

Cunningham completed 16 of 25 passes for Middle Tennessee State including a 69-yard scoring throw to Elijah Metcalf. Cunningham and Frank Peasant also ran for scores for the Blue Raiders and defensive end Zaylin Wood returned an interception for a touchdown.

Key’Shawn Smith returned a kickoff 91 yards for a touchdown for Miami (2-2) which turned the ball over on its first three possessions and never escaped the early hole it dug. Quarterback Tyler Van Dyke — the Atlantic Coast Conference rookie of the year last season — was pulled in the third quarter and replaced by Jake Garcia.

Van Dyke completed 16 of 32 passes for 138 yards one touchdown to Henry Parrish Jr. and two interceptions — those coming on Miami’s first and third plays from scrimmage. Garcia completed 10 of 19 passes for 161 yards for the Hurricanes who heard plenty of boos from the fans who showed up to what was not even a half-filled stadium; most were long gone before the final whistle.

Garcia entered midway through the third quarter and brought an immediate spark. He engineered a five-play 72-yard touchdown drive — fueled by passes of 39 and 23 yards Miami’s two biggest gains of the day to that point — and got the Hurricanes within 31-17 on a 1-yard rush by Thaddeus Franklin.

That was the first of two touchdowns by Franklin the other coming from a yard out with 6:05 left to get the Hurricanes within 45-31.

The win was a long time coming for MTSU coach Rick Stockstill who played his college football at Florida State — Miami’s rival. The Seminoles went 0-2 in games that Stockstill played against the Hurricanes in 1980 and 1981.

Those games were close. This one wasn’t.

And while a blowout might have been expected with Miami entering as a 25.5-point favorite few if anyone would have dared to say it would be the Blue Raiders doing the romping. It even had oddsmakers scrambling; MTSU actually became the betting favorite to win by the midpoint of the second quarter according to FanDuel Sportsbook.

It was 10-0 before Miami got on the board 24-3 early in the second quarter when Cunningham scored on a 9-yard rush. The Hurricanes never got closer than 14 points the rest of the way.

Miami had a chance to get within a touchdown on a 4th-and-goal from the Middle Tennessee 1 on the opening play of the fourth quarter; Garcia’s pass couldn’t be controlled by tight end Will Mallory causing a turnover on downs.

The next play England-Chisolm got loose down the left sideline for the biggest pass play ever allowed by the Hurricanes two yards longer than the 96-yard pass Maryland’s Darrius Heyward-Bey caught from Sam Hollenbach in 2006.

From there it was only a matter of time before MTSU could truly start the celebration.

THE TAKEAWAY

Middle Tennessee State: The Blue Raiders went to the upper level of college football now called FBS in 1999. Entering Saturday they were 0-20 against opponents that were ranked in the AP Top 25 poll when those games were played and outscored by 585 points — 868-283.

Miami: According to SportRadar the Hurricanes became the first Power 5 school this season to commit three turnovers in a first quarter. The last Power 5 school to achieve that ignominious feat was ... Miami last season against Florida State.

POLL IMPLICATIONS

It’s over for Miami for now. The Hurricanes were No. 25 and will fall out of the poll Sunday. At 2-2 it’ll be difficult for the Hurricanes to be considered again by many voters anytime soon.

NEVER LED

MTSU is now 3-0 all-time against Miami with the other wins coming in 1931 and 1932. The Hurricanes never held the lead in any of those games.

It was Tennessee's second win over Florida in the last 18 meetings and snapped a six-game losing streak in the series. The win gave the Volunteers their first 4-0 start since 2016.

Tennessee (4-0 1-0 Southeastern Conference) took control in the fourth quarter when it traveled 87 yards for a TD after a fumble by Gators (2-2 0-2) quarterback Anthony Richardson.

Richardson had a career-high 453 passing yards and two touchdowns and ran for 62 and two scores in a raucous Neyland Stadium.

Tennessee led 17-14 at halftime following a first half loaded with big offensive plays on both sides.

Hooker who shook off what was reported as an upper-body injury threw for 248 yards including a 70-yard connection with Bru McCoy for the Vols' longest play from scrimmage this season.

A 99-yard drive that ended with a one-yard pass from Hooker to McCoy gave Tennessee the lead 7 seconds before the break.

Richardson had a career-high 220 passing yards by intermission and connected with his first TD pass of the season. Keon Zipperer broke three arm tackles on his way to a 44-yard score.

MISSING (OR NOT) IN ACTION

The left leg injury that forced Tennessee WR Cedric Tillman to miss a good deal of the Akron game caused him to be held out. ... Vols WR Jimmy Calloway couldn't play in the first half against the Gators because of a team suspension after being ejected last week for punching an Akron player. ... Florida OT Michael Tarquin (lower leg injury) and long snapper Marco Ortiz did not play. .... LB Ventrell Miller who missed last week's game with a right foot injury started.

FACTS & FIGURES

Tennessee QB Hendon Hooker had a string of 14 consecutive pass completions including 12 against Akron before a misfire. ... In back-to-back second-quarter plays Richardson threw his first TD pass of the season for 44 yards to Keon Zipperer before Hooker's 70-yarder to McCoy. ... Midway through the second quarter Richardson had thrown for 207 yards a career high. ... Florida had just three sacks in its first three games. It had three Saturday. ... RB Jabari Small's 16-yard TD reception was his first. ... Florida was four of five in fourth-down conversions.

THE TAKEAWAY

Florida: In order to have success in the remainder of their SEC games the Gators will need to add a dimension to their offensive attack. Once defenses focus on containing Richardson in the pocket the variables in the offense are limited. Richardson was able to avoid the pressure and has been sacked just twice this season.

Tennessee: Getting WR Cedric Tillman (leg) healthy is imperative if the Vols plan on competing against the elite in the SEC. Having that weapon available is key to giving LSU Alabama and Kentucky something to game-plan against.

UP NEXT

Florida: After playing three ranked teams in the first four weeks of the season the Gators get a break by hosting Eastern Washington Saturday.

Tennessee: An open date Saturday gives the Vols an opportunity to catch their breath before going to LSU and then hosting No. 2 Alabama."

These are also employed in many flavorings and food preparations that don’t need a heat source like salad dressings and bread dips.

During different food preparations extraction refining and processing cause a variety of changes in the physicochemical makeup and composition of the cooking medium. To fulfill each oil’s special property care should be taken when selecting it.

Since the beginning of time oils and fats have been used in the preparation of food making them a notable component of the modern diet. Given that they contain more than twice as many calories as carbohydrates they are a good source of nutritional energy. Oils and fats bring out food’s flavor and nutritional value by serving these functions. They work as a vehicle for vital minor components like vitamins and as a source of energy.

Types of oils that are used in India

India is lucky to have a wide variety of oilseed crops grown in its different agroclimatic zones. Groundnut mustard rapeseed sesame safflower linseed nigerseed and castor are one of the oilseeds that are still grown historically. Soybean and sunflower grew in popularity recently. Coconut is the most important crop grown on plantations. In the northeastern regions of Kerala the Andaman and Nicobar Islands Karnataka Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh oil palm is farmed.

The oil industry of India

Due to the rising demand for healthy oil increased export and population expansion the Indian Edible Oil market is projected to rise.

The 2020–2027 forecast period predicts a strong expansion of the Indian edible oil market. It is a result of people’s growing preference for pure unfiltered and nutritious oil. Customers are picking premium edible oils more because they are becoming more concerned with their health. The demand for a premium or value-added edible oils like canola oil olive oil and rice bran oil is driven by the increasing prevalence of lifestyle-related disorders including diabetes high cholesterol and hypertension. The growth of the Indian edible oil sector will be aided during the projection periods by the increasing population and economy.

Contribution of oil to health

You should only eat fats in moderation even if your body requires them to function. Even tiny quantities work. Saturated and trans-fat-rich foods can make worse autoimmune diseases cancer and heart disease. These lipids help insulin resistance which can lead to diabetes to develop.

Examine each element of your diet

The oil contains nine calories per gram compared to proteins carbohydrates and fat. Even the best oils like olive and avocado include fats. No more than 25% to 35% of the calories consumed each day should be made up of fat. Remember that salt and sugar are commonly added to foods whose fat content has been reduced through processing for flavors. These might not be the best trades to make.

Consider using nutrient-dense oils

There is no denying that some oils can improve your health. Olive oil may increase HDL levels while lowering LDL levels of harmful cholesterol. Beta-carotene and the vitamins A E D and K are just a few of the fantastic benefits found in olive oil.

Consider your oil-based cooking methods

Your food will absorb more oil if you often deep-fry with oil. Instead experiment with sautéing with less oil. The extreme heat from frying also fosters free radicals over time which could raise your risk of developing skin cancer.

People should only ingest little amounts of any oil that can be used for cooking at very high temperatures. Beyond the stovetop and oven vegetable oil has a variety of other uses that people can enjoy.

Demand and supply of edible oil

India consumes a lot of edible oil due to the country’s large population and increased availability. The great usage of edible oil in Indian cuisine is mostly due to the country’s high population density. Despite having a big agricultural economy many agro-climatic conditions and an abundance of land India imports most of the oil it consumes.

This is due to a lack of indigenous production of edible oil which is unable to meet demand. Even though the Indian government is working to expand domestic production of edible oil doing so could help farmers and reduce the dependency on imports. Most of the supply-and-demand gap will be closed during the ensuing decades by increasing oilseed production and stable domestic vegetable oil supplies.

Qatar Energy Minister Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi with TotalEnergies Chairman Patrick Pouyanne

France's TotalEnergies on Saturday signed a new $1.5 billion deal to help expand Qatar's natural gas production as Europe struggles to find new energy sources to replace Russian supplies.

The French energy giant will have a 9.3% stake in Qatar's North Field South project part of the world's biggest natural gas reserves Qatar Energy Minister Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi mentioned at a signing ceremony.

TotalEnergies chairman Patrick Pouyanne said the French company would invest $1.5 billion in the new field.

The company had already agreed in June to put more than $2 billion into Qatar's North Field East and Al-Kaabi said ""With this agreement we see an enhanced position for TotalEnergies as a long term strategic partner.""

According to Al-Kaabi 25% of the field is to be reserved for foreign firms and more deals will be announced in the coming weeks.

Britain's Shell Italy's ENI and US giants ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil have already signed up to be part of North Field East.

Qatar aims to increase LNG production by more than 60%

Qatar has embarked on a massive expansion of the whole North Field aiming to increase its liquefied natural gas (LNG) production by more than 60% by 2027.

The boost comes as Europe struggles to replace supplies of Russian oil and natural gas due to anti-Russian sanctions imposed by the European Union over the war in Ukraine.

Al-Kaabi who is to host talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Doha on Sunday refused to discuss negotiations with Germany but expressed surprise at media reports that Qatar was insisting on a 20-year supply deal.

The war in Ukraine came as Europe was already facing an energy crisis and Qatar has hosted multiple visits by European leaders seeking gas supplies.

Europe had to accept longer deals to guarantee supplies

Europe had rejected the long-term deals that Qatar seeks but a change in attitude has been forced as it faces a looming winter of energy shortages.

""We are in active discussions with the majority of buyers around the world and some are advancing more than others"" Al-Kaabi told a news conference after the ceremony.

""For us 15 years plus constitutes a long term deal"" the Qatari Minister added.

Pouyanne considered that Europe had to accept longer deals to guarantee supplies. Producer countries and energy majors have insisted on the need for certainty in contracts to justify the huge investments needed in the gas industry.

""The question is simple -- the longer it (the contract) is the better the price will be for the buyer"" Pouyanne said.

""If you want a cheap price for a short duration the answer will be 'no'"" he added.

Qatar's gas is among the cheapest to produce

It is noteworthy that Qatar is one of the world's top LNG producers alongside the United States Australia and Russia.

State-owned Qatar Energy estimates the North Field holds about 10% of the world's known natural gas reserves. LNG from the North Field is expected to start coming on line in 2026.

South Korea Japan and China have traditionally been the main markets for Qatari LNG.

Qatar's gas is among the cheapest to produce and has fuelled an economic boom in the tiny Gulf emirate.

Can I Get a Discount? (Published 2022),"It sounds like your condo board is doing its part to fix the problem. If it weren’t you would have the law behind you: The New York State Multiple Dwelling Law requires every building owner (including condo associations) to provide residents with gas or electricity for cooking. So if your board wasn’t meeting the task you could report the situation to 311 or start what is known as an HP proceeding in housing court to force action.

As for financial remedies to lessen the inconvenience of life without gas tenants in rental buildings (particularly rent-stabilized tenants who have vast protections in their leases) can request rent abatements on the grounds that their basic services have been diminished. But you own your apartment so different rules apply.

“You don’t live in a rental building — there is not a landlord who is going to give you a rental abatement” said Leni Morrison Cummins a lawyer and the chairwoman of the condo and co-op group in the Manhattan office of the law firm Cozen O’Connor. “You are an owner and you are proportionally responsible for your share.”

You might want to use this opportunity to consider switching your appliances from gas to electric a process that would involve capping your gas line and may require the advice of an electrician and input from your condo board. But it would get your apartment up and running again and would be in line with the city’s long-term goal to move away from gas dependency.

Bajo la consigna #DespertandoLeonesEc reafirmó allí la lucha contra el comunismo y a favor de la causa libertaria a nivel regional. «Es un sistema asesino. Se cargaron la vida de 150 millones de seres humanos» exclamó en referencia al comunismo ante el público procedente de distintas partes de Ecuador.

El líder del movimiento “La Libertad Avanza” comparó naciones que fueron divididas entre zonas comunistas y capitalistas para evidenciar cómo las regiones que en un determinado momento sucumbieron bajo el influjo de la extrema izquierda quedaron devastadas. “De lo que fue el imperio austrohúngaro Austria prosperó con libertad de comerciar mientras Hungría se hundió con los rojos” dijo.

Aseguró que el sistema es tan malo que lo tienen que implementar por la fuerza. Para lograrlo se valen de una estrategia de división para venderle al pueblo una película de buenos y malos: “Yo soy el amigo del pueblo ustedes son el enemigo del pueblo”.

De igual modo subrayó que la Ley de Moore «tira por la borda los planteos socialistas». Pues por medio del progreso tecnológico se puede producir más o lo mismo con menos trabajo. Para graficarlo usó el ejemplo de los luditas el colectivo británico que en el Siglo XIX se oponía a la automatización de ciertas tareas. “Cuando se produjo la lamparita (el foco) los productores de velas no estaban contentos con Edison” asomó Milei. “Hoy podemos transmitir esta conferencia porque no nos estamos iluminando con velas” aseguró

Detalló además que el socialismo se sostiene por medio de la envidia el odio y el resentimiento. «Le dice a la persona que no perdió. Le da un fundamento que le permite canalizar su bronca su envidia su odio por no resultar victorioso en la vida».

«Cuanto más regulan a un sector a ese sector peor le va (…). Cuanto más Estado hay más contaminado está y funciona peor (…). En el extremo el socialismo real el comunismo se derrumba» afirmó el político argentino a propósito de las regulaciones económicas propiciadas por el Estado.

Sobre el disparatado sistema de fijación de precios que habitualmente se ve en países comunistas explicó que durante la existencia de la Unión Soviética los rusos mandaban espías a Estados Unidos para ver los precios de las cosas y así tener una referencia de cuánto podían costar en su propio mercado. No tomaban jamás en cuenta las preferencias de los rusos la tecnología de los rusos la dotación de recursos de los rusos. «No son Dios» exclamó aseverando adicionalmente que el socialismo real siempre fracasa porque «es una gran estafa intelectual».

Las referencias de Milei a la política argentina no se hicieron esperar. En una parte de su discurso también sacó a la luz los caricaturescos errores del socialismo peronista: «El imbécil que es gobernador de la provincia de Buenos Aires antes fue ministro de Cristina Fernández de Kirchner dijo que en realidad la Unión Soviética había fracasado no porque estaba mal pensada sino porque no tenían el Excel porque no tenían las cuentas” continuó. «El problema del socialismo no es el chef es la receta” agregó. “Si yo voy a tratar de hacer comida con excremento se va a podrir».

Para comprender mejor los desafueros de las promesas socialistas y de cómo luego estas nunca se materializan recomendó a la audiencia la obra “El atavismo de la justicia social” de Friedrich Hayek.

Las recientes actuaciones del papa Francisco y su actitud tímida a la hora de fijar posiciones firmes en defensa de la democracia en el mundo también fue comentada por Milei durante su ponencia quien como argentino pidió «perdón al mundo católico por el papa que les mandamos». «Gracias al Creador somos desiguales y eso ayuda a distribución del trabajo» aseveró. La única forma de progresar es sirviendo al prójimo con bienes de calidad y al mejor precio! añadió.

Como conclusión citó al galleo Miguel Anxo Bastos: «capitalismo ahorro y trabajo duro». «No solo somos superiores en el plano productivo somos mejores en el plano moral. No tengan miedo que vamos a ganar. Viva la libertad carajo« exclamó.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbXVuZG8vbm90aWNpYXMtaW50ZXJuYWNpb25hbC02Mjk5NDM3MdIBPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbXVuZG8vbm90aWNpYXMtaW50ZXJuYWNpb25hbC02Mjk5NDM3MS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Beulah Louise Henry : quién fue 'Lady Edison' la talentosa inventora que logró la fama con objetos para la vida cotidiana,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbXVuZG8vbm90aWNpYXMtaW50ZXJuYWNpb25hbC02Mjk5NDM3MdIBPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbXVuZG8vbm90aWNpYXMtaW50ZXJuYWNpb25hbC02Mjk5NDM3MS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673EB6D7B0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Owners of specific sites are understandably keen to have them validated; other owners have less of a vested interest. Moreover in some areas precise boundaries between vineyards have sometimes been difficult to pin down and some vineyards such as Gaisberg in Kamptal belong to more than one village.

Scroll down to see tasting notes and scores for 12 top white wine picks from Lower Austria

Despite all this the growers’ association called the Oesterreichische Traditionsweingüter (Austrian traditional wine estates) has – off its own bat – created a selection of what its members consider the finest vineyards (Rieden) in Lower Austria. The association has no official standing but is widely respected and few would quarrel with its choice of some 90 sites as Erste Lagen (first growths).

Not many are household names but the same might well be true of the premier cru vineyards of Santenay or St Aubin. As with the official DAC classification only traditional varieties win the association’s seal of approval for each site.

On September 22 2022 the European Space Agency announced Harmony as its 10th Earth Explorer mission. Harmony is part of the FutureEO program. This program is a series of missions using the latest sensing technology to make precise measurements of the planet’s ever-changing topography.

According to ESA the mission will provide data needed to respond to the greatest crises now facing humanity. The announcement said:

Pivotal to ESA’s FutureEO program Earth Explorers are pioneering research missions that show how novel observing techniques lead to new scientific findings about our home planet. Advancing science and technology they address questions that have a direct bearing on climate change and societal issues such as the availability of food water energy resources and public health.

Harmony will actually be a satellite constellation. ESA said:

This exciting new mission will comprise two identical satellites orbiting Earth in convoy with a Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite. Each Harmony satellite will carry a receive-only synthetic aperture radar and a multiview thermal-infrared instrument.

Harmony’s goals

The purpose of the mission is to monitor movement on the Earth’s surface to make a high-resolution record of its subtle ongoing changes. Harmony’s lead investigator Paco López-Dekker explained:

Harmony will for example be used to quantify the processes that govern the exchange of momentum heat and moisture between the ocean surface and the air above. These exchanges influence processes in the lower atmosphere drive weather patterns and affect our climate. It will also be used to study deformation and flow dynamics at the rapidly changing ice-sheet edges for a better understanding of sea-level rise.

Harmony will also track the world’s critical fresh water supplies. López-Dekker said:

In addition Harmony will observe the motion of mountain glaciers which are essential in providing freshwater to hundreds of millions of people so the importance of understanding how they are changing cannot be overstated. And Harmony will be used to measure small shifts in the shape of the land surface such as those related to earthquakes and volcanic activity and therefore contribute to risk monitoring.

Bottom line: The latest ESA FutureEO mission Harmony is the 10th mission in the Earth Explorer program. It will monitor small but critical changes to Earth’s shape.

At least some people will give an affirmative answer. Yu Chengdong Executive Director of Huawei recently introduced Kunlun Glass used in the Mate50 Pro Kunlun version to fix this pain at the Huawei Mate50 launch conference.

Kunlun glass has the first-ever five-star glass drop resistance certification from Switzerland's SGS and the drop resistance of Kunlun Glass is ten times higher than ordinary glass said Jiang Hong chief scientist of Chongqing Xinjing Special Glass Co. Ltd. and director of the National Key Laboratory of Special Glass.

It is said to be better than Corning glass

Kunlun Glass was developed and manufactured by Chongqing Xinjing Special Glass Co. Ltd. which settled in Liangjiang New Area in 2014 and mainly produced high-alumina and high-lithium silica special glass.

""As a high-end material high-alumina silica glass is widely used in touch panels aviation high-speed rail and rail trains with great market demand"" said Bai Yibo chairman of Chongqing Xinjing Special Glass Co. Ltd. ""In 2020 Xinjing added a production line to produce transparent nano-ceramic glass.""

Two days after the Huawei launching conference Apple debuted the iPhone 14 series on September 8. The series continues to use Apple's exclusive super-ceramic glass panels produced by Corning Inc. in the United States.

""Kunlun glass is also a super ceramic crystal a transparent nano-ceramic glass"" said Jiang. He continued that since Apple has invested in Corning Corning's glass is exclusively for Apple and not sold to Huawei and other Chinese mobile phone manufacturers.

""But now we are fully capable of producing our own Kunlun Glass and some of its properties are even better than Corning's super-ceramic"" said Jiang.

10000 trillion crystals prevent crack propagation

Experiments show that the Huawei Mate50 Pro equipped with Kunlun Glass can be dropped from 4.2 meters without damage because it contains 10000 trillion nanocrystals to prevent cracks.

""Ceramic glass is ubiquitous but it is difficult to make it transparent. The reason for its high resistance is that there are 10-20 nanometer crystallites in the glass which is like mixing stones in cement"" said Jiang.

Jiang continued that the majority of glass-ceramic screens are nano-crystallites. Kunlun Glass has undergone high-temperature platinum precious metal smelting at 1600 degrees nanocrystal growth for 24 hours and 108 processing procedures. Each piece of Kunlun Glass has 10000 trillion high-strength nanocrystals injecting composite particles.

""When glass crack expands it encounters the crystal grain and the crack will bypass"" said Jiang. ""It must bypass many crystals and a long path to break the glass ceramic which resists the crack propagation.""

Motorola has doubled its Australian market share since 2021. It started with the Edge 20-series and the new g-series that were more about what users wanted. It is now close to #3 in Australia after Samsung and OPPO.

Like Goldilock’s porridge – It is just right.

Australian review Motorola Edge 30 Fusion 5G 8/128GB Dual sim Model XT2243-1 Retapac firmware

Website Product Page Price: $899 Colours Midnight Grey From* JB Hi-Fi Telstra Optus Officeworks Woolworths Big W Warranty 24-months ACL Country of Manufacture: China Company Owned by Lenovo (Est 1984) – a multinational technology company with its primary operational headquarters in Beijing and Morrisville North Carolina. It is the world’s largest PC maker and it purchased Motorola Mobility from Google in 2014. Most of Lenovo’s smartphone business is now under the Motorola brand with grand plans to become a ‘top five’ smartphone maker. More Other CyberShack Motorola news and reviews

* Grey market – no Australian warranty and 5G won’t work

We strongly advise you to buy a genuine model with Australian firmware.

It is easy to identify the Australian version – under Settings About Phone and Regulatory Labels there is an Australian RCM C-tick mark. There is also an RCM C-Tick on the box. They use unique Australian 5G sub-6Ghz and 5G low-band frequencies requiring local activation first.

Note that Telco-supplied models may have a single SIM.

Deep-Dive review format

It is now in two parts – a summary and a separate 300+ line database-driven spec including over 70 tests to back up the findings. It also helps us compare different phones and features.

We use Fail (below expectations) Pass (meets expectations) and Exceed (surpasses expectations or is the class leader) against many of the items below. We occasionally give a Pass(able) rating that is not as good as it should be and a Pass ‘+’ rating to show it is good but does not quite make it to Exceed.

You can click on most images for an enlargement.

First impression – Exceed

Undeniably classy curvy thin and light at 172g. The 3D Corning Gorilla Glass 5 velvet AG glass back is almost fingerprint proof. It feels excellent in hand.

The front Glass has a curved edge and Motorola has wisely avoided using an Edge screen (slide out). Instead it has an edge light – a thin band that glows when you receive a call or notification.

A winner in the looks stakes.

Screen – 6.55″ 2400 x 1080 10-bit 1.07 billion colour HDR10+ 144Hz refresh pOLED – Exceed

Here is proof that you can put a 10-bit 1.07 billion colour screen into a <$1000 phone. pOLED is OLED made by LG (Samsung has trademarked AMOLED but persists in using lesser 8-bit 16.7m colour screens in most of its Galaxy series).

It is a delight to use – a

colourful saturated DCI-P3 (or natural sRGB) bright daylight readable screen. It reaches 500 nits for typical use and nearly 1000 for HDR10+ content. It has infinite contrast – pure blacks and whites. Delta E is 1.4 (<4 is excellent).

The screen has L1 Widevine and can play most streaming services’ FHD/HDR content.

A note on Dynamic refresh 144Hz rates

While you can select 60 or 144Hz all our tests were on Auto. It will AI-range from 48/60/90/120 and 144Hz and in theory should not impact too much on battery life. We rarely saw anything other than 60/90Hz screens.

Processor SoC – Qualcomm SD888+ 5G – Exceed

This is quite an AI upgrade to the 2021 SD888. For example it has 32 TOPS versus 27 (trillion operations per second) which is serious AI processing power. It can process three 4K HDR video streams and a 27MP image at once. Add QC 5.0 charging and reasonably low power draw and it is a winner.

To keep costs down it has 8GB/128GB RAM/Storage but the USB-C 3.1 Gen 1 allows you to mount external SSD storage at 759/240MBps sequential read/write (about half the internal UFS speeds). Videographers and Vloggers will love this and again something you cannot do in a Samsung Galaxy.

Throttling is there – 19% but it is not a huge issue as it stabilises after 6 minutes and there is no overheating.

Comms – Everything – Pass+

It gets a Pass+ because it is advertised with Wi-Fi 6E but this is not enabled yet. We understand that the upgrade to Android 13 enables it (this is the same for most smartphones with Wi-Fi 6E).

5GHz speeds are excellent although they drop off a little at 10m.

Ready for – anything – Exceed

We get excited with a phone that has a full USB-C 3.1 Gen 1 5Gbps alt DP audio/video/data/charge port. So many skimp with a USB-C 2.0 480Mbps OTG/charge port.

This means you can mirror your screen to a TV or monitor over a USB-C to HDMI or USB-C to USB-C cable but there is more.

Motorola has ‘Ready For’ which is kind of an Android desktop that turns your screen into a computer – it even runs Microsoft Office 365. We will look closer at Ready For in another article. For now accept that it is something only some high-end Samsung Galaxy phones do with DeX – desktop experience.

LTE and 5G – Pass+

It uses a Qualcomm X60 modem – a small step under the flagship X65 in the SD8 Gen 1.

It covers all Australian 4G and 5G/low bands and most world bands. You must buy a genuine Australian model (no grey market) as the IMEI is initially locked to Australian Telcos.

4G reception strength is excellent finding the four closest towers at very strong signal strengths. It is suitable for city/ suburbs/ regional and rural use. Dual ring tones are a bonus.

Battery – Exceed

Motorola claims up to 30 hours (Wi-Fi/GPS/BT/4G/5G off) but our video loop (50% brightness/sound Wi-Fi off) gave 17 hours of screen-on use. PC Mark 3 indicates typical screen-on use at 12 hours and 6 minutes. Heavy users need a daily top-up and regular users may get two days.

Where it earns the ‘Exceed’ mark is Motorola’s inclusion of a 65W charger which fills 0-100% in just 37 minutes – excellent.

Sound – Pass

It is a straight Qualcomm WSA8835 setup with Qualcomm’s new Class-D stereo amp outputting up to 7.3W (2 x 3.65W) at reasonably low total harmonic distortion. It also includes a bridge to use USB-C earphones without a DAC cable. It processes Dolby Atmos (DA) and downmixes to 2.0 speakers.

The pity is that this powers a mismatched forward-firing earpiece and bottom-firing speaker – the latter is appreciably stronger skewing the sound stage. The maximum volume is 82dB.

Sound signature-wise it is Bright Vocal – good for clear voice but some music genres can sound harsh. But there is a hint of mid-and-high-bass that helps.

Bluetooth 5.2 has SBC AAC most aptX and LDAC codecs. BT headphones had excellent left-right separation and DA makes quite a difference with DA content.

Hands-free is excellent with dual mics offering some noise cancellation.

Build – Exceed

It is a very nice phone – desirable even. The build is excellent with Gorilla Glass 5 front and back and an alloy frame. Motorola has upped the warranty to 2-years now which is retrospective for all 2022 Edge models.

IP52 is a joke for a wannabe flagship but Motorola persists with it to keep costs in check.

The box includes a 68W charger USB-C earphones/mic and a bumper cover.

Android 12 – Exceed

Motorola has just upped the Edge 30 series to three OS upgrades and three years of security patches. It is close to pure Android and the MY UX adds things like a camera app and Moto gestures.

Missing – no deal breakers

No microSD but fast USB-C data transfer rates compensate

A better IP rating would make this a killer device

3.5mm jack – no deal breaker and it has an inbuilt USB-C headphone bridge

Motorola Edge 30 Fusion camera – Pass+

It is a 50 (wide bins to 12.6MP) +13 (ultra-wide) +2MP(depth) setup. This is a common setup and the Qualcomm AI post-processing power produces excellent point-and-shoot images.

1X Day Primary sensor: the colours are excellent with good dynamic range. Good details in the background shadows and highlights.

2X Day Primary sensor: natural colours and good detail

4X Day Primary sensor: Good colour and details – particularly good background with little noise

10X Day: Primary sensor: Pushing its limits with a noisy background – still pretty good

Ultra-wide: 13MP sensor: Slightly muted colour and details. You can tell it is a different sensor from the primary.

Macro 13MP UW sensor: excellent details and colours and not as critical about 4cm focus distance.

Indoor office light: Excellent colours details and sharpness.

Bokeh Depth: A 2MP sensor helps for bokeh shots. Excellent foreground colour detail and sharpness and bokeh background.

Dark <40 lumens: The standard mode (not night mode) is quite decent details although there is quite a lot of noise.

Night mode: Amazing – saturates the colour and removes much noise but over-sharpens the image.

Selfie: The 32MP (bins to 8l1MP) has natural skin tones good detail and a range of filters to enhance any image.

Video (we are not video experts): Primary sensor: You can shoot at 8K@30fps (no stabilisation) 4K@60/30fps with OIS and the day/office light results are very good. Ultrawide sensor: You can shoot 4K@30fps no OIS and 1080p@60/30fps with EIS. Selfie: 4K@30fps no OIS or EIS. Best at 1080p@30fps.



1X Primary sensor and it is as good as it gets

Ultra-wide: Colour and dynamic range difference to the primary sensor

2X Primary sensor – as good as it gets

4X and details are holding up well.

*X – acceptable shot with noise creeping into the background.

Macro – perfect.

Perfect office light shot. Perfect Bokeh shot.

<40 lumens and it is quite an acceptable shot.

Night mode really cleans this shot up and brings back colours. Perhaps a little over-sharpened.

CyberShack’s view – Motorola Edge 30 Fusion is a diamond in the rough

Every so often you come across a glass slab that is a real gem – it delights and restores your faith that some companies are trying to make a difference. I would be happy to own one as a daily drive. At $899 it offers everything you need punching well above its weight.

Competition is almost non-existent in this price bracket. Go to $999 and you have

Though price hikes have been happening for specific items the big box retailer has committed to keeping that particular snack under two dollars.

Costco CFO Richard Galanti said during a presentation on fourth-quarter financial results Thursday that they're not trying to fill in the gaps potentially left by the inexpensive meal.

""We really don't look at it that way"" he explained on the call MarketWatch reported. Galanti said other areas like the gas and travel side of the business were doing well enough to help them ""be more aggressive"" in other parts of the store.

""Or as you mentioned hold the price on the hot dog and the soda a little longer — forever"" he said.

If adjusted for inflation MarketWatch calculated the hot dog combo would be $4.11 by now. But it's a massive part of the brand's culture — and history — to keep it at the $1.50 price tag.

In an interview on CNBC in July CEO Craig Jelinek gave a one-word answer when asked whether he would raise the signature food court item's price: ""No.""

Way back in April 2018 Jelinek spoke at the Issaquah Chamber of Commerce in Washington where Costco's corporate headquarters are about the dogs.

""I came to [Costco co-founder Jim Sinegal] once and I said 'Jim we can't sell this hot dog for a buck fifty. We are losing our rear ends.' And he said 'If you raise the effing hot dog I will kill you. Figure it out'"" Jelinek said according to 425 Business.

""What we figured out we could do is build our own hot dog-manufacturing plant (in Los Angeles) and make our own Kirkland Signature hot dogs. Now we are doing so much hot dog business that we've opened up another plant in Chicago"" Jelinek explained. ""By having the discipline to say 'You are not going to be able to raise your price. You have to figure it out' we took it over and started manufacturing our hot dogs. We keep it at $1.50 and make enough money to get a fair return.""

With 583 locations in 48 U.S. states Costco's appeal is broad. Although shoppers now have to have a Costco card to enjoy the food court after the retailer changed its membership policy in 2020.

And that's why we shop at Costco once a week. By loading up on milk cheese and bulk produce at a lower price point we're able to keep our credit card bills to a minimum without having to skimp on the things we want.

But one big myth you'll hear about Costco is that its prices are always the cheapest around. Not so. There are certain products that will generally cost you more money at Costco so you're better off buying them at the grocery store instead.

1. Pasta

Pasta is a staple item in many people's pantries -- certainly in mine. But be careful when buying pasta from Costco in bulk because you may end up spending more money than necessary.

Pasta is one of those items that supermarkets tend to discount. And sometimes those discounts can be substantial. In my area it's not uncommon to find a one-pound box of pasta at the grocery store for $0.89 or less when it's on special. But even at Costco's bulk price rate it's hard to find pasta for less than $1 per one-pound box.

2. Cereal

Costco offers year-round deals on many cereal brands. But if you're willing to be patient you're likely to find a better price at the supermarket once your favorite cereal goes on sale.

Not only do supermarkets tend to discount different cereal brands on rotation but you might be able to stack a coupon on top of that for a much lower price per ounce. Furthermore some supermarkets sell a store-brand version of common cereals that are discounted to begin with. Costco's Kirkland brand doesn't produce a lot of imitation cereal so you're generally looking at buying a bulk box of a name brand at your local warehouse club.

3. Avocados

Avocados are expensive to begin with. But over the past year Costco has raised its price on its bulk pack of six. In my area you'll now pay about $10 for a half-dozen avocados or $1.67 apiece whereas if you wait for them to go on sale at the supermarket you might pay just $1.25 apiece.

Furthermore avocados happen to be a tricky thing to buy in bulk because that often means having them all ripen at the same time -- which unless you're making guacamole for a crowd is probably not what you want. You may be better off buying a couple of on-sale avocados at the supermarket at the start of the week and then replenishing with another two at the end of the week.

4. Books

Costco can be a great source for gifts including books. But don't expect to find the most competitive prices there -- or the best selection. Often you can find books at a lower cost at Amazon or Target and that includes boxed sets.

5. Bread

Costco's bakery has some delicious bread items that may be cheaper than what your local bakery charges. But packaged/sliced bread isn't such a great deal at Costco. Where I live it's almost always more expensive than the store-brand version at my local supermarket. And since my kids don't care what sort of white bread their sandwiches are made on there's no sense in me paying extra.

Do your research

While there are plenty of bargains to be had at Costco don't just assume that all of its prices are the cheapest. Instead spend some time comparing prices especially if you're on any sort of a budget. You may find that while Costco is the right choice for the majority of your shopping you can save money by purchasing a few key items elsewhere.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvY29zdGNvLWFnYWluLWNvbW1pdHMtdG8taG9sZGluZy1ob3QtZG9nLWFuZC1zb2RhLWNvbWJvLXByaWNlLWNvbnN0YW50LXBvc3NpYmx5LWZvcmV2ZXItMTE2NjM5NDA0MjnSAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0d2F0Y2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9jb3N0Y28tYWdhaW4tY29tbWl0cy10by1ob2xkaW5nLWhvdC1kb2ctYW5kLXNvZGEtY29tYm8tcHJpY2UtY29uc3RhbnQtcG9zc2libHktZm9yZXZlci0xMTY2Mzk0MDQyOQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Costco again commits to holding its hot-dog-and-soda combo price constant — possibly 'forever',"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.marketwatch.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /story/costco-again-commits-to-holding-hot-dog-and-soda-combo-price-constant-possibly-forever-11663940429 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673E4DA260>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvY29zdGNvLWFnYWluLWNvbW1pdHMtdG8taG9sZGluZy1ob3QtZG9nLWFuZC1zb2RhLWNvbWJvLXByaWNlLWNvbnN0YW50LXBvc3NpYmx5LWZvcmV2ZXItMTE2NjM5NDA0MjnSAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0d2F0Y2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9jb3N0Y28tYWdhaW4tY29tbWl0cy10by1ob2xkaW5nLWhvdC1kb2ctYW5kLXNvZGEtY29tYm8tcHJpY2UtY29uc3RhbnQtcG9zc2libHktZm9yZXZlci0xMTY2Mzk0MDQyOQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL21vbmV5LzYyOTg3OTEvc2lkZS1odXN0bGUtY29zdGNvLXNob3BwaW5nLWFtYXpvbi_SAU1odHRwczovL3d3dy50aGUtc3VuLmNvbS9tb25leS82Mjk4NzkxL3NpZGUtaHVzdGxlLWNvc3Rjby1zaG9wcGluZy1hbWF6b24vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I’m an Amazon seller – my Costco side hustle made $6000 by just shopping at the store...,"ONE savvy Amazon seller has managed to bank $6000 after making a simple shopping run at Costco.

According to data from Side Hustle Nation the average American earns $1122 per month from side hustles.

2 The Amazon seller just purchased one type of product from Costco

2 He bought around 50 and 60 Scrabble games to make a major profit

But TikToker “weflipitall_” has made $6000 after doing a simple shopping run at Costco.

As the channel name indicates the content creator finds products and then flips them for a profit on Amazon.

Here’s what he did at Costco as revealed in a recent video.

What he bought at Costco

The Amazon seller only bought one type of product: Scrabble deluxe vintage edition which is a board game.

READ MORE ON COSTCO BAGEL BOSS I tried 5 store bagels including Costco and Trader Joe's - the winner was close

He wound up buying a bunch of them for $29.99 each and wheeled them out on a flatbed cart.

Most importantly the TikToker claimed that he made a massive profit of between $100 and $120 on each of them.

In total he said he made $6000 and it’s unclear the exact amount of time that this took.

That would mean he bought between 50 and 60 Scrabble games and spent in the range of $1500 and $1800.

So keep in mind here that you may need to spend a little money to profit big.

How it works

Costco isn’t the only place the product flipper shops at to make a profit.

In another recent video he revealed specifics on how you can do this at Marshalls with clothing items.

For example he came across a sweatshirt in the store that was listed for $19.99 and saw that the retail price was $59.50.

But after scanning one of the tags through the Amazon seller app he estimated that he would make about $13 in profit on each sweatshirt.

So on four sweatshirts he would make a little over $50 in profit.

Moreover entrepreneur Stephen Raiken is making $17000 per month by doing a similar gig and it even helped his mom retire early.

Stephen finds books and clothes at his local thrift shops and sells them for profit on Amazon after scanning them.

To get started Stephen said you’ll need to create an Amazon seller account.

While it’s free to sign up the cost afterward will depend on the selling plan you select.

For example individuals are charged 99 cents for each item they sell while a professional plan comes with a $39.99 monthly fee regardless of the number of items sold according to Amazon.

“Amazon also collects a referral fee on each sale which is a percentage of the total transaction and varies by product category” the e-commerce giant said.

Once signed up you’ll want to wait until your account gets approved and then download the Amazon seller app.

After you scan and find out how much they are worth you can create listings throughout the app.

Along with the price you'll want to include the condition of the item and then prepare it for shipment to an Amazon fulfillment center.

You can also feature images in the listing.

PRINCE Harry and Meghan Markle wanted to move to Windsor Castle - but were given Frogmore Cottage instead according to an explosive new book.

The New Royals by Kate Nichols claims that when the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced plans to relocate from Kensington Palace they set their sights on a suite of apartments at Windsor.

But instead the Queen made the ""generous gesture"" of offering them Frogmore Cottage as their new home instead an extract from the book published by MailOnline says.

The late Lady Elizabeth Anson who died in 2020 spoke with the Queen frequently in the lead up to the eventual Megxit.

It comes as:

Claims Meghan ‘thought she’d be Beyoncé of the UK

King Charles ‘ hasn’t decided ’ on titles for Archie & Lilibet

hasn’t decided The Duke and Duchess face questions after explosive claims

The Queen was ‘surprised’ that Meghan wanted to wear a white wedding dress

Her Majesty ‘thought Meghan Markle should have sorted things out with her dad

She said: ""The cottage was a big deal.

""The Queen's entrance into the gardens is right next to their cottage. It is essentially her back yard her solitude and her privacy.

""She was giving that up in gifting Harry and Meghan Frogmore Cottage. We all thought it was very big of her. She said 'I hope they'll respect it.' ""

In the book Lady Elizabeth suggests Her Majesty found Harry's behaviour worrying before he met his now-wife.

When Harry spoke about the ""total chaos"" caused by shutting down his emotions for 20 years in 2017 his grandmother was worried the mystique of the Royal Family would be shattered and speaking so candidly would only encourage more interest on the subject.

Lady Elizabeth said: ""When I said to the Queen 'I think it's no bad thing he's opened up' she replied 'I'm afraid I can't agree with you. [The media] will want to know more and more'.""

It comes amid claims Markle told Harry she would break up with him if he didn't announce publicly they were dating a new book has claimed.

In his latest work Courtiers: The Hidden Power Behind the Crown royal correspondent and author Valentine Low says the Duchess of Sussex dished an ultimatum to her now-husband.

According to an extract from the book published on The Times as Harry was facing ""hordes of journalists"" keen to dig into his new girlfriend's life Harry ""became determined to protect"" her.

But at the same time it is claimed Meghan told him that if he didn't announce how serious they were she was out.

In the book a source said: ""She was saying 'If you don’t put out a statement confirming I’m your girlfriend I’m going to break up with you.' Harry was in a panic.""

The claim is one of a series of scathing revelations made about Meghan in Low's story airing a number of claims from insiders and former aides inside his latest analysis of life behind palace walls.

He wrote that while Meghan worked to be portrayed publicly in a positive light during the couple's tour of Australia in 2018 behind the scenes ""it was a different story"".

The book states: ""Although she enjoyed the attention Meghan failed to understand the point of all those walkabouts shaking hands with countless strangers.

""According to several members of staff she was heard to say on at least one occasion 'I can’t believe I’m not getting paid for this'.""

Low also stated that ahead of the couple's engagement she attempted to make her arrival known among the palace staff.

The book says: ""In the spring of 2017 more than six months before the couple were engaged she told one of Harry’s advisers: 'I think we both know I’m going to be one of your bosses soon'.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3MuY28udWsvbGlmZS1zdHlsZS9zdHlsZS8xNjczODExL2Nyb3duLXByaW5jZXNzLW1hcnktc3R5bGUtcGluay1kcmVzcy1sYXRlc3Qtcm95YWwtcGljdHVyZXPSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHByZXNzLmNvLnVrL2xpZmUtc3R5bGUvc3R5bGUvMTY3MzgxMS9jcm93bi1wcmluY2Vzcy1tYXJ5LXN0eWxlLXBpbmstZHJlc3MtbGF0ZXN0LXJveWFsLXBpY3R1cmVzL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Breathtaking' Crown Princess Mary rewears fuchsia gown & 'gleaming' pumps - 'perfection',"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3MuY28udWsvbGlmZS1zdHlsZS9zdHlsZS8xNjczODExL2Nyb3duLXByaW5jZXNzLW1hcnktc3R5bGUtcGluay1kcmVzcy1sYXRlc3Qtcm95YWwtcGljdHVyZXPSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHByZXNzLmNvLnVrL2xpZmUtc3R5bGUvc3R5bGUvMTY3MzgxMS9jcm93bi1wcmluY2Vzcy1tYXJ5LXN0eWxlLXBpbmstZHJlc3MtbGF0ZXN0LXJveWFsLXBpY3R1cmVzL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673E50A350>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The new black marble stone laid into the floor simply records the birth and death dates of the monarch who ruled for 70 years and died at the age of 96: Elizabeth II 1926 – 2022.

The queen’s coffin was laid to rest on September 19 in the King George VI Memorial Chapel at Windsor Castle’s St George’s Chapel.

Her coffin was interred in an intimate ceremony following her state funeral in Westminster Abbey.

The ledger stone also records the deaths of the Queen’s parents King George VI and Elizabeth the Queen Mother and her husband Prince Philip who died last year.

The stone is engraved with the star of the ancient chivalric Order of the Garter to which the queen and the other royals belonged.

The queen’s sister Princess Margaret’s ashes are interred in the same chapel.

The late monarch commissioned the memorial chapel as a permanent resting place for her father King George VI and it was completed in 1969.

Elizabeth often prayed in St George’s Chapel which dates back more than 500 years.

Her husband Philip left instructions for his remains to be transferred from the Royal Vault beneath St George’s to the memorial chapel on his wife’s death.

Windsor Castle reopens to the public on Thursday and people will be able to visit St George’s Chapel."

(WSVN) - Rescue crews took four train crew members to the hospital after two freight trains collided near Miami International Airport in Northwest Miami-Dade causing a derailment and leading to a major road closure.

Miami-Dade Police and Fire Rescue units responded to the scene of the crash near Perimeter Road and Northwest 15th Street Saturday night.

A statement issued by a CSX spokesperson reads in part “Two CSX rock trains were involved in an incident near Miami International Airport that resulted in a derailment.”

According to a Tri-Rail spokesperson the two trains crashed on an industrial track outside the main line.

MDFR officials said the collision took place at around 7 p.m.

A picture posted to social media by Andy Slater captured the aftermath of the impact. A closer look at the image shows one of the trains is lopsided.

Paramedics transported the injured victims to area hospitals with minor injuries.

The CSX statement reads in part “As a precaution several crew members were transported to the hospital for evaluation.”

MDFR officials said the Miami-Dade County Department of Environmental Resources Management was notified about a fuel spill due to the crash.

The CSX statement reads in part “Preliminary reports indicate that an unknown quantity of diesel fuel spilled from the derailed locomotives. There are no waterways impacted.”

Tri-Rail officials said hazmat crews have responded to the scene.

Since the crash took place outside the main line it has not affected Tri-Rail’s train schedule.

Police said they have shut down the eastbound lanes of Perimeter Road between Northwest 57th and 45th avenues while fire crews and the hazmat unit worked to decontaminate the area.

Officials with MIA said there is currently no access to the airport through Perimeter Road. Drivers are advised to take the Dolphin Expressway as an alternate route.

According to the CSX website the company transports a variety of things including “biodiesel ethanol automobiles and chemicals among other equipment.

The CSX statement goes on to say “CSX is currently investigating the incident and working closely with local first responders to assess the situation as we develop a recovery plan.”

Police have not provided further details about the collision as they continue to investigate.

September 24 2022

Story By Mike McGlothlin

In the diesel truck segment there are literally dozens of tire options to choose from. From highway terrains to mud terrains to the ultra-popular all-terrain category there is no shortage of competition. But in the motorsport realm a few select tires seem to get the nod over all others—and many of them are manufactured by Nitto. In the dirt a lot of truck pullers gravitate toward the most aggressive mud terrain in Nitto’s comprehensive lineup the Mud Grappler. In drag racing many drivers turn to either the Terra Grappler G2 NT420V or NT555 RII.

As a result Nitto’s Mud Grapplers dominate the dirt and its street and radial variants are a top choice at the drag strip. You’ll see what we mean below as we profile some of the top-running pulling trucks in the nation along with a former ET class drag racing champion who might win a second ring this season.

Why Truck Pullers Like The Mud Grappler

So why exactly have so many truck pullers gravitated to the most aggressive tire Nitto manufactures? It started nearly a decade ago when a few big-name pullers showed up with Mud Grapplers under their trucks and proceeded to finish out front. That was all it really took to get truck pullers to try something more aggressive than an all-terrain tire. The Mud Grappler’s large tread blocks take huge bites out of any surface they’re used on and many competitors believe they load an engine harder than any other DOT tire—and in a turbocharged diesel engine more load means more boost which (usually) equates to more power.

2022 PPL Limited Pro Stock Champion

Adam Kincaid relied on Mud Grapplers to dig his Hill Brothers second-gen (which packs an O’Bryant Diesel Cummins) to a Lucas Oil Pro Pulling League points championship in 2022. In one of the most competitive truck pulling classes in existence it’s no easy feat to conquer the Limited Pro Stock diesel truck category. After winning night one of the Horsepower in Horse Country event in Shelbyville Kentucky back in August Adam qualified both days at the Scheid Diesel Extravaganza. Consistency and a tendency to finish in the Top 5 were a big part of his championship run this season.

A Truck You Can Never Count Out

Last year’s Limited Pro Stock diesel truck class champion CW Cartmell is always in the hunt for a win—and many times pulls off an upset when the distance to beat seems unbeatable. In 2021 he swept the Scheid Diesel Extravaganza winning on both nights which is something we’d never seen before. In 2022 CW turned in Seventh Place and Fourth Place efforts at the Scheid show. CW’s Dodge sports a Haisley Machine-built mechanical injection Cummins that’s rumored to be in the 1500 hp range (if not higher). Part of his winning combination includes a pair of 35-inch Mud Grapplers up front clawing for every last inch of ground.

Kenny Smith’s Front-Running Ford

When your livelihood consists of building custom-spec clutches for truck pulling what better way is there to advertise your products than by successfully campaigning a Limited Pro Stock truck? This is exactly what Kenny Smith of Kenny’s Diesel and his Cummins-powered dentside Ford do. Kenny won his first pull of the year back in June then won again later in the month and ended up competing at the top of the heap at the Scheid Diesel Extravaganza in August. There Kenny’s Ford moved the sled 330.42-feet on Friday night which was good enough for Sixth Place. The following day Hunter Smith piloted the old Ford to the First Place qualifier which once again got the truck into the nighttime show. Like CW Cartmell and so many others Kenny opts to run Nitto Mud Grapplers up front.

The Underdog Duramax’s Chances Increase With Mud Grapplers

One of a handful of Duramax-powered GM’s in the mix within the DOT-tire Limited Pro Stock diesel truck field is Matt Loucks’ GMC coined “Night Howler.” Like other Duramax owners in the class wins are hard to come by but at the same time these 6.6L-based V-8 propelled trucks often shake things up in the standings with occasional front-of-the-pack performances. At the Scheid Diesel Extravaganza back in August Matt earned a spot in both nighttime shows after having qualified Ninth Place on Friday and Sixth Place on Saturday. And just like the previously-mentioned competitors Matt trusts Nitto’s Mud Grappler to always get him past the full-pull mark.

All Juiced Up—And Poised To Challenge For A Championship

Another second-gen Cummins with winning potential belongs to Stacy Gwinn. In fact his Mud Grappler-graced Dodge is currently sitting in Second Place in the Ohio State Tractor Pullers Association (OSTPA) Limited Pro Stock diesel truck class standings. With one event left on the schedule he’ll have one last crack at the championship on September 30th. Stacy gets help in his 3.0 smooth bore class efforts thanks to industry leaders Scheid Diesel and Hart’s Diesel as well as Attitude Diesel.

Mud Grapplers Earn Their Keep In Pro Street Too

Ed McConnell’s beautiful Duramax-powered ’67 Chevy mixes it up in the 8000-pound Pro Street Diesel Truck Class a category that calls for DOT-approved tires and a smooth bore turbocharger with an inducer no larger than 2.6-inches (66mm). For ultimate traction Ed runs a proven tire: Mud Grapplers. For a turbo that maximizes horsepower he runs a charger from Hart’s Diesel. Most recently we watched Ed and his ’67 Chevy qualify fourth and place seventh overall at the Scheid Diesel Extravaganza. In a tightly-packed unreal-competitive field of trucks Ed’s Seventh Place distance was less than a foot away from the Third Place finisher.

Terra Grappler G2s For The Win On The Drag Strip

In diesel drag racing the NT555 RII drag radial is popular as is the NT420V but the unexpected all-terrain that gets it done on the drag strip is the Terra Grappler G2. Bracket racer Ken Phillips has proven this with both trucks he campaigns in the Outlaw Diesel Super Series’ ET Bracket class. His new addition the standard cab Duramax pictured here landed him in the winner’s circle back in June at the Outlaw Diesel Revenge race in Indy—even though he’d never even raced the truck before… Whether it’s the truck the tires or Ken’s driving talents (most likely a combination of all three) his 2022 racing season has been nothing short of impressive. After grabbing the runner-up spot at the Scheid Diesel Extravaganza Ken is the ET Bracket points leader heading into the final race of the season.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3RmbHRydWNrLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5L3ZpZGVvLXlvdS13b250LWJlbGlldmUtaG93LW11Y2gtdGhlLW5ldy1nbWMtaHVtbWVyLWV2LXdlaWdocy13aGVuLWNvbXBhcmVkLXRvLWEtZm9yZC1saWdodG5pbmctYS1yYW0taGQtY3VtbWlucyVFRiVCRiVCQy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Video: You Won't Believe How Much the New GMC Hummer EV Weighs When Compared to a Ford Lightning & a Ram ...,"We all know that heavy-duty diesel pickup trucks weigh a lot due to their construction for heavy hauling and towing. How do the new GMC Hummer EV truck and Ford F-150 Lightning Pro compare? Let’s put them on a certified scale and find out.

The baseline is a new 2022 Ram HD 2500 Cummins turbo-diesel. It’s a basic Tradesman crew cab 4×4 with just a few options. This truck belongs to TFL’s Alex Lightning so it has a bunch of tools and motorcycle gear. We put it on the scales first.

Ram 2500 HD Cummins Diesel

This relatively simple Ram HD turbo-diesel truck weighs close to 8000 lbs. According to its payload sticker in the door jam it should weigh closer to 7700 lbs but Alex does have some equipment in it as we mentioned. This is a typical weight for an HD diesel-powered pickup truck. A dually 1-ton crew cab 4×4 pickup truck will weigh between 8400-8800 lbs depending on options.

Next up is the base Ford F-150 Lightning Pro. It has a “small” 98 kWh battery but it likely does weigh a lot.

2022 Ford F-150 Lightning Pro

The base Lightning Pro is equipped with two electric motors for AWD capability. It’s a crew cab truck with a 5.5-foot bed. It weighs a surprisingly low 6120 lbs! Why is it surprising? Our F-150 Lightning Lariat that we took all the way to the Arctic ocean weighed between 6800 – 7800 lbs when we had it loaded with a Four Wheel Camper shell and supplies. For reference a Ford F-150 3.5L twin-turbo V6 crew cab 4×4 weighs around 5500 lbs.

Now it’s time to put the big GMC Hummer EV truck on the scales. Many reports put its weight at “over 9000 lbs”. Let’s see how it goes. It has one of the largest battery packs in any production consumer vehicle to date. It’s estimated at around 212 kWh.

GMC Hummer EV Edition 1 truck with a spare tire kit

The Hummer EV truck punishes the scales at 9440 lbs of curb weight. This includes the spare tire mount in the bed. The Hummer EV is equipped with three electric motors that combine for 1000 horsepower. It has a height-adjustable suspension and four-wheel steering.

At this time the GMC Hummer EV Edition 1 truck is the most powerful and heaviest consumer pickup truck available on sale now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2V2cy12cy1kaWVzZWwtYW5kLWdhc29saW5lLXRydWNrcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Test Shows The Main Drawback Of Electric Trucks Vs Diesel And Gasoline Trucks,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2V2cy12cy1kaWVzZWwtYW5kLWdhc29saW5lLXRydWNrcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbGxzLmllL2dhYS9icmVuZGFuLWN1bW1pbnMtcG9pbnQtYmFsbHliYWNvbi1ncmFuZ2UtdGlwcGVyYXJ5LWludGVybWVkaWF0ZS1odXJsaW5nLXJlbGVnYXRpb24tc2VtaS1maW5hbC01MjU3MzfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,47-Year-Old Brendan Cummins Hits Winner In Tipp Relegation Playoff,"Ballybacon/Grange defeated Ballinahinch 2-14 to 0-19 in their Tipperary Intermediate Hurling Championship relegation semi-final on Saturday.

While Homan’s 1933 1220 Wallis tractor is historic in its own right the vintage machine is also carrying history when it heads to the show in Rock Springs.

Homan who turned 100 in July still resides in the farmhouse in which he was born. “I moved one bedroom away from the room I was born in. I guess I just can’t leave” he said.

While his roots run deep on the family farm which is now operated by his son Homan’s ties to the Wallis tractor are just as entrenched.

Homan’s father Sam purchased the tractor in 1933 to replace the first tractor on the farm — a 1926 Fordson. At the time there were several Wallis tractors in the area and they were sold through a nearby Massey Harris dealer Homan said. With 210 acres to plow the Fordson just wasn’t efficient and horses were being phased out of the agricultural landscape.

“It was a big difference when we went from horses to a tractor. We used to keep three teams and have two hired men to help with plowing” Homan said. “But even after my dad got a tractor he insisted on keeping a team of horses to do jobs he said a tractor couldn’t do like plant corn.”

It didn’t take long however for the Wallis to prove its worth. Equipped with a set of two-bottom 14-inch plows the 12-horsepower Wallis turned over acres of ground for years on the Homan farm.

“My dad could plow 8 acres a day with it. He was so proud” Homan said.

“It was a wonderful tractor and never gave us any trouble. The wet clutch was so smooth you could move an inch at a time without jumping.”

After several years of hard plowing and harrowing the Wallis was taken to a mechanic for an overhaul. According to Homan the mechanic ground the valves and then stopped.

“He came to my dad and said it would be a mistake to tear that tractor down. There’s nothing wrong with it” Homan said. “Ever since then all we’ve done to it is replace the fan belt.”

For all of its attributes the steel-wheeled Wallis did have one shortcoming: it was too low for a cultivator.

In 1941 Homan’s father traded in the Wallis on a new Allis-Chalmers WC and a cultivator from a dealer located at what is now the entrance to Ag Progress Days. Homan said the family was sad to see the Wallis leave but the absence didn’t last long.

Changing Times Call for Changing Machinery

That same year Homan said his family was timbering the woods on their farm and using horses to drag the logs to a nearby mill. The horses couldn’t keep up with the demand from the mill he said and the Wallis was still sitting on the dealer lot.

“We bought it back that same year — a month after we traded it — so we could get the logs to the mill faster” Homan said.

After the lumbering was finished Homan parked the Wallis in a shed where it sat for several decades. In the meantime the farm went through another major transition in 1946 when one of the horses representing the last team on the farm had to be put down after being struck by a car.

At that time Homan was running the farm and milking cows and despite his father’s insistence he yearned to run the operation completely with tractors.

“Everyone was switching to tractors at that time and with only one horse left I figured now was the time to get out of horses so I sold it” Homan said. “I was milking one day and my dad came into the barn and said he’d been looking all over for another horse. I told him I sold the other one and he was mad. He said you just can’t farm without horses.”

But there was no reversing the trend and over time Homan added several John Deere tractors to the farm and never kept another horse.

While the era of farming with horses was largely gone a relic from the past remained on the farm. The Wallis still sat in the shed forgotten until Homan was asked to display the tractor at the antique machinery show at Ag Progress Days.

Despite always being a dependable machine the fenders had rusted off and a paint job was needed. Homan had new fenders built and he painted the tractor to get it ready for the first show in 1975.

That same year he began making the annual trek to Ag Progress Days on the seat of the Wallis tractor that his father purchased in 1933.

Yet there was just one more update needed for the tractor.

“It was rough driving it on the road with the big steel wheels. I took the cleats off and cut the beads off a set of tractor tires to make them flat and they fit right on the steel wheels” Homan said. “You still don’t want to drive it too fast or it’ll jar your kidneys out so I just take my time driving it while my son (Wayne) follows behind me on his Gator.”

The Wallis has been a part of Homan’s life for 89 of his 100 years and the two of them haven’t missed a trip to Ag Progress Days.

It is a trip he intends on making every year.

“If I’m still living and they want me to bring the Wallis over I’ll keep doing it” Homan said. “When we crank it up and I climb onto the seat it brings back a lot of memories.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy93Y2Zjb3VyaWVyL25hbWUvZnJhbmNpcy1ldmVuLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM2NjgxNzcw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Francis Even Obituary (2022) - Waterloo IA - Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy93Y2Zjb3VyaWVyL25hbWUvZnJhbmNpcy1ldmVuLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM2NjgxNzcw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002674225B7C0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

That is until they’re ready to get incinerated at which point they’ll birth plumes of airborne toxins and endanger people in the developing world — all for the sake of a few nuggets of recovered semi-precious metals.

Luckily the right to repair movement is here to fight this growing e-waste problem. By giving devices longer life consumers can reduce the number of times they need to toss a gadget in the trash with minimal hope that it gets recycled responsibly. In recent months big names like Apple Samsung and Google have made announcements supporting greater repairability of their products. Are these initiatives enough to make a real dent in the problem or are they simply lip service to defend against impending legislation that could potentially hurt the bottom line of industry giants?

Earth’s e-waste problem

Right now humanity pumps out over 53 megatons of e-waste annually and only 17% of it is collected and documented properly. Our rate of e-waste generation went up by 21% between 2015 and 2020 with rates expected to continue to climb four to five percent annually. Despite only taking up about 5% of solid waste volume e-waste is the source of 70% of its total toxicity. Much of it gets shipped off to developing countries where substandard processing results in direct exposure of toxic heavy metals to workers. For example some 50000 Bangladeshi children are involved in e-waste recycling with 83% dealing with long-term health problems from exposure such as cancer and asthma. 15% die as a result of their participation in the industry. These chemicals also reach the local populace by leaching into the soil and water supply then back up to humans through food sources.

While there’s plenty of localized environmental runoff from inadequately processed e-waste there’s also the lost economic opportunity. Mining the metals required for electronics is expensive and has its own significant environmental footprint. Meanwhile there are perfectly reusable resources in our old devices that are going to waste. The International Panel on Climate Change’s latest report outlines solutions we can be implementing to meet climate goals and repairability makes the list. “Policymakers need to leverage the potential socio-economic opportunities of transitioning to circular economies which show positive GDP growth and job creation by shifting to more labor-intensive recycling plants and repair services than resource extraction activities” says the mitigation report.

The current state of affairs

Apple kicked off the recent spat of manufacturer repair initiatives in the last year. It was a pleasant surprise from a company that has historically been downright adversarial to the right to repair. Samsung and Google quickly followed suit by making official OEM parts available for sale.

That’s all well and good but both programs are far from perfect. Samsung’s repair program for example inflates the cost of a battery replacement by gluing the screen to the battery itself whereas Apple’s repair program doesn’t offer replacement ports and connectors which are particularly prone to failure. These are some of the main gripes of Louis Rossmann long-time right-to-repair advocate and repair technician. He argues that even with these new programs the repair world is still worse off than it was thirty or forty years ago.

“I think they’re all moving to a model of serialization of parts so even if you find an OEM part it won’t work the same. Less parts being available than before. Less manuals being available than before. A model of lending or leasing rather than owning.”

Apple's self service repair program got released let's check it out

Big manufacturers twisting the definition of ownership isn’t a new tactic either. Just look at John Deere. Serialization is a major tool the company uses to complicate the DIY repair process. This makes it so that you can’t just take a part from one machine and pop it into another. The parts have serial numbers which need to match the parent in order to function. John Deere defended this practice in a 2015 copyright lawsuit saying that a farmer only had “an implied license” to use their tractor. John Deere continues to obstruct the right of farmers to fix their own equipment and insists on funneling service into monopolistic repair shops. This gives manufacturers the power to control who gets the parts they need and how much they cost.

In Apple’s case you can see this with the requirement of a software activation for a rear glass cover despite the iPhone 14 being their most repairable device in years. Cory Doctorow author and Special Advisor at the Electronic Frontier Foundation describes another mechanism used by Apple to accomplish this goal.

“Apple does this bizarre thing where they engrave tiny logos on parts in assembly inside the device. If you send a phone overseas to be stripped down then shipped back to the U.S. as refurbished parts they can be blocked at the border due to trademark tarnishment. This is because it has an Apple trademark on it that wouldn’t be obvious to a user without a jeweler’s loupe and the part might not be as robust as a brand-new one. Apple routinely asks customs authorities to block reimportation of actual Apple parts made in Apple factories.”

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of the late 90s set a lot of the groundwork for this type of intellectual property defense. The potential for abuse was evident to critics at the time and the DMCA’s use has since expanded well beyond the piracy of disc-based media it was originally intended for.

Is a better system possible?

Though the big players may not be doing enough to properly support right to repair some underdogs are making it a selling point. Up-and-coming electronics manufacturer Framework has developed a laptop with components that can be swapped with ease. By all counts Framework has succeeded with minimal compromises to system performance. In fact they just launched their first motherboard upgrade. Valve a major force in PC games but a relative neophyte in hardware offers a repair kit for their Steam Deck. Then you have Fairphone which not only offers devices with a plethora of user-replaceable parts but also ensures their materials are equitably sourced.

Thea Kleinmagd Circular Material Chains Innovator at Fairphone tells us “When a small company like Fairphone can offer spare parts free repair information and long-term software updates for their phones while being profitable why should a lawmaker refrain from demanding this from every company?”

But Fairphone and other niche players are operating at a much different scale than Apple Samsung and Google. Can Fairphone’s standards apply to the mammoth production volumes of tech giants? Framework sympathizes with the difficulty of larger companies changing direction.

“If your business is built around the revenue that comes from a mature and consistent replacement cycle transforming your business to work in a longer replacement cycle is extremely difficult. This works in our favor as a startup” says Framework CEO Nirav Patel. “Since we started from zero market share and zero revenue everything is growth for us. Success for us and our mission is actually decreasing the total revenue of each category we enter by reducing the number of units that need to be manufactured each year.”

Fairphone agrees that repair service is something that manufacturers need to factor into their business model. “If the revenue of a company is solely based on sales of devices they don’t have an interest in producing long-lasting devices since they cannibalize their own sales” says Kleinmagd. One study suggested that American consumers could save $40 billion a year if they repaired their devices instead of replacing them which would be great for end users but would be lost revenue for manufacturers.

Google and Samsung have found a convenient partner in iFixit to offload some repair responsibilities onto. iFixit has already been selling repair kits for some time and has a healthy perspective on the financial pressures of the industry.

“There are economic opportunities for manufacturers in a repair-friendly marketplace. Many repair technicians want to buy official manufacturer parts. Since manufacturers often don’t offer parts independent technicians end up buying third-party parts instead. Manufacturers could capture some of that repair parts revenue. Modular hardware also lets manufacturers enter a new market: aftermarket upgrades. What if people could buy a new camera module instead of a whole new phone? Automotive aftermarket repair and upgrade is a $405.8 billion-dollar industry” Elizabeth Chamberlain iFixit’s Director of Sustainability tells us.

Enacting real legislative change

Despite the existence of promising alternatives Rossmann’s overall assessment of the world of repair remains bleak. “I think there’s progress in terms of people understanding right to repair as an issue. I think there’s zero progress in terms of there being any sort of real change.” Having manufacturers co-opt right to repair in visible but superficial ways can be their way of getting end users to back off from pressuring political representatives for meaningful legislation.

Other right-to-repair activists are more optimistic. Gay Gordon-Byrne Executive Director of The Repair Association says “Europe has been promoting design standards for home appliances TVs and now cell phones. France has required a repairability index that has worldwide value. We’ve got legislation passed in two states and more underway. The FTC has evaluated opposition ideas and rejected them entirely. It’s been a decade of work now coming to fruition. I tell people that New York’s Fair Repair Act fixes about 80% of the practical problems with repairing equipment covered by the law. Another 20% of problems are problems of federal copyright law and cannot be altered by the states. Obviously the Fair Repair Act also carves out some categories that we want to expand particularly agricultural equipment and home appliances.”

Doctorow concurs that the divide between state and federal levels complicates progress. “In the U.S. there’s a doctrine of pre-emption where federal law zeroes out state laws that tread in the same territory. Once you pick off these victories at the state level they tend to capitulate to federal legislation. That’s what’s happening right now with federal privacy law. The big ad tech companies are finally on board for a federal privacy law but they want it to trump all state privacy laws including ones that are more strict.”

There remain so many hurdles to right to repair that it can be easy to get pessimistic. Intense profit incentives and a quagmire of legalities seem stacked to erode consumer rights and leave a whole lot of toxic chemicals in an e-waste wake. Alternative modes of operating are gaining in visibility but they require grassroots support to spread. If you’re interested in pushing right to repair forward you can lend your support to the following legislative measures across the US.

Seated in extra legroom coach which offers free cocktails they asked for a Jack Daniels and Coke during the drink cart pass through the cabin. Half an hour later they wanted another drink so they pushed the button about their seat. It lit up. About five minutes later a crewmember showed up and declined their request as the passenger explains it

We are still service the back of the plane. I’ll bring you one after we finish in back..AND DON’T TOUCH THAT BUTTON AGAIN.

They did not return and did not ever bring that second drink. Did the passenger do something wrong?

The head of the largest flight attendants union Sara Nelson says you shouldn’t push the call button for a drink.

Don’t use the call button to ask for a drink” Sara Nelson the international president of the Association of Flight Attendants told TPG. “As a general rule don’t think of the call button as your vodka-tonic button.” Nelson explained that it’s “not intended to be for ordering drinks.

Nelson is 100% in the wrong. The alternative to pressing the call button to let a flight attendant know you want a drink is to go to the galley. But you don’t want a steady stream of passengers heading to the galley and blocking the aisles and airlines often announce not to congregate in the galley. In Ms. Nelson’s world passengers simply wouldn’t hydrate. Cabin crew wouldn’t provide service. And you’d like it or at least sit down and shut up about it.

The call button exists what does she think it is for? She says it is so individual passengers can ask to identify themselves when called upon to do so by a crewmember. And if you do use it for something like a glass of water you’d darned well better have a compelling moral justification (“It may be that you’re a mother and you have an infant in your arms and you need some help”).

In the rest of the world this isn’t even a question of course passengers are supposed to push the button for service. Emirates even monitors response times and reminds crew to answer calls quickly.

Delta flight attendants aren’t even unionized but the median Delta employee also doesn’t usually scold and ignore passengers this way. The bottom line is that it is not an ’emergency button’ it is a call button and if you need a drink the best way to ask for one is to let a crewmember know you need one.

That said if you are in economy you can expect to wait until the crew finishes serving everyone else. What you shouldn’t expect is (1) to be scolded and (2) to be ignored.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vdXBncmFkZWRwb2ludHMuY29tL25ld3MvZGVsdGEtbmV3LXJvdXRlcy1zdW1tZXItMjAyMy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta Air Lines Announces New Routes for Summer 2023,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='upgradedpoints.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/delta-new-routes-summer-2023/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673E8BA5C0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vdXBncmFkZWRwb2ludHMuY29tL25ld3MvZGVsdGEtbmV3LXJvdXRlcy1zdW1tZXItMjAyMy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL2dhemV0dGUuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2RlbHRhLXRvLXJlc3VtZS1ub25zdG9wLWZsaWdodHMtYmV0d2Vlbi1jb2xvcmFkby1zcHJpbmdzLWFuZC1hdGxhbnRhLW5leHQteWVhci9hcnRpY2xlXzc0N2JjMWYwLTM4MjctMTFlZC04YjdjLTg3NTQzNmUwZWQxMi5odG1s0gGhAWh0dHBzOi8vZ2F6ZXR0ZS5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvZGVsdGEtdG8tcmVzdW1lLW5vbnN0b3AtZmxpZ2h0cy1iZXR3ZWVuLWNvbG9yYWRvLXNwcmluZ3MtYW5kLWF0bGFudGEtbmV4dC15ZWFyL2FydGljbGVfNzQ3YmMxZjAtMzgyNy0xMWVkLThiN2MtODc1NDM2ZTBlZDEyLmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta to resume nonstop flights between Colorado Springs and Atlanta next year,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

Detroit Ave.,"There was talk of a spire and erecting a structure as high as 17 stories.

But what won out at 222 N. Detroit Ave. according to the man who oversaw the $110 million evolution of the office building was a desire to fit in not stick out.

“It blends in with everything. We wanted to make it look like it was built over time” Patrick Coyle real estate manager for Devon Energy said of the company’s roughly 11-story tiered office structure that will be dedicated Monday. “That’s the reason for the various height changes and different looks from the outside.

“That’s why we built the breezeway. We didn’t want to stick this giant chunk of concrete in the middle of this block and basically make everybody walk around it. We wanted it to feel like it’s part of the neighborhood.”

At roughly 260000 square feet downtown Tulsa’s beefy architectural addition had to scale two lofty hurdles — a company shake-up and the COVID-19 pandemic — to reach the finish line.

In October 2019 WPX Energy held a groundbreaking for what was to be its new headquarters on Detroit Avenue. But less than a year later as COVID was wrecking the country’s economy Oklahoma City-based Devon Energy announced that it planned to acquire WPX dissolving the latter’s operations in Tulsa.

“When the merger got announced it was ‘What do we do?’” Coyle said. “The discussion with (then-WPX CEO and now president and CEO of Devon) Rick (Muncrief) was ‘We’re going to finish the building. We want this to be a benefit to the city. We’re not going to walk away and leave a hole in the ground. We want this to be something positive.’”

To help incentivize the move by WPX (now Devon Energy) to the Tulsa Arts District the city established a tax increment financing (TIF) district that encompasses the block on which Devon’s building was constructed.

The TIF captures property taxes that normally would be paid by developers during the life of the TIF and returns it to the district to assist the developer and to pay for public improvements.

The up to 25-year development and finance agreement with the company places thresholds on such things as investment Class A office space retail space and publicly accessible parking spaces.

In return the firm is scheduled to receive $16.6 million in assistance over the life of the agreement as long as the project is completed as set out the city said.

The project also is projected to generate $5 million over the course of the agreement which will be used to fund infrastructure needs within the Inner Dispersal Loop or at the Evans-Fintube site.

“This property represents a significant investment in jobs commerce and economic development” Mayor G.T. Bynum said in a statement. “I want to thank the business leaders who not only had the vision for this project but the integrity and commitment to finish the job when their own plans changed due to circumstances associated with the pandemic.”

The 222 North Detroit campus encompasses an 11-story tower and adjacent four-story building with floors five and six spanning both structures.

More than 207000 square feet — the law firm Crowe & Dunlevy has leased the entire sixth floor — is reserved for office space and an undisclosed restaurant that could open in the fourth quarter could occupy a portion of the nearly 17300 square feet of retail space on the ground level.

So far the law firm is the only leased tenant but that could change.

The building will have 24-hour security and as a nod to COVID touch-free restrooms throughout.

All 680 parking spaces are covered including the 340 that are underground in a cavern equipped with exhaust fans and carbon monoxide detectors Coyle said.

“We have some really great legacy office assets that provide a great location for businesses but oftentimes what we would hear from prospective new entrants into the Tulsa market is that they were really looking for what’s referred to as ‘trophy’ office space very modern with a high level of amenities” said Kian Kamas executive director of the Tulsa Authority for Economic Development.

“That really ties into their thinking of how to attract and retain the top talent. So when we think about assets like the new headquarters building or Santa Fe Square (under construction) or the Vast Bank building the construction of those facilities has added a level of product in the Tulsa market that just hadn’t been there.”

Thousands of bricks from Spaghetti Warehouse which was razed for the new construction are part of the lobby of 222 North Detroit which will allow tenants to tailor the floor they are leasing.

“It’s an incredible asset for Tulsa and it’s going to get some really good tenants very soon” said Brett Beaver director at Cushman & Wakefield/Commericial Oklahoma the exclusive leasing agent for the property. “It’s a great addition to the office market and to downtown. They didn’t cut any corners. It is a magnificent property.”

The fifth level is the largest at 37012 square feet. Many would say the 11th floor with its slab-to-ceiling windows is the most spectacular.

“It’s so unique ...” Beaver said. “It’s brand new Class A. The 11th floor has dramatic 360-degree views. It’s some of the coolest space in the building.”

Besides providing updated digs for existing Tulsa companies the building with all its perks has the ability to lure firms from out of state.

“It’s certainly possible” Beaver said. “We’ve had a few prospects in that area. But for the most part it’s all local Tulsa companies. There’s just a demand for new office space. There isn’t a ton of it.”

One to two prospective tenants tour 222 North Detroit weekly Beaver said.

“You can have a thousand people looking at it and maybe you close four or five of those” Coyle said. “It’s a tough business. But the building sells itself. You can walk around it and it’s quality.”

The change follows Western Power Distribution’s acquisition by National Grid last

Western Power Distribution which distributes electricity to 8 million customers across the South West the Midlands and South Wales has changed its name to National Grid.

The change follows Western Power Distribution’s acquisition by National Grid last year and means it is now part of the biggest electricity transmission and distribution company in the UK.

National Grid delivers electricity and gas safely reliably and efficiently to the customers and communities it serves and is committed to delivering the transition to clean energy and helping the UK reach its net zero targets.

Customers will see no change to the excellent standards of customer service they currently receive.

If there is a power cut people should continue to call 105 or 0800 6783 105.

Help for vulnerable customers during a power cut will also be unchanged. Anyone who is elderly very ill has a disability or relies on power for medical equipment can still get priority assistance by calling 0800 096 3080 or visiting www.nationalgrid.co.uk/psr . Those who are already registered for priority assistance do not need to take any action as they will remain on the priority services register.

The process for anyone needing a new electricity connection to a home or business will be the same too with options to do this online or by phone.

Social media handles for Facebook Twitter and Instagram will however change to @gridcustomersuk and the company website can now be found at www.nationalgrid.co.uk

National Grid does not sell electricity so the name change will not affect bills which come from customers’ chosen suppliers.

Phil Swift President of National Grid Electricity Distribution said: “Our name is changing but our commitment to delivering a reliable and safe service remains the same and we’re looking forward to playing our part in delivering on the ambitious climate goals National Grid have set.

“Joining National Grid means we’re part of the biggest electricity transmission and distribution business in the UK working together to secure the transition to a clean fair and affordable energy future.”",,,

Each unit will be a one-room apartment with common amenities and a private outdoor space. The units are anticipated to be available at the end of 2023.

In Pike County the Pike County Land Reutilization Corporation also received a permit to demolish a building on U.S. 23 in Waverly. Gary Arnett Development Director of Pike County said the land bank currently has around 12 buildings they are looking at getting demolished but the paperwork for all of them has not been finalized. Many of these buildings are already falling down and demolishing them will help beautify the area.

OhioHealth and NovaCare will be building out a physical therapy clinic to the OhioHealth location on Zane Plaza in Chillicothe. This partnership offers experienced providers to patients as they work towards getting back to doing the activities they enjoy.

Other projects include a Dollar General store being built in Bourneville handicap renovations to restrooms at Butt Realty in Chillicothe redoing roofing on two shelters in Yoctangee Park sign changes to the Taco Bell on East Main Street and replacement and removal of antennas at the Verizon store in Waverly.

Whether it's hand soap candy or paper goods like toilet paper and paper towels buying these items from the dollar store can save shoppers some cash and a trip to the grocery store.

""People who aren't familiar with dollar stores may not realize that a lot of the items you commonly see on supermarket shelves are available at dollar stores too -- only at a fraction of the cost"" she explained.

One stop shop

Low-price department stores like Walmart and Target are often sought out for the versatility of the products they offer.

Maurie found dollar stores are not that different.

""At my local store you can buy everything from birthday cards to art supplies to pans and baking tools"" she wrote.

""As a busy working mom who's perpetually pressed for time that's an important thing.""

Skip the lines

It's no secret that a trip to the grocery store at the most desirable shopping times can end with standing in long lines.

At her local dollar outlet Maurie said she never has to wait in time-consuming queues to check out.

""Granted it could be that I'm just going at the right times.

""But I tend to do all of my errands at the same time -- in the morning after dropping my kids off at school.""

Her early shopping trips always seem to have long wait times for the grocery store but virtually no wait at the dollar store.

As recommended in the city's last water and sewer rate study in 2019 the council unanimously approved on three readings an ordinance increasing water and sewer rates by 3% across the board. The annual increase was recommended to keep up with the increased costs of water and sewer service to the city.

The new sewer rate for the first 1000 gallons of water used or any portion thereof will be $8.79 per month within the city and $14.56 outside the city limits. Those rates decrease in cost per 1000 gallons as usage goes up:

• For the next 4000 gallons -- $3.23 per 1000 gallons inside the city and $4.08 outside the city.

• For the next 45000 gallons -- $2.47 per 1000 gallons inside the city and $2.47 outside the city.

• For usage in excess of 50000 gallons -- $1.60 per 1000 gallons inside and outside the city.

Meter size is a factor in considering water usage rates. Base rates for up to 1000 gallons of water for those inside the city with a 5/8-inch to 3/4-inch meter is $15.43 per month. For those outside the city that same base rate is $37.01. Those rates increase by meter size: 1-inch -- $21.60 inside and $51.81 outside the city; 1 1/2-inch -- $27.76 and $65.45; 2-inch -- $44.71 and $107.34; 3-inch -- $169.63 and $407.08; 4-inch -- $215.90 and $517.99; 6-inch -- $325 and $777.14; and 8-inch -- $447.17 and 1073.22.

Water rates inside the city are $6.02 per thousand for 1001 to 15000 gallons; $5.78 per thousand for 15001 to 50000 gallons; $5.55 per thousand for 50001 to 300000 gallons; $5.10 per thousand for 300001 to 1 million gallons; $4.71 per thousand for 1 million and one to 5 million gallons; and $3.10 per thousand for all usage over 5 million gallons of water per month.

Water rates outside the city are $10.26 per thousand for 1001 to 15000 gallons; $8.32 per thousand for 15001 to 50000 gallons; $6.40 per thousand for 50001 to 300000 gallons; $5.55 per thousand for 300001 to 1 million gallons; $4.95 per thousand for 1 million and one to 5 million gallons; and $3.10 per thousand for all usage over 5 million gallons of water per month.

The rate increase will begin to be reflected on customers' January bills.

The council also unanimously approved an ordinance changing sidewalk specifications on three readings with one vote. This ordinance codifies current practice by requiring that sidewalks built in new subdivisions have a 4-inch aggregate base compacted to 90%. It also requires that sidewalks wider than 4 feet have joint spacing matching the sidewalk width up to a maximum spacing of 10 feet.

Not having the sidewalk base can cause the sidewalks to crack and fail according to Gentry Mayor Kevin Johnston.

A third proposed ordinance to change the zoning of certain properties for Apple Valley LLC was referred back to the Planning Commission for review since the owners of the property requested the city hold off on changing the zoning of the property at this time due to a change in development plans. The location of the Apple Valley property is between Marion Lee and Taylor Orchard roads to the west of the intersection of those roads.

Approved by resolution was the 2022 millage rate for the collection of taxes in 2023. The resolution left the General Fund millage at 4.8 mills and the Firemen's Pension at 0.3 mills. Even though the rate did not change the city is required to pass a millage resolution each year in order to collect those taxes.

Johnston updated the council on items under consideration by the city's Safety Committee including pedestrian safety along Pioneer Lane and possible options to slow street traffic or divert pedestrian traffic neighborhood speed limits and possibly adding stop signs clarifying city code on through truck traffic on West Main Street and a park amenity naming and numbering system.

Johnston sought council input to see if there was interest in pursuing property purchases of the current Grand Savings Bank location when it moves to its new building currently under construction on property along Arkansas 59 just north of the current Dollar General store. Johnston said he could see the building serving as a city hall for 5 to 10 years until a larger and more permanent city administration building is built downtown on city property. He also said owning the land there might help the city someday fix the junction of Main Street with Arkansas 59 so that it is a straight crossing rather than a turn on and off Arkansas 59.

He said the city also had an opportunity to buy additional land between its current South Park property along the railroad and south of Smith Avenue to connect it to the cemetery property further south. Council member Jason Williams said he thought purchasing the land would be a ""great addition to the city.""

Johnston said he would include these possible land purchases in the 2023 budget planning process.

Adjusting hours at city hall from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. was brought to the council for input and the recommended change to the city handbook will be brought back to the council for consideration at its October meeting.

Johnston said the change would allow employees to take a 30-minute lunch break rather than the current 60-minute break and allow all lunch breaks to be taken closer to noon instead of running into midafternoon. He also said the number of people coming into the city office after 4:30 was minimal with most of those just dropping off a water bill payment that could have just as easily been paid via the drop box.

Another item for future consideration would be to make it a standing policy that the city waive building permit fees for other tax entities. He said the change would allow government agencies to get more for their tax dollars and avoid just passing tax dollars from one entity to another. City Attorney Joel Kurtz will prepare a resolution for the policy change to be taken up by the council at its next regular meeting which is set for Oct. 3.

Johnston again updated the council on the splash pad and sports complex projects saying that final punch list items were being completed at the sports complex and that cameras to monitor both facilities would be installed and operational soon. The cameras are to discourage and prevent vandalism.

Johnston told council members that the city needed to consider the replacement of some park facilities such as the Edwards Pavilion. The much-used pavilion has roof damage and the wood supports and rafters are old and worn.

Larry Gregory of the Garver firm reported on final work at the new water storage facility on Y-City Road and of current smoke testing of Gentry's sewer lines. He said the report from the smoke testing should be complete by the October meeting and provide the city with a better idea of needed updates to the city's current sewer system and regarding the city's needs for a new wastewater treatment plant.

Johnston said the county had received two bids for ambulance service including a new bid from Northwest Health. He also reported that Gentry may be in the running for up to $300000 in street paving through the Arkansas Street Aid Program."

When interior designer and serial renovator Hannah Pemberton set her sights on overhauling a large Arts and Crafts–era home in the English seaside town of Margate many of those closest to her had their doubts—and voiced them. “Everybody was like: ‘What are you doing? It’s too big; it’s such a project!’ They said we were crazy” she recalls. What they didn’t understand was that it was just the right fit. She and her husband Matt are both self-employed and needed dedicated areas to work from home. Fortunately for them this detached house boasts six bedrooms one of which could easily be turned into Matt’s office (Hannah claimed the area off the kitchen for herself). The designer never doubted her capacity for overhauling the 2700-square-foot property which she describes as a “sad tatty mess” when they got their hands on it four years ago.

Hannah attacked the home’s makeover with her signature approach of blending form with function. “I love designing storage so that things can be hidden away practically and making them look exciting in the process” she says. Case in point: The luxurious daybed in the kitchen is a clever alternative to a sofa and surrounded by pastel-hued shelves for her 6-year-old son Felix’s books and toys. “Most of the time he’s sprawled out on it playing with Legos or reading which is what it was designed for” she says. To its right is a large light-filled studio where Hannah can mood-board design concepts for clients and store her bicycle.

With cooking being a big part of their family life (Hannah had a pop-up restaurant in London back in 2016 and has also authored a cookbook dedicated to plant-based bowls) a walk-in pantry was a must. “Cooking is probably my love language; it’s how people know if I like them” she says laughing. Overlooking the garden meals and morning coffee are enjoyed around the bouclé-swathed banquette which was gained by absorbing the garage.

The kitchen’s orange island is inarguably a quirky feature but it doesn’t come off as overbearing given it’s tempered by the rest of the room’s neutral palette. “I try to walk a line of respectability but with a little wink through colorful accessories” says Hannah of her spirited style.

One room that always garners excitement from visitors is the narrow powder room which is clad in pink zellige tile and has a coordinating concrete sink and saffron-tinged walls. “I used the tiles to accentuate how long and thin that space is” explains Hannah. The warm tones are echoed around the house courtesy of a palette of orange pink and beige contrasted with pops of green as a nod to the sea which is just a short walk away.

Upstairs Hannah furnished the bedrooms with a mix of pieces she sketched and had custom-made such as the plywood bedside and dressing table in the primary bedroom. Her opulent super-king bed is upholstered in a romantic floral fabric she plans to stock on her website. The drumlike fringed lampshades are her take on a mid-century design classic which she scaled up in size. When she posted one on her Instagram account it ignited a flurry of orders—she’s shipped hundreds to clients all around the world.

In Felix’s space the ceiling is wrapped in a warming sandy-toned paint—a nod to the subtle shipwreck theme the designer was going for (not pictured: a life-size resin cactus and palm tree in the corner). “It started when my mum who is an antiques dealer bought me a model of a ship” explains Hannah. “I wanted it to reflect that we live by the beach without the stereotypical nautical stuff.”

On the third floor they had to remove asbestos from the L-shaped attic room before they could reveal its beautiful wood beams in the roofline. The charming discovery inspired Hannah to go whimsical with the theme landing on a fabric inspired by Aesop’s fables depicting peacocks tigers and horses for the bench seating cushions and blind to create a cocoonlike feel.

Hannah’s renovation of the property which spanned exterior updates and landscaping incites knocks on her door from appreciative passers-by on a weekly basis. “It’s really gratifying and quite funny that people are so keen to ask about part of it or tell you what they think” she says. It might have taken three years but she proved the naysayers wrong.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmllL2J1c2luZXNzL2pvYnMvZG9taW5vcy1waXp6YS10by1yZWNydWl0LTEwMDAtc3RhZmYtaGVyZS1haGVhZC1vZi1oZWN0aWMtd2ludGVyLXNlYXNvbi80MjAxNjExMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Domino's Pizza to recruit 1000 staff here ahead of hectic winter season,"The takeaway company expects 700000 pizzas to be ordered during the cold months

The Dover/Kent County Metropolitan Planning Organization has approved the final document for the Rail Corridor Industrial Land Use Study.

The study points the need to keep property with the potential for rail access available for industrial development.

Linda Parkowski Executive Director of the Kent Economic Partnership and Choose Central Delaware said “The Rail Study will bring awareness of importance of preserving and zoning land along the rail corridor in Kent County for appropriate uses. There is a finite amount of rail in Central Delaware and this study highlights the need to use it wisely for future generations.”

The draft report can be read here on the Dover Kent MPO website. Any questions or concerns about this study can be directed to James Galvin Principal Planner at james.galvin@doverkentmpo.org.

The Dover/Kent County Metropolitan Planning Organization is a federally mandated nonprofit that works with local state and federal governments along with local transportation organizations to ensure that transportation planning and projects are done in keeping with federal law to include the Clean Air Act and the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (FAST).

Interest in rail transport has been building especially after Carload Express and its Delmarva Central Railroad subsidiary took over operations along the the Delmarva Norfolk Southern line.

Delmarva Central has been active in marketing its services and located its headquarters in the railroad and State Fair town of Harrington in Kent County.

The line supplies grain for the poultry industry along with propane and building materials.

Rail service is expected to be spurred by moves toward an economy that relies less on fossil fuels. Trains are more efficient than trucks in terms of fuel consumption",,,,,,,,,,,,

At Dow we’re committed to improving and scaling conservation and sustainability efforts over time including prioritizing initiatives to protect one of the world’s most valuable resources. A range of strategic partnerships and innovations help Dow participate in the protection and restoration of both marine and freshwater ecosystems around the globe through the Valuing Nature Goal.

The goal is to enable sustainability at scale. A recent example of how Dow achieves that is the collaboration with Ralph Lauren to create the world’s first scalable zero wastewater cotton dyeing system. The fashion giant incorporated Dow’s ECOFAST™ Pure technology a sustainable fabric treatment that uses 50% less water than other methods to create its 2020 Team USA collection for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Another is the upscaling of beach cleanup and ocean restoration programs along with the #PullingOurWeight campaign and this year’s Global Serve-a-thon.

This World Rivers Day I’d like to turn the attention toward a cause that Dow considers part of its very DNA. Since day one Dow has recognized the importance of rivers to the livelihood of surrounding communities including the ones Dow is a part of. This understanding drives the company’s work to advance water stewardship and enhance water management through a number of projects: at Loch Leven Dow is working to restore the 4500 acres of bottomland hardwood-forested wetlands upriver from Dow’s Plaquemine site in Louisiana. And with our partners at The Nature Conservancy (TNC) we’re working to restore the Atchafalaya Basin Preserve through long-term conservation and education by establishing the Atchafalaya Conservation Center to further community outreach and research.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91cm1pZGxhbmQuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9oaWdoc2Nob29sL2FydGljbGUvQ2hhcmdlcnMtZG9taW5hdGUtYXQtVHJpLUNpdGllcy1DaGFtcGlvbnNoaXAtMTc0NjQ5NTQucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chargers dominate at Tri-Cities Championship,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.ourmidland.com/sports/highschool/article/Chargers-dominate-at-Tri-Cities-Championship-17464954.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91cm1pZGxhbmQuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9oaWdoc2Nob29sL2FydGljbGUvQ2hhcmdlcnMtZG9taW5hdGUtYXQtVHJpLUNpdGllcy1DaGFtcGlvbnNoaXAtMTc0NjQ5NTQucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYnVzaW5lc3NfbmV3cy9kb3ctc2lua3MtdG8tMjAyMi1sb3ctYXMtcmVjZXNzaW9uLWZlYXJzLXJvaWwtd29ybGQtbWFya2V0cy9hcnRpY2xlX2YxYmU5ZWM0LTNiOTQtMTFlZC1iNWNhLTNiZGQ1YjU2ZGIzMS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dow sinks to 2022 low as recession fears roil world markets,Visitors to the financial district walk past the New York Stock Exchange Friday in New York.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9zdG9ja3MvbmV3cy9kb3ctZHJvcHMtYnV0LW5hcnJvd2x5LWF2b2lkcy1jb25maXJtaW5nLWJlYXItbWFya2V0LXN0YXR1cy9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NDQwOTgyNS5jbXPSAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvc3RvY2tzL25ld3MvZG93LWRyb3BzLWJ1dC1uYXJyb3dseS1hdm9pZHMtY29uZmlybWluZy1iZWFyLW1hcmtldC1zdGF0dXMvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk0NDA5ODI1LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dow drops but narrowly avoids confirming bear market status,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='economictimes.indiatimes.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /markets/stocks/news/dow-drops-but-narrowly-avoids-confirming-bear-market-status/articleshow/94409825.cms?from=mdr (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000026740D662C0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9zdG9ja3MvbmV3cy9kb3ctZHJvcHMtYnV0LW5hcnJvd2x5LWF2b2lkcy1jb25maXJtaW5nLWJlYXItbWFya2V0LXN0YXR1cy9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NDQwOTgyNS5jbXPSAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvc3RvY2tzL25ld3MvZG93LWRyb3BzLWJ1dC1uYXJyb3dseS1hdm9pZHMtY29uZmlybWluZy1iZWFyLW1hcmtldC1zdGF0dXMvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk0NDA5ODI1LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Mike will play a big role in getting the sister the help she needs so let’s talk about what’s in store.

Now that Jennifer is back on painkillers she’s on the verge of spiraling out of control.

Jennifer will pop pills and deal with a vision or hallucination of Abigail DiMera (Marci Miller) that leaves her reeling.

After Jennifer gets behind the wheel in this drugged-up state it’ll set up a disaster on the road.

Days spoilers hint that Gwen Rizczech (Emily O’Brien) will end up injured thanks to Jennifer so it’s clear that Jenn needs to get her life together.

Fortunately Jennifer won’t have to go through the next difficult chapter alone.

Roark Critchlow is reprising the role of Dr. Mike Horton after 12 years away from Days so Jennifer will get assistance from her brother.

It looks like Mike will help Jennifer get settled in a rehab program somewhere.

Mike will only be back for a couple episodes but he’ll share scenes with Jennifer Jack Deveraux (Matthew Ashford) Doug Williams (Bill Hayes) and Julie Williams (Susan Seaforth Hayes).

During the week of October 3-7 Mike will pop back up just before Jennifer says an emotional farewell to Jack.

It sounds like Mike will take the lead on guiding Jennifer through the next steps – though Jack will only be a phone call away if Jennifer needs him.

Of course Jack will want to stick around Salem and make sure Gwen is OK following her own hospital ordeal.

Even if Jack offers to go with Jennifer she may insist on him staying put and being there for his daughter.

Jennifer can hopefully come out stronger on the other side especially with supportive Mike in her corner.

It’ll be great to see Roark Critchlow again as Dr. Mike Horton even just for this brief DOOL visit.

Days of Our Lives spoilers say Mike will do his part to put Jennifer on the right path so stay tuned to DOOL.

It’s been a rough few months for Days of Our Lives heroine Jennifer. Like the rest of her family she’s struggled to deal with the murder of her daughter Abigail not to mention the continued presence of Gwen in their lives. Seeking comfort where she could find it Jennifer has been popping pills the way some folks do Tic Tacs and it’s becoming a major problem for her.

Fortunately while there’s not currently a doctor in the house in which she’s residing there is one in the family and he’s about to head back to Salem. Look for Roark Critchlow to step back into the role of Jennifer’s brother Dr. Mike Horton on Tuesday October 4.

More: Look who else is returning to Days of Our Lives!

For those needing a bit of a history lesson here’s a quick-hit version of Mike’s life. Although he’s the son of Laura and Bill Horton he was raised believing his dad to be Bill’s brother Mickey. As you can imagine this led to a whole lot of drama when finally the truth came to light. For years Mike was a central character experiencing pretty much every form of trauma that a soap writer could throw his way. Confessing to a murder he didn’t commit? Check. Interfaith relationship? Check. Falling in love with a woman dying of leukemia? Check. Accidentally shipping illegal weapons? Yup!

More: Look who else is heading back to Salem!

At one point Mike became involved in a heated battle with none other than Craig Wesley as they competed to becoming the Chief of Staff at University Hospital. Not surprisingly Craig — with then-wife Nancy by his side — managed to manipulate his way into the position at least briefly. Personal-life wise Mike was notoriously unlucky in love. Although he has a son Jeremy with ex Robin Jacobs Carrie Brady was the owner of his usually lonely heart. And although they did experience a few years of happiness off-screen she would eventually reunite with her true love Austin Reed.

Now of course the timing is perfect for Mike’s return as sis Jennifer is dealing with a major crisis which as this week’s video preview reveals is about to take a potentially deadly turn! Being a doctor and all perhaps Mike will also be able to help cure Kate Marlena and Kayla of what ails them!

Critchlow also appeared briefly on Passions as Dr. Ackland a psychiatrist hired by Sheridan’s wicked dad to erase true-love Luis from her mind. Luis you’ll recall was played by none other than Galen Gering who currently plays Rafe on Days.

The new change to the way Mosaic United works will enable the government to provide up to half of the funding for new projects with the remaining half coming from a donor. Until now it needed to be a third.

The change as well as others that are soon to be rolled out came under the direction of Gary Torgow a Detroit-based businessman who has served for the last five years as chairman of Mosaic United’s steering committee.

Well known in Detroit for his business and philanthropic activities Torgow is a key player today in Israeli-Diaspora relations. Over the years he has forged strong ties on Capitol Hill leveraging those relationships to help his local Jewish community and beyond.

“We are enjoying as a people a historic renaissance in Jewish philanthropy activism and scholarship. But we are at the same time experiencing a never-before-seen urgency across the broad spectrum of Jewish life around the entire globe.” Gary Torgow

“We are enjoying as a people a historic renaissance in Jewish philanthropy activism and scholarship” Torgow said at a Jerusalem Post Conference in Jerusalem last October. “But we are at the same time experiencing a never-before-seen urgency across the broad spectrum of Jewish life around the entire globe.”

In addition to spending countless hours on Mosaic United Torgow is chairman of Huntington Bank. He is a licensed lawyer with a degree from Wayne University and serves on the board of DTE Energy Company and as a director of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan.

Huntington Bank is a $179b. asset regional bank holding company headquartered in Columbus Ohio providing consumers small and middle-market businesses corporations municipalities and other organizations with a comprehensive suite of banking services.

Currently Mosaic United operates four different pillars.

The campus pillar seeks to strengthen students’ Jewish identities through tailored tracks and partnerships with Hillel International Chabad on Campus International and Olami. There is also the Shalom Corps track which saw the creation of a global Jewish volunteer movement. Yisraelim is aimed at reaching young Israelis who live outside Israel through its innovative educational and engagement experiences provided by partner organizations. The Teen Travel Pillar operated with RootOne through the Jewish Education Project brings North American teens on meaningful educational trips to Israel.

With the challenges only growing when it comes to Israel’s relationship with the Diaspora Torgow and Mosaic United will be called on to play an even greater role in the years to come.

“The miracle of Israel and its success... has expanded exponentially. Israel has become a resource for the entire world” Torgow explained at the conference. “But it is a tragic reality that in the intervening time somehow we have not adequately cultivated the commitment imagination loyalty and pride of the new generation in the Diaspora.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

(Courtesy photo)

PENDER COUNTY — A solar company that wanted to plant 2360 acres of panels in Pender County timberland was sent packing Monday.

A wide-ranging public hearing ended in an unanimous vote by county commissioners to reject a special-use permit for the development. Commissioners took issue with the size of the project its location in the midst of a large section of land used for agriculture and the impact it could have on flooding and water supply if leaching was an issue.

The project would have involved Coastal Pine Solar subsidiary of California-based Birch Creek buying up acreage from the middle of a 6587-acre wooded parcel north of Piney Woods Road and east of U.S. 421.

It was proposed on land in the county’s rural agricultural classification with farming use “highly encouraged.” Right now the land is owned by Evergreen Timber Co. and used for commercial timber management.

If approved the company would have spent nearly $300 million clearing the land and pneumatically driving enough solar panels into the ground to power 50000 homes on Duke Energy’s grid about 200 megawatts worth.

“I think we should make the distinction here that this is not a small acreage project” Pender County Commissioner Jackie Newton pointed out. Newton also lives adjacent to the property. “This is a utility-sized project that is proposed by a current non-land owner.”

Pender Planning Director Travis Henley told PCD the solar farm was easily the largest that has landed on his desk. Solar projects are permitted by right in the county’s two industrial districts but Henley said rural agricultural land is the only place with parcels large enough to place projects of this scale.

“Whether it’s two 25 or 2400 acres if it’s in [rural agriculture] it requires a special use permit” Henley said.

Duke draws power from eight solar facilities in Pender currently. Six are in the 5 megawatt range and two are larger. The Crooked Run solar development produces 70 megawatts and Innovative Solar 67 produces 34.

Before 2017 5 megawatt farms on about 30 acres of land were the norm but substantial enterprises are becoming the standard because the state’s largest utility company is looking for more efficient projects.

“People say why is it so large?” said Thomas Terrell a lawyer from Greensboro firm Fox Rothschild representing Coastal Pine Solar. “The answer is Duke Energy.”

Terrell recounted the N.C. General Assembly passed a law enabling Duke to use a competitive bidding process in 2017 to decide which projects it would purchase solar electricity from. Prior to the law if someone built a 5 megawatt farm Duke had to pay for the power it generated at a rate Duke spokesperson Randy Wheeless said was “pretty attractive.”

“That’s why you saw so many of them” he told PCD.

Roughly 7.5% of Duke’s grid is solar and it buys about 10 times more than it owns from third parties Wheeless said. There are over 700 solar farms in North Carolina with more than 40 owned by Duke; however the company has plans to build 55% of its own solar infrastructure in the future.

Wheeless pulled information on some projects that have won bids and found 20 30 and 40 megawatt farms across the state. Five megawatt farms are becoming a thing of the past and the reason is the economy of scale.

“To build 5 megawatts to get the labor to get the parts to get the racking the panels you’re just as well building a bigger one” he said.

Pender County is no stranger to big solar projects. A 672-acre farm with a $70-million price tag was built in the northern part of the county in 2019.

“This is not our first rodeo with a solar farm” Commissioner George Brown said. “I wasn’t sure where this was going to go in our county a few years ago when I experienced the first one.”

More than a half-dozen residents came out to speak against Coastal Pine. They echoed commissioner concerns about soil contamination flooding and the impact of clearing land.

The development team rebutted: It would have no environmental impact on the property; the land could return to timberland once the lifespan of the solar panels expire (any where from 25 to 40 years); it would boost tax revenue; and could benefit the soil by allowing it to lie fallow and build up nutrients in decades to come.

Wesley Wooten a farmer with property also adjacent to the proposed project pushed back on every point the Coastal Pine team made. He said notices about the project should have gone out to an area larger than 500 feet from the acreage and claimed solar farms are “terrible” for jobs and economic growth because employees do not stay after construction is complete.

Representatives for Coastal Pine did not present estimates on job creation during the hearing.

Wooten surmised the solar project could turn the massive acreage into a wasteland that cannot be farmed if concrete is left behind in the ground. He was speaking from experience first-hand explaining how he brought concrete to another site to reinforce panel installations because the developer did not realize how high the water table was.

The developers assured there would be no soil contamination. The piles the solar panels would be mounted on are made from galvanized steel coated in zinc to prevent corrosion with no concrete involved according to Tommy Cleveland a solar engineer hired by Coastal Pine who also used to work for N.C. State University.

Cleveland told the board the farm would have no negative impact on the land and “organic matter” in the soil increases over time on solar farms.

According to the attorney Terrell Coastal Pine would also comply with creating a decommissioning plan to remove the panels at the end of their service life expectancy of about 40 years.

Wooten also questioned whether the panels consisting of heavy metals would leach contaminants into the ground water if damaged and if their installation could cause flooding.

Terrell shot back asking for scientific evidence there could be leaching a risk to water supplies or any engineering calculations to support the idea there would be flooding.

The panels would stop drawing power if broken Cleveland added also noting the materials would not leak into the soil.

Commissioner Brown said later in the meeting when another solar farm approached the board years back he hoped to get people to speak to the commissioners about negatives of the farms like “leakage.”

“That never happened” Brown said. “In my opinion I think before we go any further with too many more solar farms in our county I would like to hear from experts on the other side of the fence.”

Though civil engineering on the site had not been complete the Coastal Pine team had to present competent material and substantial evidence to address concerns raised. Terrell said the developer met those requirements and therefore was “entitled” to the permit.

Commissioner Newton was clear she supported property rights as long as it did not cause adverse effect to the environment or harm to neighbors. Her main concerns were with tree loss and potential runoff.

“Clearcutting 2500 acres of timber plus is not going to be healthy” she said noting the county has an affiliation with the American Flood coalition in an effort to be more resilient.

The commissioner also was taken aback the developer had not considered the water table or the county’s well water.

Another resident Charles Rooks spoke in the meeting and characterized the project as “light industry.” Newton concurred saying the solar farm company did not belong in an agricultural district.

Hired by Coastal Pine planner Kara Drane with Colliers Engineering and Design intimated the project would be “harmonious” with the other property uses in the area and not produce noise emissions odor or traffic.

The county’s master development plan specifies its purpose is “to ensure that such development occurs in a manner that suits the characteristics of the land is harmonious with adjoining property is in substantial compliance with the goals and policies of the adopted Land Use Plan Unified Development Ordinance and is in the best interest of the general public.”

The team proposed Coastal Pine install permeable fencing so small wildlife could still graze the farm to which commissioner Newton asked how a seven-foot fence enclosing the entire 2360 acres was amicable with nature. Drane said the fencing would not be visible because of buffering around the project.

At the end of the hearing Terrell appealed to the commissioners as a farmer stating he understood “the emotion of farming.” He echoed Drane’s sentiments that the farm would be hidden from public view but reminded the only thing relevant to the board are its ordinance standards.

Commissioner Newton made a motion to deny the request. She cited the project was not of similar use to the agriculture listed in the district impaired adjoining districts due to the scale of clear-cutting and constituted a nuisance or hazard.

The board agreed unanimously.

“We don’t know what’s going to happen in 25 30 years and who’s going to be around to clean it up” Newton said.

The Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol is a binding agreement to reduce production and use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) chemicals used in refrigeration and air conditioning that are also potent short-lived greenhouse gases. President Joe Biden is expected to soon sign the agreement something he has called for since his inauguration. The United States would join 137 other countries in an agreement that is projected to prevent substantial additional warming by the end of the century.

“I am thrilled to see the U.S. rally to the support of this vital agreement” John Kerry the U.S. special presidential envoy for climate who as U.S. Secretary of State helped forge the initial agreement in 2016 said in a written statement.

“Businesses supported it because it drives American exports; climate advocates championed it because it will avoid up to half a degree of global warming by the end of the century; and world leaders backed it because it ensures strong international cooperation” Kerry said.

The U.S Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to members of the U.S. Senate earlier in the week urging individual members to vote in support of the treaty and noting that they “will consider including votes related to this legislation in our annual ‘How They Voted’ scorecard.” The Senate had to give its “advice and consent” with a two-thirds majority vote in favor of ratification before President Biden could ratify the agreement.

A 2018 report by the U.S. air conditioning and refrigeration industry found that by 2027 the Kigali amendment would increase U.S. manufacturing jobs by 33000 increase U.S. exports by $5 billion and reduce imports by nearly $7 billion.

The United States began phasing down the production and use of HFCs after Congress passed the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act legislation that was signed by then President Donald Trump in 2020. Subsequent regulations released by the EPA in 2021 are compliant with the Kigali Amendment which requires the U.S. and other developed countries to reduce production and use of HFCs by 85 percent by 2036.

Officially ratifying the Kigali Amendment further solidifies the United States commitment to reducing HFC emissions and protects U.S. industry. Failure to ratify would close segments of the chemical and manufacturing industries to U.S. producers after 2023 because the Montreal Protocol “prohibits trade with countries not party to [it] or its amendments” according to the Air-Conditioning Heating and Refrigeration Institute and the Alliance for Responsible Atmospheric Policy industry groups that support ratification.

U.S. ratification also shows that the country is committed to climate action Avipsa Mahapatra the climate campaign lead at the Environmental Investigation Agency said.

“This is the first time the Senate has in a bipartisan way signed on to a climate treaty in the last 30 years” Mahapatra said of those who voted for the agreement including Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) who for years had mocked and criticized Democrats’ efforts to do anything about climate change. “I think it does infuse a little bit of hope in our ability to make climate action possible in this country.”

Phasing down HFCs is of particular importance because the chemicals are “short-lived climate pollutants.” HFCs remain in the atmosphere for 15 years on average far shorter than carbon dioxide which remains in the atmosphere for 300 to 1000 years. Any effort to curb HFC emissions or other short-lived climate pollutants such as methane will have a near-instantaneous impact on slowing global warming.

A study published earlier this year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) found curbing HFCs and other short-lived climate pollutants along with carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide a greenhouse gas with an atmospheric lifetime of 109 years slows the rate of warming a decade or two earlier than decarbonization alone and can avoid altogether the 2 degree Celsius threshold of warming that the Paris Agreement cites as the maximum allowable to avoid catastrophic environmental impacts.

“That is the only way to slow near term warming” said Durwood Zaelke president of the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development in Washington and a co-author of the PNAS study.

Zaelke said the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol is the first step in tackling short-lived climate pollutants. The next step is to focus on methane the second leading driver of climate change after carbon dioxide he said.

“You can use the Montreal Protocol as your inspiration for creating a new agreement on methane” Zaelke said. Last year more than 100 nations led by the U.S. and the European Union pledged to curb methane emissions; however the existing agreement the Global Methane Pledge is non-binding.

Mahapatra said more can also be done with the Kigali Amendment to further reduce HFC emissions.

“It has always operated on the principle of start and strengthen” Mahapatra said of the Montreal Protocol. “From here we hope that there will be deeper cuts in HFC production… to totally eliminate the use of these gases.”

But there was one moment that you probably missed. Apparently a fan tried to grab Nicki’s wig during her RL performance.

Nicki Minaj closed out the 2022 Rolling Loud New York festival at Citi Field in Queens N.Y. on Sept. 23. The rap superstar's hometown set didn't disappoint as she delivered the hits and brought out surprise guests like Lil Uzi Vert. However there was a moment when a fan tried to grab Nicki's hair while she was performing ""Moment 4 Life"" a cappella style.

At the 11-second mark in the video below you can see two hands waving as the Queen serenades the crowd and the wind is blowing her long black wig. When some of her long hair blows near the audience a hand appears and tries to grab her wig. It looks as if the fan missed the opportunity to grab a handful of Nicki's hairpiece. Nevertheless it was a weird moment.

Oddly according to The Shade Room a fan is allegedly trying to sell some of Nicki Minaj's hair strands for $12000 on eBay. Currently the bid is now at a whopping $15000. There are also nine other listings that claim to have strands of Nicki's hair for biddings. Various bids range from $1.00 to as high as $7000 for the rap vet's coif. Swipe left below.

While it may be weird to sell Nicki Minaj’s hair on eBay it’s not as strange as what a Kanye West fan was selling on the auction/shopping platform. Back in July of 2021 after Ye’s listening event for his Donda album someone posted an eBay listing for a bag of air—yes air—from the album listening party. The person was selling a Ziplock bag full of oxygen from the sold-out event at a starting price of $3333.33 plus $4 for shipping.

It’s unclear if anyone actually purchased the bag full of air. But who knows there might be someone out there who wants to cop strands of Nicki’s hair on eBay.

That's been the case at the 2022 Laver Cup too with a special edition hat quickly selling out earlier in the week. The merchandise stores held a small number of black 'RF' hats that had Laver Cup written on the side.

With Federer announcing the tournament this week would be his last before retirement fans descended on the capital to grab what merchandise they could. Retailing at £36 fans quickly snapped up the hats before they sold out with fans now turning to eBay to make a huge profit on their initial investment.

He was in his prime when he made that comment known internationally for his music and collaborations with for example Le Corbusier. Yet the search never stopped and Xenakis managed to stay elusive until his death in 2001 along the way building a legacy that is being observed this year the centennial of his birth.

The premiere of “Metastaseis” in 1955 in Germany put Xenakis in the company of the era’s respected composers. Admirers and opponents alike were struck by the work’s sheer violence of the masses of sound which were constructed not by notes but by ever-changing glissandos going up and down and landing briefly into visceral clusters of pitches.

It was something new and exciting. The composers of the Darmstadt School then the powerhouse of avant-garde music had been focused on serialism and the belief that every aspect of composition should be under control measured and organized in a highly abstract manner. But Xenakis in an article titled “The Crisis of Serial Music” took issue with the likes of Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen essentially accusing them of leading music into an impasse.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsbmV3cy5jYS9uZXdzLzkxNTQyMTAvYi1jLW11c3F1ZWFtLWhpc3RvcnktaGVyaXRhZ2UtYW5kLWN1bHR1cmUtc2hvd2Nhc2VkLWluLWZpZmEtMjMv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly9nbG9iYWxuZXdzLmNhL25ld3MvOTE1NDIxMC9iLWMtbXVzcXVlYW0taGlzdG9yeS1oZXJpdGFnZS1hbmQtY3VsdHVyZS1zaG93Y2FzZWQtaW4tZmlmYS0yMy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,B.C.

The Milton Keynes-based firm offers gymnastics and Ninja Knights – a mixture of non-contact martial arts and parkour – classes led by expert coaches as well as holiday camps and birthday parties.

Gymfinity Kids has said it plans to grow to at least 24 venues as part of its growth strategy.

In the short term the group said it will open a number of new clubs over the next 12 months and is reviewing options for international franchising.

The new fundraising included investment from existing management as well as third party investors.

Mr Roberts said: “We founded Gymfinity Kids with a distinctive offering proposition and facilities in an industry that like the gym sector 15 years ago is not very consumer friendly.

“I am delighted with our progress particularly given the challenges presented by the global pandemic.

“Children’s mental and physical wellbeing has never been more important and is the driver behind our purpose of laying the foundations for a happier healthier nation.

“The investor interest we received reflects the quality of the team we have assembled the business we have built and opportunity we see.”

Managing director Jacques De Bruin said: “The business has made good progress in a challenging five years with lengthy closures due to Covid.

“We have over that period expanded conservatively whilst refining our distinctive proposition and focussed on the families we welcome daily into our clubs and nurseries.

“We know how important being active is and have worked hard to make Gymfinity Kids a really fun and exciting place for children’s development.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zcG9ydHNrZWVkYS5jb20vbW1hL25ld3MtdGhleS1saXRlcmFsbHktcHJvbW90aW5nLXBlb3BsZS1taWdyYWluZXMtanJlLWd1ZXN0LWJyaWdoYW0tYnVobGVyLXRlbGxzLWpvZS1yb2dhbi1veHljb250aW4tdG9vay11cy1waGFybWFjZXV0aWNhbC1tYXJrZXTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"""They were literally promoting it for people with migraines"" - JRE guest Brigham Buhler tells Joe Rogan how OxyContin ...","ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zcG9ydHNrZWVkYS5jb20vbW1hL25ld3MtdGhleS1saXRlcmFsbHktcHJvbW90aW5nLXBlb3BsZS1taWdyYWluZXMtanJlLWd1ZXN0LWJyaWdoYW0tYnVobGVyLXRlbGxzLWpvZS1yb2dhbi1veHljb250aW4tdG9vay11cy1waGFybWFjZXV0aWNhbC1tYXJrZXTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000267403299F0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

NATCHEZ — A Centreville woman lost her life in a crash Saturday at about 9 p.m. when she tried to turn from the southbound lanes of U.S. 61 across the northbound lanes onto Kingston Road.

Virginia Malone 56 was driving a 2007 Dodge Journey when she collided with a 2012 Ford Expedition driven by Christopher Towell 54 of Jonesville Louisiana.

Cpl. Craig James public affairs officer with Mississippi Highway Patrol Troop M of Brookhaven whose troopers are investigating the crash said Malone received fatal injuries during the crash and was pronounced dead at the scene.

James said the accident is still under investigation. Adams County Sheriff’s deputies as well as Natchez Fire and Rescue personnel assisted MHP at the scene.

Adams County Coroner James Lee who apparently arrived at the scene shortly after the accident said the Ford Expedition “T-boned” Malone’s vehicle.

He called the accident “tragic.”

“All I can say right now is the victim’s family was at the scene of the accident and it was evident she was very well loved by her family and friends” James said. “I pray Godspeed to all of them.”",,,,,,

BPEA is working with advisers on a merger that could value its two portfolio companies at HK$54.6 billion to HK$62.4 billion they said.

The pan-Asian buyout firm – which itself is merging with Swedish investment firm EQT – has notified Tricor and Vistra’s creditors about the merger plans.

To help set a valuation for the merged business BPEA is weighing selling a minority stake in Vistra the larger of the two firms.

BPEA completed its purchase of Tricor from Permira in June in a deal that valued the company at about HK$21.84 billion including debt.

It then started preparations for a merger of the two business services firms after having considered a potential sale of Vistra earlier.

Vistra had drawn preliminary interest from other private equity firms including Warburg Pincus Bloomberg News has reported. A deal could have valued Vistra at HK$31.2 billion to HK$39 billion insiders said at the time.

According to their websites Vistra founded in 2006 is a fund administrator and corporate service provider while Tricor founded in 2000 provides services like investor and initial public offering services human resources corporate trust and so on.

Starwood Capital Group spent $91.8 million for a 669-unit affordable housing portfolio in the state Multi-Housing News reported. Comprising four different communities the transaction breaks down to roughly $137000 per unit.

All four assets were completed between 1994 and 2007 developed under the Low Income Housing Tax Credit program. All four will remain affordable under Starwood.

The 94-unit Villas at the Cove Crossing at 2738 Lantana Road and 2735 Donnelly Drive in Lake Worth sold for $16 million from an entity tied to Equity Management Partners records previously revealed. Equity Management flipped the property for a 62 percent gain from its purchase five months earlier.

The other properties involved in the portfolio deal include: the 184-unit Overlook at Monroe at 100 Wilner Circle in Sanford; the 241-unit Sonrise Villas Apartments at 53 Sonrise Place in Fellsmere; and the 150-unit St. Luke’s Apartments at 915 Quincy Street in Lakeland.

Marcus & Millichap’s Evan Kristol represented both the sellers and buyer in the deal; Kristol confirmed to The Real Deal that Equity Management was the seller of the other three properties in the portfolio.

CBRE Capital Markets originated Freddie Mac loans on all of the properties. Each community includes swimming pools clubhouses and laundry facilities.

Starwood has a growing portfolio of low-income rentals in Palm Beach County. In December the firm spent $176.4 million for affordable housing complexes in Greenacres and West Palm Beach.

Additional fees advertising requirements and competition with “resellers” have left many artists and designers unsure of their financial security. Now the online marketplace is requiring all sellers in the United States to verify their bank account information with Plaid a fintech company that recently settled a class-action lawsuit after Venmo users accused it of stealing their data.

Since late August Etsy sellers across the country have claimed that the Plaid verification process feels like an invasion of privacy primarily the requirement that users must enter their online banking username and password. The Indie Sellers Guild a new union that organized the week-long “Etsy Strike” in April is now advocating for an end to the Plaid partnership.

“Etsy sellers aren’t okay with being forced to share our private financial data with a third-party service in order to keep our shops open” the Guild wrote in a press release. “It’s one thing for sellers to freely choose to use a service like Plaid to consider the security risk and loss of privacy and decide that it’s worth it. It’s another thing entirely to be forced to give up privacy rights and sign up for a service that we do not want in order to keep getting paid.”

Since April the Guild has recruited more than 2600 of Etsy’s four million sellers (the company listed upwards of 96 million users in late 2021) received more than 86000 signatures on a strike petition and published a second petition after the Plaid news. Interim President Kristi Cassidy a Rhode Island-based clothing designer whose Auralynne shop has been on the platform since 2006 told Hyperallergic that her business is starting to feel unsustainable.

“The company had to know that we were not going to be happy about this” she said. “This is leading people to doubt that Etsy has their best interest in mind.”

Cassidy claims the Plaid partnership reflects Etsy’s waning regard for independent artists which dates back to its first fee increase in 2018. Since then she notes the company has given search priority to sellers who offer free shipping mandated advertising fees for anyone making at least $10000 per year and launched a since-revised star seller program that disproportionately rewards resellers of already made items — all of which imposes challenges on anyone making handmade goods and custom listings.

“It’s hard trying to do your own thing” Cassidy lamented. “None of us have the power of a giant company like Etsy to dominate Google searches.”

In response to Hyperallergic’s request for comment an Etsy spokesperson said “As part of our efforts to protect our users reduce the risk of fraud and account takeover and to meet evolving legal requirements Etsy is working to verify bank accounts. This is best practice across many industries including other ecommerce marketplaces. Sellers are able to have their accounts verified instantly or if they prefer use a micro-deposit based account linking option that does not require sharing account credentials.”

Since at least 2018 Plaid has been accused of posing as various bank institutions on money apps like Venmo and Robinhood to collect and sell users’ data. The company denies all wrongdoing however and opted for a $58 million settlement for the lawsuit last year. In a statement sent to Hyperallergic a Plaid spokesperson expressed their commitment to transparency on all data usage.

“The claims raised in the lawsuit do not reflect our practices” the spokesperson said. “We do not nor have we ever sold data. We make our role and practices clear and provide services that give consumers control over how and where they share their data.”

The fintech’s Auth product an app programming interface adopted by Etsy increases the speed and security of payouts for US sellers allowing for instantaneous money transfers and minimal room for error when users enter their account and routing numbers. Etsy’s site states that the service helps payments prevent money laundering and fraud citing a “manual solution” for sellers who opt out.

At the same time Etsy sellers are struggling with account verification through Plaid. Some received email messages claiming their information could not be verified only to receive a follow-up email stating otherwise. Etsy did not immediately respond to Hyperallergic’s multiple requests for comment but the Plaid spokesperson stated that any frustration over the partnership is a “misunderstanding.”

“We are committed to providing a secure experience for anyone using Plaid to safely and easily connect their financial accounts to the apps and services they want to use” they continued. “We welcome anyone with questions or concerns to contact our support team directly.”

Two months after introducing the all-new 2022 Ford Ranger Sime Darby Auto ConneXion (SDAC) has officially launched the 2022 Ford Everest in Malaysia. The third-gen SUV – which competes against the likes of the Toyota Fortuner and Isuzu MU-X in the ASEAN region – goes on sale here in three variant forms. These are the 2WD Sport 4WD Trend and 4WD Titanium.

The new seven-seater which was unveiled in March this year measures in at 4914 mm long 1923 mm wide and 1841 mm tall with a 2900 mm-long wheelbase. The track has also been increased by 50 mm to help deliver a more controlled ride on the tarmac.

Styling-wise the front end features a mix of horizontal and vertical elements some familiar from the Ranger and Raptor. Cues include C-clamp daytime running lamps first seen on the Maverick and a grille styled along the lines of the standard Ranger. The latter is finished in black on the Sport while the Trend and Titanium’s horizontal accents are dressed in chrome.

The Sport and Trend are equipped with LED headlamps with manual levelling while the Titanium gets matrix LED projector headlights with auto high beam. The front fog lamps are LED units while the rear features integrated full-width LED tail lamps.

Viewed from the side strong shoulder line gives the Everest a muscular shape and the wider track further adds to the SUV’s presence. As for wheels the Sport and Titanium get 20-inch alloys (with 255/55 profile tyres) while the Trend comes equipped with 18-inch units (and 255/65 rubbers).

Elsewhere new roof rails allow the Everest to support static loads of up to 350 kg and dynamic loads of up to 100 kg on the roof allowing the SUV to carry bikes canoes cargo pod or a roof-top tent.

For Malaysia the Everest gets two engine and drivetrain options the mills being the familiar Single-Turbo and the Bi-Turbo 2.0 inline four-cylinder diesels as seen on the Ranger. The Sport variant comes with the 2.0 Single-Turbo which offers 170 PS at 3500 rpm and 405 Nm from 1750 to 2500 rpm. It’s paired with a six-speed automatic transmission.

The Trend and Titanium are equipped with the Bi-Turbo unit which provides 210 PS at 3750 rpm and 500 Nm from 1750 to 2000 rpm in the way of output. This is partnered with the automaker’s 10R80 10-speed SelectShift automatic which on the Titanium gets a novel e-Shifter. Both variants also come with a two-speed electronic shift-on-the-fly transfer case also known as a part-time 4WD system with an e-locking rear differential.

In terms of drive modes the Sport offers four – Normal Eco Tow/Haul and Siippery while the 4WD variants add on two more these being Mud/Ruts and Sand. As before the Everest’s technical ability remains high. It continues to have a water wading ability up to 800 mm and a maximum braked trailer towing capability of up to 3500 kg.

Inside the cabin has been given a complete rework with Ford saying that plenty of thought has been put into the function and feel of the interior with inspiration taken from modern homes and by introducing improved materials and premium finishes as well as ambient lighting to the cabin. Attention has also been paid to making the interior quieter making it easier for front row occupants to talk to passengers in the second and third row.

As standard the Everest comes with leather upholstery ebony interior trim eight-way adjustable powered front seats an eight-inch TFT digital instrument cluster wireless Qi charing and an electronic parking brake among others. Both the Sport and Titanium come with a hands-free powered tailgate.

A SYNC 4A system handles all matters related to communications entertainment and information with a large portrait-oriented touchscreen (10.1-inches on the Sport and Trend and a 12-inch unit on the Titanium) handling presentation duties with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto support and an eight-speaker audio system also in the mix.

As for space there’s now more elbow leg and shoulder room in the front and back. and access to the third-row 50:50 split seats are now easier thanks to 60:40 second-row units that slide further forward than before. Both rear rows have also been designed to fold flat to offer improved cargo carrying ability with those on the Titanium being powered. There is more storage area for occupants and power outlets in all three rows allow device charging for all on board.

One money changer also saw 50 per cent more customers looking to buy Japanese yen while some travellers have promptly made new travel plans to Japan.

Low-cost airline Scoot meanwhile said that it will be increasing the number of flights to Japan in anticipation of greater demand.

In response to queries by TODAY a Scoot spokesperson said that it currently operates four flights a week to Osaka as well as to Tokyo via Taipei.

""To meet the expected increase in travel demand to Japan during the year-end period our service to Tokyo via Taipei will be increased to daily flights by end October 2022"" the spokesman said.

Scoot's Osaka service will also be increased to daily flights in November.

Travel booking website Expedia Group said that flight searches to Japan on its platform ""almost doubled (+90 per cent) on the day of the announcement"".

""Search demand for hotels in Japan (also) saw an 85 per cent increase on the day of the announcement compared to the last 14-day (Sept 8-21) average” said the company's Asia head of public relation Lavinia Rajaram.

Travel agency EU Holidays also saw enquiries for travel to Japan going up by ""20 to 30 per cent"" since Thursday said its marketing manager Mandy Chen 30.

All of this comes after Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced the lifting of the restrictions on Thursday (Sept 22) allowing visa-free travel and individual tourism in Japan once again for fully-vaccinated tourists from Oct 11 onwards.

Japan will also scrap daily arrival caps.

Prior to this Japan had one of the strictest border measures only opening to tourists in June for guided tours.

In early September it removed mandatory pre-arrival Covid-19 tests for fully-vaccinated travellers as well as raised the daily arrival cap from 20000 to 50000 and allowed foreign tourists on non-guided tours.

It however still required visitors to apply for a visa which wasn't required for 68 countries including Singapore previously.

Thursday's announcement to resume visa-free travel was welcomed by travellers.

Ms Julie Tan 48 a housewife told TODAY that she changed her original flight to Tokyo from Oct 7 to Oct 11 after the announcement.

She is visiting her daughter who is studying in a Tokyo university to celebrate her birthday on Oct 10.

Ms Tan also planned on going back to Japan again in February next year with the rest of her family.

“Everything is so convenient and ... easy to plan…even with elderly or with younger kids…Japan is clean. So it's very elderly friendly and is also very children friendly” she added.

Ms Rachel Leung 50 a housewife and part-time human resource executive said she booked air tickets last week for a trip to Japan in December when she heard that the country could be easing travel restrictions.

This is even though the S$1700 cost of the Singapore Airlines tickets was about S$700 more than before the pandemic.

She said she missed “the atmosphere and food” in Japan badly and used to visit the country with her family every year prior to the pandemic.

""(In) December wintertime we usually go and eat crabs (there)” she said.

Mr Abdul Malek Mustapa 33 an e-commerce worker told TODAY he was excited to explore Tokyo Osaka and Kyoto for the first time without the restrictions during his trip at the end of October.

“There's this deer park I do want to go to. I think it's part of the temple where you can go there and feed the local deers” he said.

Apart from travel agencies some money changers have also seen a rise in business for Japanese yen on Friday.

A sole proprietor of a money exchange at The Arcade who wanted to be known only as Mr Rahim 45 told TODAY that he saw around 50 per cent more customers changing Japanese yen.

A spokesperson from CashChanger a website that aggregates exchange and remittance rates added that compared to August ""there is an increase of 50 per cent in traffic of people looking for (the) Singapore dollar-Japanese yen exchange rate”.

Thin Margin an online currency exchange company also told TODAY that the number of people changing Singapore dollar for Japanese yen is “about the same” as compared to before the Covid-19 pandemic.

The Singapore dollar has strengthened this year against the yen rising from a rate of S$1 to 85.32 yen on Jan 1 to S$1 to 102.57 yen earlier this month.

The current exchange rate is about S$1= 100.35 yen which means Singapore travellers are still getting 17.6 per cent more in yen than the start of the year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVudGl2YS5jby5pbi90cmVuZHMvdG9wLTEwLWJlc3QtdHJhdmVsLWNvbXBhbmllcy1pbmRpYS0yMDIzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 10 Best Travel Companies In India 2023,"Do you need a list of the Top 10 Travel Companies in India? In India the travel industry is expanding incredibly quickly. Numerous new travel agencies entered the market. To stay afloat in the fierce competition travel agencies offer a variety of beneficial features to their clients.

What is a Travel Company?

A travel company is a private retailer or government agency that offers the general public travel and tourism-related services on behalf of lodging or travel suppliers to offer various travel bundles for each destination.

Outdoor recreation activities airlines car rentals cruise lines hotels trains guidebooks travel insurance package tours logistics for the delivery of luggage and medical supplies to travellers upon request public transportation schedules car rentals and bureau de change services are all things that travel agencies can offer. Travel agencies can also serve as generalised sales agents for international airlines.

Travel Technology

The major computer reservation systems which enable comparison and sorting of hotel and airfare rates among different providers are used by the travel industry. Bookings made through travel agencies including internet agencies may or may not be quickly confirmed.

Instead of having their own booking engine like online travel agencies do metasearch engines and scraper sites like Skyscanner Kayak.com Rome2rio and TripAdvisor provide search query results and then send users to service providers or online travel agencies to make a reservation. It is possible for travel agents to work with airline consolidators.

Tourism in India

India’s economy is heavily dependent on the quickly expanding tourist sector. The World Travel and Tourism Council estimates that in 2018 tourism provided 42.673 million jobs or 8.1% of all employment in India and generated 16.91 lakh crore (210 billion US dollars) or 9.2% of India’s GDP. By 2028 the industry is expected to increase at an average annual rate of 6.9% reaching $320 billion (or 9.9% of GDP) or 32.05 lakh crore.

In October 2015 the medical tourism sector in India was valued at $3 billion; by 2020 it is expected to reach US$7-8 billion. 184298 overseas patients came to India in 2014 to receive medical care.

India welcomed more than 17.9 million foreign visitors in 2019 compared to 17.4 million in 2018 an increase of 3.5%. India is now the eighth most visited country in Asia and the Pacific and ranks 22nd overall. In 2012 there were 1036.35 million domestic tourist visits to all states and union territories a 16.5% increase from 2011.

The most visited states in 2014 were Uttar Pradesh Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. Agra Delhi Mumbai Chennai and Jaipur were the top five Indian cities visited by international visitors in 2015. According to the number of international visitors Delhi is the 28th most popular tourist destination in the world followed by Mumbai (30) Chennai (43) Agra (45) Jaipur (52) and Kolkata (90).

The World Economic Forum’s Travel and Tourism Development Index 2021 which superseded the body’s previous Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report places India 54th overall out of 117 countries. In the most current Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report which was published in 2019 India was ranked 34th out of 140 countries. The report ranked the price competitiveness of the Indian tourism sector 13th out of 140 countries.

According to the article India has reasonable ground and port infrastructure in addition to a fairly good (ranked 28th) air transportation infrastructure (ranked 33rd). Additionally the nation received great marks for its natural resources (ranked 14th) cultural resources and business travel (ranked 8th).

According to the World Tourism Organization India came in 16th overall and 7th among Asian and Pacific nations for tourism receipts in 2012.

The ministry of tourism develops national policies for the expansion and promotion of tourism. The Ministry collaborates and communicates with other federal ministries and agencies state and union territory administrations and business representatives throughout the process.

Specialized tourist goods like rural cruise medical and eco-tourism are being actively promoted. The Incredible India programme which promotes travel to India is still being run by the ministry of tourism.

Here's how to expand your Backpack.

If there's one thing that becomes apparent after several hours in Disney Dreamlight Valley it's that there are a whole lot of items. There are a lot of items. You're only one person so chances are that you're going to run out of inventory space sooner than later. You're inevitably going to find yourself encumbered so here's how to up your inventory space.

How to expand inventory slots - Disney Dreamlight Valley



Source: Shacknews

Your inventory slots in Disney Dreamlight Valley will be used to hold pretty much anything in Disney Dreamlight Valley. That includes fruits vegetables prepared meals fish gems flowers and even the most basic of items: stones. You only get 21 inventory slots to start out but will quickly discover that this isn't nearly enough.

It's possible to up your inventory by seven slots at a time but this is going to cost you. In fact you can expand your Backpack to have up to 42 inventory slots but the cost of expansion is going to rise every time. Here's what you're looking at:

28-Slot Backpack : 5000 Star Coins

: 5000 Star Coins 35-Slot Backpack : 20000 Star Coins

: 20000 Star Coins 42-Slot Backpack: 50000 Star Coins

YEEOWCH! That's an astronomical number of Star Coins. The kicker to this story is that even with 42 inventory slots you're going to become encumbered sooner or later especially as you discover new food ingredients crops fish materials and anything else that comes with unlocking newer lands in the late game. Remember that Disney Dreamlight Valley is currently in early access so there's always a chance that the number of inventory slots could eventually increase before the release of the full game.

At this point you're going to have to start thinking about what to keep in your personal storage. The personal storage at your house will contain only seven inventory slots. That isn't a lot at all. However this number can also be increased.

Raise your friendship level with Scrooge McDuck up to Level 2 and complete Scrooge McDuck's Grand Re-opening which will unlock the Dreamlight Valley Economy 101 quest. Complete the first part of the quest and sell some gems to Goofy. Once that's over return to Scrooge and he'll give you the ability to expand your house. Put aside some Star Coins so that you can expand your house. As you expand your house you'll also expand the number of inventory slots in your personal storage. Your first house upgrade will bump your storage space up to 14 while your second will double that to 28.

Is that still not enough space? Good lord how much storage space does one person need? Very well hoarder if there's more you would like to put away for a later use you can simply craft a Chest using a workbench. All you need is 25 Softwood and 25 Stone. A Chest will have an additional 14 item slots. If you need more than that just craft another one. There's no limit to the number of Chests you can have in your house.

That's how you up your inventory space in Disney Dreamlight Valley. Hopefully Gameloft will grant players additional Backpack space down the road. We'll look for any updates here at Shacknews.

The announcement came after a Sept. 9 email notified some students in doubles they would have a third set of furniture. According to the email building capacity varies annually so dorms are meant to function as either a double or triple. In the past students have made the best of their circumstances by finding creative uses for extra furniture according to the email.

Hahna Song a second-year psychobiology student said because the lack of space in her previous triple was very restricting she chose a double this year to try solving the problem. Her roommate who slept on the top bunk also often found it difficult to breathe Song added.

Upon receiving UCLA Housing’s original email Song said she was initially taken aback adding that although it may have been difficult to take out furniture in buildings that were occupied over the summer sessions UCLA Housing should have alerted Bruins about the potential issue sooner.

Adelle Yan a second-year communication student said she expected residents to be treated better adding UCLA Housing should have notified students earlier.

“They did specify this as a possibility in the undergraduate housing contract” Yan said. “I feel like this whole clause feels unreasonable because the school does have the means to make this right.”

Yan also expressed frustration with the tone of the Sept. 9 email which she perceived as an attempt to put a positive spin on a negative situation. She said she circulated a petition which received more than 300 signatures within a day calling on UCLA Housing to not only offer storage spaces for the extra furniture and reconfigure bunk beds into ground-level single beds but also to issue a formal apology.

UCLA spokesperson Steve Montiel said in an emailed statement UCLA was not obligated to supply exactly two sets of furniture for double occupancy rooms. However Montiel said they take critiques from residents to heart.

“We recognize that this decision caused stress for students and families as they prepared to move in to their housing and moved quickly to address their concerns” Montiel said in the statement. “We appreciate the feedback which allowed us to reconsider the decision we made to maintain the residence hall furniture despite the change in occupancy.”

But Cameryn Tucker a second-year linguistics and anthropology student said she was skeptical any changes would be made adding there’s no means of confirming how many rooms have or haven’t had their furniture removed.

“I have big issues with the way that UCLA is organized. … They’re not communicative they have no type of transparency whatsoever” Tucker said. “So I just have really low hopes when it comes to administration doing anything – I did not even think that they’re gonna take out the furniture.”

Although she was dissatisfied with UCLA’s process Tucker said she’s glad they responded adding she hopes the furniture removal happens in a timely manner.

“It makes me feel better about the school that I go to because I know a lot of schools – they don’t really listen to their students” Song said. “I’m glad they were able to fix it relatively quickly.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUva2l0Y2hlbi1vcmdhbml6YXRpb24tcHJvZHVjdHMtdW5kZXItMjXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,25 of the best kitchen organization products on Amazon for under $25,"Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication.

XOM,ExxonMobil,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlY2xpbWF0ZW5ld3Mub3JnL25ld3MvMjUwOTIwMjIvZXh4b24taG91c3Rvbi1zaGlwLWNoYW5uZWwtY2FyYm9uLWNhcHR1cmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exxon's Long-Shot Embrace of Carbon Capture in the Houston Area Just Got Massive Support from Congress,"Pipe Dreams: Sixth in a continuing series on whether capturing carbon is a climate solution or a dangerous distraction.

Imagine a clean energy future and you might picture giant turbines twisting in the wind or electric vehicles zipping quietly down the highway. Fossil fuels become relics or disappear altogether.

ExxonMobil has a different vision. In this story of the future oil refineries continue to distill crude. Fossil fuel-burning power plants churn away too.

Oil and gas aren’t the problem Exxon chief executive Darren Woods has said. The problem is their carbon pollution. So last year Exxon proposed a herculean industrial effort for the Houston area that would allow the region’s fossil fuel infrastructure to continue operating at full throttle for decades while steadily lowering its climate emissions.

Using a technology called carbon capture and storage Exxon said it could collect 50 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually from industrial smokestacks by 2030 and double that amount by 2040. The company would then compress the gas and deliver it through hundreds of miles of new pipelines to injection wells drilled beneath the Gulf of Mexico where the climate-warming gas would remain locked away forever in porous rock.

Exxon is proposing to create an entirely new industry built to capture carbon and reinject it all so that energy companies can keep on pumping and burning oil and gas. The $100 billion mega-project would tie together dozens of facilities owned by 12 of the world’s biggest corporate polluters including oil majors like Chevron power generators like Calpine and chemical giants like Dow. It would also require substantial government financing Exxon said.

Exxon and others have already made strides in securing this support. Since the company released its proposal Congress has given the Energy Department $20 billion to spend on carbon capture and clean hydrogen projects and authorized another $250 billion in loan guarantees for these and other emissions-cutting technologies. Lawmakers also increased the value of a carbon-capture tax incentive such that if Exxon and its partners meet their 2030 goals for Houston they would stand to reap more than $4 billion every year from taxpayers for up to 12 years. The prospect of these multibillion-dollar government handouts has riled many climate advocates.

“Paying them to do this is paying a ransom on the planet” said Corey Williams who until recently served as the research and policy director at Air Alliance Houston an environmental advocacy group.

“We’re not penalizing them we’re considering paying them” he added. “That to me couldn’t be more backwards.”

Many analysts and environmental advocates received Exxon’s announcement with skepticism. Some critics see the company’s commitment to carbon capture as a form of greenwashing a disingenuous gesture toward lowering emissions serving as cover for the real investments in oil and gas. Exxon’s only publicly announced investment in carbon capture this year has been a $400 million expansion of an operation in Wyoming compared with a projected $22.5 billion in total capital expenditures. The company has also said it expects to sell even more oil and gas five years from now than it does today.

Even if the world’s current capacity for capturing carbon were increased by a factor of 10 it would equal only 1 percent of global CO2 emissions. What’s more over the last several decades only a few dozen carbon capture operations have been built and collectively they capture far less CO2 than what Exxon said it could achieve over just eight years. Nearly every attempt to build these types of projects has hit delays failed to reach targets or simply never been completed.

The Houston region is home to one of the greatest concentrations of heavy polluters in the country but most of the emissions come from refineries and power plants which are among the most expensive applications for carbon capture technology. Every project needed for the Houston hub as the proposal is known would need to be unprecedented in nature and scale.

Exxon Chevron and others have proposed some of the first projects that could begin to make up the hub but they have yet to publicly commit anything beyond small initial investments despite raking in what could be record profits this year: Exxon earned $17.9 billion from just April through June.

Williams and other community advocates also worry that the carbon capture projects if built would do little or nothing to limit the release of cancer-causing air pollutants like benzene and heavy metals that spew from the refineries and petrochemical plants into surrounding neighborhoods. The people who live in these neighborhoods are predominantly Latino and the air they breathe is some of the dirtiest in the nation.

The hub might not deliver the climate benefits Exxon claims either. The carbon capture equipment would require vast quantities of power. Even if that electricity were generated by emissions-free sources many advocates and experts argue it would be more effective to simply send that power into the grid and displace fossil fuels altogether rather than run carbon capture operations.

Many of the Houston projects would involve converting natural gas into hydrogen a clean-burning fuel while capturing the associated CO2. But research indicates that upstream methane leaks in natural gas systems which remain widespread can reduce or negate the climate benefits of using the fuel to make hydrogen.

In short many experts say Exxon’s vision is an extreme long-shot—some would say bad-faith—proposal for the largest-ever deployment of a technology that has failed to prove itself at scale despite billions of dollars of public subsidies and private investments and decades of effort.

Still many policy experts have come to believe that some amount of carbon capture will be needed to meet climate targets and the Biden administration has made the technology a key part of its climate policies. So the Houston hub perhaps the biggest and boldest plan to capture carbon from smokestacks is drawing significant attention from major corporations and the federal government.

The hub inched closer to reality last month when Congress passed a major climate and tax bill that includes the substantial expansion of a federal carbon capture tax credit. The change could push many of the proposals including one announced this year by Exxon for its Baytown refinery across the economic threshold of profitability. Some academic modelers are now projecting a 13-fold increase in carbon capture by the end of the decade because of this tax credit expansion.

Oil and gas executives reacted to the bill’s passage with “wild enthusiasm” said Charles McConnell energy officer and director at the University of Houston’s Center for Carbon Management and Energy Sustainability who is serving as an academic adviser to Exxon and the other companies pursuing the hub. “To say any more would probably be more than I care to share.”

This lucrative incentive comes on top of the billions of dollars that last year’s infrastructure bill sent to the Department of Energy to help build carbon capture projects and clean hydrogen hubs. And when that money begins flowing next year a good portion is widely expected to land in Houston.

More Money for Carbon Capture Than Ever Before

Early last year Exxon’s top executives were in the uncomfortable position of playing defense. An upstart hedge fund had launched a campaign to replace several of the oil company’s directors trying to convince shareholders that fresh blood was needed to reposition Exxon’s business to address climate change. The hedge fund presented data about an inevitable transition away from fossil fuels and how Exxon’s investments were failing to anticipate that trend. The shareholder vote was scheduled for late May. A few weeks before the critical vote Exxon’s management floated a counter-narrative about its bright future that revolved around the Houston hub.

On the day the company announced the proposal Woods and Joe Blommaert who was then chief of Exxon’s low carbon business wrote a column for The Wall Street Journal arguing that the Houston hub would help the nation meet its climate targets and serve as a model for the world. As the central pillar of Exxon’s low-carbon strategy it would build on the company’s expertise “managing hydrocarbon molecules” as executives like to say rather than attempting to enter entirely new businesses like wind or solar energy.

“Based on Energy Department numbers we estimate there is adequate capacity along the Gulf Coast to store around 500 billion metric tons of CO2” they wrote. Tens of thousands of new jobs would be created in the process they said and thousands of existing jobs would be preserved.

The success of their proposal however was contingent on government funding. And Exxon executives and lobbyists had already been working to line up support from public officials.

The week before the announcement Woods had presented the hub proposal to Houston’s mayor Sylvester Turner in a phone call according to emails obtained in a public records request. The day after Exxon went public with the carbon capture plan Turner followed with his own press release praising the effort as “the type of bold ambition and investment we will need to meet our climate goals.”

Within weeks the commissioners of Harris County home to Exxon’s Baytown refinery and many of the industrial facilities along the Houston Ship Channel passed a resolution in support of the company and the proposal too.

Exxon’s shareholders nevertheless voted to replace three corporate directors in May. But the vote did not change the company’s pursuit of the Houston hub.

Most of the financing Exxon needed from government would come at the federal level where its lobbyists began discussing the Houston proposal with members of Congress and agencies last spring according to lobbying disclosures. One Exxon lobbyist pitched the hub to officials at the Department of Labor according to emails obtained in a records request claiming it would create “tens of thousands of new jobs.”

In May of last year Woods met with Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and discussed the company’s efforts on carbon capture and storage. To build the hub Exxon would need the department to expand or amend its loan programs according to a presentation given to state regulators last year by Erik Oswald vice president of strategy and advocacy at Exxon’s low-carbon business.

Charisma Troiano an Energy Department spokeswoman declined to elaborate on what was discussed at the meeting with Exxon saying only that “the department and the secretary meet with a lot of companies interested in carbon capture given the recognition that it is needed to reach President Biden’s net zero by 2050 goals.”

After a lobbying blitz from Exxon and many others Congress soon allocated more money to carbon capture and storage than any government anywhere has to date and much of it closely matched what Oswald said his company needed for the Houston hub. The infrastructure bill that passed last year for example created a new Energy Department program that will provide $2.1 billion in loans and grants for building carbon dioxide pipelines and authorized billions more for clean hydrogen and carbon capture demonstration projects. The bill also directed the Interior Department to issue regulations within a year that would open offshore areas to CO2 storage another step Exxon needed. Days after the bill was signed the company secured the mineral rights beneath a swath of federal waters off Houston that align closely with where Exxon has said it would inject the hub’s CO2.

Last month the climate legislation passed by Congress included a significant expansion of a carbon capture tax credit as well as a new clean hydrogen production tax credit. While the new value of the carbon capture credit isn’t as high as what Exxon has sought—$100 per metric ton—it comes close increasing the value by about 70 percent to $85 for every metric ton of CO2 captured and stored underground. That places the value not coincidentally just above the estimated cost of applying carbon capture to hydrogen production and close to the cost for several other applications.

This tax credit change is likely the most important subsidy of all for the Houston hub: 50 million metric tons of carbon dioxide could work out to more than $4 billion annually. Companies have until 2033 to begin construction to qualify for the credit and are eligible to receive it for 12 years.

The bill also authorized the Energy Department to offer $250 billion in loan guarantees for projects that would help energy facilities “avoid reduce utilize or sequester air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases.” This closely matched a request in Oswald’s presentation last year. Of the eight items he listed as “what’s needed” from government the infrastructure and climate bills delivered all or part of six.

In March of this year while the climate bill’s fate was uncertain Exxon announced the first proposal for the hub a plan to make hydrogen with natural gas while capturing the process’s emissions at its Baytown refinery complex. Chevron soon followed with its own proposal a CO2 storage project in state waters off the Gulf Coast. Two weeks later BP and Linde a chemical company that is among the 12 supporting corporations said they would team up to produce low-carbon hydrogen and “support the storage of carbon dioxide captured from other industrial facilities—paving the way for large-scale decarbonization of the Texas Gulf Coast industrial corridor.”

Exxon declined to make anyone available for an interview but spokesman Todd Spitler emailed a statement that pointed to several carbon capture proposals the company has announced around the world most of which are in the early planning stages as evidence of its intentions to deploy the technology.

Earlier this year Woods spoke directly of the company’s carbon capture efforts at a major oil industry conference in Houston.

“It’s not unlike the things that our industry has done and our company in particular has done as we move around the world is building some of these industries grassroots from scratch” he said. “We’ve got an opportunity to essentially build a new business here from scratch working with the government and with industry.”

‘If You Can’t Do it Here’

Buffalo Bayou was once a swampy mosquito-infested creek that seeped through Houston to Galveston Bay. Its shallow waters couldn’t accommodate oceangoing vessels so local leaders aiming to build a true inland port embarked on a series of projects beginning in the late 19th century to dredge and widen the waterway.

Today the Houston Ship Channel is lined by a nearly unbroken 20-mile stretch of refineries storage tanks and petrochemical plants. They comprise all the industrial pieces needed to convert hydrocarbons into the fuels fertilizers and plastics that feed the modern economy. Their smokestacks and flares form an industrial skyline of white plumes and orange flames belching greenhouse gases into the thick Gulf Coast air and toxic pollution into residential neighborhoods. Depending on the wind their stench can hang heavy above the houses carrying a foul smell of sulfur and crude even a hops-like tang.

Exxon’s Baytown refinery and petrochemical complex is the largest of these sprawling over 3400 acres four times the size of Manhattan’s Central Park. It is one of the country’s biggest sources of carbon dioxide pollution pumping out more than 11 million metric tons in 2020 the last year for which data is available according to figures reported to the Environmental Protection Agency.

This concentration of polluting industry happens to sit next to some of the best geology for storing carbon dioxide underground: Formations beneath the Gulf of Mexico could hold more than 100 billion tons of CO2 according to one study. Add in the fact that the companies already hold many pipeline rights of way and enjoy the permissive oversight of Texas regulators and you have what many experts say is the ideal place to build a major carbon capture hub.

“If you can’t do it here commercially you can’t do it anywhere” said McConnell of the University of Houston who has been advising Exxon and the other hub companies. McConnell led the Energy Department’s Office of Fossil Energy from 2011 to 2013 and he said his experience there is not lost on the companies as they seek federal funding. The United States and the world remain far off track for the larger goal of zeroing out greenhouse gas emissions by midcentury. Many experts have charted pathways for achieving zero emissions within the power sector by building massive amounts of renewable energy and light-duty transportation through electrification. But billions of tons of carbon pollution are emitted every year by the manufacturing of iron steel cement chemicals and many other products central to society. These sectors account for roughly one-sixth of global CO2 pollution and currently carbon capture and storage is one of the few tools for reducing them. “It’s not an option” McConnell said. “It’s a requirement.”

Some supporters of the technology also argue that applying carbon capture to a select number of fossil-fueled power plants could make the electric grid much more efficient and reliable than if it depended entirely on renewable sources. Because wind and solar power are intermittent an all-renewable grid would require building tremendous capacity to meet peak demand far more than what might be needed most of the time. There are substantial hurdles to building so much renewable energy production including opposition from communities where it would be sited and backlogs in permitting.

One of the people who makes this argument is Brad Crabtree who is now the Energy Department’s assistant secretary for fossil energy and carbon management the position McConnell once held.

“When you retrofit for example a power plant with carbon capture it has a special value in the broader decarbonized grid that often doesn’t get fully recognized” Crabtree said. “It can result in efficiencies elsewhere” driving down costs system-wide he added.

Before he joined the Biden administration Crabtree was the director of the Carbon Capture Coalition a collection of energy companies unions and environmental groups that advocates supportive policies. Now he is overseeing billions of dollars in federal funds created by those policies to help build demonstration plants pipelines and storage sites much of which could be done by coalition members.

McConnell said the Houston companies are serious about building the hub and have developed rigorous plans for doing so. “These guys know what they want to do” he said.

Substantial hurdles to developing a major hub remain including uncertainty about long-term liability associated with storing CO2 underground and securing the permits and investments needed to build pipelines. Still McConnell said the new higher tax-credit value means companies can now start running business modeling for specific projects.

“That’s what’s exciting” he said. “That’s what is going to put the tailwinds into the sail here. I think you’ll see a lot of interesting business developments. They won’t all move forward but it’ll be interesting. This is a big deal.”

Is Carbon Capture Viable?

Carbon capture and storage might be one of the best technologies for reducing emissions from certain polluting industries but there is substantial debate about which sectors those are. And just because it might be needed doesn’t mean it’s viable.

As of last year 27 carbon capture operations were running globally capable of preventing some 37 million metric tons of pollution according to the Global CCS Institute. Four more were under construction and another 102 in various stages of planning. Even if every one of those planned projects were completed all of the world’s carbon capture plants would prevent about 150 million metric tons of pollution annually or less than one-half of 1 percent of global CO2 emissions which amounted to about 36 billion tons last year.

Economics would suggest that the most cost-effective plants will be built first. Policy experts on the other hand want to focus on the most intractable sectors like cement that have few alternatives for cutting emissions. Houston’s industrial polluters by and large do not fit in either category.

Refineries are one of the largest sources of carbon emissions in the Houston region according to EPA data and they are among the most expensive to retrofit with carbon capture technology. They also hold a precarious position in the global transition away from fossil fuels. Declining demand would mean fewer refineries raising the question of why the nation would invest tens of billions of dollars to lower the emissions from facilities that might close soon.

“If we really think about what is the world that we need to make in order to achieve and stay at net-zero emissions within the next couple of decades I don’t really personally see a role for the ongoing dependence on fossil fuels at the kind of intensity that that would indicate” said Emily Grubert an associate professor of sustainable energy policy at Notre Dame who recently completed a year leading the Energy Department’s office of carbon management which conducts research into carbon capture. She added that while some diminishing volumes of oil and gas will likely be needed to produce materials or fuels for decades “for like bulk oil production and refining and transportation fuels in particular we are not going to succeed at decarbonization if that’s still a thing.”

The largest source of emissions around Houston in 2020 were coal- and gas-fired power plants. Grubert and many other experts say that because the costs of wind and solar generation have fallen so rapidly—and with the costs of battery storage now declining too—there is no compelling case for spending billions to retrofit these power plants rather than shutting them down. Building new wind and solar farms is simply cheaper and perhaps more reliable.

Utilities and the federal government have already spent many billions of dollars trying to launch commercial-scale carbon capture power plants. Only one was completed in the United States and it happens to be outside Houston—attached to a coal plant that was the second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the region in 2020 after Exxon’s Baytown refinery.

Five years ago NRG Energy began operating the Petra Nova carbon capture plant with nearly $200 million in Energy Department support and more in local tax breaks. By some measures the project was a success. It captured more than 90 percent of the carbon dioxide that passed through the system according to an Energy Department report.

But the project was designed to capture only a fraction of the coal plant’s emissions and according to the report it failed to reach its overall capture target because of numerous problems that arose including equipment outages and difficulties delivering the gas to its ultimate destination a nearby oil field. Ironically the project’s finances depended on using the captured CO2 to squeeze oil out of the ground and generate cash from the sales which helps explain Petra Nova’s largest failure.

In 2020 as oil prices crashed the project ceased capturing any carbon emissions. It hasn’t restarted since.

‘I Don’t Really Feel Like it’s Solving the Problem’

The Ship Channel has spawned an almost entirely industrial landscape. But just past the fence lines in many cases are the homes and schools of the area’s mostly Latino residents.

Valero’s Houston refinery for example borders two sides of the Manchester neighborhood. About 200 yards from the gate are a playground and community center. On the wall is a mural showing smiling children playing below industrial stacks topped with bright orange flames like a dystopian dream. One of the goals of the Houston hub effort is to keep refineries like Valero’s operating for decades albeit with new emissions-capturing equipment.

“With carbon capture I don’t really feel like it’s solving the problem” said Leticia Gutierrez the director of government relations and community outreach at Air Alliance Houston which campaigns for cleaning up the area’s air pollution.

To start capturing 50 million metric tons which is about one-third of the region’s industrial emissions might not deliver the climate benefits it would appear to.

Many of the projects including Exxon’s Baytown proposal and that of BP and Linde would convert natural gas into hydrogen while capturing CO2 emissions. The clean-burning hydrogen could replace natural gas used at the refineries and might fuel ships or heavy-duty trucks. Exxon has said the Baytown project could reduce the refinery’s emissions by “up to 30 percent” or about 3 million metric tons per year while also selling hydrogen to help others lower their emissions.

But academic research has shown that any benefits achieved by capturing CO2 can be offset by leaks of natural gas which consist primarily of methane a far more potent greenhouse gas. Even if these projects reduced carbon dioxide emissions they could increase methane emissions negating the larger goal.

Carbon capture equipment is also extremely energy-intensive. One utility in Wyoming for example said in regulatory filings that operating equipment at coal plants there would consume more than one-third of the plants’ electrical output a phenomenon known as “parasitic load.”

For the Petra Nova operation near Houston the company built a new natural gas turbine to power the carbon capture system which required nearly 15 percent as much electricity as was generated by the coal unit it was attached to. That natural gas turbine also sent its own carbon dioxide and all its other emissions straight into the air.

This power consumption raises one of the core arguments against the technology: If you power carbon capture systems with fossil fuels you generate additional pollution. If you power the systems with renewable energy you consume precious clean power that could be put to other uses. Either way you are effectively driving emissions higher at least somewhat in an elaborate attempt to reduce them. This hardly seems efficient.

For the people who live close to the industrial development however carbon dioxide is not the most important pollutant. The region’s refineries and chemical plants spew toxic chemicals like benzene which drive cancer risks far higher for workers and nearby residents. According to an analysis last year by ProPublica the greater Houston region has “the third-biggest hot spot of cancer-causing air in the country.”

Gutierrez grew up nearby and still lives in the area where she has raised three children. Her son developed asthma when he was a child she said and she found that his symptoms would clear when they would visit family in Mexico in the mountains outside Monterrey.

Gutierrez herself has developed headaches and rashes of which her family has no history she said. The companies have said the hub’s use of carbon capture and hydrogen fuel could reduce some air pollutants from the area’s power plants and trucks such as soot and sulfur oxides but it is unclear how it would reduce the emissions of toxic pollutants.

Exxon declined to answer detailed questions about the projects.

“People sometimes ask me why I don’t move” Gutierrez said while giving a tour of the area earlier this year. She stays because she loves her house she tells them and her community. Anyway she said she couldn’t afford to buy anything similar on Houston’s westside where the air is cleaner.

Few if any residents have heard of the hub proposal Gutierrez and other community advocates say but people in the communities around the Ship Channel are skeptical of any plan presented by Exxon or other corporations to clean up the industry. It is unclear whether they would welcome it. One thing for sure is that the companies haven’t come to ask.

The case was filed in the High Court on September 13 by attorneys Seenath Jairam SC Melinda Janki and Abiola Wong-Inniss.

A statement from the litigants said that the resort to the courts is to make sure that the company takes full financial responsibility in case of harm loss and damage to the environment. ExxonMobil’s local affiliate Esso has agreed in the permit to provide insurance and an unlimited parent company indemnity to cover all environmental loss and damage that might result from a well blowout oil spill or other failures in the Liza 1 Development Project in Guyana’s Stabroek Block.

Any “accident” in its operations will affect not only Guyana and Guyanese but most of the Caribbean countries and possibly beyond the region the statement noted. It added that Esso is registered off-shore and its financial position is unclear as it has been filing what it calls ‘branch’ accounts in Guyana. (In separate litigation a Guyanese citizen has asked the court to order Esso to comply with Guyana’s company law and file full accounts.)

Under the law of the land at the moment each company or corporation is a separate legal entity from its shareholders and creditors must look to the company/corporation to liquidate its liabilities parlous as its financial state may be and not to its billionaire shareholders.

“Communities in Guyana are taking lessons from major disasters like the BP Deep Water Horizon in 2010 which cost the company over 65 billion USD and destroyed the environment and livelihoods. Unlike the United States of America Guyana has no experience in oil and no oil/gas experts engineers and other necessary technical staff to run an oil sector.

Guyana also lacks the infrastructure to swiftly cap a well and mitigate the damage caused by a potential oil disaster. A World Bank project to build capacity has been downgraded to moderately unsatisfactory” the litigants said in their statement.

According to their fixed date application Collins and Whyte are asking the court for a declaration that the EPA as the sole authority competent under the Environmental Protection Act (EP-ACT) to enforce the provisions of the environmental permits issued to Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited (EEPGL).

They are asking the court for an order of mandamus directed at the EPA requiring it to immediately produce true copies of the insurance required under the environmental permit issued to EEPGL. They are requesting particularly a copy of the environmental liability insurance policies a summary of the environmental liability policies; evidence that the insurer is authorised to provide insurance in Guyana; evidence of authorisation of the institution or parent (insurers) to provide insurance under the conditions outlined in the permit; evidence of the insurers’ financial strength; and evidence that the insurer has a grade A+ rating assigned to it by the Better Business Bureau under the conditions set out in the permit.

Additionally the litigants are also asking the court to compel the EPA to hand over the true copies of the legally binding agreements set out in the permit. Those agreements include the unlimited financial undertaking by ExxonMobil Corporation the ultimate parent company of Esso to provide adequate financial resources for Esso to pay or satisfy its environmental obligations regarding the Stabroek Block including its liabilities under condition 14.1 of the permit for all costs associated with clean up restoration and damage caused by the discharge of any contaminant and its obligations to compensate all persons who suffer loss or damages.

They are also seeking to compel the EPA to tender the agreements with ExxonMobil Corporation which prove that it has taken unlimited indemnity as the parent company in addition to evidence of agreements to show that the parent company absorbs all responsibilities in the case of an environmental disaster.

Collins and Whyte are also asking the court to direct the EPA to “immediately file with the court true copies of the unlimited undertakings and indemnities required from the un-identified co-venturers under condition 14.10 of the permit; alternatively an order of mandamus directed to the agency requiring it to immediately cancel the permit in accordance with condition 14.8; and an order of prohibition directed to the agency prohibiting the agency from granting any environmental permit to Esso (or its successors and assigns) which does not include the provisions for financial assurance and liability for pollution damage.“

They also want a declaration that unlimited liability is imposed on the parent company for costs associated with clean-up restoration and compensation for pollution including the environmental obligations of the EPA and the state of Guyana.

They argue that the EPA has the legal obligation to cancel all permits issued to EEPGL if it has not met the requirements as set out in the document. They further submit that the EPA has breached its mandate by allowing EEPGL to operate without insurance as outlined in the permit.

The duo through their lawyers told the court “…the agency through its human minds including its officers has failed or omitted to carry out or to show that it has carried out its legal duties and or obligations thereby amounting to misfeasance in public office by them and by failing or omitting to act has acted unreasonably irregularly or improperly and or has abused its power.”

In his statement Collins said “I can’t even drive my car without insurance. So it is incomprehensible that the government would allow Esso to operate without any form of insurance. An oil spill would be devastating for our country and region as many Guyanese and Caribbean peoples depend on the Ocean for their livelihoods. That is why we have decided that the time has come to take matters to the court for relief.”

There are currently six cases in court regarding the operations of ExxonMobil’s affiliate Esso in Guyana.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vcGVyc2Vjb25kbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8yNC9yZXZlYWxlZC1ob3ctZXh4b25tb2JpbC1wYXJ0bmVycy1vdmVyc3BlbnQtMTM4Ym4taW4tZGVjYWRlcy1sb25nLWVuZXJneS1wcm9qZWN0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Revealed! How ExxonMobil partners overspent $138bn in decades-long energy projects,"Twenty-one of the projects accounted for 93 per cent of the overspend according to the analysis. The worst ended up costing more than six times an early estimate.

The $138bn overspend is a gross figure that includes partners’ stakes in the projects meaning Exxon that did not shoulder the costs alone.

Exxon spokesman Matt Furman said that the so-called Gate 2 early-stage estimates used as a comparison in the study were “rough sketches” and that the company’s share of the costs above the more important Gate 3 final investment decision amounted to $20bn during the period.

Of that total only $6bn was attributable to projects that Exxon operated representing a margin of error of 1.5 per cent compared with the total capital invested he said.

The entire energy industry suffered large cost overruns during the 2010s made worse by the 2014 oil price crash one of the worst in the history of the crude market. The Kashagan project in Kazakhstan funded by a group of major oil companies including Exxon went well over budget.

Costs at Gorgon an Australian gas operation run by Chevron and in which Exxon has a minority stake also spiralled. Other examples abound.

But the study’s findings are notable because of Exxon’s reputation for keeping a tight leash on spending and the sheer number of major projects in which the US company holds stakes.

It was in large part this widely perceived erosion in financial discipline that led to last year’s successful activist campaign by investor Engine No 1 to replace three directors on Exxon’s board.

And while the company has reported record profits this year during a surge in commodity prices it faces decisions in coming years on whether to proceed with new multibillion-dollar projects including a gas development in Mozambique and low-carbon investments.

“The point of the study was to look at how it’s possible to tighten up the rough sketches to get them closer to the numbers used for final investment decisions” Mr Furman said. “We did so that we don’t risk wasting time on projects that may never be funded.”

The study gives several examples of how costs soared without naming projects.

In one instance it was decided to shorten a length of a pipeline to cut costs but that ended up rerouting the pipeline through a “more challenging and sensitive location”.

Costs were ultimately higher than they would have been otherwise the report said.

Elsewhere it said “shortcuts were taken in engineering to save costs and resulted in poor quality and excessive cost in fabrication and construction”.

The study did not say whether it was Exxon or other operators who took these short cuts.

“There are a number of projects in this study in which we did not have a controlling interest” Mr Furman said.

“This means we do not have decision-making authority on the project or how money is spent. This includes any decision making that takes place before the project is funded or built and at any time during the project.”

The analysis identified so-called “runaway projects” — defined as those that exceeded early cost estimates by more than 70 per cent — and suggested that planners have “intentionally underestimated” the price tags of projects in critical early stages to win approval for them.

“This theory suggests human biases and behaviour contribute to over-optimistic outlooks” the study said without attributing the actions specifically to Exxon employees.

“Shortcuts can create false expectations and set a project up for failure.”

Exxon’s demanding culture can largely be traced back to former chief executive Lee Raymond who drove down costs and pursued new reserves especially in downturns during his tenure from 1993 to 2005.

The result was a peer-leading return on capital employed (ROCE) that led Exxon to the top of the S&P 500 Index. Despite the cost overruns Exxon’s ROCE “led the industry for nearly the entire period” Mr Furman said.

The 2020 study was part of regular internal reviews ordered up by Exxon management to improve on how the company develops oil gas and chemical projects. It was not the first time an internal report highlighted room for improvement in Exxon’s planning of major projects.

A 2015 study known internally as the Black and Blue report identified misaligned employee performance incentives a lack of communication between teams and undue pressure to meet deadlines as “hypotheses” for “inefficiencies” in its internal processes.

The company’s “go fast” culture meant “key processes’’ were skipped to stay on schedule according to a presentation of the 2015 study seen by Bloomberg.

“We routinely evaluate capital investments and how we can improve” Mr Furman said.

Darren Woods who took over as chief executive in 2017 after then president-elect Donald Trump chose Rex Tillerson as US secretary of state consolidated Exxon’s front-line business units and shifted the company’s focus to operating its own assets rather than taking stakes in outside projects.

He recently made a series of rare external appointments such as chief financial officer Kathy Mikells from Diageo and low-carbon vice president Dan Ammann who once led General Motors’s self-driving division.

Mr Woods is targeting a reduction in annual costs by $9bn by next year. The company has trimmed its workforce — mainly through layoffs and post-pandemic attrition — to the lowest level in at least two decades.

The 2020 analysis found that “multiple runaway projects” were the result of insufficient design and planning work.

“Some projects locked in to specific concepts too early without fully considering other better options” the analysis said.

The rising interest rates — the Federal Reserve upped them again Wednesday — had the legislative budget committee learning “the risk of a recession in the next 18 months” is 50% higher than in June.

That’s according to the economic forecast presented Thursday by the governor’s Office of State Planning and Budgeting. The usual suspects were blamed: fallout from the war in Ukraine ongoing inflation and the Fed tightening its monetary policy even as its chair Jerome H. Powell acknowledges that increasing rates “will also bring some pain to households and businesses.”

There’s always something new each week with the Colorado economy. And we’ll dive into how Coloradans are coping with higher prices below. But first let’s look at how rising mortgage rates are affecting the local housing market.

>> Read the Colorado Economic & Fiscal Outlook report

Colorado houses cost more … or less

If this were 2019 the for-sale housing market in Colorado would be considered booming. Sellers are getting about 40% more than what they would have if they had sold their house three years ago. And even with the market cooling this year the median price of a house sold in August was 10% higher than a year ago.

But higher interest rates did seem to affect potential buyers borrowing money to buy one. Interest rates for a 30-year-fixed loan were 6.62% on Friday up from 6.35% from a week earlier according to Mortgage News Daily. The Fed has raised rates five times this year or a total of three percentage points. That includes three consecutive months of three-quarter point increases a historically high increase for one meeting. In early June the same 30-year mortgage rate was 5.55%.

Bankers had adjusted rates because the increases were anticipated so rates didn’t go up the same percent overnight said Matt Leprino head of real estate brokerage Remingo in Denver.

“I wouldn’t expect that today it’s three-quarters of a point more expensive to buy a house than it was yesterday” Leprino said. “But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t affect buyer confidence.”

Buyers are no longer snapping up houses within 12 days of hitting the market in Denver. They’re waiting 21 days. They’re not paying more than the seller originally asked for. Take a look at the home sales for August between 2017 to 2022:

Leprino being a Realtor sees a bright side.

“I hate it when people say the market is crashing because what I always will respond is: ‘To whom?’” Leprino said. “It’s a great great opportunity. It’s better than it’s been in three years for buyers. Yes interest rates are higher and prices are not as low as they used to be. However people don’t have to pay above asking anymore and so it’s an opportunity for them to get in now. Yes interest rates are higher than they were. But again from a historic perspective five five and a quarter it’s a really good interest rate.”

According to data from the Colorado Association of Realtors the average seller is getting 99% of what they priced the house for compared with 102% a year ago in Denver and the state.

But median sales prices have also dipped each month this year since May according to the organization’s data. Between May and August the median sales price in Colorado fell 4.8% and 4.6% in Denver.

That’s the reverse of what happened in the past two years when prices rose or stayed flat between May and August. But normally Leprino said median prices do decline over the summer as families try to get their move done before school starts.

“It would be irresponsible of me to say (rising interest rates) had nothing to do with it and I’m sure it did to a certain extent” he said. “But looking at it from a historic perspective prices are always lower in August. … It’s just seasonality in our market.”

Gas prices switch gears and go up

Gas prices hit their above $5-a-gallon peak in June before starting to fall back down to something a little more palatable in July. They dropped below $4 a gallon in Colorado. Then someone noticed they were back up again this week ending a streak of declines “just short of 100 days” The New York Times reported.

AAA now has Colorado’s per-gallon prices at $3.753 for regular which is up 8 cents from last week. (Anyone get gas for under $3? I found a service station selling gas for $2.88 — in Greenwood Village no less!)

So what happened? AAA says unplanned maintenance work at refineries on the West Coast and Midwest are partly to blame. That aggravated a tight supply. However if supply returns gas prices could come down the organization said.

So long sub-$3 per gallon of gasoline. The low price was gone a day after filling up at the Shell station in Greenwood Village on Sept. 6 2022. (Tamara Chuang The Colorado Sun)

How Coloradans are coping with inflation

What’s Working asked readers how much does life cost you nowadays. And readers responded!

“Hamburgers at my favorite restaurant went up at least 30%” said one person who filled out What’s Working’s cost of living survey.

“M&M chocolate candies from $2.99 a bag to $3.99 a bag. That is ridiculous” said Terry from Fort Collins. (That’s also a 33% increase which is higher than the rate of inflation.)

“I used to be able to buy milk for around $2.49 now it’s over $3.00” said Debi from Denver.

“Bacon doubled in price all food items have gone up. Even candy has gone up. I can’t afford” wrote Diane Stone.

Notice the trend here? A lot of folks commented about the cost of food. And overall food took a hit if you were to look at the results from our completely unscientific survey taken by 53 people: 47% cut back on eating out and at the grocery store.

In August food prices were up 1% compared to last year according to the Consumer Price Index for Midwestern states which includes Colorado. For the year they’re up 12.9% the largest increase since February 1979 reported the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Some food categories that saw the largest increases compared to a year ago:

“Other” food at home which includes sugar sweets oils: up 19.3%

Cereal and bakery products: up 17.7%

Meat poultry fish and eggs: up 11%

Food away from home up 9.3%

“Getting fast food for my teenage daughter and I runs at least $20 now so I can definitely prepare a great meal and have leftovers for lunch for less than that” wrote Erin Hutchinson in Colorado Springs about how she’s dealing with higher prices.

A chunk of folks however said inflation doesn’t affect them. They noticed it — and most cited the rise in gas prices and food — but they didn’t cut back on what they normally buy. Their shopping patterns may have changed a bit.

One guy named Larry who hasn’t cut back said that however he started to “watch gas station prices when you drive by even when you don’t need gas.”

In its earnings report Thursday the company said it would once again increase rates. FedEx Express FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery rates will go up by an average of 6.9% while FedEx Freight rates will go up by 6.9%-7.9%.

The decision follows a news release from the company detailing preliminary earnings results that heavily underperformed by analysts' expectations. FedEx said declining global volumes and rising operating costs from inflation hit harder than expected and the company would pursue an aggressive cost-reduction plan in fiscal year 2023 to adjust operations.

Since 2012 FedEx package rates have usually increased by an average 4.9% annually. Following early effects of the pandemic that cost the company millions of dollars rates were raised by 5.9% for 2021 and again for 2022. Now rates are going up even more making it the highest rate increase in at least 10 years.

""We will monitor post-implementation stickiness"" FedEx's Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Officer Brie Carere said in the company's earnings call Thursday. ""But given the inflationary backdrop we thought this was the right increase for the year.""

With the new rates a 1-pound package shipped up to 150 miles via FedEx Express Standard Overnight will cost $33.87 compared to the previous $31.22.

A full guide to the new rates can be found in the document posted on the FedEx website.

Over the last three years United Parcel Service (UPS 0.64%) has produced a higher total return than the S&P 500 and the industrial sector. And even after its 4.5% decline on Friday in response to a bleak outlook from FedEx (FDX 1.40%) UPS stock is barely underperforming the market this year.

The issue is that UPS last reported earnings in late July. And if the industry is as bad as FedEx is making it out to be then there's a risk that UPS will cut its full-year guidance and report worse-than-expected results when it announces earnings in late October.

Here's why UPS remains a buy despite FedEx's warnings and why investors would do well not to assume that UPS will cut its guidance to the same degree as FedEx did.

The better bellwether

Despite not even cracking the top 100 S&P 500 stocks by market cap many investors still turn to FedEx for a reading on the broader economy. On Sept. 16 financial headlines focused on FedEx's pre-announcement and many fear that FedEx's guidance for lower package delivery volumes signals weaker consumer demand.

While FedEx accounts for a large share of U.S. package delivery volume it provides more of a premium service than the U.S. Postal Service Amazon or even UPS. Its main premium service is expedited shipping through FedEx Express.

In fiscal 2022 FedEx Ground only accounted for 36% of revenue and 42% of total operating income while FedEx Express made up nearly half of revenue and 47% of operating income. FedEx Express continues to be the company's differentiating factor.

The drawback of FedEx Express is that its performance can be relatively volatile benefiting when customer demand is good and the economy is growing and slipping when the company's customers are facing compressed margins and begin cutting back on expedited shipping.

Meanwhile UPS should be viewed as more of a bulk shipping service. In 2021 its U.S. domestic package revenue accounted for 64% of total revenue while U.S. domestic package delivery made up 55% of total adjusted operating profit.

UPS and FedEx operate sizable high-margin international and freight segments. But the main difference between the two is that FedEx focuses on speed and convenience while UPS leans into affordable solutions that cater to a mix of residential customers big companies and small and medium-size businesses. In sum UPS is a better bellwether as a package delivery company than FedEx is.

The better business

Although UPS could cut its guidance when it reports earnings in October the differences between FedEx and UPS mean that the two companies are not an apples-to-apples comparison. The nature of FedEx Express might lead you to believe that FedEx tends to sport higher margins than UPS. But the opposite is true.

Beginning about eight years ago UPS began to separate itself from FedEx consistently posting much higher operating margins. UPS' success with small and medium-size businesses the healthcare industry automotive and its ""better not bigger"" framework have led to improved routes and efficient operations and UPS now is much more profitable than FedEx. One of the best ways to understand the differences between UPS and FedEx is by looking at the 10-year changes in capital expenditures (capex) revenue and operating income.

You'll notice that FedEx routinely spends more on capex than UPS. In fact its trailing-12-month (TTM) capex is at a 10-year high while UPS' TTM capex is at a five-year low. Although UPS makes slightly more revenue than FedEx its TTM operating income is more than double that of FedEx proving the company is much better at converting similar sales into higher profits.

UPS is an excellent long-term buy

UPS has a market cap of around $154 billion compared to FedEx's $42 billion market cap after Friday's sell-off. Although FedEx looks cheaper UPS remains a better buy.

The company has done a superior job managing expectations and exceeding goals ahead of schedule. The profitability of its business not to mention its ability to register a higher operating margin while deploying less capex is a testament to why it is a better company to invest in than FedEx.

If FedEx turns itself around it could very well outperform UPS given the depressed levels in its stock price. But with UPS' 3.3% dividend yield a reasonable valuation and an impeccable management team investors would do well to take advantage of the dip in UPS stock."

(Courtesy photo)

PENDER COUNTY — A solar company that wanted to plant 2360 acres of panels in Pender County timberland was sent packing Monday.

A wide-ranging public hearing ended in an unanimous vote by county commissioners to reject a special-use permit for the development. Commissioners took issue with the size of the project its location in the midst of a large section of land used for agriculture and the impact it could have on flooding and water supply if leaching was an issue.

The project would have involved Coastal Pine Solar subsidiary of California-based Birch Creek buying up acreage from the middle of a 6587-acre wooded parcel north of Piney Woods Road and east of U.S. 421.

It was proposed on land in the county’s rural agricultural classification with farming use “highly encouraged.” Right now the land is owned by Evergreen Timber Co. and used for commercial timber management.

If approved the company would have spent nearly $300 million clearing the land and pneumatically driving enough solar panels into the ground to power 50000 homes on Duke Energy’s grid about 200 megawatts worth.

“I think we should make the distinction here that this is not a small acreage project” Pender County Commissioner Jackie Newton pointed out. Newton also lives adjacent to the property. “This is a utility-sized project that is proposed by a current non-land owner.”

Pender Planning Director Travis Henley told PCD the solar farm was easily the largest that has landed on his desk. Solar projects are permitted by right in the county’s two industrial districts but Henley said rural agricultural land is the only place with parcels large enough to place projects of this scale.

“Whether it’s two 25 or 2400 acres if it’s in [rural agriculture] it requires a special use permit” Henley said.

Duke draws power from eight solar facilities in Pender currently. Six are in the 5 megawatt range and two are larger. The Crooked Run solar development produces 70 megawatts and Innovative Solar 67 produces 34.

Before 2017 5 megawatt farms on about 30 acres of land were the norm but substantial enterprises are becoming the standard because the state’s largest utility company is looking for more efficient projects.

“People say why is it so large?” said Thomas Terrell a lawyer from Greensboro firm Fox Rothschild representing Coastal Pine Solar. “The answer is Duke Energy.”

Terrell recounted the N.C. General Assembly passed a law enabling Duke to use a competitive bidding process in 2017 to decide which projects it would purchase solar electricity from. Prior to the law if someone built a 5 megawatt farm Duke had to pay for the power it generated at a rate Duke spokesperson Randy Wheeless said was “pretty attractive.”

“That’s why you saw so many of them” he told PCD.

Roughly 7.5% of Duke’s grid is solar and it buys about 10 times more than it owns from third parties Wheeless said. There are over 700 solar farms in North Carolina with more than 40 owned by Duke; however the company has plans to build 55% of its own solar infrastructure in the future.

Wheeless pulled information on some projects that have won bids and found 20 30 and 40 megawatt farms across the state. Five megawatt farms are becoming a thing of the past and the reason is the economy of scale.

“To build 5 megawatts to get the labor to get the parts to get the racking the panels you’re just as well building a bigger one” he said.

Pender County is no stranger to big solar projects. A 672-acre farm with a $70-million price tag was built in the northern part of the county in 2019.

“This is not our first rodeo with a solar farm” Commissioner George Brown said. “I wasn’t sure where this was going to go in our county a few years ago when I experienced the first one.”

More than a half-dozen residents came out to speak against Coastal Pine. They echoed commissioner concerns about soil contamination flooding and the impact of clearing land.

The development team rebutted: It would have no environmental impact on the property; the land could return to timberland once the lifespan of the solar panels expire (any where from 25 to 40 years); it would boost tax revenue; and could benefit the soil by allowing it to lie fallow and build up nutrients in decades to come.

Wesley Wooten a farmer with property also adjacent to the proposed project pushed back on every point the Coastal Pine team made. He said notices about the project should have gone out to an area larger than 500 feet from the acreage and claimed solar farms are “terrible” for jobs and economic growth because employees do not stay after construction is complete.

Representatives for Coastal Pine did not present estimates on job creation during the hearing.

Wooten surmised the solar project could turn the massive acreage into a wasteland that cannot be farmed if concrete is left behind in the ground. He was speaking from experience first-hand explaining how he brought concrete to another site to reinforce panel installations because the developer did not realize how high the water table was.

The developers assured there would be no soil contamination. The piles the solar panels would be mounted on are made from galvanized steel coated in zinc to prevent corrosion with no concrete involved according to Tommy Cleveland a solar engineer hired by Coastal Pine who also used to work for N.C. State University.

Cleveland told the board the farm would have no negative impact on the land and “organic matter” in the soil increases over time on solar farms.

According to the attorney Terrell Coastal Pine would also comply with creating a decommissioning plan to remove the panels at the end of their service life expectancy of about 40 years.

Wooten also questioned whether the panels consisting of heavy metals would leach contaminants into the ground water if damaged and if their installation could cause flooding.

Terrell shot back asking for scientific evidence there could be leaching a risk to water supplies or any engineering calculations to support the idea there would be flooding.

The panels would stop drawing power if broken Cleveland added also noting the materials would not leak into the soil.

Commissioner Brown said later in the meeting when another solar farm approached the board years back he hoped to get people to speak to the commissioners about negatives of the farms like “leakage.”

“That never happened” Brown said. “In my opinion I think before we go any further with too many more solar farms in our county I would like to hear from experts on the other side of the fence.”

Though civil engineering on the site had not been complete the Coastal Pine team had to present competent material and substantial evidence to address concerns raised. Terrell said the developer met those requirements and therefore was “entitled” to the permit.

Commissioner Newton was clear she supported property rights as long as it did not cause adverse effect to the environment or harm to neighbors. Her main concerns were with tree loss and potential runoff.

“Clearcutting 2500 acres of timber plus is not going to be healthy” she said noting the county has an affiliation with the American Flood coalition in an effort to be more resilient.

The commissioner also was taken aback the developer had not considered the water table or the county’s well water.

Another resident Charles Rooks spoke in the meeting and characterized the project as “light industry.” Newton concurred saying the solar farm company did not belong in an agricultural district.

Hired by Coastal Pine planner Kara Drane with Colliers Engineering and Design intimated the project would be “harmonious” with the other property uses in the area and not produce noise emissions odor or traffic.

The county’s master development plan specifies its purpose is “to ensure that such development occurs in a manner that suits the characteristics of the land is harmonious with adjoining property is in substantial compliance with the goals and policies of the adopted Land Use Plan Unified Development Ordinance and is in the best interest of the general public.”

The team proposed Coastal Pine install permeable fencing so small wildlife could still graze the farm to which commissioner Newton asked how a seven-foot fence enclosing the entire 2360 acres was amicable with nature. Drane said the fencing would not be visible because of buffering around the project.

At the end of the hearing Terrell appealed to the commissioners as a farmer stating he understood “the emotion of farming.” He echoed Drane’s sentiments that the farm would be hidden from public view but reminded the only thing relevant to the board are its ordinance standards.

Commissioner Newton made a motion to deny the request. She cited the project was not of similar use to the agriculture listed in the district impaired adjoining districts due to the scale of clear-cutting and constituted a nuisance or hazard.

The board agreed unanimously.

“We don’t know what’s going to happen in 25 30 years and who’s going to be around to clean it up” Newton said.

Steel City Underground will pick an exceptional play of the game as a highlight each week of the Steelers 2022 regular season. Stay tuned as we hand-select the very best from the Black and Gold!

Fans of the Pittsburgh Steelers have been clamoring for better offense and increased usage of rookie wide receiver George Pickens. In Week 3 against the Cleveland Browns at FirstEnergy Stadium fans were rewarded.

Following the Browns’ first touchdown drive the Steelers were set up for first-and-ten at their 25-yard line due to the kickoff resulting in a touchback. Quarterback Mitchell Trubisky came to life in one of the best offensive series he’s run in the 2022-23 NFL regular season.

Trubisky completed two short passes – one to running back Jaylen Warren one to Diontae Johnson – in an up tempo paced offensive drive. Trubisky then handed the ball off to Warren for a seven-yard gain.

On second-and-three from the Pittsburgh 46-yard line Trubisky finally took the long shot fans have been begging to see.

Operating out of the shotgun Trubisky had Pickens streaking down the right sideline. Although the pass wasn’t precisely on target the rookie was able to make a backward-leaping twist of a one-handed catch in-bounds over the top of the defender for a 36-yard first down that grabbed everyone’s attention.

The play was one of the top highlights the Steelers have produced on offense through three weeks of play and set up the remainder of the touchdown drive.

With 52 seconds on the clock left in the first quarter Warren grabbed six yards on first down and then five more before time ran out.

On the Cleveland five-yard line Najee Harris was able to rumble into the end zone. Chris Boswell nailed the PAT. The game was then tied at 7-7.

The incredible Pickens catch was the best connection between the receiver and Trubisky on the night and the season. Hopefully the duo will continue to build trust with each other when they’re both on the field throughout the remainder of the season.

Gaudin Ford enabled electronic signatures so customers didn't need to visit the store to place an order. The dealership hired a website vendor to create a page allowing customers to order a vehicle without having to leave the website.

Gilligan said success with the new process would not have been possible without buy-in from employees. Gaudin Ford introduced a pay plan that offers a bonus to sales employees for each order taken. That's in addition to the regular commission they earn on the sale of a vehicle when a customer takes delivery sometimes months later. The goal of the incentive is to prevent employees from prioritizing customers who can close a deal the same day with a vehicle in stock Gilligan said.

One of the most critical changes has been giving dealership employees visibility into every order placed.

Gaudin Ford reworked its new-vehicle inventory manager position and moved its Internet manager into the new role giving her oversight into the retail ordering process Gilligan said. She created spreadsheets that track customer information and the status of an order then shared them with sales employees so they could communicate updates to their customers. This holds sales representatives accountable to stay in touch with their customers he added.

Ford has taken notice. The automaker says Gaudin Ford stands out in its 59-store Phoenix region which covers Arizona New Mexico and southern Nevada.

""Gaudin Ford was one of the first in the region to adopt a comprehensive strategy around retail orders has originated a number of best practices and consistently ranks 'near' the top of the region in retail order metrics including verified retail orders submitted and sales (volume and percentage) resulting from retail orders"" Ford spokeswoman Cathleen O'Hare told Automotive News via email.

Gaudin Ford had to change customer mindsets about the ordering process as many Americans are used to selecting a vehicle from hundreds on a dealership lot at any given time Gilligan said. One approach has been to send marketing messaging about ordering custom vehicles.

Dealership employees explain to customers that if they can wait to install some accessories such as a certain trailer hitch or bedliner they can get their keys faster he said. They talk to lease customers about ordering their next vehicle nine months ahead of when they are scheduled to turn in their current one. They pitch build-to-order if a customer can't find what he or she wants on the lot.

""This has absolutely transformed the way we do business"" Gilligan said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHhwbG9yZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLTA5LWZvcmQtZWxlY3RyaWMtcmVpbnZlbnRzLWhpc3RvcmljLW1pY2hpZ2FuLmh0bWzSAVFodHRwczovL3RlY2h4cGxvcmUuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMi0wOS1mb3JkLWVsZWN0cmljLXJlaW52ZW50cy1oaXN0b3JpYy1taWNoaWdhbi5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford's electric drive reinvents historic Michigan factory,"A cab is lowered on the frame of a battery-powered F-150 Lightning truck at Ford's Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn Michigan.

Construction crews are back at Dearborn remaking Ford's century-old industrial complex once again this time for a post-petroleum era that is finally beginning to feel possible.

The manufacturing operation's prime mission in recent times has been to assemble the best-selling F-150 a gasoline-powered vehicle.

The truck plant churns out a new pickup truck every 53 seconds in a well-oiled process that will continue for the foreseeable future.

But in September 2020 Ford broke ground on a smaller facility on neighboring land tasking the new operation with building a battery electric cousin to the internal combustion engine (ICE) F-150.

The F-150 Lightning is part of a growing fleet of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) hitting the roadways from established automakers and upstarts.

At the Detroit Auto Show last week President Joe Biden proclaimed that ""the great American Road Trip is going to be fully electrified.""

After racking up some 200000 reservations for the Lightning Ford has announced expansions to quadruple output over the next year.

Will there be a tipping point where the Lightning could overtake the ICE model? That is a question on the minds of officials at Ford and rival Detroit automakers that are investing billions of dollars in BEVs while still producing millions of ICE vehicles.

Chris Skaggs BEV Planning & Implementation Manager at Ford Motor Co. at their Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn Michigan.

""The industry is changing so quickly I don't think anybody has a good prediction of where it's going to be"" Ford's Chris Skaggs told AFP.

""But we are reacting and getting the right resources to build batteries and scaling so that we can meet demand whatever that is"" said Skaggs a veteran Ford operations manager who is leading the BEV plant expansion.

""I've been doing this for 29 years and I thought I would be retired before we even got to this point.""

Storied history

The Lightning marks the latest reinvention of the Dearborn Rouge industrial complex south of Detroit near the Rouge River.

The Rouge factory was built between 1917 and 1928 and originally planned to comprise all the components in car production including tire-making vehicle assembly steelmaking and engine building.

Peak employment topped 100000 in the 1930s a decade that also saw visits by artist Diego Rivera for his famed murals of auto workers.

The complex was enlisted to build fighter jet engines for the Allies' World War II before assembling such iconic Ford vehicles as the Thunderbird and the Mustang which was launched in the 1960s and is now assembled at a different Michigan factory.

A battery waits to be installed on the frame of an electric-powered F-150 Lightning truck.

The Rouge site—long emblematic of the moving assembly line that changed manufacturing history—began to look like a white elephant as Ford streamlined later in the twentieth century and pollution rendered it a brownfield site.

But William Clay Ford Jr. the great-grandson of Henry Ford refused to shutter it authorizing a $2 billion upgrade soon after becoming chairman in 1999.

Dearborn Truck plant opened in 2004 following extensive environmental cleanup and the installation of a ""living roof"" to make heating and cooling more efficient.

'Flex' capacity

The younger Ford who identified Rouge as ""our heritage"" faced pushback internally on the Dearborn investment which coincided with a trying period financially.

But it would be difficult to find fault with the staying power of the F-150 which has been the best-selling vehicle in the United States for four decades.

Three shifts populate the 4500-employee Dearborn truck assembly plant working around the clock.

The vehicle assembly process starts when the aluminum coils are stamped into panels on-site. The panels are assembled at the body shop and then painted before making their way to the assembly line.

Fuel powered F-150 trucks under production.

The truck then proceeds through hundreds of work stations where the engine and other components are installed and is then put through testing including wheels and headlamp alignment camera-based inspections and electronic computer once-overs before shipping to the customer.

Ford does not release daily output figures but each vehicle is assembled in hours once it arrives at the factory Skaggs said.

In contrast to the ICE truck factory which clanks with activity the BEV plant operates at a modest hum a quality partly due to the company's focus on ergonomics.

The BEV assembly process is also organized around production lines but there are fewer work stations in an operation that is still gearing up for bigger things. The Rouge Electric Vehicle Center currently employs about 500.

The expansion will double the size of the BEV factory and add more workers and work stations taking output to 150000 annually by next fall Skaggs said.

But the added productivity will be ""flex"" Skaggs said meaning it could be used for either ICE or BEV depending on demand.

It's been 114 years since Henry Ford turned out what is considered the first affordable automobile and the Model T remains a historic treasure in Ford Motor Co.'s story. To celebrate Model T lovers and enthusiasts gathered Sunday at the Ford Piquette Avenue Museum in Detroit for an afternoon of free Model T rides food trucks other vendors and a chance to tour the museum. The celebration took place during the last day of the North America International Auto Show at Huntington Place several miles south in downtown Detroit.

A happy birthday sign hung high over a craft area designated for kids. The craft of the day was a recycled piece of cardboard toilet paper roll decorative tape and wooden wheels to create a car model.

The smell of chili filled the air from Great Lakes Dawg House a mobile food stand that offered hot dogs that you could fix up with chili relish onions or whatever your taste buds desired. Six feet away ""partygoers"" could get a ""Drunken Lamb"" sandwich from Belly It a unique sandwich casual food truck. The Drunken Lamb sandwich consisted of Hennesy marinated lamb chops with toppings that included iceberg lettuce tomatoes feta sauce and pepper relish served on a pita. If those sandwiches didn't appease your appetite then you could head over to The Best Damn Salad for a healthier option of salads that featured shrimp veggies catfish and other options to choose from.

The only thing missing was birthday hats and of course a birthday cake but viewing the intricateness and uniqueness of the Model T was the best party favor as guest could get.

Grandson of an original Piquette Plant engineer

Bruce Balough of Canton Ohio delivered a now restored 1908 Model SR Roadster to the Piquette Plant in honor of his grandfather Charles Balough who he said was a part of the original Model T engineering team.

Grandpa Balough began working for Ford in 1906 and helped do drawings for the Model S series and then features on the Model T. His grandson found the 1908 Model SR at a swap meet in Pennsylvania and spent five years restoring it. Bruce Balough called it a fun time being able to work on something that his grandpa was a part of despite never meeting his grandpa before his death. He said he learned about his grandfather's life through his grandmother.

""He came to the U.S. in 1903 he had $9 in his pocket and all he could say in English was buttered toast"" Bruce Balough said with a chuckle. "" But he spoke read and wrote Hungarian German Romanian and French and finished his college degree when he was 19 years old. He was a smart man.""

While his grandfather didn't stay too long in Michigan and eventually moved to Ohio. The legacy of the Model T and factory still matters to the grandson.

""It's nice that people have taken the time to save this factory because it has such an important part of history"" Balough said. ""And the fact that there's so many people here that are so passionate and what they do.""

This is not the first time Balough has made an appearance at the museum but he definitely felt he needed to be there today — ""my grandfather was there for the birth of the Model T. I need to be there too."" The museum will be storing his car for the winter.

Riding in a Model T

The Model T ride is a little bumpy now with all those Michigan potholes but it's also a light ride.

Mike Skinner who drove a 1914 Model T Touring and was among those providing rides says that the Model T was revolutionary.

""Well they're the car that put the world on wheels when they came out in 1908"" Skinner said. He said it had a planetary transmission and a strong but lightweight vanadium steel chassis with an eight-inch clearance that could go just about anywhere.

Skinner said what really made the car special was the price tag. In 1909 a Model T cost about $850 according to the Detroit Historical Society. The cars were originally assembled by hand but as demand grew production shifted to a plant in Highland Park which was considered the birthplace of the moving assembly line.

As far as what a Model T may be in today's society Skinner has an idea.

""It would be lightweight and would be inexpensive"" he said. "" It would probably be pretty elementary of course now you have to have backup cameras and safety features but it still would be an automobile that most people or everyone could afford.""

Mother and daughter duo Elaine Waldbott and Catherine Waldbott came back for another day of touring the museum and riding in the Model Ts Sunday after previously visiting the museum on Saturday.

""Oh it was so much fun"" Catherine said. ""It was like taking a ride at the amusement park it was very bouncy.""

Catherine was born and raised in Detroit and felt that seeing the Model T was a must.

""Beautiful seeing what it was like for people back in back in the day when they drove their cars and to experience it"" she said.

A history lesson at the Piquette Museum

As some enjoyed the outdoor activities and soaked in the coolness coming from the fall air others headed inside for warmth and to explore the museum.

For the $17 admission price for adults guests could tour the Piquette Museum and learn about Henry Ford and his team's process of creating the Model T.

With two floors of artifacts to show docent Jerry Porter started guests with a history lesson on Ford's office. An average-sized room where guests could peek in and compare it to a photo that was taken by Ford in the office. The office space features a setup with Ford's desk covered in drawings the camera still planted in the corner and a white coat sitting still on a coat rack.

On display you can view one of the oldest Model Ts assembled in the Piquette Plant. It's the 1909 Model T Touring a reddish but not too red hue with big white tires on red wheels. Brass metals and vanadium steel were new materials with this innovation. It weighed in at only 1200 pounds compared to cars today that average around 3000 pounds.

This model was deemed stronger and lighter than the ones before with a 22 horsepower engine. Getting familiar with roads this version also offered flexible three-point suspension for rough terrain.

Vehicles made at the Piquette Plant featured a Ford logo with wings.

After guests awed over the Models A through T Porter took them to the second floor of the museum for a more inside look at the rise of the Model T.

Ford had a ""Secret Experiment Room"" which it's deemed as the birthplace of the Model T. Sketches on a blackboard a rocking chair and different types of engines sat on display.

Guests were also able to learn about members of Ford's team and how he came up with the idea of the Model T.

Step 1: Select a skilled team that crew included Edward Huff ""Spider"" a self-taught electrical engineer who was just 28 years old in 1907. For the Model T Huff worked on designing the flywheel magneto and ignition coils he was an independent worker not a Ford employee.

Step 7: Introduce the new car on March 19 1908 Henry Ford announced to dealers the Model T was coming. So many people were interested in the new lightweight inexpensive easy to drive easy to repair performative car on bad roads that the company became flooded with orders. The car officially went into production on September 27 1908.

The museum also features variations of the Model T from a 1921 Model T Chemical Fire Truck to a 1925 Model T which was converted into a pickup truck. Farmers wanted Model Ts businesses began to use them and they became a staple in American culture.

Jalana Alonoz-Ginyard a former Detroiter and now a teacher at Detroit Enterprise Academy showed up to the event after hearing about it on WDET.FM.

""They were talking about the anniversary of the Model T and I said I'm gonna come check it out because I've never been here before been to Piquette Street been in this area but never been here"" Ginyard said.

She also says that she learned a lot about the Model T cars on her tour of the museum.

""I didn't know so many different models were built and I certainly didn't know all of the steps and what it took"" she said. ""And the prices of the car was a lot different it was cheap but yet expensive for that time.""

As a teacher she wished more of her students knew about this history.

""I teach second grade and it would be nice if my students could come or even some of the older students from my school because they don't really know about car history"" she said. ""This is really interesting.""

The museum is open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday year-round. Tickets for adults are $17 students and youth tickets are $10 and children under the age of 4 can get in free."

Homa's four-ball match with partner Billy Horschel During Day 2 at Quail Hollow came down to the last hole against the Canadian pairing of Corey Conners and Taylor Pendrith.

The Americans entered the par-4 18th with a 1-up lead and just needed to tie the hole to secure a whole point in the match. Pendrith made birdie for the Internationals so after Horschel made par it was up to Homa to drain his putt to win the match - and the Presidents Cup rookie came through.

""When we talk about things money can't buy money cannot buy that feeling (on the 18th green) and that was something that I will remember forever and I will tell anybody who ever wants to hear how that felt"" Homa said after his round according to CBS Sports' Kyle Porter.

Homa was a captain's pick of Davis Love III this year and after winning the Fortinet Championship in California last week Homa admitted to having a chip on his shoulder for being told he was only chosen as a result of LIV players leaving the TOUR.

Homa is now 2-0-0 in his matches this week at Quail Hollow.",,,,,,,,,,,,

An Indiana teenager has achieved something no other student in the world achieved this spring: a perfect score on the Advanced Placement Calculus AB exam.

Felix Zhang is a junior at Penn High School in Mishawaka Indiana.

The Penn-Harris-Madison School Corporation said that the College Board which administers the AP exams told the school's principal that Zhang achieved a perfect ""5"" rating and was the only student in the world to earn every possible point on the AP Calculus AB exam. In other words he achieved a 108 out of 108.

""This outstanding accomplishment is likely a direct reflection of the top-quality education being offered at Penn High School"" Head of the Advanced Placement Program Trevor Packer said in a news release. ""We applaud Felix's hard work and the AP teacher responsible for engaging students and enabling them to excel in a college-level course.""

Zhang recently held a news conference about his achievement. He took the test in the spring of 2022 along with 270000 students worldwide.

""I felt pretty confident knowing that I knew what to do on the test but there was always a chance I would make a small error or something"" he said. ""So I wasn't really expecting to see a perfect score. And that was pretty surprising to me because I felt like there's a lot of other people out there who probably perform very well on this test and I'm pretty surprised that no one else got a perfect score.""

Zhang is currently studying AP Calculus CB.

""The teachers in Penn-Harris-Madison School Corporation are some of the best in the state of Indiana"" Superintendent Dr. Jerry Thacker said. ""Their incredible dedication and commitment to academic excellence and making sure every single student reaches their highest potential is nothing short of extraordinary; and they do this every day across our district in all 15 schools. Felix Zhang and teacher Mrs. Denise White are just one of the many examples of great student/teacher relationships that result in phenomenal achievements for our students. It exemplifies our ‘Triangle of Success’—connecting students teachers and parents!""

AP exams are used to help students gain entry into colleges along with scholarships and other financial aid. Colleges and universities around the world receive AP® scores for college.

Mostly because my list of non-Apple things is growing right now and there’s lots of other cool stuff to get to. However after I published the video I’ve seen some questions on the lack of Apple’s ascent rate warnings and safety stops. So I figured I’d quickly cover that here merely as somewhere to link to.

First though in case you haven’t watched the video – you should. Especially if you’re into geeky things (that’s why you’re here right?). For those long-term readings you’ll remember nearly a decade ago I had a depth testing chamber made which allows me to simulate various depths – including creating entire second-by-second dive profiles. I can literally re-create any dive profile I want and have the machine control it to the second emulating the dive. It’s super cool. I go into the entire backstory of this in the last 3 minutes or so of the video (literally titled “Story Time”).

However before we get there I explain that basically the Apple Watch Ultra is a certified dive device and that it has two levels of ‘design’. The first is the hardware design which is certified to 100m in depth. And then the second is their software app which is designed for usage to 40m (131ft) of depth. That native app is called…umm…Depth. And it essentially aims to show your current well…depth (and duration/water temp). But that’s it.

But Apple made a big deal in the keynote about their partnership with Huish Outdoors and their upcoming app called the Oceanic+ app. That app (which costs $79/year) has all the dive-related functions you’d find in a normal dive computer. Things like dive planning water type ascent warnings safety stops mixed gas options etc… That app isn’t available today and is slated for sometime this fall.

Now in the keynote they briefly showed some app data pages but it was slim pickings. However if you found the right person over in the hands-on area at the post-keynote tables there was a guy that was demoing the app. I got a long-form hands-on demo but it wasn’t entirely the focus on my time there. So while that was cool (there’s some tidbits in my original Apple Watch Ultra video) what’s more useful is this nifty chart that I was sent which shows a slate of screenshots from the Oceanic+ app including things like ascent warnings etc…

And then this all pairs with the Oceanic+ phone app which has a dive log including showing the entry/exit GPS points on the map and the full details of the dive (plus pre-dive planning).

Of course all of this would make for a super interesting comparison to the Garmin Descent G1 ($649) which has been sitting in my long-term testing queue for many months. I’ve got a number of dives in on it and a boatload of non-dive stuff as well. Basically the Descent G1 is an Instinct 2 Solar but with all the dive stuff of Garmin’s higher-end Descent MK2 series ($1299). The core dive-specific difference is it lacks air integration (which then requires the $1499 version of the MK2 plus Air Integration module for another $400). Below the Descent G1.

Price-wise the Descent G1 is cheaper than the Apple Watch Ultra ($799) and of course has all the native dive stuff built-in whereas the Ultra would at present require the $79/year subscription for the Oceanic+ app. Obviously there’s a gazillion other differences between the two watches.

Anyways that’s getting off on a tangent but a few of you have asked my thoughts there as well. Certainly there’s many reasons why someone would choose Garmin vs Apple or vice versa beyond just diving. And until the Oceanic+ app releases it’s hard to know how exactly those two feature sets compare.

With that hope you found the video interesting – and get ready for yet more busy weeks. Definitely a fun time of year!

Garmin (GRMN -0.22%) stock has had a rough 2022 already and shares caught additional pressure recently thanks to news out of Apple (AAPL -0.69%). The consumer tech giant already competes against some of Garmin's popular smartwatch devices but that competition is hitting a new level.

Apple announced a new addition to its smartwatch lineup that's aimed at sports enthusiasts and includes many of the navigation features that have been a staple of Garmin products like its tactix adventure watch.

Is Garmin doomed to lose market share now that Apple is targeting this niche? Let's take a closer look.

Carving out a niche

Garmin has already been bumping up against Apple and other competitors in the wearables space and it has done well despite these challenges. Sure sales are down in 2022 -- especially in Garmin's fitness and cycling products -- after surging last year. But the company has a wide range of popular devices ranging from affordable fitness trackers to high-end scuba diving watches.

Sales in its fitness segment jumped 16% in fiscal 2021. And the outdoor division home to Garmin's more adventure-focused smartwatches was up 14%. That success is a good indication that the company won't be crushed by Apple's entrance into the high-end portion of the adventure watch market.

Wider portfolio

Garmin also has a deep portfolio that would allow it to continue growing even if Apple dominates in this new rivalry. It sells boating and aviation GPS platforms and its auto navigation segment is also making a run toward $1 billion in annual sales.

The adventure watch unit is one of five major revenue streams for the device maker which grew its overall business in each of the last five fiscal years despite temporary slumps in areas like fitness trackers. It's likely that Garmin will continue to benefit from this diversity through any new Apple competition.

Looking ahead

The more immediate concern for investors is how Garmin will weather the next few quarters that are likely to bring falling sales and declining profit margins. There was ample evidence of these trends in the last earnings report. Revenue fell 6% in the quarter that ended in late June as operating profit margin fell to 24% of sales from 28% a year ago .

Executives at the time lowered their full-year outlook to target $5 billion in sales compared to the $5.5 billion they had predicted a few months earlier. Garmin could reduce that forecast again in its next update if consumers continue to push spending away from categories that had been popular in earlier phases of the pandemic.

Still the overall sales footprint is likely to rise for a seventh straight year in 2022 despite the extra competition from Apple. That track record is a clear sign that Garmin has endurable competitive advantages across several GPS device categories.

Instead of looking at the Apple move as a negative for the stock shareholders should see it as confirmation that the adventure watch category has a large global appeal. Both companies can succeed in that kind of environment and the rivalry should benefit consumers and the wider tech industry too.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGVzcGxpdC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMzIwODEwL3RlYW0tc3dlZXBzLWNsb3NlLWZpbmlzaGVzLWhpZ2hsaWdodC1nYXJtaW4tbXMtdGV4YXMtaW52aXRl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Team Sweeps Close Finishes Highlight Garmin MS Texas Invite,"

DENTON TEXAS -- As Bentonville High School (AR) senior James American Horse found himself stride-for-stride with Wolfe City's (TX) Caden Thurman down the final 100-meter grass straightaway in the elite boys race at the Garmin MileSplit TX XC Invitational the Arkansas talent knew he couldn't settle for second.

He and his teammates didn't take a draining six-hour bus ride to Denton to come away empty-handed.

""We traveled so far to come here"" American Horse said after the race. ""If I'm already up there with (Thurman) just might as well try and get it done. It ended up working.""

The two seniors bolted to the line to the delight of cheering spectators gathered by the finish at South Lakes Park and it was American Horse who crucially dipped at the timing pad to take the elite race win in 15:32.00 just a tenth of a second ahead of Thurman in 15:32.10.

That not only earned American Horse an individual title but it made for his first-ever sub-16:00 5k performance and boosted Bentonville to a dominant team win with a low 60 total points.

That team title win comes with a lot of weight as well as Bentonville upset Arkansas' top-ranked Fayetteville team who also made the trip across state lines and finished fourth.

Beyond the show-stopping battle between American Horse and Thurman impressive team showings from Bentonville and dominant individual performances made for some of the top highlights in Denton on an action-packed Saturday morning.

The sun had barely begun to rise at South Lakes Park at 7 a.m. when the first start gun promptly went off but athletes from Texas Arkansas and Louisiana took to the start line at the Garmin MileSplit TX XC Invitational more than awake and ready to compete.

The elite boys race may have produced the most exciting finish of the morning but a dominant front-running performance from Georgetown (TX) senior McKenzie Bailey kicked off meet action and she came into the varsity elite girls race looking to have fun.

Bailey the top seed entered in the race surged to the lead from the gun and it was her and Plano West (TX) senior Haley Harper who pulled away from the field early. But just a mile in Bailey opened a significant gap on Harper that never ceased as she raced her way to a win in 17:56.20.

""I think that's just been my goal in most of the races lately is just enjoy it"" said Bailey following her win.

Harper who has had a breakout fall as a senior in her first season dedicated solely to distance training came in solidly behind Bailey for second in 18:17.60.

But Bailey wasn't shy to make her joyous attitude known as she weaved through South Lakes Park. With the mantra ""Have a good race"" written in Sharpie on her back Bailey grinned as she passed cheering spectators en route to her win.

And on the team side Bentonville didn't come to Texas to mess around. Led by junior Haley Loewe running 18:44.10 for third the team from Arkansas got their program's team winning streak started by scoring 73 points for the team title ahead of strong Texas teams in Northwest Nelson with 104 and a Bailey-led Georgetown with 167 points.

Over 1800 athletes and 75 teams took to the South Lakes Course on Saturday morning and between the American Horse-Thurman battle Bentonville dominance and Bailey's confident racing it made for quite the spectacle to highlight Saturday's Garmin MileSplit TX XC Invitational action.

The Index BPM Smart Blood Pressure Monitor is available now in the US for $149.99 integrating measurements such as systolic and diastolic blood pressure into the Garmin Connect app.

It doesn't appear as if these metrics will talk with one another just yet - so for example this won't be integrated into your Garmin watch and affect features like Training Readiness.

However it is a great development for those who are already embedded in the Garmin ecosystem and those who don't want to wait for the company to release a blood pressure feature for its wearables.

In terms of the actual smarts users can set reminders to take their blood pressure with reports also automatically compiled into seven-day four-week or year-long summaries that can be saved as PDFs.

And in a similar way to Garmin's Index S2 smart scale multiple users can also take advantage of the device; up to 16 people can use the Index BPM to track their readings and sync to their individual Garmin Connect accounts.

It's adjustable too fitting arm sizes of 9 - 17 inches in circumference and has a battery life of nine months Garmin says from four AAA batteries.

Currently the Index BPM is FDA-cleared which means that Garmin has been able to demonstrate the device is ""substantially equivalent to another legally marketed device"" that has clearance or approval.

In this case an example of a similar product would be the Withings BPM Connect.

However this is different from full FDA approval which is only granted when the agency decides a product has benefits that outweigh the known risks.

It's unlikely that full approval will come to the Index BPM of course and the device itself doesn't offer anything groundbreaking in terms of features but it does feel like a necessary step for the company to take as it progresses deeper into health monitoring.

In a way we're surprised it took Garmin this long - and it may still take a while for the Index BPM to hit other territories - but we look forward to testing one out in the near future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGVzcGxpdC5jb20vdmlkZW9zLzU4MTMwNi93b29kbGFuZHMtZW5qb3ktb3Blbi13aW4tYm9uZGluZy1hcy1hLXRlYW3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Woodlands Enjoy Open Win Bonding As A Team | Garmin MileSplit TX XC Invitational,"Folders

Gartner took first in 15:22.8 and finished a comfortable 14 seconds ahead of runner-up Ryan Connolly of North Andover (15:37.0).

That was exactly how he wanted it.

WRENTHAM — Henry Gartner was mired in a crowded lead pack during the early portion of the MSTCA Frank Kelley Invitational’s Championship Boys’ 5K. The Falmouth senior was still only fourth at the 3K mark.

The race plan could not have gone any better for Gartner.

“It feels awesome” he said. “First race of my senior year; it’s a great way to start it off . . . I felt like I had more [left] which is great for my next couple of races.”

Gartner wanted to hang back among the leaders through the first mile as long as he kept pace. When he clocked in a sub-five-minute mile and still felt good he knew his legs could power him the rest of the way.

“You can’t win [the race] in the first mile but you can lose it” he said.

Coach Conor Markham said he and Gartner had been working on this strategy. He was impressed that Gartner took it to victory — but not surprised.

“If you saw the work that he puts in — this should happen” said Markham.

Veteran poise also proved superior in the earlier girls’ championship 5K. Brookline senior Camille Jordan went head-to-head with Cambridge sophomore Aoife Shovlin for most of the race and were deadlocked at the 3K mark. But Jordan had just enough extra in the tank winning in 18:19.7 with Shovlin (18:22.5) close behind.

“Towards the end I was kind of deciding whether or not I should hold back and see what I could do towards the finish or if I should just take the lead” said Jordan. “But I decided to kind of stay with her and let her get a little ahead so I could have a good finish.”

Jordan’s clocking left her prior PR in the dust by more than 90 seconds. Both she and coach Mike DeYoung credited a massive summer leap for building positive momentum for the fall.

“It felt really good” Jordan said. “I think I did a good job of training over the summer and just regaining my confidence in cross-country because normally I’m used to running track as my primary sport.”

Brookline also dominated in team scoring with just 37 points. The Warriors placed four runners in the top 11 finishers. For DeYoung the Frank Kelley was a quality first test for a team that should be a Division 1 front-runner.

“I would say people were about where I thought that they were given workouts and the work they did over the summer — maybe a little bit faster” he said. “But I know they’re a really talented group and super hard-working. They all ran over the summer [and] really dedicated themselves this summer to being the best they can be and I think that’s what you’re seeing.”

It was a tight field of runners at the start of the varsity girls' championship 5K. But Brookline senior Camille Jordan eventually gained separation to win the race. MARK STOCKWELL FOR THE BOSTON GLOBE

“It’s really rewarding” said coach Scott Hafferkamp. “I see it every day how hard they work. I’m glad to see it paying off.”

Now in his eighth season Hafferkamp said his team had this meet circled on the calendar.

“It was our first true test to see where we’re at” said Hafferkamp. “They went out there and executed.”

Rounding out the team scoring was Austin Desisto (16:26.6) Dan Ottesen (16:48.9) Nathan Dubay (16.52.9) Davis Haines (16:57.6) and Owen Schultz (17:17.3). On the girls’ side Westford’s Emily Wadlake was second in the freshman race completing the 4K in 15:41.

The Guinness World Records announced that Cena has already granted 650 wishes through Make-A-Wish -- while no one else has awarded more than 200 wishes.

Cena has reportedly become the most requested celebrity to grant wishes through the foundation after starting his professional wrestling career in 1999 and becoming a 16-time world champion in the WWE.

He was often a crowd-favorite character becoming the face of WWE’s “Be a Star” anti-bullying campaign while taking his career to Hollywood.

Cena granted his first wish through Make-A-Wish in 2002 and in 2012 he participated in Make-A-Wish’s 1000th wish to a fan named Cardon.

“There is no more humbling experience than a child who could ask for anything in the world asking to meet me” Cena said while Make-A-Wish celebrated his 500th wish. “It is inspiring to see the impact that granting wishes can have and I look forward to granting 500 more.”

The Make-A-Wish Foundation is a nonprofit organization that helps fulfill the wishes of children diagnosed with critical illnesses. Children between the ages of 2 and 18 can choose to meet a celebrity attend an event or give a gift to someone.

Since their creation AI systems have come a long way and are now able to combine complex data sets and computer science to mimic human problem-solving and decision-making abilities. AI also has a variety of real-world applications ranging from customer-service automation to optimising service-operations or product features.

AI adoption continues to grow. According to a McKinsey survey1 of the more than 1800 organisations consulted 56% had adopted AI in 2021 – compared to 50% in 2020. The survey also found the number of respondents attributing at least 5% of earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to AI had risen to 27% from 22% the year before.

A similar study by Gartner in 2022 also recognised the growing applications of AI in business.2 It found that 40% of surveyed organisations had deployed thousands of AI models and predicted that the business value of AI would reach $5.1bn by 2025.

However as the use of AI in business continues to grow responsible AI practices will be paramount to maintaining this growth and contending with the potential ethical and socio-technical repercussions of AI.

As a global asset manager with extensive investments in the technology sector we believe we can have a positive role in encouraging Responsible AI. Our research therefore seeks to define the principles behind this and understand how they may be put into practice in the long-term.

AI opportunities and risks

With the real value that businesses can gain from AI systems they represent potential opportunities to generate returns for clients. AI is notably the bedrock of the metaverse and will enable its scalability and automation3 – with deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) enhancing activities and interactions in the Web 3.0.4

We believe that together AI and the metaverse could drive an expanding and tangible investment opportunity fuelled by companies with the potential to deliver strong year-on-year growth over the next decade.

From an environmental social and governance (ESG) standpoint5 AI should allow investors to collect and analyse information on risks and opportunities at an unprecedented scale. In particular we see great potential in using sentiment analysis algorithms and NLP solutions to better integrate ESG considerations into investment strategies.6

At AXA IM we have developed our own NLP-enabled impact investing technique which scores parts of corporate documents to help assess how companies can support the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Separately another study has shown that AI may be a net contributor to achieving the 169 more detailed targets within the 17 broad SDGs.7 Potential examples include a technology that better identifies recyclable material to reduce ocean-bound plastic or a platform that uses satellite data and AI to reduce water waste.

However alongside the opportunities and potential applications AI systems can offer they also bring destructive risks – the most visible being privacy violations and cybersecurity breaches which can quickly damage a company’s reputation.

AI also carries societal and human rights-related risks which though harder to define and measure are arguably the most salient.8 Most notably AI systems can be a source of discrimination. When used in financial services ‘network discrimination’ can disadvantage certain communities from securing loans; when used in recruitment AI can reproduce existing patterns of social bias.

Even when used for content moderation automated content flagging can infringe upon rights to free expression and opinion – not to mention the legal and ethical concerns raised by the ability to identify and track individuals with AI.

Regulation: A nascent environment

Given the significant risks associated with AI adoption we are witnessing the emergence of a new regulatory landscape. The European Union (EU) is in the process of drafting AI regulation that echoes the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)9 and which aims to address the risks associated with specific uses of AI while bolstering trust within the AI systems being used.10

EU risk categories for AI systems

McKinsey & Co. What the draft European Union AI regulations mean for business 2021: Relevance of AI risks for companies

This draft regulation would no longer permit the use of unacceptable-risk systems within the EU; subject high-risk systems to various requirements including human oversight transparency cybersecurity risk management data quality monitoring and mandatory reporting; and it would require transparency within the use of limited and minimal-risk systems so individuals are aware that they are interacting with AI technologies.

The regulation would not only apply to companies and AI providers within the EU but would have extraterritorial jurisdiction over any AI system providing output within the EU. Companies in breach could also face penalties of up to €30m or 6% of their global revenue – whichever is higher – making fines more substantial than those imposed by the GDPR.

As governments and regulators across the globe increasingly consider the governance and regulation of AI we believe the risks could become very material for companies from a legal and financial perspective.

Responsible approaches to AI

Beyond regulation the European Commission has produced Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI11 which can serve as a useful framework for companies to implement Responsible AI practices. These guidelines seek to support AI that is lawful ethical and robust in the face of their potential harm.

They are built around four ethical principles which bring concrete requirements for companies:

Respect for human autonomy : Ensuring respect for the freedom and autonomy of human beings; the allocation of functions between humans and AI systems follows human-centric design principles and leaves meaningful opportunity for human choice; human oversight over work processes in AI systems is maintained

: Ensuring respect for the freedom and autonomy of human beings; the allocation of functions between humans and AI systems follows human-centric design principles and leaves meaningful opportunity for human choice; human oversight over work processes in AI systems is maintained Prevention of harm : AI systems should neither cause nor exacerbate harm or otherwise adversely affect human beings; attention must also be paid to situations where AI systems could cause or exacerbate adverse impacts due to asymmetries of power or information; human dignity as well as mental and physical integrity is protected

: AI systems should neither cause nor exacerbate harm or otherwise adversely affect human beings; attention must also be paid to situations where AI systems could cause or exacerbate adverse impacts due to asymmetries of power or information; human dignity as well as mental and physical integrity is protected Fairness : Ensuring equal and just distribution of benefits and costs and that individuals and groups are free from unfair bias discrimination and stigmatisation; the use of AI systems does not lead to people being deceived or unjustifiably impaired in their freedom of choice; the ability to contest and seek effective redress against decisions made by AI systems and by the humans operating them is preserved

: Ensuring equal and just distribution of benefits and costs and that individuals and groups are free from unfair bias discrimination and stigmatisation; the use of AI systems does not lead to people being deceived or unjustifiably impaired in their freedom of choice; the ability to contest and seek effective redress against decisions made by AI systems and by the humans operating them is preserved Explicability: Processes should be transparent the capabilities and purpose of AI systems openly communicated and decisions explainable to those directly and indirectly affected; “black box” algorithms are avoided

At AXA IM our approach to Responsible AI draws on a similar structure and requires four clear components. We believe corporate AI systems should be fair ethical and transparent while remaining reliant on human oversight – both from a technical and high-level governance perspective.

We think that companies will be able to mitigate AI risks and deliver sustainable value creation if they practice Responsible AI policies – benefitting from the deployment of AI systems whilst building trust and improving customer loyalty.

The bottom line is that Responsible AI is not only about avoiding risks but ensuring that these technologies can be harnessed to the advantage of people and businesses alike.

Assessing how Responsible AI is practiced

We have looked at a range of studies and benchmark/assessment tools which deal with how companies address and practice Responsible AI – and they ultimately reveal a large gap in progress.

The 2021 McKinsey survey12 for instance highlights what we see as a lack of awareness amongst the organisations they consulted towards the various risks associated with AI. We think the graphic below is a good illustration of how companies may be underestimating the risks.

Corporate assessments of AI risks

McKinsey & Co. The state of AI in 2021 2021: Relevance of AI risks for companies

Similarly the 2022 Big Tech Scorecard by Ranking Digital Rights (RDR)13 14 an independent research programme graded tech companies relatively poorly in terms of algorithmic transparency – based on indicators which follow a similar framework to those discussed earlier including elements relating to human rights policy in the development of algorithmic systems risk assessments transparency and privacy.

None of the major tech companies assessed achieved a score above 22% according to RDR’s methodology with some of the biggest global firms near the bottom of the ranking.

The Digital Inclusion Benchmark from the World Benchmarking Alliance15 meanwhile ranked companies on “inclusive and ethical research and development” and sought to capture “the degree to which company practices reflect the participation of diverse groups and consideration of ethics in product development”. Our assessment of benchmark scores for a range of companies found underwhelming performance with just 3% of the 77 we studied gaining a top score.

We think these results help demonstrate the need for responsible investors such as AXA IM to engage companies in discussions over Responsible AI and indicate how we might put that into practice. As part of our responsible technology research and engagement programme we focus on firms with significant investment plans in AI development.

Our key engagement recommendations urge companies to:

Align with the key components of AXA IM’s approach to Responsible AI – fair ethical transparent human oversight

Increase disclosure and transparency around AI system development

Ensure oversight of Responsible AI by their board and senior executives

We are convinced that mitigating the risks associated with AI systems – and addressing regulatory considerations – are closely related to the ability of companies to deliver long-term value creation with these technologies. We also believe that AI systems can better provide long-term and sustainable opportunities when Responsible AI is practiced.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY3Nwb3J0c2Jvc3Rvbi5jb20vbmhsL2Jvc3Rvbi1icnVpbnMvYm9iYnktb3JyLWlzLWFtb25nLXRoZS1mYXN0ZXN0LXBsYXllcnMtdG8tcGxheS1pbi10aGUtbmhsLzE5Mzc0OC_SAXlodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNzcG9ydHNib3N0b24uY29tL25obC9ib3N0b24tYnJ1aW5zL2JvYmJ5LW9yci1pcy1hbW9uZy10aGUtZmFzdGVzdC1wbGF5ZXJzLXRvLXBsYXktaW4tdGhlLW5obC8xOTM3NDgvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bobby Orr is among the fastest players to play in the NHL,"I got the need. The need for speed.

While that famous saying comes from Tom Cruise’s character in Top Gun it can be applied to hockey as well.

The NHL has been home to some of the fastest skaters that the world has seen. It’s impressive enough being able to balance and play the game on ice but certain players take it to the extreme flying up and down the ice with the puck.

Stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Boston sports teams! Sign up here for our All Access Daily newsletter.

Here are some of the fastest players to ever play in the NHL.

Pavel Bure

It’s one thing to have incredible speed. It’s another to have the ability to handle the puck while using that speed.

That’s what fans got to experience watching Pavel Bure aka the “Russian Rocket” during the 1990s. The winger led the league in goals three times in his career finishing with a total of 779 points in 702 NHL games. He likely would have scored even more had he not played in a time where neutral zone traps ruled supreme.

Paul Coffey

There may not have been a smoother skater in the NHL than Paul Coffey especially not among defensemen. Arguably the best offensive defenseman in the game Coffey's ability to rush the puck up the ice is what separated him from everyone else. He was able to blow by defenders using his pace and skill and his precision passing helped him record 1135 assists in his career the sixth-most in NHL history and second-most among blueliners.

His accolades include four Stanley Cups three Norris Trophies 14 All-Star Games and is second all-time among defensemen in goals assists and points. He owns the record for most goals by a defensemen in a season (48) the only defenseman to score at least 40 goals in more than one season and one of just two defensemen to record 100 points in a season more than once.

Yvan Cournoyer

Yvan Cournoyer was a part of the Montreal Canadiens’ dynasty that ruled in the ‘60s and ‘70s. Despite his smaller stature the Canadian right winger was known for his incredible speed. That speed earned him the nickname the “Roadrunner” after the Looney Tunes character.

During his 16-season NHL career Cournoyer was a part of 10 Stanley Cup winning squads. He took home the Conn Smythe for playoff MVP in 1973 scoring 25 points in 17 games. Cournoyer was a two-time Hart Trophy winner as league MVP and goes down as one of the greatest Canadiens in the franchise’s history.

Sergei Fedorov

One of the first Russians to make their way to the NHL Sergei Fedorov was about as complete of a player as you’ll find. He had physicality he could defend he could shoot and he had the speed to beat you. When Fedorov wanted to turn it on he could and would go end-to-end flying by everybody and putting the puck in the back of the net.

Fedorov played 18 seasons in the NHL where he won three Stanley Cups a Hart Trophy two Selkes as best defensive forward and was selected to six All-Star games. He is the all-time leader in points and assists among Russian players.

Mike Gartner

While Mike Gartner’s patented mustache may have been his best physical feature his speed is what made him one of the greatest hockey players. At the beginning of his career Gartner had an uncanny ability to streak to the outside and fire slapshots past goaltenders. As the league started to figure out Garnter’s tendencies he adapted and would use his speed to get to the net either to beat goalies with a deke or find rebounds and second-chance opportunities.

Gartner ended his career without a Stanley Cup win but was a Selke winner and an eight-time All-Star. He is eighth all-time in career goals with 708 one of just eight players to hit 700 career goals.

Bobby Hull

Maybe it was Bobby Hull’s blonde head of hair that flowed up and down the ice that made him look faster but Hull could fly around a rink. Known as the “Golden Jet” Hull made his mark in the NHL with his speed and his rocket of a slap shot.

He’s another forward who loved to use his skating ability and take the puck from his own defensive zone and bring it all the way to the other end by himself. A three-time Art Ross as the league’s top point scorer and a two-time Hart winner Hull had an immaculate 16-year career in the NHL along with seven more seasons in the WHA.

Connor McDavid

The best player in the NHL right now is also the fastest. Connor McDavid’s ability to breeze by defenders while maintaining control of the puck and finding teammates is unmatched. There is no one like him in today’s NHL.

At just 24 years old he’s already a two-time Hart winner three-time Art Ross recipient four-time All-Star and three-time Ted Lindsay winner. This season nothing has slowed down McDavid with 15 points in just six games. In 413 NHL games so far in his young career he already has 589 points. McDavid is absolutely unstoppable and may compete with Wayne Gretzky as the greatest player ever in the NHL.

Scott Niedermayer

When Scott Niedermayer started his career in the NHL he was an offense-first kind of defensemen. But he adapted and became one of the premier two-way defenders in the league. His speed had a great deal to do with that. Niedermayer could carry and possess the puck up the ice and find his way to the net. But he also could sprint back and break up plays in his own zone.

Niedermayer won four Stanley Cups in his 18-year career in the NHL and was honored with the Conn Smythe in 2007. He won the Norris Trophy in 2004 and was a five-time All-Star.

Bobby Orr

No. 4 Bobby Orr. One of the greatest defensemen in NHL history had blazing speed and an uncanny ability to get up and down the ice without losing the puck. At the time defensemen weren’t supposed to have an amazing offensive ability but Orr revolutionized the position.

Orr won eight consecutive Norris Trophies from 1968 to 1975 the Calder Trophy as a rookie twice took the Art Ross was awarded the Hart three times and won two Stanley Cups. A truly fantastic career for one of the greatest to lace the skates.

Maurice Richard

Maurice Richard was a terror on the ice in the ‘40s and ‘50s with the Montreal Canadiens. Given the nickname “Rocket” Richard’s speed wasn't even his best quality. He had a temper on him and wasn’t afraid to use it throwing his body around often.

An eight-time Stanley Cup champion Richard amassed 966 points in 978 games during his 18 seasons in the NHL. He led the league in goals five times in his career a reason why the trophy given to the league’s top goal scorer is now the Rocket Richard Trophy.",,,

MILWAUKEE (CBS 58) -- Dozens participated in the American Heart Association's Annual Heart Walk Saturday morning in Milwaukee.

But for one man walking in the event held a special meaning.

Two years ago Matt Pemberton the director of core solutions at GE Healthcare was shoveling snow off of his driveway when all of a sudden he began having trouble breathing.

""I couldn't just take a deep breath. I had no chest pain so I went inside and it went away very quickly"" Pemberton said. ""That's why I didn't think it was much.""

But when he decided to go outside again just moments later Pemberton said the same feeling happened within minutes.

""I go inside and my wife's like 'hey you should go to the doctor and do your ECG'"" Pemberton said.

Luckily that's when he remembered he had a handheld KardiaMobile device from ""a swag bag from my boss.""

""I grabbed it. It takes a single view of the heart unlike the ones we make at GE that's a lot more comprehensive. Even though it's not cleared to do this I had knowledge of how to read an EKG. So I was able to read and notice there was a problem and I went into the hospital"" Pemberton said. ""The device didn't tell me it was bad I just knew from my experience that I needed to go to the doctor.""

When he arrived Pemberton was diagnosed with a heart blockage commonly known as ""the widow maker.""

He credits the device for saving his life.

""My doctor said at any time I went back out I could've easily blocked that artery and died on the driveway"" Pemberton said.

Now years later he's undergone a complete lifestyle change from exercising more to eating healthier.

""I'm feeling great. It's been two years since I had my open heart surgery"" Pemberton said. ""I've lost weight and I'm feeling really good.""

His advice? Staying on top of your health.

""[My doctor] checks my cholesterol now twice a year. I didn't check it at all before"" Pemberton said. ""Take care of yourself. If I had any message for anyone you don't need a device to do that.""",,,,,,,,,

NATIONAL STATEMENT BY MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE DR VIVIAN BALAKRISHNAN TO THE 77TH SESSION OF THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY NEW YORK 24 SEPTEMBER 2022





Multilateralism and International Law for a World in Crisis





Mr President Excellencies

Let me first congratulate His Excellency Csaba Kőrösi on assuming the Presidency of the 77th session of the General Assembly. I also commend His Excellency Abdulla Shahid for his stalwart leadership of the 76th session during what was a most challenging year.





2 This (General) Assembly is taking place in the shadow of multiple concurrent crises. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine flagrantly violates international law and the UN Charter and undermines the rules-based order. We are also deeply concerned about the potential annexation of even more Ukrainian territory. The multilateral system which has contributed so greatly to global peace and security is now being severely tested.





3 At the same time superpower rivalry continues to sharpen. As we have seen in theatres from Europe to Asia this year the risks of accidents miscalculations confrontation and even outright conflict have escalated. The prospects for international cooperation have weakened considerably and the temptation to resort to unilateralism has become even stronger. But the need for global cooperation has never been greater or more urgent given the range of transnational challenges that all of us confront today.





4 Our recovery from COVID-19 remains uneven and fragile. The risk of a future and even more deadly pandemic has risen.





5 The global economy is entering a period characterised by higher and prolonged inflation and we see high interest rates all over the world. Energy prices have soared. It will become harder to generate the resources all of us need in order to address these long-term problems.





6 Societies everywhere will have to grapple with greater internal division disruption and polarisation. Without that sense of cohesion unity trust or even an ability to agree on facts the will and unity needed for societies to confront these existential challenges will be undermined considerably.





7 The climate crisis is a clear and present threat. Our global commons including water and biodiversity are also deteriorating rapidly. Our global food supply is at risk.





8 To make things worse all these threats and crises are occurring concurrently; interacting with and compounding each other in a vicious circle. For instance the Secretary-General has spoken of a triple crisis (of) food fuel and finance. The impact of these simultaneous crises on ordinary people and on our livelihoods has been severe and all the more so in developing countries. We see this in the devastating impact of the floods in Pakistan and in parts of Africa.





9 The post-World War II era of relative stability and prosperity has unfortunately come to an end. A new world order is being born and any obstetrician here will tell you the moment of delivery is actually the most dangerous. Will we have a more divided less prosperous and less peaceful world? Or instead can we strengthen multilateralism and the United Nations to deal with the challenges of the future uphold and strengthen the rules-based international system and jointly harness the opportunities offered by new technologies including digital technology synthetic biology and customised healthcare and renewable energy. If we can do this we can then create a new era of peace and prosperity for everyone.





10 Singapore believes that the only way forward is to uphold the inclusive and rules-based multilateral system that has underwritten peace and progress for all of us since World War II.





11 This is also why we have worked with a cross-regional group of countries to establish the Forum of Small States (FOSS). We did so in 1992. We started small with only 16 countries. This year we celebrate the 30th anniversary of FOSS. We now have a 108 countries – a majority at the UN – we are all proud members. FOSS has always been a champion of the UN and rules-based multilateralism. It gives us a collective stake and voice in the global commons a means to safeguard our interests and a system where we have sovereign equality and disputes can be settled peacefully in accordance with international law.





12 Indeed the profound importance of multilateralism and international law is precisely why Singapore condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The security and even existence of Singapore – and many other countries and especially small states – depends on the international community upholding the fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.





13 If we do not protect these principles there is then no basis for countries – big and small – to cooperate on an equal footing. Small states especially must not allow the world to regress to one where ‘might is right’.





14 While the rules-based multilateral system is not perfect it is by far our best option in addressing transnational challenges and managing the global commons. This was exemplified by the pivotal adoption of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) 40 years ago. It brought order and predictability to the governance of the oceans and provided a universal legal framework in which all States can work together.





15 The geopolitical reality today makes it harder to forge consensus on such a framework. But as our experience with COVID-19 has shown multilateral cooperation is the only way forward. Ultimately we share one planet. Despite all our differences our destinies are inter-woven and no one is safe until all of us are safe. This applies for pandemics it also applies for climate change the conservation of the oceans and all our other shared challenges.





16 Singapore will do our part. We are honoured that Ambassador Rena Lee serves as the President of the BBNJ Conference (Intergovernmental Conference on Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction) which is currently negotiating a treaty under UNCLOS on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. We call on all delegations to expedite the conclusion of a robust and future-proof BBNJ treaty.





17 There is much more that we can do to re-energise and transform the UN-based multilateral system to new realities and challenges. I commend the leadership of the Secretary-General in putting forth a bold and ambitious “Common Agenda” to do so.





18 Let me focus on just three areas in our global commons where there is an urgent need to build resilience: climate change and food insecurity global health and pandemic preparedness and digital transformation and cybersecurity.





Climate Change and Food Insecurity



19 Climate change remains the most pressing challenge confronting humanity today as we have seen from the more frequent occurrences of extreme weather events and the devastation that they have wrought world over.





20 We need a sustained and ambitious global response. Continued commitment by all countries to the Paris Agreement and Glasgow Climate Pact – that is absolutely critical. We also need to step up cooperation in the transition to net zero. This will be the biggest socio-economic transformation since the Industrial Revolution. Both will require considerable economic restructuring technological breakthroughs investments and behavioural changes. The UN-led multilateral system will be key in pulling everyone together to row in the same direction and not leave anyone behind.





21 Singapore as a small low-lying alternative-energy disadvantaged island nation is especially vulnerable to climate change and rising sea-levels.





22 Singapore’s impact on global emissions is infinitely small but we take our climate change action obligations very seriously. We have just raised our climate ambition to achieve net zero emissions by or around mid-century. A comprehensive strategy to green our economy is taking shape and we will raise carbon taxes progressively from 2024.





23 We will do our part to build a comprehensive green finance ecosystem and facilitate the regional journey to net zero. We are supporting industry efforts to build the infrastructure for a voluntary carbon credit market in Asia. We are also building capabilities in environmental risk management in the financial sector and providing grants to defray the costs of green and sustainability-linked loans and bonds.





24 An adjacent issue is food insecurity. Climate change the pandemic and the war in Ukraine have all exacerbated the threat to our food security. According to a UN report as many as 828 million people were affected by hunger last year — that is 46 million more than 2020 and 150 million more than 2019.





25 We must reverse this negative trend. First we need to ensure that food supply chains remain open and operate smoothly. Second we must pursue innovation and leverage technology to adapt to new challenges. For example working together to develop climate-resilient food systems whilst developing the necessary precautions for food safety. There is much scope for multilateral cooperation on capacity-building and the development of global norms and standards.





Global Health Architecture and Pandemic Preparedness



26 Next — it is essential to build a more robust global health architecture to protect our future generations. After COVID-19 there will be other pandemics and other major health emergencies. In my view COVID-19 was perhaps a full dress rehearsal for a worse pandemic to come.





27 We must be better prepared to predict prevent detect assess and respond to pandemics in a coordinated and effective fashion in (the) future. We have a collective responsibility to rectify the longstanding under-investment in pandemic preparedness amongst other global public goods.





28 Singapore has supported multilateral initiatives to strengthen the global health security system. We will continue to support the COVAX Facility and we have contributed to the establishment of a financial intermediary fund for pandemic prevention preparedness and response hosted by the World Bank.





Digital Transformation and Cybersecurity



29 Lastly we must enhance international cooperation to harness the opportunities of the digital revolution.





30 Digital transformation does not take place in a vacuum. It must be navigated in the context of intersecting issues — geopolitical tensions technological bifurcation cybersecurity threats and the digital divide.





31 The world has made significant progress by developing based on a single shared technology stack. Interconnectedness (and) interoperability has brought us together lowered costs (and) spurred innovation and competition and the cross-fertilisation of ideas. But if we fracture our world and our technology stack all that good work and that speed of progress and innovation will be slowed down significantly.





32 We need an open and inclusive global framework to harness and optimise the opportunities of digital transformation while effectively addressing all its challenges. A zero-sum exclusionary bifurcated approach benefits no one. An erosion of trust and an atmosphere of confrontation will only breed more cyber threats and malicious cyber activities. We must also ensure that all States particularly small states developing and least developed countries benefit from the digital revolution and not be left behind.





33 Singapore fully supports the Secretary-General’s proposal for a Global Digital Compact which has received strong support from Member States.





34 We are honoured that Ambassador Burhan Gafoor serves as Chair of the Open-Ended Working Group on security of and in the use of information and communications technologies. The consensus adoption of the Working Group’s first Annual Progress Report in July is a welcome sign that multilateralism is alive and well and can still deliver meaningful progress on the global commons even in these difficult times.





Mr President Excellencies





35 To conclude — this is a moment where multilateralism must be defended and fortified. Our responses to these myriad opportunities and challenges must remain rooted in the foundational tenets of multilateralism including especially adherence to the UN Charter and international law.





36 I remain an optimist in these difficult times and I believe that we are actually on the cusp of an era of profound technological breakthroughs one that will equip humanity with unimaginably powerful new tools.





37 It is in the world’s interest – and in our own national long-term interest – to set aside our differences address the challenges of the global commons and to harvest the emerging opportunities provided by new technologies.





38 Ultimately as Member States we have as much responsibility to each other and to our citizens: to work together to improve adapt and strengthen the multilateral system that we have built so painstakingly over the past 77 years so that our people – all people – can lead better more secure more peaceful and happier lives.





39 Thank you Mr President Excellencies.

According to the theory advances in AI — specifically of the machine learning type that’s able to take on new information and rewrite its code accordingly — will eventually catch up with the wetware of the biological brain. In this interpretation of events every AI advance from Jeopardy-winning IBM machines to the massive AI language model GPT-3 is taking humanity one step closer to an existential threat. We’re literally building our soon-to-be-sentient successors.

Except that it will never happen. At least according to the authors of the new book Why Machines Will Never Rule the World: Artificial Intelligence without Fear.

Co-authors University at Buffalo philosophy professor Barry Smith and Jobst Landgrebe founder of German AI company Cognotekt argue that human intelligence won’t be overtaken by “an immortal dictator” any time soon — or ever. They told Digital Trends their reasons why.

Digital Trends (DT): How did this subject get on your radar?

Jobst Landgrebe (JL): I’m a physician and biochemist by training. When I started my career I did experiments that generated a lot of data. I started to study mathematics to be able to interpret these data and saw how hard it is to model biological systems using mathematics. There was always this misfit between the mathematical methods and the biological data.

In my mid-thirties I left academia and became a business consultant and entrepreneur working in artificial intelligence software systems. I was trying to build AI systems to mimic what human beings can do. I realized that I was running into the same problem that I had years before in biology.

Customers said to me ‘why don’t you build chatbots?’ I said ‘because they won’t work; we cannot model this type of system properly.’ That ultimately led to me writing this book.

Professor Barry Smith (BS): I thought it was a very interesting problem. I had already inklings of similar problems with AI but I had never thought them through. Initially we wrote a paper called ‘Making artificial intelligence meaningful again.’ (This was in the Trump era.) It was about why neural networks fail for language modeling. Then we decided to expand the paper into a book exploring this subject more deeply.

DT: Your book expresses skepticism about the way that neural networks which are crucial to modern deep learning emulate the human brain. They’re approximations rather than accurate models of how the biological brain works. But do you accept the core premise that it is possible that were we to understand the brain in granular enough detail it could be artificially replicated – and that this would give rise to intelligence or sentience?

JL: The name ‘neural network’ is a complete misnomer. The neural networks that we have now even the most sophisticated ones have nothing to do with the way the brain works. The view that the brain is a set of interconnected nodes in the way that neural networks are built is completely naïve.

If you look at the most primitive bacterial cell we still don’t understand even how it works. We understand some of its aspects but we have no model of how it works – let alone a neuron which is much more complicated or billions of neurons interconnected. I believe it’s scientifically impossible to understand how the brain works. We can only understand certain aspects and deal with these aspects. We don’t have and we will not get a full understanding of how the brain works.

If we had a perfect understanding of how each molecule of the brain works then we could probably replicate it. That would mean putting everything into mathematical equations. Then you could replicate this using a computer. The problem is just that we are unable to write down and create those equations.

BS: Many of the most interesting things in the world are happening at levels of granularity that we cannot approach. We just don’t have the imaging equipment and we probably never will have the imaging equipment to capture most of what’s going on at the very fine levels of the brain.

This means that we don’t know for instance what is responsible for consciousness. There are in fact a series of quite interesting philosophical problems which according to the method that we’re following will always be unsolvable – and so we should just ignore them.

Another is the freedom of the will. We are very strongly in favor of the idea that human beings have a will; we can have intentions goals and so forth. But we don’t know whether or not it’s a free will. That is an issue that has to do with the physics of the brain. As far as the evidence available to us is concerned computers can’t have a will.

DT: The subtitle of the book is ‘artificial intelligence without fear.’ What is the specific fear that you refer to?

BS: That was provoked by the literature on the singularity which I know you’re familiar with. Nick Bostrom David Chalmers Elon Musk and the like. When we talked with our colleagues in the real world it became clear to us that there was indeed a certain fear among the populace that AI would eventually take over and change the world to the detriment of humans.

We have quite a lot in the book about the Bostrum-type arguments. The core argument against them is that if the machine cannot have a will then it also cannot have an evil will. Without an evil will there’s nothing to be afraid of. Now of course we can still be afraid of machines just as we can be afraid of guns.

But that’s because the machines are being managed by people with evil ends. But then it’s not AI that is evil; it’s the people who build and program the AI

DT: Why does this notion of the singularity or artificial general intelligence interest people so much? Whether they’re scared by it or fascinated by it there’s something about this idea that resonates with people on a broad level.

JL: There’s this idea started at the beginning of the 19th century and then declared by Nietzsche at the end of that century that God is dead. Since the elites of our society are not Christians anymore they needed a replacement. Max Stirner who was like Karl Marx a pupil of Hegel wrote a book about this saying ‘I am my own god.’

If you are God you also want to be a creator. If you could create a superintelligence then you are like God. I think it has to do with the hyper-narcissistic tendencies in our culture. We don’t talk about this in the book but that explains to me why this idea is so attractive in our times in which there is no transcendent entity anymore to turn to.

DT: Interesting. So to follow that through it’s the idea that the creation of AI – or the aim to create AI – is a narcissistic act. In that case the concept that these creations would somehow become more powerful than we are is a nightmarish twist on that. It’s the child killing the parent.

JL: A bit like that yes.

DT: What for you would be the ultimate outcome of your book if everyone was convinced by your arguments? What would that mean for the future of AI development?

JL: It’s a very good question. I can tell you exactly what I think would happen – and will happen. I think in the midterm people will accept our arguments and this will create better-applied mathematics.

Something that all great mathematicians and physicists are completely aware of was the limitations of what they could achieve mathematically. Because they are aware of this they focus only on certain problems. If you are well aware of the limitations then you go through the world and look for these problems and solve them. That’s how Einstein found the equations for Brownian motion; how he came up with his theories of relativity; how Planck solved blackbody radiation and thus initiated the quantum theory of matter. They had a good instinct for which problems are amenable to solutions with mathematics and which are not.

If people learn the message of our book they will we believe be able to engineer better systems because they will concentrate on what is truly feasible – and stop wasting money and effort on something that can’t be achieved.

BS: I think that some of the message is already getting through not because of what we say but because of the experiences people have when they give large amounts of money to AI projects and then the AI projects fail. I guess you know about the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center. I can’t remember the exact sum but I think it was something like $10 billion which they gave to a famous contractor. In the end they got nothing out of it. They canceled the contract.

(Editor’s note: JAIC a subdivision of the United States Armed Forces was intended to accelerate the “delivery and adoption of AI to achieve mission impact at scale.” It was folded into a larger unified organization the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Officer with two other offices in June this year. JAIC ceased to exist as its own entity.)

DT: What do you think in high-level terms is the single most compelling argument that you make in the book?

BS: Every AI system is mathematical in nature. Because we cannot model consciousness will or intelligence mathematically these cannot be emulated using machines. Therefore machines will not become intelligent let alone superintelligent.

JL: The structure of our brain only allows limited models of nature. In physics we pick a subset of reality that fits to our mathematical modeling capabilities. That is how Newton Maxwell Einstein or Schrödinger obtained their famous and beautiful models. But these can only describe or predict a small set of systems. Our best models are those which we use to engineer technology. We are unable to create a complete mathematical model of animate nature.

But the rivals face a new season in their decades-long battle as Kellogg prepares to spin off its North American cereal business into a new standalone company.

The move is similar to the creation of Lakeville-based Post Consumer Brands in 2015 and executives at Kellogg and Post say having a company solely dedicated to cereal gives them the advantage.

""You can't overstate the importance of focus and prioritization. And that North American cereal business is going to be what they live for"" Kellogg chief executive Steve Cahillane said at an investor conference earlier this month.

So can General Mills with a much more diverse portfolio of products maintain its No. 1 position in cereal when the competition heats up?

""The biggest challenge for us is staying focused on what we do well"" General Mills CEO Jeff Harmening said at the same investor conference. ""There's a case to be made we can get distracted but I assure you we will not.""

The gulf widens

Five years ago General Mills and Kellogg co-led the category with equal market share.

It was an era of cost-cutting measures and consolidation in the packaged food industry. Every major food company was slashing costs to avoid a takeover. But the philosophy went too far: Without innovation and marketing efforts the brands were killing themselves.

General Mills wised up sooner than some others by reinvesting in its top cereal brands. The company also listened to consumers. Rather than trying to put a healthy spin on all its sugary cereals it embraced those brands for what they are.

Gradually General Mills grew its market share of U.S. cereal while Kellogg's declined.

General Mills has widened its lead ever since. The Cheerios and Cinnamon Toast Crunch maker boasts a 34% share of the U.S. cereal market and had $3.1 billion in cereal sales over the past 12 months according to IRI a Chicago-based market research firm.

Michigan-based Kellogg anchored by Frosted Flakes Froot Loops and Frosted Mini-Wheats collected 25% of all dollars spent on cereal in the same time frame with $2.3 billion in sales.

However some of Kellogg's recent share decline is attributable to a major fire at a plant in 2021 and a nearly three-month strike at all four of its cereal plants last fall. Its unit sales fell more than 14% over the previous year IRI data shows.

As Kellogg continues to rebuild its inventory — and with the cereal spinoff still a year away — General Mills has a chance to shore up its lead.

""At least in the near term there's an opportunity for General Mills"" said Edward Jones analyst Brittany Quatrochi. ""There's likely to be some distraction on Kellogg's part.""

Cahillane said Kellogg hasn't given enough support to its North American cereal business which accounted for about 20% of the company's total revenue in 2021.

""You've heard me say 'We don't have to win in North American cereal for our algorithm to work. We just have to be stable'"" he said. ""Think about how that's perceived by the people who work in North America cereal. They're like 'Great I don't have to grow. I'm not that important.'""

That attitude will change with a cereal-focused company.

""They are going to wake up each and every day with one thing on their mind"" Cahillane said. ""How do I win in this category?""

But if the executives in Golden Valley are sweating they aren't showing it.

""It's certainly not arrogance but confidence that we are doing the fundamental things right in order to succeed"" Harmening said. ""We've gained market share five years in a row.""

General Mills' leaders dismiss the notion their success is due to a competitor's recent stumbles.

""We believe in our cereal business"" Harmening said in an interview last week. ""We've got the best brands in the category. We have a deep knowledge in cereal and we care about the business quite a bit.""

Stronger segment

The overall cereal business struggled for several years until COVID-19 jumpstarted sales for comfort and convenience foods including cereal.

While the major boost from pandemic-era stockpiling has faded and price increases have slowed the number of boxes sold Quatrochi said the business remains on much better footing now.

""The pandemic reintroduced people to cereal many of whom are still working [and eating] more at home"" she said.

Barclays analyst Andrew Lazar wrote earlier this month the category ""is quite healthy at the moment likely in part as cereal provides an affordable meal during challenging times.""

Cereal has not been immune to inflation — the average cost per unit has risen 10.7% in the past year according to IRI — but it remains a consumer staple.

""A bowl of cereal with a glass of milk is $1 and that's really helping the category"" Cahillane said.

Kellogg has tapped its chief legal officer 22-year company veteran Gary Pilnick to lead the North American cereal business and has announced several other high-level hires.

Yet there are many unknowns as to how the new company will perform.

Lazar questioned whether the new company can achieve ""sustainably stable sales ... as the business was consistently losing share prior to the pandemic.""

""We continue to believe investors remain skeptical around the value creation proposition"" he added.

Morningstar analyst Erin Lash echoed that sentiment in August but said with better brand spending ""we think its [Kellogg] products will uphold strong positions in their respective categories over the long term.""

Kellogg is also separating its plant-based business led by Morningstar Farms. The remaining company will focus on its global snacking portfolio which includes Pop-Tarts Pringles Cheez-Its and international cereal.

The rationale is that the three businesses will perform better on their own than they would have under one umbrella.

Lazar said Kellogg also seemed ""increasingly frustrated with being viewed first as a cereal company despite cereal representing a smaller and smaller percentage of the company over the years.""

General Mills appears unlikely to follow Kellogg in separating its cereal business after watching its domestic cereal sales rise 9.4% over the past year.

Harmening said that while that rate of growth may cool off over the next year ""We're playing the long game.""

""No matter what our competition does we're going to keep building our brands caring for and believing in them"" he said. ""In the long run that is what led us to be successful.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL21hcmtldHMuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3N0b2Nrcy9pcy1nZW5lcmFsLW1pbGxzLXN0b2NrLW55c2UtZ2lzLXdvcnRoLWJ1eWluZy1hZnRlci1zdHJvbmctcTEtMjAyMy1yZXN1bHRzLTEwMzE3NjI5MTTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is General Mills Stock (NYSE:GIS) Worth Buying after Strong Q1-2023 Results?,"General Mills (NYSE: GIS) reported strong Fiscal Q1-2023 earnings on September 21 despite macroeconomic headwinds. In fact among the multitude of negative earnings surprises as of late General Mills beat expectations regarding both EPS and revenue. While this is impressive I’m neutral on General Mills due to its valuation being too high.

Diving into its Q1 results General Mills net sales increased to $4.7 billion an increase of 4% year-over-year facilitated by a 10% increase in organic net sales compared to the previous year. It is important to note however a 5% decrease in organic volume.

While seemingly concerning a 15% increase in organic pricing and mix offset this decline illustrating the apparent pricing power of General Mills and the consequent acceptance of price increases by the consumer.

Similarly diluted EPS increased 32% year-over-year to $1.35 with adjusted EPS following suit increasing 13% from the prior year to $1.11 and coming in above expectations of $1.00.

The company certainly didn’t achieve this without any challenges however as inflation continues to plague producers in the form of input costs. General Mills faced an approximately 14% to 15% increase in its cost of goods sold causing its gross margin to only advance 0.2% from 34.7% to 34.9% compared to the previous year.

This isn’t necessarily surprising as the PPI a measure of inflation from the perspective of producers came in at 7.3% in August above expectations of 7.1%. Regardless this was offset by the aforementioned pricing power of the firm which sustains this still impressive margin.

Wall Street liked this news sending shares up 5.72% on Wednesday despite downward market pressures after the Federal Reserve’s announcement of a 75 basis point interest rate hike.

What’s even more appealing is the 32% gain of General Mills over the last year compared to the -16% return of the S&P 500 (SPX) thanks to solid fundamentals and significant barriers to entry.

General Mills was founded in 1928 and has grown to manage a diverse selection of consumer staples including brands such as Cheerios Blue Buffalo and Pillsbury. With commitments to drive shareholder value through its Accelerate strategy the company pledges to constantly innovate and capitalize on its scale.

General Mills Has Solid Fundamentals

General Mills success in Q1 can be partially attributed to its respectable fundamentals though they may come at a premium to investors.

The company’s Fiscal 2022 gross operating and net margins are 33.71% 17.14% and 14.25% respectively. While these values themselves contain some insight it’s important to compare such metrics to previous performance or fellow competitors for a more effective ratio analysis. Accordingly General Mills’ gross margin is superior to about 67% of companies in the Consumer Packaged Goods Industry and the operating and net margins are superior to about an impressive 88% of companies in the same industry.

Furthermore its return on equity which can be interpreted as the amount of net income produced by $1 of shareholder’s equity is 40.34% better than about 96% of companies in the industry. In a similar manner but with respect to assets instead of shareholder’s equity its return on assets is 8.52%.

It is also vital to consider the economic profit or “economic value added” of the company by finding the difference between the return on invested capital and the weighted average cost of capital determining how efficiently and effectively the company manages shareholder money.

Currently GISs economic profit is 5% which has been generally stable over the past 10 years. While not extremely high it does outperform competitors such as the -3% economic profit of The Kraft Heinz Co. (NASDAQ: KHC) and the 4% economic profit of Kellogg (NYSE: K).

While General Mills capital management may be positive attention should be drawn to its management of debt through the form of liquidity ratios which are measures of how easily a company can satisfy its short-term debt.

General Mills’ current and quick ratios are 0.63x and 0.4x respectively which are quite low. These metrics place General Mills below about 90% of fellow companies in the industry.

A cursory glance at the balance sheet would reveal a decrease in cash and cash equivalents since last year with considerable increases in accounts payable and the current portion of long-term debt; monitoring this is a necessity as more long-term debt becomes current which could detract from future cash flow.

Speaking of cash operating cash flow increased from $370 million in the prior year to $389 million in Fiscal Q1 2023. 90% of this is expected to be converted to free cash flow in Fiscal 2023 which can proliferate the company’s ability to return value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. In Q1 alone the company paid $325 million in dividends and repurchased $501 million worth of shares up from only $150 million in the previous year.

Finally while these fundamentals are strong they come at a price. Its P/E ratio is currently 19.5x with a forward P/E of 19.3x and a PEG ratio of 3.48. GuruFocus also assigns GIS an intrinsic value of $64.69 and with shares trading at $80.78 the stock appears overvalued.

General Mills Increases Its Fiscal 2023 Guidance

CEO Jeff Harmening was pleased with these results stating “We continue to deliver strong performance in a highly volatile operating environment.” As a result he continued “Given the strength of our first-quarter results and confidence in our ability to adapt to continued volatility ahead we are increasing our full-year outlook for net sales operating profit and EPS growth.”

Organic net sales growth which was previously expected to increase by 4% to 5% is now expected to increase by 6% to 7%. Adjusted operating profit growth which was previously expected to be -2% to +1% is now expected to be flat to +3%. Finally adjusted diluted EPS growth was increased from flat to +3% to +2% to +5%.

Any growth is notable in an inflationary and rising interest rate environment and increasing such growth is even more impressive pointing to the sustainable competitive advantages the firm enjoys.

The Keys to Success: Sustainable Competitive Advantages

The goal of any firm is to enjoy above-average profits over the long term a “sustainable competitive advantage” and the goal of investors is to subsequently identify such companies. Doing so is quite simple when considering General Mills facilitating its strong performance.

The majority of these competitive advantages of General Mills are rooted in basic economics. For instance General Mills has been able to mitigate the effects of inflation. Why? Because of the inelastic nature of its products.

Elasticity is a measure of how consumers’ demand reacts to a change in price. For elastic goods a change in price provokes a substantial change in demand and for inelastic goods a change in price has little effect on demand. Food for both humans and pets is inelastic. Regardless of changes in price consumers and their pets still need to eat granting the firm the ability to maintain sales despite increasing prices.

On the contrary dining at restaurants may be decreasingly feasible for consumers as the prices of both food and other necessities continue to climb. Subsequently many are choosing to eat at home leading to even more demand for products in the tried and true brands of General Mills.

Moreover the company also enjoys economies of scale and scope by producing a great deal of a wide variety of products creating multiple revenue streams. This along with well-established brands worth $9 billion create economic moats or barriers to entry preventing other companies from entering the industry.

In Q1 General Mills either grew or held market share in 66% of U.S. retail sales. This was due in part to the company’s successful execution of vertical integration as seen in the acquisition of TNT Crust a frozen pizza crust producer with double-digit compound annual net sales growth.

The combination of inelastic goods and a substantial market share along with the numerous barriers to entry established by economies of scale scope and brand recognition has proven to be beneficial for the company consumers and shareholders alike.

Is GIS a Good Stock to Buy?

Wall Street enjoyed General Mills’ Q1 Earnings but it may now be somewhat overvalued. As such GIS currently has a Hold rating based on three Buys 11 Holds and two Sells. The average General Mills price target of $76.81 suggests 2.8% downside potential with a high price target of $88 and a low target of $57.

Conclusion: General Mills Valuation Offsets Its Strong Fundamentals

In an oligopolistic market with a few large competitors it is apparent that General Mills is able to mitigate the effects of inflation. Along with positive fundamentals and a track record of growth through successful acquisitions the many competitive advantages and economic moats may create the same confidence in investors as the company has established in consumers regarding quality and loyalty to their products. However the current valuation is not as attractive.

GM,General Motors,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8yNC9nbS1yZXR1cm4tdG8tb2ZmaWNlLW1hbmRhdGUtcmVtb3RlLXdvcmtlcnMtdGhyZWUtZGF5cy13ZWVrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM issues return-to-office mandate for remote workers,"General Motors Co. became the latest company to ask corporate employees to return to the office at least part of the time.

Employees who had worked remotely during the Covid-19 pandemic are expected to “pivot to a more regular in-person work cycle” which includes three days on GM’s campus each week a spokesperson said Friday. The return-to-office mandate will take effect later this year the spokesperson said.

“We’re committed to maintaining flexibility to ensure our employees can attend to personal commitments” the spokesperson said. “We will share details with them in the coming weeks.”

Detroit-based GM joins a long list of corporations including Apple Inc. Peloton Interactive Inc. and Comcast Corp. that have asked workers since Labor Day to return to offices several days a week.

GM like much of the auto industry allowed white-collar workers to log in remotely under its “work appropriately” strategy during the pandemic.

Ford Motor Co. said Saturday it’s keeping a “flexible hybrid” model that only requires salaried workers to appear in-person for group meetings. Mitsubishi Motors North America Inc. offers its corporate employees the option to work from home all the time.

Those policies stand in stark contrast to Tesla Inc. where Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk ordered workers in June to spend 40 hours per week in the office and dismissed remote work as “pretend.”

While many CEOs remain critical of remote work some research has shown that people who work from home are just as productive and typically more satisfied than office workers.

Still the ability to work remotely presents a wrinkle for companies with a mix of white-collar and frontline workers: Management must walk a fine line when they extend flexibility to some employees and not to others.

GM employs more than 94000 people in the US including about 2300 workers at its Detroit Renaissance Center global headquarters according to the company’s website.

In fact according to a GM exec there was going to be hardly any Nikola in these trucks as the startup’s contribution was literally just skin-deep ending with the design of the truck.

Scott Damman a senior General Motors manager who works in the software division testified in court against Trevor Milton and stated that ""there were no components coming from Nikola. They owned the creative design what the vehicle looked like and felt like but all of the parts were to come from General Motors.""

This is at odds with statements made by Milton in 2020 when he said referring to the Badger pickup (pictured) that GM was going to build for Nikola (in exchange for an 11 percent stake in the company then valued at $2-billion) that ""it’s probably 70% Nikola 30% GM when it comes to the parts that are really important to us.""

This all ties into the lawsuit’s wider narrative that Trevor Milton used false statements to convince ""innocent investors"" to buy Nikola shares. The charges were filed by the New York Attorney General’s Office in 2020 and in 2021 prosecutors added new charges against Milton regarding the purchase of a ranch in Utah - part of the purchase was made with an option to buy Nikola stock.

The former Nikola chief executive has yet to take to the stand and defend himself in court and looking at the precedent his indictment is not a foregone conclusion according to analysts who believe it all hinges on his defense. He resigned from his position in September of 2020 after a report by short seller Hindenburg Research pointed out many of his exaggerations and directly accused him of fraud.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd4eXouY29tL25ld3MvZ20tZW1wbG95ZWVzLW11c3QtcmV0dXJuLXRvLXdvcmstaW4tcGVyc29uLXN0YXJ0aW5nLWxhdGVyLXRoaXMteWVhctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM: Employees must return to work in-person starting later this year,"DETROIT (WXYZ) — General Motors announced Sunday beginning later this year employees will be required to return to work in-person at least three days each work week.

Effective later this year employees who transitioned to working remotely some or all of the time during the pandemic will pivot to a more regular in-person work cycle and they will now be expected to work three days on-campus each week"" said Maria Raynal General Motors spokesperson.

At this time GM has not provided an exact date for employees to return in-person.

According to an article in Crain's Detroit business GM's message to employees was attributed to ""the senior leadership team"" listing CEO Mary Barra President Mark Reuss and 12 other top executives. The message which also cited the desire to encourage more collaboration moving forward did not say specifically when the new policy would take effect.

On April 20 2021 GM laid forth a new philosophy that signaled a culture shift for the 113-year-old automaker called Work Appropriately.

Work Appropriately gave many salaried employees flexibility to work wherever they could best do their job. GM viewed it as a hiring and retention tool because GM has more access to talent by not requiring all its employees to move to Michigan or make daily commutes.

GM's new return-to-office plan couldn't come fast enough for the Renaissance Center. The site of GM's headquarters effectively became a ghost town when COVID-19 sent office workers packing to work from home. Among them: roughly 5000 GM employees.

GM has been unable to provide any figures on how many employees show up to RenCen offices daily because Work Appropriately means the number fluctuates daily.

Without them it was quite quiet. Back in June it was questioned about what was going to happen to the RenCen because of how empty it became plus GM owns part of the building.

Since the pandemic RenCen lost Deloitte LLP as a tenant and Blue Cross Blue Shield moved about 50 of its 2000 workers to a smaller office in Detroit.

This convenience has led to the development and availability of tablets and capsules for various ailments even cancer. Studies show that standard compressed controlled-release and coated tablets are the most common form of solid oral dosage. Currently a wide range and diversity of ingredients are often included in tablet formulations.



According to IQVIA MIDAS Global Data (February 2022) the oral solid dose (OSD) market is $541 billion and has shown steady growth over the past few years. Meanwhile 72 per cent of newly approved drugs in 2021 were small molecules and nearly 50 per cent of new drugs approved in 2021 were OSD as per FDA data.

Moreover emerging companies hold more than 70 per cent of the total OSD clinical development pipeline and more than 80 per cent of the OSD preclinical development pipeline.



Several industry experts have pointed out that OSD formulations are the pharma industry’s tried-and-true treatment forms. It is not just convenient for the patients tablets and capsules are efficient and cost-effective to manufacture and shelf stable.



Although billion-dollar large molecule injectable drugs like Humira and Keytruda are topping the market charts reports suggest small molecule solid dose drugs still make up the vast majority of drugs in the U.S. market.



In recent years new drug approval for tablets and capsules specifically have outstripped approvals for injectables solutions and creams. Additionally several small molecule OSD products are beginning to show promise in the fight against COVID-19 thrusting aging medications back into the spotlight and renewing patients’ and manufacturers’ enthusiasm for OSD drugs.

What are Oral Solid Dose (OSD) formulations?

The oral solid dosage (OSD) form refers to a final drug product that is ingested through the mouth dissolved in the digestive system and delivered to the body through the blood. The most common OSD forms which include tablets and capsules are efficient and cost-effective to manufacture shelf-stable and easy to administer. Interestingly they are widely understood and embraced by patients worldwide. According to experts they are preferred by pharmaceutical manufacturers owing to the advantage of economy of scale.



“Oral Solid Dose Formulations involve the products like tablets capsules sachets effervescent tablets sublingual tablets etc. So the overall difference between each type of Oral Solid Dose Formulations is mainly dependent upon their nature their palatability their strength their dosage and their organoleptic parameters” Dr. Arvind Badiger- technical director at BDR pharma pvt ltd. told Financial Express.com.



Apart from the standard immediate release or sustained release tablets there are a significant number of oral dosage forms that ensure delivery of active ingredients in the most convenient manner such as orally disintegrating tablets timed release capsules etc. in various shapes sizes and flavours. It is noteworthy that the wide range and type of available solid dose options makes it possible to respond rapidly and creatively to changing user preferences and market needs as well as the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) properties such as release efficiency pH-sensitivity API taste etc.



There are various forms of OSD: Small molecules tablets capsules soft gels effervescence gummies and pills and all of them are ingested through the mouth dissolved in the digestive system and delivered to the body through absorption into the bloodstream



Originated in 1842 when Englishman William Brockedon patented tablets of compressed sodium and potassium carbonate OSD formulations are a widely used and well-proven drug delivery system. Today oral solid dosage drug products are the most common dose form physicians prescribe for a variety of indications.

Why is OSD a dominant mode of medication?

According to industry experts the oral solid dosage is such a dominant delivery form for three main reasons: easy to administer well-understood manufacturing methods and well-developed. Interestingly oral solid dose products continue to lead the charts in novel drug approvals. In 2019 USFDA approved 48 novel drugs and 54 per cent of these drugs were OSD.



In same year Janssen Pharmaceutical’s Balversa (erdafitinib) tablets were approved under the FDA’s accelerated approval program in April 2019 as a treatment for adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer. Balversa reportedly the first FGFR kinase inhibitor to receive FDA approval is an important new therapy for a small subset of patients with urothelial carcinoma who up until this approval had limited treatment options.



“With respective effective parameters Oral Solid Dose Formulations are always considered as patient-friendly dosage forms compared to either injectables or suppositories topical preparations or inhalations etc. Once the tablet is consumed by the patient the patient will get the beneficial effect based on the dosage form. For example if a person is suffering from acidity the tablet dosage form or a capsule dosage form if he/ she consumes will give him relief within a certain period of time. However if the patient consumes the same kind of medicine in the form of apheresis granules like ENO he can get an effect more in an immediate manner. So that is how the dosage forms vary with respect to its effectiveness” Dr Badiger told Financial Express.com.

‘Never-ending demand for Oral Solid Dose Formulation’

According to Vision Research Report during the forecast period of 2022 to 2030 the global oral solid dosage contract manufacturing market is estimated to develop at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.21 per cent. The global oral solid dosage contract manufacturing market was valued at USD 31.93 billion in 2021 and it is predicted to exceed USD 54.9 billion by 2030.



The report also revealed that advances in drug delivery technology such as the delivery of drugs and sustained release formation are enabling oral solids to achieve even higher levels of bioavailability while lowering drug administration frequency.



The global market is growing in conjunction with the oncology sector. Clinical-stage cancer programs increased by 77% between 2015 and 2020 (1642 to 2911) and completely dominate the landscape resulting in approximately one-quarter of drugs currently being developed globally being classified as highly potent. Moreover the COVID-19 crisis has had a number of short- and long-term consequences.



The healthcare sector witnessed a considerable decline in revenue recognition during the year 2020 due to labor shortages and disruption of the raw material supply chain. As small molecule oral solid dosage (OSD) products such as azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine have a positive impact on the COVID-19-infected population there is an increasing number of manufacturers were focused on the commercialisation and production of such OSD drug products and supporting the market growth.



Moreover the industry witnessed a significant surge in 2020 and 2021 as a new and high number of CMOs were allocated with contracts of OSD as a potential treatment of the COVID-19 infection. In August 2020 Pfizer Inc. announced an agreement with Gilead Sciences Inc. to provide contract manufacturing services for the supply and manufacturing of Gilead’s investigational antiviral remdesivir drug with an aim to scale up the supply of the investigational treatment for COVID-19 patients. These factors supported the demand surge of OSD products across 2020 and 2021.

’90 per cent of Cancer Medication is in Oral Solid Dosage form’

According to the Market Watch 2022 report the tablets segment dominated the OSD contract manufacturing market last year. The report also revealed that it accounted for the largest share of 32.7 per cent of the global revenue. Several studies have highlighted that the clinical-stage cancer programmes increased by 77 per cent between 2015 and 2020 (1642 to 2911) and completely dominate the landscape resulting in approximately one-quarter of drugs currently being developed globally being classified as highly potent.



“The involvement of OSD or the contribution of OSD in cancer treatment has been quite phenomenal because many of the drugs which are used for cancer treatment are quite toxic in nature. Therefore injectable anti-cancer drugs are comparatively less when you see the total number of molecules” Dr. Badiger told Financial Express.com.



He also highlighted that 90 per cent of the products which are available in the treatment of cancer are available in the form of oral solid dosage forms and the rest of the 10 per cent are available in injectable dosage forms.



“Oral solid dosage forms have been contributing majorly to the treatment of anti-cancer drugs and if we look at the future pipeline of production it is also concentrated mainly on the oral solid dosage form. However this is specifically mentioned in chemotherapy or immunomodulating drugs. But when we look at the monoclonal antibodies or biosimilar kinds of products there we have a good number of products that are available in injectable forms as well” he added.

Oral Solid dosages in India’s cancer care segment

In India according to a 2018 study in the Indian Journal of Medical Research almost 75-80 per cent of patients have advanced disease (Stage 3-4) at the time of diagnosis. The treatment of this deadly disease is limited by the affordability of patients in countries like India. Currently cancer patients receive a combination of treatments including surgery chemotherapy radiation therapy and immunotherapy.



Earlier this month four major anti-cancer drugs were added to the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM).



The Union health ministry released the NLEM 2022 list with 34 additions including the cancer drugs Bendamustine Hydrochloride HCI Trihydrate Lenalidomide and Leuprolide Acetate taking the number of medicines on the list to 384 across 27 categories. According to the central government this move will help in reducing “patients’ out-of-pocket expenditure”.



Four major anti-cancer drugs – Bendamustine Hydrochloride Irinotecan HCI Trihydrate Lenalidomide and Leuprolide acetate which is effective in various types of cancers have been added to the list.



Dr. Badiger told Financial Express.com that various factors are driving the growth in OSD manufacturing now that automation has become phenomenally significant.



“Now the manufacturing is done under the isolator technology thereby the psychotoxic property of the medicine is not affecting the operators. More importantly the trace and tracks have evolved in order to understand the entire manufacturing process of the solid dosage form in order to trace it to the basics. The technology has been further significantly changed after the granulation has developed” he said.



Dr. Badiger also said that earlier the tables were manufactured with equipment like rapid mixer granulators now there are high shear granulators top spray regulators single port regulators automatic exclusion regulators etc. “where the evolution has helped the assumed management of anti-cancer products.”



“Efficacy varies from molecule to molecule and it depends upon the type of cancer that the property is going to treat. So it definitely varies from molecule to molecule and also it depends largely upon the kind of treatment you are targeting it to” he added.

OSD formulations: A Patient-Centric Alternative for Cancer Treatment

Dr. Badiger also explained that most chemotherapeutic anticancer drugs are available in the oral solid dosage form.



“Most of the OSDs that are available in the current scenario are tablet dosage form largely. Some of them are present in soft gelatin capsules some of the are present in hard gelatin capsules and hardly a few are present in suspension dosage form and solution dosage form. One of the challenges for the anti-cancer product is that the product needs to be protected to be exposed to the environment as they are psychotoxic in nature particularly to the paramedical staff or caretaker of the patient” he added.



Moreover OSDs are not divided as per the type of cancer. Rather it is the type of molecules that are divided based on the type of cancer.



“…For example we have various immunomodulators like everolimus which are used for breast cancer treatment and they are available in tablet dosage form. Whereas there is a product like enzalutamide which is present in the soft gelatin capsule that will be used for the treatment of prostate cancer. In the same way there is a product like abiraterone which is present in the form of a tablet and is used for the treatment of prostate cancer. The same formulation of enzalutamide which is available in the form of soft gelatin capsule is now converted into a tablet dosage form and both of them are being used internationally for the treatment of prostate cancer. So the type of OSDs will not determine the treatment of type of cancers rather the type of molecules will determine the treatment of the different types of cancer” He said.



Meanwhile there are various types of products already available in the market.



“We have a product like Cyclophosphamide that is a very old conventional tablet dosage form which is a highly psychotoxic drug used in the treatment of cancer. There is a product like capecitabine that is also highly toxic in nature and it is used in the treatment of various types of cancer such as androgen receptor inhibitor which is used in the treatment of cancer. So it is the type of molecules that make the difference in the treatment of different cancer it is not the types of dosage forms” Dr. Badiger said.



He also informed that efficacy varies from molecule to molecule and it depends upon the type of cancer that the property is going to treat. “So it definitely varies from molecule to molecule and also it depends largely upon the kind of treatment you are targeting it to” Dr. Badiger said.

‘Tablets dominate OSD contract manufacturing market’

According to the Market Watch 2022 report the tablets segment dominated the OSD contract manufacturing market in 2021 and accounted for the largest share of 32.7 percent of the global revenue. Tablets are the most common OSD form.



Tablets contain an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) which is also known as a dry powder ingredient and a drug substance. According to experts the method of compression is used to form tablets which can be coated or uncoated.



Experts have revealed that pharmaceutical companies have a preference for tablets as they are simple to make package and transport have good physical and chemical stability and allow for simple and accurate dosing.



Moreover the capsules segment is expected to register the fastest CAGR over the forecast period and is the second-most lucrative dosage form in the market. It is noteworthy that capsules are a widely known oral dosage formulation that is common among both pharmaceutical companies and consumers.



Asia Pacific is projected to be the fastest-growing regional market with a CAGR of 6.4 percent over the forecast period. The region also accounted for the largest market share in 2021. India and China are OSD CMO market powerhouses in the APAC region with significantly lower prices the report revealed.



According to the report one area of the OSD market in particular expected to expand is the development and manufacturing of highly potent active pharmaceutical ingredients (HPAPIs).

Find out before you travel.,"If you happen to travel to the UK  UAE or neighbouring Bhutan  your checkout experience at merchant outlets will be as seamless as 'scan and go.' You do not need a forex card or a credit card or cash because the UPI App will take you through the checkout process safely from a merchant outlet.

The UPI technology allows money transfers in seconds from person to person (P2P) or person to merchant (P2M) bank accounts. Most Western countries which rely solely on card payments lack real-time payments. And that's where the subsidiary of National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is placing large bets.

Two years ago NIPL was set up as a wholly-owned subsidiary of NPCI to roll out India’s domestic card scheme (RuPay) and mobile payment solution (UPI) in global markets. NIPL is helping countries to build payment ecosystems including P2P P2M and cross-border payments. “Why should one reinvent the wheel? We have done it successfully in India and we want to share it with the world"" says Shukla of NIPL. India’s neighbour Nepal is a classic example of NIPL building a modern digital infrastructure for another country.

In July last year NPCI’s global subsidiary signed up with Bhutan’s central bank to enable the usage of the UPI-powered BHIM App. Bhutan will be the first nation to adopt UPI standards for its QR deployment. This August NIPL signed an MoU with the UK’s payments solutions provider PayXpert to make the UPI-based QR code solutions available in the UK on all PayXpert’s Android POS devices for in-store payments.

UPI acceptance has also gone live with the UAE’s Mashreq Bank which deploys QR code in UAE. In the P2M space Indian travellers and tourists in the UAE can now make payments through BHIM UPI across 10000 shops and merchant stores via NEOPAY the payment subsidiary of Mashreq Bank. In November NIPL also tied up with the UAE’s largest merchant acquirer--Network International--to help Indian travellers visiting the UAE by allowing them to make payments seamlessly through UPI-based mobile applications in retail merchant partners such as jewellers supermarkets and duty-free shops.

By the end of this year five Southeast Asian goliaths--Malaysia Singapore Indonesia Thailand and the Philippines--will sign a contract to combine their respective QR code payment systems. This will pave the way for merchant payments via QR codes throughout the region. “It is really ideal for us to build a pipe with them and start routing the transactions through their infrastructure so we add value to them” says Shukla.

The other big piece for UPI expansion is remittances. India is one of the top recipients of cross-border remittances receiving more than $80 billion annually and sending around $20 billion abroad. The remittance market is dominated by banks money transfer operators (MTOs) and foreign exchange dealers. There are 32 million Indians who live outside India according to market studies.

That number is comparable to the populations of Saudi Arabia Malaysia and Australia combined. “Wherever we see a huge concentration of Indians we are working with the payment players in the remittance space” says Shukla. The current inward remittance infrastructure includes a ‘Rupee Drawing Arrangement’ where the banks in India tie up with global licensed institutions which hold a vostro account on its behalf in the foreign currency. Similarly there are also Money Transfer Service Schemes (MTSS) for remittances for foreign tourists travelling or residing in India. The main payment rails or pipes are something called SWIFT whose network is used to transfer money.

“NPCI is trying to make UPI the rails for transferring money. But that adoption has been slow mainly because of the local regulations and the processes and policies around moving global money"" says Raj K. Founder and CEO of FairexPay a Cross-Border Fintech. But at some point cost-effective real-time settlement globally will be the order of the day. That’s where UPI would be the framework for adoption. “We have identified payment players. We are working in different markets where the progress is in different stages. There are markets where we are discussing commercial and technical issues” says Shukla.

For example NIPL has made a deal with Western Union a world leader in cross-border payments so that money can be transferred into bank accounts in real time. NIPL has also done something strategic by connecting with Singapore’s PayNow which is a popular payments ecosystem. As a result the two fast payments ecosystems will enable real-time money transfers between the two countries. “Once you’ve done it then you can just create a template and go to other markets and start deploying it"" says Shukla. NIPL’s cross-border payments initiative is a work in progress which has huge potential to not only make payment transfers easier and faster but also reduce the high cost of remittances.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2Jsb2dzL3RoZWRhbmlzcG9zdC9kaWdpdGFsLWluZGlhLWlzLWEtZ2xvYmFsLXN1Y2Nlc3Mtc3Rvcnkv0gFfaHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vYmxvZ3MvdGhlZGFuaXNwb3N0L2RpZ2l0YWwtaW5kaWEtaXMtYS1nbG9iYWwtc3VjY2Vzcy1zdG9yeS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Digital India is a global success story,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='timesofindia.indiatimes.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /blogs/thedanispost/digital-india-is-a-global-success-story/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673ECC5330>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2Jsb2dzL3RoZWRhbmlzcG9zdC9kaWdpdGFsLWluZGlhLWlzLWEtZ2xvYmFsLXN1Y2Nlc3Mtc3Rvcnkv0gFfaHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vYmxvZ3MvdGhlZGFuaXNwb3N0L2RpZ2l0YWwtaW5kaWEtaXMtYS1nbG9iYWwtc3VjY2Vzcy1zdG9yeS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,

The Guardians baseball's youngest team finished an unexpected run to the top of the AL Central.

Rookie Steven Kwan hit a grand slam and drove in a season-high five runs as the Guardians clinched a division championship no one thought possible six months ago with a 10-4 win over the Texas Rangers.

When catcher Luke Maile squeezed Josh Smith’s foul pop for the final out the Guardians began celebrating a title that actually became official 15 minutes earlier following second-place Chicago's loss to the Detroit Tigers.

Tied for first on Sept. 4 the Guardians have won seven straight and ripped off 18 wins in 21 games to open a 10-game lead and run away with the division.

“This team’s good. We’re not just young. We’re pretty good"" said starter Cal Quantrill the club leader with 14 wins. ""I don’t think anybody’s excited to face us right now. We’re playing our best baseball. We’re playing baseball the right way.”

This is Cleveland’s 11th Central title since the division’s inception in 1994 and its fourth in 10 years under manager Terry Francona who battled health problems the past two seasons but has enjoyed this ride with a team that may have surprised early on but is now being viewed as a legitimate World Series threat.

“For what our guys did and when you’re doing it with people that you absolutely care about and love and respect it means a lot” Francona said before his statement was interrupted by a bone-chilling dousing.

“I’m amazed by these guys” said Chris Antonetti the team’s president of baseball operations. “They came together and played the game the right way.”

This season wasn’t supposed to happen.

After dropping Indians as their nickname following the 2021 season a move that rankled a sizable portion of Cleveland’s fan base the Guardians did little to upgrade their roster in free agency as the front office decided 2022 would be devoted to seeing what it had.

As it turned out Cleveland’s kids were more than all right.

Maybe no one more so than Kwan a 25-year-old with a game way beyond his years. He made the roster in spring training and has been the Guardians’ pesky leadoff hitter from opening day working pitchers into deep counts before slapping hits and becoming an annoyance on the base paths.

It was fitting that it was Kwan who led the way to Sunday's clinch.

“Help any team I was on whether it had been Triple-A or the majors” Kwan said of his goals this season. ""I think that helped me in college travel ball whatever. I know if I focus on helping the team and others then everything will fall into place.”

Kwan’s slam in the eighth inning barely cleared the wall and bounced back into play. He wasn’t sure it out until signaled by first-base umpire Bruce Dreckman. He said his reaction was “black out.”

With bigger games ahead Kwan wasn't ready to reflect on what he and his teammates have accomplished.

“I definitely want to keep my head down keep it rolling.” he said. “Maybe in a superstitious kind of way don’t want to take my eyes off anything. Keep it going forward.”

The Guardians have defied the odds from the start and became the first team to win a division with at least 16 rookies making their major league debuts.

The season began with low expectations everywhere but inside Cleveland's clubhouse. Maybe is was naivete but the Guardians believed they could be special and that's exactly what's happened.

“From Day One they’ve come together” Antonetti said. “You go around the clubhouse the tone our veteran players set like José Ramírez Amed Rosario Shane Bieber Austin Hedges. ‘Tito’ (Francona) said just find a way to help the team win.

“They embraced that mentality.”

The Guardians have done it with an offense that puts the ball in play solid and often spectacular defense and a lights-out bullpen anchored by closer Emmanuel Clase (a big league-best 39 saves).

Cleveland strikes out less than any team in the majors and nobody goes from first to third better.

Amid the clubhouse chaos Antonetti made a point to credit the 63-year-old Francona who won two World Series with Boston and may have had his best season after dealing with serious medial issues.

“To think of what he’s overcome personally to get to this point” Antonetti said. “This is a special moment for ‘Tito.’""

UP NEXT

Guardians: Bieber (12-8 2.81 ERA) will open a three-game series on Tuesday at home against Tampa Bay in a possible preview of a first-round postseason series. Bieber will face RHP Corey Kluber (10-9 4.30) a two-time Cy Young winner during nine seasons in Cleveland.

Rangers: Play three games at Seattle beginning Tuesday. Texas hasn’t announced a starter for the opener to face LHP Robbie Ray (12-10 3.60).

That is just one of the things that Bubba Thompson provides for the Texas Rangers. Since joining the big club in early August the 24-year old outfielder has made quite an impression. He has quickly become a fan favorite at Globe Life Field and it is fair to say that he just might find himself in the discussion to make the Rangers’ roster in 2023. To do that however he needs to keep doing what he has been doing for the past seven weeks. That would be getting on base and stealing as many bases as he possibly can.

Bubba Thompson

Bubba Thompson made his major league debut on August 4 of this year. Since then he has played in 44 games for the Rangers. He has a batting average of .284 over 134 at-bats. He doesn’t have that much power in his bat as he only has one home run to his credit in 2022. Bubba Thompson’s main weapon on the field is his speed. In the 44 games that he has played he has swiped a total of 16 bases. For the time being Thompson is hitting near the bottom of the Rangers’ order. That could change in time if keeps doing what he has been doing.

Bubba Thompson has also proven himself to be a real asset in the outfield as well. Since his debut he has a fielding percentage of .981. He has played the majority of his games in left field for the Rangers and his speed has also proven to be valuable in that respect. He has only made two errors this season. Both of those errors occurred when he was patrolling left field. So it appears to be a safe conclusion that he will spend the majority of his time in right field. In the 257 innings that he has spent in the outfield Thompson has made 53 putouts in a total of 54 chances.

Bubba’s Future

Once he is given the chance to really stretch out Bubba Thompson could potentially become a .300 hitter for the Rangers. Given his .280 average that probably won’t happen this year as the Rangers only have 12 games remaining on their schedule in 2022. However if he makes the team out of spring training in 2023 he has a very good chance to reach that mark of .300. It will also be very interesting to see where the Rangers put Bubba Thompson in the order next year.

Chances are that he won’t stay in the eighth spot for very long next year. With his speed he has the potential to be a very good leadoff hitter someday. As stated earlier he does not have much power in his bat and that will need to be taken into consideration when determining his spot in the lineup for next year. He is still very young and he still has much to learn at the major league level. He has some great teammates that can teach him along the way however. Fellow outfielders Adolis Garcia and Kole Calhoun could be great mentors for Bubba Thompson. Bubba Thompson has a great future head of him for the Texas Rangers and both the team and the fans are looking forward to watching that happen.

On Oct. 10 2008 the driver who struck Lucas did not stop or call 911.

Press conferences followed in 2009 and 2013 at which Lucas’ mother Judie Moore and his grandfather Gerald Shortreed stood with police and pleaded for someone to come forward.

Early on police believed the car involved was an older model white Dodge Neon.

Two billboards and numerous posters appeared around the county and an Armstrong Trucking trailer driven around the province was plastered with the 18-year-old’s face and bold text advertising a “$50000 reward” for information.

But it wasn’t enough to stir the conscience of anyone out there who knew what happened.

As the family was left to mourn the lost life of their son brother and grandson whoever hit and killed Lucas had already made the decision to move on with theirs – a decision repeated over and over as 5094 days came and went.

But on Sept. 21 police appeared at Moore’s Fergus home with word of a new development in the case of her son’s death.

That morning police executed a warrant at a Sideroad 21 address in Mapleton and took Arthur residents David Alexander Halliburton and Anastasia Marie Halliburton into custody.

David is charged with failing to stop at the scene of an accident involving bodily harm or death and Anastasia is charged with accessory after the fact (to commit an indictable offence).

Both have also been charged with obstructing justice having knowledge of unauthorized possession of a weapon and careless storage of a weapon prohibited device or ammunition.

The allegations have yet to be proven in court.

Neighbours told the Advertiser David was a transport truck driver who came and went and largely kept to himself.

Both appeared for the first time in Guelph court on Sept. 22 and were released later that day. Their next court date is Oct. 25.

Publication bans are in place on details stemming from bail hearings and any identifying information of victims or witnesses.

Moore has long wondered if the day would ever come when the car would be found.

But with the passing of time expectations changed and finding out who caused her son’s death became less of a priority.

Eventually she stopped caring at all about whether the day would come.

“Now that it has I’m glad” she said in an interview at her home on Thursday.

“It has made me feel better than I thought it would.”

Around 100 kilometres away in Etobicoke Lucas’ sister Jenneen Beattie was readying for her daughter’s dentist appointment on Wednesday when she read a news report about the arrests.

Her initial reaction was one of disbelief that the car had been found after so long.

Beattie gave up hope four years ago after posting a 10th anniversary video about Lucas to Facebook in the hope it would go viral and provoke a clue.

“After that video I kind of packed it away” Beattie said by phone her voice breaking.

“I really just kind of gave up hope after 10 years that we’d find anything.”

The news and conversations have reopened deep wounds and stirred complex unresolved emotions for a family with relationships strained by the damage wrought by unanswered questions and the untold ripple effects of Lucas’ death.

“Our family hasn’t even gathered on Thanksgiving and had a proper Thanksgiving dinner since this has happened” Beattie said.

“We’ve lost a lot.”

Moore says she has lost more than her son. “You lose a little piece of yourself too.”

Police have so far divulged little to the family Moore said.

According to Beattie police intend to meet with the family next week.

“Hopefully they’ll tell us [more] when things settle down” Moore said.

She commended the Wellington County OPP saying “they did their due diligence for sure” over years of investigating tips.

“I am positive that they followed up on anybody who said ‘Oh there was a white neon’ and I know at first they were getting a ridiculous amount of calls … and they would still go and look” she added.

Moore always imagined whoever hit and killed her son was from outside Wellington County blissfully unaware of their daily suffering.

Having two local people accused is more difficult to comprehend.

“If [the driver] had stopped none of this would be happening right now” she said struggling to find words to express her bewilderment.

“That is not a person I want to know or try to understand.”

Moore hopes her son’s death isn’t in vain and that people can learn from the family’s experience.

“I want it out there: this is partly Lucas’ fault” she said adding her son shouldn’t have left the party to wander down a county road while inebriated.

Jesse Matthews a friend of Lucas and his brother Marcus told the Advertiser he struggles wondering how Lucas’ life could have turned out differently.

“I was at that party and we were going to get him a ride … and he just wanted to walk it off and it just tears me apart because we had him a ride and then this [happened]” Matthews said by phone.

“I’ll come meet you there later” were the last words Tarique Todd said to Lucas his best friend as Lucas left the party.

Todd met Lucas in Grade 7 and the two became fast friends.

“He was just a big teddy bear a big huge guy who loved everybody” Todd told the Advertiser by phone. “He always put a smile on everyone’s face.”

After his death Todd and three other close friends got the Wu-Tang Clan hip-hop group’s logo—a stylized letter ‘W’ resembling a flying bird—tattooed on them with Lucas’ name or his nickname “Pigglet” in the middle.

“Everytime anyone hears ODB or another Wu-Tang song you just turn it up and smile and think of the guy” Todd said.

The arrests mean a lot to friends who were close to Lucas.

For Todd the arrests mean that his best friend’s life “didn’t just go away” and called the news a “complete bombshell.”

But the outcome from the court process he said will “never bring back Luc.”

“People say this is closure now but it will never be closure it’s actually just starting now after 14 years … and it’s bringing up a lot of emotions for people that loved him” Todd said.

Moore hopes the legal process doesn’t drag out but said closing the case and putting it behind her is only a tiny part of a much larger journey.

“I feel like I’ve never properly mourned Lucas” she said.

The day she learned about her son’s death the family was coincidentally moving from one home to another.

She had three other children to look after and her mother had recently suffered a stroke.

She also couldn’t afford to take much time away from work.

Of the past 32 years of her memories of Lucas Moore said 14 have been marred by the search for who left him for dead.

It has been increasingly difficult to focus on the positive memories she said rather than those overshadowed by sorrow.

In all those years Moore said she hasn’t felt able to take time by her son’s grave and sit with her emotions.

“My plan is to now mourn – to take the time” she said.",,,,,,,,,

Back then LJN made action figures based on the game but the TV show based on the game went mostly unrepresented. In the 1983 cartoon a group of kids enter a Dungeons & Dragons amusement park ride and find themselves transported into a fantasy realm. There they have magical weapons and embody different character classes from the game. The new Dungeons & Dragons Cartoon Classics line brings three of those kids into three dimensions along with their mentor and arch-foe.

Previously the animated characters had only appeared as PVC figures in Europe. Each of the new figures comes fully articulated with signature weapon. They also include a special die apiece — collect them all to make an exclusive set.

The first wave includes Hank the ranger Diana the acrobat Bobby the barbarian with baby unicorn Uni and a two-pack of the Dungeon Master and Venger. Venger includes his big wings and alternate spellcasting hands. All figures are currently Target exclusives although after September 30 only Venger and Dungeon Master will be exclusives. The individual figures run $24.99 with the two-pack at $49.99.

Check them all out in the gallery below. Are you glad to finally have these? Let us know in comments.

American confectionary brand Hershey’s have teamed up with Japanese confectionary brand Monteur to create some delicious treats perfect for the upcoming autumn months. The two companies have worked together before and previous collaborations were wildly popular. This year looks like it will be just as popular and new products were released on September 1.

We were lucky enough to receive a sample of some of the products on sale and were blown away by the rich sweet taste. So sweet and tasty were they that we instantly felt an overwhelming sadness as the collaboration will come to a close at the end of September!

But instead of lamenting what could have been (i.e. eating Hershey’s and Monteur sweets until our bodies eventually give out) we decided to treasure the time that we do have and gave all products we were lucky enough to be sent a thorough taste test.

▼ Hershey’s x Monteur Caramel Chocolate Cream Puff — 129 yen (US$0.90)

At a glance you’d be forgiven for assuming this Caramel Chocolate Cream Puff was just an ordinary cream puff but that will all change once you bite into the puff and reach the filling.

▼ We dare you to look at this without your mouth instantly watering.

Inside the cream puff is not one but two layers of deliciousness; a cream made with Hershey’s cocoa and a melt-in-your-mouth caramel sauce. The caramel sauce has a hint of bitterness which goes well with the sweet chocolate cream.

▼ Hershey’s x Monteur Caramel Chocolate Eclair — 129 yen (US$0.90)

Next up is the Caramel Chocolate Eclair another product with a luxurious taste. It also has chocolate cream and caramel sauce as a filling. Let’s take a look at the cross-section.

The chocolate layer on the outside has a slight bitter flavour and a crispy texture which pairs well with the creamy filling.

▼ Hershey’s x Monteur Caramel Chocolate Roll Cakes — 388 yen (US$2.70)

Finally we tried the Caramel Chocolate Roll Cake which comes pre-cut into four pieces. The filling is a mix of whipped cream caramel sauce and chocolate flakes and the sponge layer is made using cocoa from Hershey’s.

The cake comes precut in four slices making it the perfect treat to share with your friends and family.

▼ Or you can do as we did and devour the whole thing by yourself.

All products in the Monteur x Hershey’s collaboration all have a delightful combination of bitter and sweet tastes and you can taste the caramel and chocolate with each bite.

The Hershey’s x Monteur products are on sale in all areas of Japan except for the southern region of Kyushu and will be on sale until the end of September.

And while Kyushuites might be missing out on trying the Hershey’s collaboration this time they’ve got something equally delicious to keep them satisfied.

Bill and Jen Wintermyer | September 24 2022

The score and the stats are a stark contrast to the outcome of the game. With nearly two-thirds of the stadium packed and electric atmosphere fans saw the game end with Hershey’s win over Milton Hershey 28 to 21.

The game really came down to one series with Milton Hershey starting at their own 24-yard line driving the ball down field with a balanced rushing and throwing series. Milton Hershey got to Hershey’s 4-yard line with first and goal but then was unable to score and turned the ball over on downs. This changed the course of the game by seeming to take all the momentum away from Milton Hershey.

Hershey countered starting at the 4-yard line moving the ball on 8 rushing attempts and 1 passing attempt before they stalled and were forced to punt. While they didn’t score on this drive they did eat up a ton of clock.

The first score was a result of a Hershey 14-yerd rushing touchdown by Angel Cabrera at 6:29 in the first. Hershey got their second score following another Angel Cabrera 4-yard rush with only 52 seconds left in the first. First quartered ended 14-0 Hershey.

Milton Hershey marched downfield and scored in the second quarter after a 29-yard dash by Elijah Johnson at 9:32. Hershey responded starting at their on 19-yard line and ending with Angel Cabrera scoring his third touchdown of the game following a 29-yard scamper. Milton Hershey scored with less than a minute on the clock ending the half at Hershey 21 Milton Hershey 14.

Starting on a short field Milton Hershey only needed 5 plays to score on a 10-yard touchdown pass from Kenneth Emile to Mohamad Koroma tying the game at 8:56 in the third quarter. Hershey 21 Milton Hershey 21. Hershey responded with Quarterback Daniel Painter running in the ball for a score at 5:38. Hershey 28 Milton Hershey 21.

The fourth quarter saw no scores but lots of great play by both teams but the game ended Hershey 28 Milton Hershey 21.

To realize the promise of the Internet of Things (IoT) companies cannot continue to use legacy technologies. Legacy data centers process discrete files and objects but the constant flow of data from IoT devices represent something new: data streams.

Data streams don’t have a beginning or an end to provide natural starting and stopping points for processing. Legacy data processing technology that depends upon batch processing cannot expand quickly enough to avoid throughput bottlenecks and the resulting delays affect the critical functions of ingestion processing and analysis.

To make practical use of real-time data streams from sensors security cameras medical devices and other time-critical information flows the data must be ingested and processed quickly. Dell’s Streaming Data Platform provides a scalable solution to rapidly accommodate high volumes of IoT data and make it available for real-time analysis.

See below to learn all about Dell Streaming Data Platform and where it stands in the storage sector:

Dell Streaming Data Platform key benefits

Customers that pursue solutions such as the Dell Streaming Data Platform hope to gain the following key benefits.

Consolidate infrastructure

Dell’s Streaming Data Platform not only enables rapid data flows that keep up with IoT information sources it also can expand to encompass and replace existing legacy infrastructure. The expandability of a single platform eliminates the need to maintain and secure multiple technologies.

Edge data control

The Dell Streaming Platform solution installs into local or cloud data centers completely under the control of the organization. The solution directly ingests data feeds and provides a single solution incorporating analysis and alerting. After processing the Streaming Data Platform can directly feed the data into local data centers or whatever cloud storage provider might be desired for long-term storage.

Maximize IoT information insights

The surging quantities of information from IoT devices continues to grow in number and in richness. However if an organization cannot keep up with the pace of the information it will fail to receive information on a timely basis and be able to act.

Adopting the Dell Streaming Data Platform enables an enterprise to continuously match the growing needs of the IoT feeds for ingestion processing and analysis. If needed the system can also scale to incorporate historical data flows to help catch up to information backlogs and provide the maximum information for alerts and artificial intelligence (AI) analysis and to minimize the delays for intelligent reactions.

Simplified deployment

Enterprises always have the option to build their own stream solution but these do-it-yourself (DIY) solutions consume enormous development time for integration vulnerability testing debugging and deployment. The true value to the company comes from the information extracted from the data stream so deploying a packaged solution enables companies to extract value more efficiently and much faster.

Dell Streaming Data Platform use cases

RWTH Aachen University

The scientists mathematicians and software developers collaborating in the Laboratory for Machine Tools for RWTH Aachen University (WZL) seek new insights from machine product and manufacturing data. Various sensors in WZL’s custom metal fineblanking incubators generate more than 1 million data points per second and small localized data processing created huge delays in making necessary adjustments.

“We wanted to use high-frequency data to help manufacturers analyze changes in their processes monitor output and process quality and make adjustments in real time” explained Philipp Niemietz head of digital technologies for WZL.

Adopting Dell’s Streaming Data Platform provided the lab with the capabilities to make AI-guided adjustments based on real-time analysis of the sensor data.

“No matter how many sensors we use once we set up the analytics pipeline and the data streams we don’t have to address any load-balancing issues” said Niemietz.

Other use cases

Itzik Reich VP technologist of ISG at Dell published a blog in which he illustrates real-world test cases to which the Dell Streaming Data Platform was successfully applied to replace batch and real-time processes. These use cases cover a broad variety of applications such as:

Video feeds from a fleet of drones monitor the real time health of cattle.

A sheet metal manufacturer uses real-time temperature sensor data streams to replace ineffective real-time and variance batch pipelines to make automated adjustments and maintain temperature within optimal thresholds.

Real-time video footage of airplane take-offs and landings can be used to automatically detect abnormalities that might require maintenance.

The faster data processing of the Streaming Data Platform permits more responsive preventative measures and subtle adjustments than legacy solutions.

While the blog does not quote specific customers Reich notes that customers often enjoy a reduction in their physical infrastructure and management time required for software and stack operations. The blog also focuses on the infrastructure savings from simplified IT architecture and the elimination of redundant data storage.

Dell Streaming Data Platform differentiators

When selecting the Dell Streaming Data Platform over other possible edge processing solutions an organization will typically do so because of the following differentiators.

Dell management platform

Dell’s proprietary management software for the Streaming Data Platform uses dynamic and automatic management of systems to turbo-charge the open-source foundation of the platform. The management software:

Distributes data processing and analytical jobs over the available infrastructure

Satisfies processing requirements in real time

Configures data stream properties

Controls application deployment

Provides critical information such as operations metrics and job status

Deployment options

Streaming Data Platform is available in various versions for flexible deployment:

SDP Core: On-premises data center implementation that enables real-time data ingestion and feeds from other SDP deployments. Supports 3–12 nodes.

SDP Edge: Edge deployment implementation with local processing filtering and enriching capabilities. Deployable on single (no high availability requirement) or three physical nodes (high availability requirement).

SDP Micro: Lightweight version of SDP Edge specifically for low-volume data from sensors without gateways. Can only be installed on a single virtual or physical node.

Open-source with support

Built on open-source community built-and-tested components Dell’s Streaming Data Platform provides the flexibility to avoid future vendor lock-in. However the solution is also backed by Dell ProSupport Plus as well as Dell’s enormous sales and support network. This support network delivers the expert consulting needs an organization may want for an effective implementation.

Unified platform

Organizations can create their own mix of technologies to duplicate the capabilities of the Dell Streaming Data Platform. Yet Dell’s unified solution provides turn-key availability for rapid deployment and integrated features that eliminate the need for tedious operational and security testing.

Conclusions

Not all enterprises have a need to process real-time data streams. However as IoT and operational technology (OT) continues to evolve and become network connected more businesses and governments will find themselves developing the need to handle streaming data sources.

Real-time processing and analysis of streaming data can enable nimble and accurate adjustments of processes or rapid detection of issues that could save a fortune — if addressed early. The Dell Streaming Data Platform enables scalable support for data streams of all types and should be evaluated as a potential solution for in-house data streaming needs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhdGFtYXRpb24uY29tL3N0b3JhZ2Uvc2VhZ2F0ZS1seXZlLWNsb3VkLXJldmlldy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Seagate: Lyve Cloud Review,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhdGFtYXRpb24uY29tL3N0b3JhZ2Uvc2VhZ2F0ZS1seXZlLWNsb3VkLXJldmlldy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002674164ED10>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

At Home Depot on Palm Beach Lakes Blvd in West Palm Beach store manager Dexter Pinto said every year customers come in at the last minute looking for items that are sometimes sold out.

""It's best if you go over that hurricane checklist and make sure you're checking those things off days in advance"" said Pinto. ""Really hurricane hardware and screws things like that are sometimes the things people tend to forget.""

Pinto said customers are often short screws or wingnuts for their shutters and their batteries don't work for their flashlights.

""Just don't wait till the last minute"" said Pinto. ""Get in as early as you can. We've got a lot of knowledgeable help in the stores a lot of associates that are willing to get down and help. Come in as early as you can and prep beforehand don't wait until the last minute.""

Pinto said it's also good to test your generator before the risk of losing power arises.

WPTV First Alert Meteorologists have put together a full personalized hurricane supply list to make sure no items are left behind.

During Honeywell’s Air Mobility Summit last week the eVTOL company remained firm that the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) decision to certify winged eVTOL aircraft under a 21.17 (b) special class instead of existing Part 23 rules is more of an “administrative change.”

During Honeywell’s Air Mobility Summit last week policymakers regulators and technology leaders came together to discuss what the U.S. needs to do to lead the global advanced air mobility industry and support this nascent sector. Honeywell Image

Under the new regulatory framework Joby signed a revised G-1 Certification Basis with the FAA this summer replacing a previous agreement it had signed in 2020. The company — just like Archer Aviation which is seeking type certification by the end of 2024 — remains steadfast that its type certification timeline is on track.

But the hurdle is in the operations and pilot training which the FAA now has to address under a special federal aviation regulation (SFAR). The SFAR requires formal rulemaking and with companies like Joby and Archer planning to operate its own eVTOL aircraft it’s a necessary step in their go-to-market plans. The industry anticipates the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) will be ready this fall followed by a final SFAR implemented by the end of 2024.

The FAA’s decision to change its course on eVTOL certification could also have an impact on international validation — an issue all eVTOL startups with planned international operations are working through. Joby for example has made headway in this area by being what it calls the first eVTOL company to formally apply for foreign validation of its expected FAA type certification kick-starting its planned operations in the U.K.

Aviation authorities themselves are also making inroads with international collaboration. The U.S. and U.K. announced a transatlantic agreement in March that would smooth the path for certification between the regions and earlier this summer the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) announced it will be adopting the European Union Aviation Safety Agency’s (EASA) certification standards for eVTOL aircraft.

Leadership in advanced air mobility (AAM)

As the industry gears up for the upcoming FAA reauthorization bill in 2023 Caryn Lund head of public affairs at Lilium told attendees during Honeywell’s summit that the eVTOL company wants to see a clear mandate from U.S. authorities to lead the world when it comes to AAM.

And rather than focusing on policies that only support first movers Wisk Aero which is developing a four-seat autonomous aircraft wants to see long-term regulations that would keep pace with the technology that’s already available allowing AAM to scale up and companies like Wisk to launch its autonomous operations.

In addition to aircraft certification Beta Technologies is pushing for the FAA to finalize and publish vertiport standards to support eVTOL operations. The aviation authority released its draft engineering brief in March but the document has largely remained stagnant even as EASA publishes its own advanced draft for vertiport specifications and ASTM International releases what it believes is the first official vertiport standard specification published in the world.

With the FAA changing course on eVTOL certification and operations regulations the policymakers regulators and technology leaders speaking at Honeywell’s event largely agreed that the U.S. has some significant work ahead of it if it wants to maintain its leadership in aviation.

“If the U.S. doesn’t take a leadership role either someone else will do it or it won’t get done at all” said Rep. Jay Obernolte (R-California) co-chair of the Congressional AAM Caucus along with Rep. Jimmy Panetta (D-California). “We are really at an inflection point in the industry. It’s such a critical time for Congress to get involved.”

Since the Wright brothers’ first flight in 1903 the U.S. has historically been a leader in aviation but that doesn’t necessarily mean the U.S. will lead in AAM Panetta said.

From vertiport infrastructure development to government funding to support innovation to solutions that would address workforce shortages and skills training the summit saw policymakers and industry leaders discuss how the U.S. government could help support this nascent industry.

Two pieces of legislation are in the works to help develop U.S. leadership in AAM and support infrastructure for eVTOL operations — the Advanced Aviation Infrastructure Modernization Act and the Advanced Air Mobility Coordination and Leadership Act.

If signed into law the Infrastructure Act would provide $25 million in grants over two years to plan and build vertiport infrastructure for AAM operations and the Coordination and Leadership Act would direct the department of transportation to create an interagency working group composed of leaders from key government agencies to focus on creating an AAM network in the U.S.

“Great countries have always had great transportation systems” said Edward Bolen president and CEO of the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “What we’re looking at here is an opportunity to build our great transportation system.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2lyYW4tbWlkZGxlLWVhc3QtcHJlc2lkZW50aWFsLWVsZWN0aW9ucy10ZWhyYW4tZDhiOGFmYTYxYTQyZmY0NGMzMGJmNWU2YmQ1ZDE4M2LSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Analysis: Latest Iran protests likely not last for Tehran,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2lyYW4tbWlkZGxlLWVhc3QtcHJlc2lkZW50aWFsLWVsZWN0aW9ucy10ZWhyYW4tZDhiOGFmYTYxYTQyZmY0NGMzMGJmNWU2YmQ1ZDE4M2LSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673EBC1FF0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The new name for Dines Green Community Academy was finally revealed on a day of celebration for the new west Worcester school.

Special guests enjoyed a ‘bee’ themed afternoon tea and tour of the new school interior before a presentation from Dafydd Lawday CEO of the Mercian Educational Trust and headteacher Andrew Morley.

Parents gathered in the school playground to see their children in the newly branded Honeywell Primary School uniform for the first time.





The dynamic project and investment from the Mercian Educational Trust marks a new chapter for the school. The trust has worked to develop a robust curriculum and improved facilities to offer a breadth of education at Honeywell Primary School and the re-branding illustrates this perfectly. This next step will go further to reinforce the school values strong local heritage and community spirit.

The Trust employed Worcester based Marketing Agency ADD Marketing to manage the re-branding project and interior transformation.

Honeywell Primary School is now a space that works in synergy with the environment. The corridors are adorned with grassy walls brightly coloured ropes hexagonal panels and cork display boards while trailing plants foliage and insects’ nest in the ceilings with newly imagined outdoor spaces. The interior is bright inspiring with an array of colours and textures for the pupils to enjoy.

Pupils also enjoyed a visit and workshops with Worcester-based textile artist Michelle Flint who will be working on a piece of artwork with the school to be displayed in the main reception area.

Cricketers from Worcestershire County Cricket Foundation joined in the celebrations with cricket tutorials taking place throughout the day.

Dafydd Lawday CEO of the Mercian Educational Trust said: “We have been working on this pioneering project for some time now and are hugely excited to see the full rebrand complete and our pupils staff and parents enjoying Honeywell Primary School.

“The unveiling the new name and branding for our school is just one part of the school’s transformation this heralds the start of things to come we are embracing a bright future with energy and excitement.”

Headteacher Andrew Morley said: “The official launch of Honeywell Primary school marks the first page of our new chapter of evolution which we as a school community will embrace together with optimism and confidence.

“We will enable our children to look outward and expand their horizons through exploration and achievement. Importantly our pupils started their first day of a new academic year with a big smile on their face ready to begin their new adventures.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vcHVuY2huZy5jb20vYnVoYXJpLWFwcHJvdmVzLW9vbi1hd2FyZC1mb3ItZXgtaG9uZXl3ZWxsLW1kL9IBRmh0dHBzOi8vcHVuY2huZy5jb20vYnVoYXJpLWFwcHJvdmVzLW9vbi1hd2FyZC1mb3ItZXgtaG9uZXl3ZWxsLW1kLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Buhari approves OON award for ex-Honeywell MD,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='punchng.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /buhari-approves-oon-award-for-ex-honeywell-md/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673EBC3430>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vcHVuY2huZy5jb20vYnVoYXJpLWFwcHJvdmVzLW9vbi1hd2FyZC1mb3ItZXgtaG9uZXl3ZWxsLW1kL9IBRmh0dHBzOi8vcHVuY2huZy5jb20vYnVoYXJpLWFwcHJvdmVzLW9vbi1hd2FyZC1mb3ItZXgtaG9uZXl3ZWxsLW1kLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,

They are often stocked with the same items personally selected by Her Majesty The Queen and other members of the Royal Family marked by what's known as a royal warrant.

Popular products such as HP Sauce Kellogg's Corn Flakes Burberry clothing Clarins skin care or Elizabeth Arden cosmetics can all display a royal coat of arms marking them as a product chosen by Her Majesty.

But those seals of approval may evaporate following the Queen's death this month leaving some brands wondering if they'll continue to enjoy the favour of royal households as His Majesty King Charles takes the throne.

HP Sauce through its parent company Heinz holds a royal warrant though it's not visible on these bottles. Heinz was officially the 'Purveyors of Heinz Products' to HM The Queen a role that could admittedly be difficult for another company to fill. (Sang Tan/Associated Press)

""There is incredible loyalty associated with with the royal coat of arms"" said Feizal Chatur CEO of Araam Inc. in Edmonton.

Chatur's company is the Canadian manufacturer of Hypnos mattresses one of more than 700 brands that currently hold a royal warrant.

That means the brand carries the stamp of approval from Queen Elizabeth and the company can display signage indicating that ""By Appointment to HM The Queen"" Hypnos products are official royal bedding and upholstery manufacturers.

Hypnos Ltd. held the royal warrant for the Queen's mattresses; Edmonton-based company Araam is the sole Canadian manufacturer. (Royal Warrant Holders Association)

Essentially it's the mattress of choice for generations of Royals at many of their palaces including Buckingham and Kensington Palaces as well as Windsor and Balmoral Castles.

The implied endorsement the royal warrant provides means significant prestige according to the Canadian branch of the mattress company.

""If it's good enough for the late Queen then it's definitely good enough for a consumer"" said Chatur in an interview with CBC Radio's The Cost of Living. Both Queen Elizabeth and the Queen Mother issued royal warrants for Hypnos mattresses according to Chatur.

Influencers before the internet

Royal warrants have been granted by the Royal Family since the 15th century with royal coats of arms being displayed by businesses since the 18th.

It's a history that makes the British Royals by some measure the original influencers before there were telephones let alone the internet and Instagram.

""Over the years the royal warrants have become if you like a … mark for quality of service and product"" said Paul Alger director of international affairs at the U.K. Fashion and Textile Association.

It keeps you on your toes in terms of quality and upholding the prestige. - Feizal Chatur CEO of Araam Inc. in Edmonton Alberta

""It's a recognition factor that the Royal Family is bestowing on these great British brands.""

While it's difficult to attach a dollar (or pound) figure to the brand equity granted by royal warrants the mark of quality is still important for many consumers. For instance gloves endorsed by the Queen would obviously pass muster said Alger as Her Majesty would be shaking hundreds of hands a day in them.

Global consumers also value seeing the royal coat of arms according to the trade expert.

""When we look at key international markets Japan China Korea for example those markets are absolutely fascinated by the royal warrant and any connection to the Royal Family … the Chinese in particular are really really passionate fans of royal warrant products"" said Alger.

What happens with a new sovereign?

With Charles now in charge it could mean many of HM The Queen's royal warrants will go away.

According to the Royal Warrant Holders Association when the person sitting on the throne changes existing businesses may continue to display a royal coat of arms for up to two years. But the royal warrant itself if it was issued by the late Queen becomes void.

The Royal household will now have to review who was granted the seal of approval said the Royal Warrant Holders Association in an email to CBC Radio.

This could mean for example the Queen's umbrellas of choice — Fulton Umbrellas — may be looking for a new endorsement in the coming years. Her love of Cadbury chocolate and its status as chocolate manufacturer to HM The Queen may need to be reviewed by Charles.

Gordon's gin holder of a royal warrant as official gin distiller to HM The Queen may no longer be as favoured as her Royal household is technically defunct and replaced with a new monarch's.

Warrants issued by the now-former Prince of Wales stay valid however despite Charles's elevation in status because the now-former Prince of Wales' household is still considered to exist.

Hence London & Scottish International manufacturer of Juniper Green Organic Gin can continue to enjoy its royal warrant as ""supplier of organic spirits"" to Charles even though he has exchanged HRH for HM.

Can any old Royal give them out?

Royal warrants could be only granted by the Queen the Duke of Edinburgh and the Prince of Wales in recent years.

Companies or businesspeople who hold a Warrant do not provide their products for free according to the Holders Association and do not pay for the royal warrant itself.

The main if not only tangible benefit is the right to display a coat of arms on their product or premises.

Hear from Paul Alger of the UK Fashion & Textile Association on Royal Warrants: Cost of Living 27:30 The Queen's death and what it means for HP Sauce or Burberry

They also are not the exclusive providers of products to the Royal household; a member of the Royal Family can purchase from anyone with or without the official seal of approval.

However as Charles's household takes over at Buckingham Palace consumers may start to see the new monarch's own preferences appear on the Royal Warrant lists.

""I think there is every likelihood that we will start to see ethical and sustainable causes coming through"" said Paul Alger in conversation with CBC Radio's Paul Haavardsrud on The Cost of Living.

""Those causes are interesting because … His Majesty was talking about sustainability and looking after the planet 30 years ago long before it was fashionable to start talking about these things.""

As for Edmonton's mattress manufacturer the CEO of Araam is hopeful the Royal households continue to use the Hypnos mattress after generations of kings queens princes and princesses sleeping on the product since 1929.

Will Charles III enjoy the same mattresses as Elizabeth II? Hypnos Ltd. has two years to find out before it has to stop displaying royal iconography. (Hannah McKay/The Associated Press)

But Feizal Chatur admits it's possible that King Charles and Queen Consort Camilla may have different preferences than Queen Elizabeth — and that drives his company to keep standards high.

""That's the beauty of the of the warrant in in my opinion because it it renews every five years or on the passing of the late Queen. So it keeps you on your toes in terms of quality and upholding the prestige the warrant provides manufacturers.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnhkYS1kZXZlbG9wZXJzLmNvbS9ocC1lbGl0ZS1kcmFnb25mbHktZzMtcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HP Elite Dragonfly G3 review: An ultralight and stylish business laptop,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.xda-developers.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /hp-elite-dragonfly-g3-review/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673E94B9A0>, 'Connection to www.xda-developers.com timed out.

4MATIC

The 21st of September marked a heartbreaking day forV8 purists as the Affalterbach-based brand officially introduced their latest addition to the line-up powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged M139 four-cylinder engine similar to the one found on the CLA 45 or GLA 45 models. In this iteration the powerplant has been mounted longitudinally as is the case for the C 43 or SL 43.Mercedes-AMG straightforwardly depicted their vision for the C 63 S E PERFORMANCE as following a ""revolutionary concept [that] brings a completely new approach to the segment which until now has been primarily characterized by the promise purely of performance. With a maximum system output of 680 hp (ps) we do indeed keep this promise.""Yes you read it right. AMG's most powerful C-Class-based vehicle ever produces 671 hp (680 ps) and 752 lb-ft (1020 Nm) of torque thanks to a proprietary 400-volt high-performance battery the P3 intelligent hybrid drivetrain concept and an electrically assisted turbocharger all of which highlight some remarkable engineering skills on their behalf.On its own the gasoline engine outputs 469 horsepower (476 ps) making it the world's most potent four-cylinder powerplants. Put together another 201 hp (204 ps) of the electric motor and couple the assembly to a nine-speed multi-clutch transmission and the+ all-wheel drive and you get a claimed acceleration time from standstill to 62 mph (100 kph) of just 3.4 seconds. These numbers are enough to terrorize its closest rivals such as the 2023 BMW M3 the 2023 Cadillac CT4-V Blackwing  or Audi RS 4.The battery is capable of supporting rapid and consistent charging and discharging cycles assisted by direct cooling of its cells comparable to AMG's Formula 1 racing cars. Even more the system accounts for a 13-kilometer (8-mile) electric range enabling quite a usable operating radius no matter urban or residential areas. Notably the instantaneous reaction of the electric drive at the rear axle combined with the variable all-wheel drive with Drift Mode capability and the standard-fit rear-axle steering give the new C 63 supercar-matching driving athletics.The exterior appearance of the new C 63 S E PERFORMANCE emphasizes a form-over-function approach with muscular proportions. A heavily modified AMG bodyshell serves as the foundation for both the Saloon and Estate versions. It stands 2.9 inches (76 mm) wider and 3.2 inches (83 mm) longer with a 0.4-inch (10 mm) extended wheelbase compared to a regular C-Class.A few distinguishing features of the new C 63 S E PERFORMANCE exterior appearance are the narrow air outlet in the center of the bonnet which flows into two power domes or the round badge with a black AMG emblem replacing the Mercedes star with laurel wreath seen on past models. The AMG-specific radiator grille with vertical struts and the front apron with a jet-wing appearance are other noteworthy design elements.Aerodynamics plays a defining role in the look of this vehicle the airflow being carefully directed via flics enormous inlets air curtains and even two electrically controlled air panels located in the front apron and behind the radiator grille. A pair of trapezoidal outwardly ribbed twin tailpipe trims massive rear diffuser and matching side skirts masterfully complete the look of this imposing vehicle. The can car sits on either 19-or 20-inch AMG light-alloy or forged wheel alternatives available in multiple high-performance tire selections measuring 265-width in the front and 275 in the rear axle.The interior cabin follows the typical AMG recipe with many individual leather upholstery options available. The inside living space highlights both the sporty and lavish sides of the C 63 S customers having at their disposal an extensive array of exclusive colors and even Nappa leather alternatives to choose from. The remarkable design finishes off with a pair of reworked second-generation AMG Performance seats generously bolstered but still comfortable complete with an AMG logo engraved in the front head restraints and the obligatory AMG Performance steering wheel featuring the now-famous twin-spoke design and integrated control buttons.The new Mercedes-AMG C 63 S E Performance will be available worldwide in early 2023 unlike the American market which will have to bear a bit more patience. They will be able to get their hands on the four-cylinder AMG super sedan most likely as a 2024 model with U.S. deliveries expected to begin in late next year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXctYnJhYnVzLW1lcmNlZGVzLWctd2FnZW4taXMtOTAwLWhwLW9mLXBpY2t1cC1hYnN1cmRpdHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Brabus Mercedes G-Wagen Is 900 HP Of Pickup Absurdity,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXctYnJhYnVzLW1lcmNlZGVzLWctd2FnZW4taXMtOTAwLWhwLW9mLXBpY2t1cC1hYnN1cmRpdHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9ocC1zcGVjdHJlLXgzNjAtMTMtdnMtbGVub3ZvLXlvZ2EtOWktZ2VuLTcv0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlnaXRhbHRyZW5kcy5jb20vY29tcHV0aW5nL2hwLXNwZWN0cmUteDM2MC0xMy12cy1sZW5vdm8teW9nYS05aS1nZW4tNy8_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HP Spectre x360 13.5 vs. Lenovo Yoga 9i Gen 7: premium 2-in-1 showdown,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.digitaltrends.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /computing/hp-spectre-x360-13-vs-lenovo-yoga-9i-gen-7/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673E740F70>, 'Connection to www.digitaltrends.com timed out.

[yyzkevin] shows us a PCMCIA WiFi card built using a Pi Pico W talking PCI ISA. This card brings modern-day WiFi connectivity to his IBM PC110 without requiring a separate router set up for outdated standards that the typical PCMCIA WiFi cards are limited by.

The RP2040 is made to talk PCI ISA using of course the PIO engine. A CPLD helps with PCI ISA address decoding some multiplexing and level shifting between RP2040’s 3.3V and the PCI 5 V levels. The RP2040 software emulates a NE2000 network card which means driver support is guaranteed on most OSes of old times and the software integration seems seamless. The card already works for getting the PC110 online and [yyzkevin] says he’d like to improve on it – shrink the design so that it resembles a typical PCMCIA WiFi card tie some useful function into the Pico’s USB port and perhaps integrate his PCMCIA SoundBlaster project into the whole package while at it.

This is a delightful project in how it achieves its goal and a pleasant surprise for everyone who’s been observing RP2040’s PIO engine conquer interfaces typically unreachable for run-of-the-mill microcontrollers. We’ve seen Ethernet CAN and DVI along many others and there’s undoubtedly more to come.

The company said it uses about 16 billion gallons of water each year globally. As semiconductor technology continues to advance the company said more water will need to be used.

What You Need To Know It takes a lot of water to manufacture chips



Intel uses about 16 billion gallons of water each year globally



Some people are wondering where Intel will get all of that water and how it will affect the community



Intel works hard to conserve and reuse water wherever possible

“The semiconductor process it's not unique to Intel. It requires a lot of high-quality water that we treat and use what's called ultra-pure water. I mean the chips we cannot have the tiniest bit of impurity on them. It's really critical” said Fawn Bergen manager of corporate sustainability for Intel. “We’re growing but also that complexity and manufacturing requires more water and energy. And so that's that's a big part of why sustainability is so integrated in our growth.”

Bergen said the tech giant has some big sustainability goals. The company wants to run off 100% renewable energy across their global manufacturing operations by 2030 reach a zero waste to landfill goal globally by 2030 and be net positive for water by 2030. She said they work hard to conserve and reuse water wherever possible.

“Something simple like low flow faucets in our restrooms to kind of a larger scale” Bergen said. “Conservation is also where we reuse water on site.”

Intel’s operations in the United States Costa Rica and India are officially net positive on water use. That means in those countries Intel restores and returns more freshwater than it takes in and the company’s new Ohio site will be no different.

“Our ultimate goal is to reduce the impact on our watersheds which is typically the withdrawal of freshwater. So our goal on site is to reuse or reduce the amount of water overall which allows us to reduce the amount of freshwater that comes in” Bergen said.

Intel’s Ohio site could initially use around five million gallons of water per day and Bergen said they’ll get their water from the city of Columbus. She said an on-site water treatment plant will ensure any water leaving the Intel site meets all local requirements.

“And it will go through the city's process as well” Bergen said. “So they absolutely regulate all of that.”

On top of being net positive for water she said they also have plans to fund water restoration projects in the area. Bergen said Intel has funded about 40 projects so far around the world.

She said they’re committed to being a positive part of their communities and reducing their environmental footprint is one way they do that.

“We want our community to say it's good to have Intel here” Bergen said.

Latest news on ETFs Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools

Investors in exchange traded funds are a barometer of what not to buy with excess returns to be made by shorting those with the biggest inflows and going long those with the largest outflows research suggests.

The contrarian nature of ETF flows is particularly strong for leveraged funds thanks to the prevalence of “dumb” retail money the academic findings show.

“ETFs with large inflows predictably earn lower future returns than ETFs with large outflows” said Shaun William Davies one of the authors.

Moreover flows to and from leveraged ETFs which provide magnified short-term exposure to an underlying market such as the S&P 500 are “always contrarian” he added.

“When markets are going down we see a big rise in long leveraged [flows] and vice versa. [Buyers] are betting against a shock and preventing stocks from getting to their fundamental value. They are catching a falling knife.”

One paper ETF Arbitrage Non-Fundamental Demand and Return Predictability co-authored by Davies found that a portfolio that is short high-flow ETFs and long low-flow ETFs earned an excess return of between 1.1 per cent and 2 per cent a month for US equity ETFs during the nine-year sample period.

A follow-up paper Speculation Sentiment written by Davies found similarly large predictive power in flows to and from leveraged ETFs. Specifically a one standard deviation increase in net flows — a commonly used statistical measurement — is associated with a 1.14 per cent to 1.67 per cent decline in broad market stock indices during the following month.

The findings were no surprise to some.

“It is an open secret within the financial industry that certain portions of the retail investor community make bankably poor investment decisions ie they buy at the top of the market and sell at the bottom” said Kenneth Lamont senior fund analyst for passive strategies at Morningstar.

“The short-term high octane returns promised by leveraged products makes them especially attractive to this subset.”

Vitali Kalesnik director of research for Europe at Research Affiliates a Californian investment house agreed that leveraged ETFs “are associated with less sophisticated investors [as] more sophisticated traders have cheaper and more efficient ways” to gain similar exposures.

Overall what the researchers are finding is “mean reversion” Kalesnik said. “The dumb money flows in. If these large flows are unrelated to fundamentals then ultimately there is mean reversion.”

The authors believe their findings result from ETF flows representing “non-fundamental” demand which they define as “beliefs that are uncorrelated with fundamental news” as well as “over and under-reaction to fundamental news”.

They argue this non-fundamental demand “distorts asset prices away from fundamental values” leading to an inevitable correction at a later point.

Davies argued there was “nothing nefarious about ETFs themselves” which he described as “one of the most incredible innovations in the financial space”.

Instead the authors argue that ETFs provide a “really clean way to observe mispricing” because of the trading mechanism that whirrs away behind the scenes to keep them fairly priced at least in normal market conditions.

If an ETF sees meaningful net inflows the price of the ETF’s shares will rise above the value of its underlying holdings. At this point arbitrageurs or “authorised participants” step in buying a basket of securities and swapping these with the ETF’s provider for newly created ETF shares. The AP then sells these shares locking in the price differential and bringing the price of the ETF and its underlying securities back into line.

This creation process runs in reverse at times of net outflows with ETF shares being redeemed.

“Any time we see arbitrageurs or APs step in to create or redeem shares we know that either the share price or the underlying assets are experiencing excess demand” Davies said.

He argued that this “must be down to something non-fundamental” since the ETF and the underlyings “have access to the same cash flows”.

The team’s data crunching suggests that ETF share creations tend to be an indicator of sub-market returns in the subsequent months as the mispricing driven by non-fundamental demand corrects. Conversely redemptions presage above-market returns.

“That suggests that ETF shares are relatively more sensitive to non-fundamental demand shocks than the underlying is” Davies said.

The analysis did not find such a strong relationship for fixed income ETFs suggesting that “a lot of the non-fundamental demand is in the bonds themselves: a lot of the price discovery is in the ETFs” Davies added.

The relationship was though very strong for leveraged ETFs. Davies attributed this to these funds being traded primarily by retail investors (“dumb” money) while the derivatives that underlie leveraged ETFs are traded by professionals (“smart” money).

Davies believed a long/short strategy based on the findings could be viable given that ETFs tend to be easy and cheap to short compared with individual stocks especially smaller companies.

He said he was working with a hedge fund that is attempting to construct a vehicle that would consistently beat the S&P 500 by a few basis points and is using Davies’s leveraged ETF metric as one of the signals as to when to go long or short the market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS81MC1tb3N0LWluZmx1ZW50aWFsLWpld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS03MTc3MzXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The most powerful man on Wall Street: Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS81MC1tb3N0LWluZmx1ZW50aWFsLWpld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS03MTc3MzXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002674004E380>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Queen Elizabeth II the United Kingdom’s longest-serving monarch peacefully passed away at the age of 96 at the Balmoral Castle in Scotland on 8th September 2022. The Royal Family obviously gathered to pay their final respects despite the complications in their relationships. Her eldest son Prince Charles who is now King Charles III said the death of his beloved mother was “a moment of great sadness.” Prince Harry and Meghan Markle unfortunately couldn’t spend time with the queen during her final hours but made it to her funeral ceremony.

Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle had a polite exchange

A source revealed that Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle “broke the ice” before Queen Elizabeth’s funeral. The source further added the two were “being cordial towards each other”

“They hadn’t spoken for a long time until that walkabout in Windsor two days after the Queen died. They had a polite exchange just before it and that broke the ice.”

Queen Elizabeth II came up with the idea of the “royal walkabout” in the 1970s.

Meghan Markle is reportedly working on a memoir

In one of her recent interviews the Duchess of Sussex dropped subtle hints that she might be working on her own memoir. It is confirmed that Prince Harry’s memoir will be released very soon but there are no confirmations of Meghan Markle’s memoir.

Royal author and biographer Meghan Mccain recently accused Meghan Markle and Prince Harry of creating unnecessary drama because they are jealous of the spotlight that is always on Kate Middleton And Prince William.

Prince William refused to meet Prince Harry

Earlier this month Duke of Cambridge Prince William and his wife Kate Middleton reportedly refused to meet his brother Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle as they were worried Prince Harry might leak more sensitive information about the Royal Family.

A source at the time said that Prince William and Kate Middleton will not meet the Duke and Duchess of Sussex until they know the contents of the couple’s upcoming Netflix documentary. The two are reportedly working on a documentary about their life in the US and it will focus on their “love story.” The Royal Family is worried as the documentary might reveal dark secrets about the family.

The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3181 million. During the January-March quarter currency-neutral sales were up 13% aided by double-digit growth in Nourish Health & Biosciences and Pharma Solutions.

Such was the case with Ann Sievers of Il Fiorello Olive Oil Company in Suisun Valley.

The love of olive oil runs in her blood and that of her family. Thanks to an academic abstract she wrote and videotaped the world has a chance to hear her passion on the topic.

Sievers’s paper was recently submitted to and accepted by Yale University the University of Rome Italy and the University of Bari Italy. Her daughter Elisabeth Fiorello Sievers who is fluent in Italian and a third-level sommelier recently read the abstract at the Fourth International Conference on Olive Oil and Health in Rome. The focus of the conference was on Olive Oil Policy Education Economics Climate Health and Marketing.

What happens next? Ann Sievers is waiting to hear as her daughter only just returned home from Italy.

“It’s an honor for sure to present to a group like this” she shared.

Olive oil she emphasized is a valuable sustainable product.

Intuitive Surgical (ISRG 0.32%) has the clear lead in robotic-assisted surgery. The company got approval for its da Vinci surgery system back in 2000. With more than two decades of research development and real-world use under its belt competitors have an uphill battle if they want to catch up with Intuitive's technology.

That is unless Nvidia (NVDA 1.27%) provides some help. The chip designer and AI specialist revealed during its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) this week that many start-ups are tapping into its platform to accelerate development of their robotic surgery systems. Did Nvidia just deal a serious blow to Intuitive Surgical's ability to stay in the lead?

A long list of competitors

Successful technology always attracts competitors especially when it's lucrative. Intuitive Surgical has built an empire that hauled in $6 billion in revenue over the 12 months ended in June. It also generates operating profit margins in the high 20% to low 30% range.

Indeed Intuitive has attracted would-be peers some of them privately owned and some of them now publicly traded stocks. Many of these companies are trying to speed up their development using Nvidia's Orin IGX -- the same platform Nvidia has built to help with other robotics technology. At GTC 2022 Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said over 70 medical device companies are using Orin IGX and the software stack built on top of it to accelerate their smart-device development.

Included in the list of companies using Orin IGX that Huang mentioned is none other than Intuitive Surgical. Other big-name peers that were mentioned include Siemens Healthineers and Stryker. Smaller companies like Asensus Surgical and Olympus were also named. And start-ups Activ Surgical Proximie and Moon Surgical were also announced as Nvidia customers.

With the list of aspiring competitors heating up should Intuitive shareholders be worried?

Lots of new business to go around

Surgeries performed using robotic assistance are still a small portion of the total procedures performed worldwide. Even in the U.S. where Intuitive has steadily increased the number of procedures that can be done with da Vinci and its newer Ion system estimates are that upward of 80% of surgeries are still done without robots. That percentage of non-robotic surgery is much higher in most other countries.

There is still a massive amount of white space for Intuitive and others. Medical care is highly personalized and the types of procedures that can be improved with AI-powered robotics number in the hundreds.

Nvidia is also involved in other areas where AI software can improve healthcare like medical imaging and scanning testing and diagnostics and drug and treatment discovery.

But back to robotic-assisted surgery. Powered with Nvidia's tech Intuitive's lead could be maintained as it develops new uses for its existing systems and broadens its offerings into new areas of healthcare. Intuitive has the benefit of already having a huge number of its machines in use. It had 7135 da Vinci systems installed as of the end of June plus another 204 Ion systems. These systems are expensive so an upstart competitor won't be able to easily displace a da Vinci robot. Intuitive's $8.18 billion in cash and short-term investments and no debt also give it a leg up when it comes to funding innovation.

The days of Intuitive's rapid growth are likely over but this is still a steadily expanding business worth staying invested in. At this stage Nvidia's advance into the medical field should help Intuitive Surgical as much as it does other robotic surgery start-ups so I don't think Intuitive investors need to worry just yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,

If you are coming into the market now and building a retirement portfolio the state of the market and the economy might feel a bit daunting. The bear market has been harsh and with the expectation of a continuing economic slowdown or recession on the horizon the outlook may not improve any time soon.

But this type of market as uncertain as it is should not alter any long-term strategy particularly when it comes to retirement. The market has gone through multiple bear markets and they have typically been followed by longer more robust bull markets.

That said if I were building a retirement portfolio from scratch right now with $50000 I'd be cautious balanced and optimistic.

Cautious

Being cautious means being prepared for the market fluctuations that occur over time. If you are invested primarily in one type of stock -- say all growth stocks or technology stocks or small caps -- that volatility is going to be more pronounced and your portfolio will be subject to wild swings. That's why portfolio diversification is so important.

I would diversify my portfolio in two ways -- through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) which are baskets of stocks that track an index and by having those ETFs diversified by investment style or strategy.

The core of the portfolio would be in an S&P 500 ETF tracking the largest 500 stocks in the U.S. This has been the major benchmark by which stocks have been measured and over the last 40 years it has returned 9% per year on an annualized basis through Sept. 20. I'd put about 30% of my $50000 or $15000 in an S&P 500 ETF. There are many good options but the granddaddy of them all is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust which is the oldest ETF on the market.

Then I would put the rest in two ETFs that perform differently in different market cycles to buoy the portfolio in difficult markets while still driving growth in strong markets. To determine which ETFs would best achieve this goal I'd use the past 20 years as a guide.

Balanced

If you look at the 20 years from 2000 to 2020 you had two very different market cycles. From 2000 through 2009 was a rocky period filled with several bear markets from the bursting of the dot-com bubble through the Great Recession. Then from 2010 through the end of 2019 the market experienced the longest bull market and the longest period of economic expansion in U.S. history.

From 2000 through 2009 it was a bad time for growth stocks and large caps as the S&P 500 had an annualized return of -2.7% over that stretch while the Nasdaq had an average annual return of -5.7. The Nasdaq 100 which is a bellwether for growth stocks posted an annual return of -6.7% in this period.

On the flip side value stocks and small and mid caps fare much better in this 10-year stretch. The S&P 400 a mid-cap index had an annualized return of 5% while the Russell 2000 returned 2.2% per year. Looking at the value side of things the S&P 400 Value Index returned 6.8% annually while the Russell 2000 Value Index returned 6% annually.

So I'd split another $20000 in two different ETFs that would better navigate down markets. One would be in a mid-cap value ETF to access to the range of midsized companies with value characteristics while the other would be in a small-cap ETF to invest in a range of smaller companies.

A good option among mid-cap value ETFs is the Vanguard S&P Mid-Cap 400 Value ETF while a good small-cap fund is the iShares Russell 2000 ETF.

Optimistic

The rest of the portfolio would reflect my long-term optimism that growth stocks in particular the technology sector will continue to drive growth in the market.

As mentioned growth stocks and large caps struggled in the 2000s but in the 2010s it was a vastly different story. The S&P 500 returned 11.2% per year from 2010 through 2019 while the Nasdaq Composite posted a 14.7% annual return and the Nasdaq 100 posted an annualized return of 16.7% over that stretch. The Russell 2000 returned a solid 10.3% while the S&P Mid-Cap Value index had an average annual return of 10% in the decade.

With a long time horizon I'd invest 30% of the $50000 or $15000 in a technology-oriented ETF like the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ 0.24%). This ETF tracks the Nasdaq 100 and has the best long-term performance over the past 40 years even with its negative performance in the 2000s. It of course is a concentrated index that includes the largest fastest-growing technology stocks.

This is just one person's view but a portfolio constructed with a focus on diversification balance and growth will go a long way toward helping you reach your long term goals.",,,,,,,,,

The combined forces of the City of Atlanta and Dekalb County governments private investment firms corporate power players the Atlanta Police Foundation and film and television production studio Blackhall Studios have worked to destroy close to 400 acres of the city’s largest forest in order to build a $90-million eighty-five-acre police training compound and a massive $400-million forty-acre movie studio complex. Only a valiant effort of forest defenders has held them off. Residents have marched organized petitions filed lawsuits and sponsored teach-ins. Muskogee (Creek) people from Georgia Oklahoma and Alabama have gathered for a rematriation summit and stomp dance ceremony on their historic territory. Raves and music festivals have filled the woods with crowds and the echoes of rap folk and techno past sunrise. Construction equipment has been sabotaged incursions into the forest pushed back demonstrations held at the homes of the heads of subcontracted engineering firms and memes circulated widely online. Around the city “Defend the Atlanta Forest” signs are displayed in yards and in the heart of the forest wooden treehouses cling sturdily to mature tree limbs and trunks. Below a village threads through the woods: tents tarped dwelling areas and outdoor kitchens. Huge banners suspended between towering trees sway in the wind welcoming supporters to the forest and demarcating the line that has been drawn around it: “No Cop City No Hollywood Dystopia.”

In November 2021 members of the Muscogee (Creek) Tribe currently living in the Helvpe Ceremonial Grounds in Oklahoma traveled to their historic territory in Atlanta’s South River Forest. The stomp dance and cultural sharing events they held in Intrenchment Creek Park were attended by hundreds of people.

Much more than a local conflict or environmental defense activism the battle for the South River Forest brings to the fore critical questions of urban life in the age of climate change. On the one hand the situation in the forest illuminates emergent mutations of urban space process and government produced by capitalist urbanization and control in the shifting social-ecological contexts of the twenty-first century. On the other hand it points to significant transformations in the strategies and struggles through which humans as world creators and dwellers fight for life on a planet being pushed into the abyss. As such the conflict in the Atlanta Forest is a struggle over the future of urban life in the Anthropocene.

§1 The South River Forest is a central site of the tipping point between two possible futures prescribed for Atlanta from the perspective of climate governance: the city will be either a “climate refuge” or a climate no-go zone.

Roughly three and a half hours from the Atlantic coast and nestled in Georgia’s piedmont region Atlanta is the nineth largest metropolitan area in America. It is also one of the fastest growing. Despite this 47.9% of Atlanta’s land is covered in tree canopy—the highest of any city the country. This lush interconnected network of mature pines oaks magnolias and other trees together gives Atlanta its nickname the “city in a forest.” Alongside making it more verdant and livable than some other urbanized areas and providing habitat for pollinators birds and a wide array of other wildlife Atlanta’s approximately 3.7 millions trees generate increasingly critical ecosystem services in an era of climate chaos. With global warming Atlanta faces increasingly frequent and intense rainfall catastrophic flooding and hotter longer-lasting heat waves as well as potentially lethal wet bulb temperatures. According to Climate Central data average summer temperatures in Atlanta have increased by 2.9°F over the last 50 years. In the summer of 2022 as part of a triple-digit heat wave blanketing the American Midwest and South that led the National Weather Service to advise a third of America to stay indoors several Georgia cities experienced temperatures above 100°F and Atlanta tied a fifty-year old June heat record of 98°F. The previous week it broke a heat record by reaching 99°F.

The proposed razing of Atlanta’s tree canopy is directly connected with this epochal crisis. As local organizations such as the South Atlanta Watershed Alliance repeatedly point out the demolition of the South River Forest will directly decrease the city’s natural ability to field extreme heat and flood events by shifting greater burden onto already-stressed grey infrastructure and eliminating the natural shade and cooling provided by urban tree canopy. Furthermore forests sequester CO₂ and Atlanta’s urban forests’ annual gross sequestration rate has been estimated at 42000-45000 tons of carbon per year the highest among cities with significant tree cover in America. Urban governments know well the importance of urban ecosystems services and climate futures which is why the City of Atlanta’s own 2017 Atlanta City Design: Aspiring to the Beloved City urban plan envisioned the forested area currently slated for construction as part of an enormous 1200-acre urban greenspace.

These global warming trajectories intersect with other forecasts for Atlanta in particular intimations that it will be a “climate refuge.” Used with increasing frequency over the past several years the terms “climate haven” or “climate refuge” refer to areas projected to receive significant chunks of the tens of millions of climate refugees and migrants as they flee wildfires natural disasters or coastal flooding along the planet’s densely developed coastlines. Once discussed as a far-off future matter in recent years media planners and politicians have begun advocating immediate and proactive relocation. During the pandemic as extreme weather intensified and became more frequent across the country planning and media discourse began suggesting that we have reached the “limits” of urban resilience—the dominant discourse and practice of climate adaptation in cities since at least 2010—advocating instead a post-resilience form of adaptation focused on defunding and disinvesting from flood- and storm-prone cities.

This emergent discourse is exemplified by a recent Washington Post opinion piece by the scenario strategy advisor Parag Khanna. Published in November 2021 after historic flooding in the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia caused by an “atmospheric river” that poured multiple inches of rain in hours Khanna’s piece argues that while wealthy American cities like Boston New York Los Angeles or San Francisco can afford to build resilience to rising seas hurricanes and wildfires others cannot. Citing the growing number of hurricanes slamming the Louisiana Gulf Coast in recent years and the economic cost of rebuilding infrastructures like power lines that will only be knocked out by subsequent storms Khanna argues that New Orleans “is going the way of Venice” and the US government “must realistically assess which geographies are becoming unlivable and which are well suited to larger population settlement. It should then offer incentives for migration toward the latter and away from the former—and direct infrastructure spending accordingly… Property developers should lure displaced Americans to gentrify the Rust Belt along the Great Lakes. The people of New Orleans should be given one-way tickets to Detroit where they can contribute to the city’s nascent postindustrial revival.”

Khanna’s vision of defunding and disinvesting from flood- and storm-prone cities and attendant climate refuge gentrification elsewhere is currently just a proposal. Still it is part of a broader climate adaptation narrative that has been gaining traction. This discourse is focused not on securing existing spaces but instead declaring their obsolescence while simultaneously identifying specific cities and regions as climate refuges. The mayor of Buffalo New York set the first explicit precedent for this in 2019 when he designated his city a Climate Refuge City in hopes of attracting new residents and economic investment. Later that year the New York Times proposed Duluth Minnesota as a critical climate refuge. For Rust Belt cities that have sustained economic population and job losses since the 1970s taking on the mantle of a climate refuge is increasingly seen as an attractive branding angle. Access to increasingly scarce resources is often seen as a key qualifier for climate refuge status (the Great Lakes hold 20% of the world’s fresh surface water). Even hot crowded and water-poor Atlanta is projected to be the destination of at least 250000 climate migrants as coastal cities like Savannah Charleston or Miami become increasingly inundated. This is likely a conservative estimate however: in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 more than 100000 people evacuated to Atlanta in a matter of days.

The destruction of the South River Forest will undermine the city’s ability to be any kind of climate sanctuary or refuge. After all even though Atlanta is a “city in a forest” it is now the city in the United States that is losing tree cover the fastest. Rather than the verdant green canopy and flowing fresh water of climate utopian city visions this is a future Atlanta closer to Bladerunner 2049’s Los Angeles: crowded polluted and denuded of life with elites ensconced in the city’s John Portman-designed concrete and glass compounds while swelling surplus populations are crowded into dilapidated apartments surveilled and held in check by state-of-the-art militarized police.

§2 The proposed construction of Cop City is one instance of a broader global tendency of governments’ use of cities as laboratories for experiments in social control and profit extraction in the era of climate chaos and social upheaval dynamics of which were exacerbated by the pandemic.

On the heels of the George Floyd Rebellion in 2020 the Atlanta Police Foundation proposed building a $90-million eighty-five-acre police training complex. Slated for the site of a former prison farm “Cop City” plans include a mock city for police training simulations replete with gas stations banks apartment complexes nightclubs and splash pads as well as burn and explosives test sites shooting ranges and a helicopter landing pad. The police training compound will be two times larger than that of the New York Police Department and three times the size of the Los Angeles Police Department’s the two largest police departments in the country. Originally named the Atlanta Institute for Social Justice and Public Safety Training “Cop City” is touted as a way of rebuilding the Atlanta Police Department’s morale and a method of bridging the gap between the police department and “the community” with weekly farmers’ market and community garden plots.

After the police murder of Floyd in the summer of 2020 an impassioned uprising overwhelmed cities across America and prompted urban elites to search for new social management strategies. This was especially the case across metro Atlanta where massive crowds took over streets and parks disregarding curfew orders to march together burn police cars and loot stores. Unable to contain the situation the governor declared a state of emergency in late May for every county in Georgia deploying thousands of National Guard troops to parks and malls across Atlanta. The uprising shattered the peace of the “Atlanta Way” a longstanding political alliance between black and white business classes. This power sharing arrangement and agreement on moderate incremental reform rather than direct confrontation is widely celebrated as the reason why the city remained peaceful in the aftermath of Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination. In 2020s America this strategy is less effective as dividing lines are more unclear; instead of simple black and white there is a multiracial bourgeois governing class alliance of economic and cultural elites and America’s motley multi-racial urban and suburban proletariat. This striation was visible in the 2020 Floyd uprising in Atlanta when then-mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and Killer Mike—a major property owner in the city’s West side—issued “go home” appeals during the uprising.

Amidst such change real estate interests and business coalitions who back the Atlanta Police Foundation sought revised approaches to ensure that such widespread—and frequently multi-racial and multi-generational—urban uprisings would never occur again. Academic governmental and military strategists widely agree that volatile urban spaces are the key conflict environments in which the twenty-first-century’s political and environmental upheavals will play out and against which existing counterinsurgency methods devised in past environments and conditions are woefully insufficient. As a 2016 counterinsurgency training video produced by the US Army and screened at the Pentagon’s Joint Special Operations University warned “our current and past strategies can no longer hold. We are facing environments that the masters of war never foresaw. We are facing a threat that requires us to redefine [military] doctrine and the [army] in radically different ways. The threat is clear. Our direction remains to be defined.”

Increasingly governments and police are now using cities as laboratories for experimenting with new modes of government and control. Some of this involves design-based efforts to construct infrastructures able to fortify cities against climate change and disaster. From New York to Miami Lagos to Kyoto the supposed imperative of resilience building has formed the substrate of a profound transformation of urban planning and government based on a rejection of modernist city/nature binaries and attempted interlinking of living beings natural processes and technological systems via sensing nodes disaster management infrastructure and human communities. Urban resilience in this way flanks and creates important discursive and material conditions in which a truly cybernetic world can freely unfold. But along with managing the impact of hurricanes and floods on markets and infrastructure building a “resilient” urban space is also a matter of developing new modes of counterinsurgency to administer social upheaval and maintain order such as those that will be trialed in the Cop City facility. As former Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms put it the goal of Cop City is to enable “twenty-first-century training” for “twenty-first-century policing.” Thus its opposition often summed up in the slogan “Stop Cop City” takes on historical and global significance.

§3 The proposed construction of Blackhall Studio is a step in the emergent hyper-striated Anthropocene world in which the economic success of global investment firms functions as the organizing principle of policing the urban environment the nonhuman elements of the world human populations and possible human ways of life.

Immediately east of the proposed site for Cop City and on top of even more of the South River Forest Blackhall Studios and CEO Ryan Millsap plan to expand the footprint of Atlanta’s film industry. While the police training compound needs to be read in light of urban counterinsurgency experiments for a post-George Floyd climate chaos world Blackhall Studio’s plans for the forest need to be understood in the post-pandemic context of real estate and finance-driven “hostile urban takeovers.” According to David Madden Covid-19 has “inaugurated a new phase of urban political-economic recomposition realignment and restructuring.” Driven by a range of political projects being legitimated in the name of pandemic response this emergent paradigm of “covid-capitalist urbanization” as he names it is characterized by the escalation of pre-existing forms of rentierism the remodulation of workplace conditions and the intensification of the relationship between urban government tech companies and algorithms. One can think here of how the pandemic has served as an opportunity for live trials of surveillance and tracking technologies in the form of selfies robotics and AI as well as “pandemic smart city” tech such as contact tracing apps and drones or social contact monitoring and vaccination pass systems. But the pandemic has also seen private equity firms real estate and venture capitalists seize control of urban futures launching new forms of accumulation by dispossession that are fueling a real estate market frenzy and massive housing shortages.

Founded in 2017 by Ryan Millsap CEO of Irinda Capital Management (ICM)— owner of tens of thousands of apartments across the Sunbelt—Blackhall played host to a slew of movies like Venom (2018) Godzilla: King of Monsters (2019) and Jumanji: The Next Level (2019) as well as straight-to-streaming shows like Lovecraft Country (2020). Eyeing expansion Blackhall originally snapped up properties in the largely black working-class Gresham Park neighborhood around the South River Forest and in a February 2021 deal with the Dekalb County government Blackhall managed to “swap” fifty-three non-contiguous acres in Gresham Park for forty acres of Intrenchment Creek Park. In April 2021 Millsap sold Blackhall to Commonwealth Asset Management for $120 million while retaining “a substantial minority interest.” Since then Blackhall has partnered with private equity firm Silver Lake which infused the project with $500 million renamed Shadowbox and announced a $1.5 billion global expansion plan. While Millsap sold controlling interest in Blackhall he retained legal control of the forty acres of Intrenchment Creek Park slated for clearcutting. To what end is not currently clear but he has announced plans for a new streaming platform Blackhall Americana.

The rapid proliferation of the content industry over the last two years is unsurprising. During the pandemic streaming services reached a high of some 1.1 billion subscribers or roughly one in eight people on the planet. Demand has only increased and generationally speaking it is Millennials and Gen Z who consume the most whether it’s streaming services like Netflix (150 million subscribers in the US) Amazon Prime and Disney+ or platforms like TikTok which has roughly 100 million monthly users in the US. The space of content is rapidly expanding and Facebook’s conversion into Meta is a sign of things to come. Shadowbox’s most recent investor Silver Lake is a largely technology-centered investment firm which in April 2022 invested $150 million into Genies an avatar ecosystem for the metaverse promising “Your own mini world. Oh and you own it all.”

In 2016 a Danish politician writing for the World Economic Forum penned an essay titled “Welcome to 2030. I own nothing have no privacy and life has never been better.” The essay predicted a shift towards a sort of AI-run Nordic luxury socialism but it recently went viral on right-wing Twitter due to its provocative title and in response to revelations that private equity firms like Blackstone are transforming America into a nation of renters. Amidst a decline in new housing construction private equity firms are snapping up single-family homes and converting them to rentals. According to geographer Desiree Fields these firms own a growing portion of the single-family home rental market with the four largest—Invitation Homes American Homes 4 Rent Tricon Residential and Front Yard Residential—owning approximately 182000 units nationwide. Significantly Atlanta is the epicenter of this change with those four firms owning 27000 single-family homes in the metro area.

The reach of private equity firms extends beyond the single-family home renter market. Invitation Homes is actually a creation of Blackstone which recently purchased Preferred Apartment Communities for $6-billion and its 12000 multi-family housing units in cities like Atlanta Nashville and Tampa. In 2021 half of Blackstone’s more than $12-billion profits were from real estate alone. This cash grab extends into Atlanta’s low-income apartment complexes. With lax laws concerning’s renter’s rights and decrepit living standards abound according to the Atlanta-Journal Constitution: “At least three-fourths of the region’s most dangerous apartments … belong to private equity firms or other absentee investors under whom crime and squalor are not so much bad fortune as collateral damage from a widely followed business model.” Mold broken appliances and violence related to the city’s drug trade combine to make an unlivable situation for many tenants yet they are trapped paying higher rents to massive predatory institutions dedicated to scraping ever more money off the back of the average American.

The point here is not to remind that there is in fact a capitalist class but rather to reveal the linkages between their actions and to understand the future they have in store for the rest of us if they were to succeed. At the end of the day organizations like Shadowbox and the private equity firms it represents don’t want to just make movies or streaming shows; they want to reshape the world in a darker more synthetic way. Their designs fuse endless content with the creation of urban and suburban fiefdoms. In other words they would destroy a forest to make a movie about a jungle that you stream while you live in the pod and eat the bugs. They’d play host to films that cast black actors and tout environmental themes while contributing to environmental racism and increasing gentrification and displacement. They’d make Atlanta hotter and less alive leaving us further from a future we can survive in or even remotely influence.

§4. The fight for the forest is a hubristic innovative fight for life in and against emergent Anthropocene urban dystopias.

On a weekday morning this past June a caravan of cars trucks and dirt bikes clogged the road along the perimeter of the South River Forest. They delivered bouquets of flowers and signs of support to the tree sitters who inhabiting makeshift houses high in the trees have put their lives on the line to defend the forest. Families zoomers and dirt bikers honked their horns and blasted radios to show their appreciation for the tree sitters and the forest itself.

The plan to bulldoze a maturing urban forest to build urban counterinsurgency training compounds and produce more streaming content clearly encapsulates the dystopian—and careless—nature of contemporary neoliberal regimes and the increasingly apocalyptic trajectory they are on. We are entering crucial decades of climate chaos in the twenty-first century. Heat waves come like clockwork; in the American west water reserves are at historic lows; panthers gorillas songbirds bees butterflies and frogs are on the verge of extinction; food and gas shortages and material price spikes have already triggered demonstrations and riots in response. Meanwhile the dominant solutions to the climate crisis are to either deny its existence outright or enforce austerity measures on the general population.

In contrast the defense of the South River Forest illuminates a possible path forward one that is nascent but nevertheless vital in the present: the fight for life. Everyone defending Atlanta’s South River Forest is acting for both themselves and those who will inherit the land after them. It’s become an existential and also commonsense matter of whether there will be anything but avatars and heat waves for those who come next. For many people the only human response to watching the video of George Floyd’s murder was to open the door and go outside in the midst of a pandemic and stay-at-home orders to join millions of others in the street. Today for many the only human response to attempts to bulldoze the South River Forest and build a landscape of police training and Hollywood film compounds has been to get up and go to the woods.

We live in a time of rapid change and cascading crisis. It’s imperative that we are able to stand back from the noise of each moment and see the present “poly-” or “perma-” crisis as a time of epochal and governmental remodulation. We should be attentive to these changes in narrative and material reality and be able to understand them when they are incipient rather than already full-blown. Too often like the Owl of Minerva spreading its wings only with the falling of dusk we only see the walls that have been erected around us once they’re already cemented in stone. Perpetually late to the game power has moved on. The conflict in the Atlanta Forest highlights some of these changes: urban global warming refuge cities cities as labs where control and extraction are being recalibrated. But it also points to the need for people (whoever they are wherever they are) to be as innovative and ready to use the present as an opportunity to experiment freely with new forms of thought strategy and life. “Stop the Metaverse Save the Real World”—inscribed on a banner tied between two loblolly pines in the South River Forest— are the philosophical and political stakes of our time.",,,,,,,,,,,,
IQV,IQVIA,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vYWxiYW5pYW5kYWlseW5ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYWxiYW5pYS1sYWNrcy1hY2Nlc3MtdG8taW5ub3ZhdGl2ZS10cmVhdG1lbnRzLW9uLWNhbmNlctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Albanian Daily News,"Cancer and rare diseases ""kill"" thousands of people during a year also because Albania does not have access to new innovative therapies that treat these diseases.

From 2017 to 2020 Albania included in the reimbursement list only 5 new drugs out of 160 that came into use in European countries. For the treatment of rare diseases in this period Albania did not include any new drugs in the reimbursement list while countries in Europe 57 drugs.

Statistics show a rapid spread of cancer and the burden of disease but funding for reimbursement remains stagnant.



As a country where poverty is present in 30% of the population and the public budget has limited capacities for health Albanian patients suffer from a deep lack of innovative therapies that could save thousands of lives especially from timely detection and treatment of neoplasms.



From 2017 to 2020 the European Union has approved about 160 new drugs that treat various diseases but in Albania during the same period only 5 of them were included in the reimbursement lists.



A recent study by IQVIA (a multinational company serving the combined health information technology and clinical research industries) found that Albania has the lowest presence of new drugs by a wide margin with neighbors such as North Macedonia Serbia which have respectively approved 11 and 17 new medications each.



Sources from the Association of Pharmacists of Albania said that the lack of new drugs in the market is related to the low budget funds for their reimbursement. These medications are usually expensive and states include them on the reimbursement list.



Companies are not interested in bringing these drugs to the market unless they are included in the reimbursement since all over the world their distribution to patients is covered by the public budget.



The IQVIA study shows that of the 160 new medications that were approved for use 74 of them or about 46% are available to patients in the EU while in Albania only 3% of them are available.



The National Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices in a special explanation evidenced that from 2017 to 2020 it has granted Marketing Authorization in the Republic of Albania for about 194 antitumor drugs including 10 ""Orphan"" drugs through Accelerated Procedure 30 days from the date of application.



But the Association of Pharmacists of Albania explained that the registration of pharmaceutical products does not mean that they can be found on the market. The monthly cost of a new medication exceeds 500 euros per month and the ability to buy it on the free market is only for patients who can be counted on the fingers of the hand while thousands of people need the medication.



""The drug becomes usable when it is included in the reimbursement list. Albania has a medication reimbursement fund of only 100 million dollars per month while the countries of the region and Europe up to 10 times higher"" explained the association.



Furthermore the association explained that the use of new drugs for Albanian patients is made possible by the reimbursement list which is administered by the Compulsory Health Insurance Fund (FSDKSH). But FSDKSH did not respond to the interest regarding the structure of the health insurance budget and inclusion in the list of new therapies until the moment when this article was written.



Because the market for expensive medicines is directly related to the reimbursement list large pharmaceutical companies are reviewing their position in Albania with the prospect of closing subsidiaries.



Medication reimbursement fund this year is about 11 billion ALL.



Health Insurance Fund's budget has increased year after year but the growth rates have not been the same for the drug reimbursement fund. In 2019 funds for drug reimbursement occupied 27% of the total health insurance budget while in 2022 they are planned to occupy only 23% of the total insurance budget.



Budget of the Compulsory Health Insurance Fund (FSDKSH) has increased year after year but the increase has mostly gone to finance contracts with Public-Private Partnerships such as basic medical check-up (check-up sterilization of surgical tools dialysis and recently laboratory). In 2020 expenses for concession payments accounted for 4.6% of the total expenses of the Insurance Fund.

You couldn’t ask for a more welcoming embrace for the first football game following the autumnal equinox.

Yet Michigan State coach Mel Tucker looked as if he was coaching a game somewhere near the equator. It did not take the internet long to notice.

BTN just said ""It is only 60° but there is some sweat dripping down Mel Tucker's face right now""

PJ Fleck could row his boat in the amount of sweat Mel Tucker is producing — Chi-town Wolverine (@WolverineChi) September 24 2022

Jokes aside Tucker’s Spartans are giving him pretty good reason to perspire at the moment.

Four games into the season Michigan State has already equaled last year’s loss total. And based on what is in front of the Spartans the odds of running the table are about nil.

The good news for Tucker is that a guaranteed $95 million over the next decade can buy many towels of the finest Turkish cotton to address the issue. But that’s of little comfort to Michigan State fans. Or even to Tucker’s competitive nature which produces very visible results.

It’s not as if Tucker is under any real pressure right now. His seat is about as warm as Iron Mountain on New Year’s morning. But Michigan State’s 2-game losing streak still counts as his first mini-crisis since taking the job.

Nothing from 2020 really counts. Everyone on the planet was just trying to make it day-to-day and Tucker had the challenges of being a first-year coach at a major football program on top of that.

With a real offseason to prepare for a full season Tucker led Michigan State to No. 9 nationally in 2021 after winning the Peach Bowl. “Tuck Comin'” became the MSU catchphrase as Tucker seemed to have the Spartans on the rise on the field and on the recruiting trail.

The recruiting element remains true. Michigan State’s 2022 class rated fourth in the B1G according to 247Sports and his verbal commits from the 2023 class rate third.

But the promising future outlook does nothing to alter Michigan State’s current state. And it’s fair to wonder whether this season’s ship can be righted.

The injury bug

As has already been noted in this space injuries have plagued the Spartans this year.

Football is no different than baseball in one regard — the strength of a defense runs through the middle. In baseball that’s a shortstop second baseman and center fielder. In football it means defensive tackle middle linebacker and safety.

It’s perhaps less of a truism today than it was for decades as football becomes more perimeter-oriented. But for the most part it sums up how defense is played in the Big Ten. And that’s where Michigan State is getting clobbered right now.

The most important players on Michigan State’s defense are defensive tackle Jacob Slade middle linebacker Cal Haladay and safety Xavier Henderson. Having all 3 on the field makes the Spartans sound enough to unleash their most talented defensive player outside linebacker Jacoby Windmon.

Slade and Henderson have been out with injuries and their absences were glaring against Washington and Minnesota. After racking up 12 sacks against overmatched Western Michigan and Akron Michigan State didn’t get any against the Huskies or Gophers. Quarterbacks Michael Penix and Tanner Morgan used their plentiful time to eviscerate Michigan State’s already questionable pass defense.

Pass rush or bust

Michigan State’s biggest weakness coming into the season was no mystery. The Spartans allowed more passing yardage than any team in the country in 2021 — 4222 yards.

Michigan State wasn’t just the nation’s worst pass defense by a wide margin. It was the nation’s worst pass defense in a half-decade. No team since Pitt in 2016 surrendered more passing yards in a season.

A defensive coordinator by nature Tucker wasn’t going to take those results lying down. And his solution was quite novel. This wasn’t about the defensive backs but quarterbacks having too much time to find their receivers.

Tucker hired Brandon Jordan out of the private sector as a full-time pass rushing coach. And along with Jordan came one of his training pupils — Windmon who transferred from UNLV.

The first 2 games were a rousing success. Windmon led the nation with 5.5 sacks and Michigan State allowed just 5.6 yards per pass attempt.

But with Windmon and every other Spartan contained by Washington and Minnesota’s rock-solid offensive lines Michigan State’s back end was back to its old ways. The Huskies and Gophers averaged 10.1 yards per attempt against the Spartans. And at the moment only 2 defenses in the country are giving up 10.1 or more yards per attempt for the season.

Michigan State’s pass defense could be treading back into those murky waters if it cannot create pressure.

No runners without Walker

Shoddy pass defense only hurt the Spartans against quarterbacks able to fully exploit it in 2021 — Purdue’s Aidan O’Connell and Ohio State’s CJ Stroud.

For the most part Michigan State had enough strengths to gloss over its weakness. And those strengths began with the nation’s best running back Kenneth Walker III. Walker led the Big Ten and ranked second in the country with 136.3 yards per game.

Walker’s fairly ordinary replacements are highlighting just how special he was.

Jalen Berger is averaging 66.8 yards per game and 5.3 per carry. Jarek Broussard averages 40.3 yards per game and 4.6 per carry. And that adds up to 2 backs combining to produce 30 yards per game fewer than Walker did by himself.

Michigan State’s offense is not built to handle the drop from being led by the nation’s No. 2 rusher to being led by the No. 77 rusher.

Trouble ahead trouble behind

Things are not about to get easier. The Spartans are steaming straight into matchups against opponents who can protect their quarterbacks and decimate Michigan State through the air — Maryland and Ohio State.

It’s not just that the Terps and Buckeyes have the best 2 receiving corps in the B1G which they do. But both are also pretty solid up front. Ohio State has only allowed 2 sacks. Maryland is at the national median with 7 sacks allowed through 4 games.

There’s a very good chance this 2-game losing streak will bloom into 4 by the time the Spartans host Wisconsin for homecoming. After last year’s thrill ride that’s the grim new reality Michigan State fans must adjust for.

But that doesn’t mean this season is already a wash.

Wisconsin is clearly a beatable opponent given its challenges passing the ball. And Tucker has a bye week before his opportunity to improve his record to 3-0 against Jim Harbaugh. Ideally by that point Michigan State will have some semblance of the defense it thought it would field this season. And ruining Michigan’s season is always a win no matter what shape Michigan State is in.

This 4-week stretch may well end up being the nadir of Tucker’s entire Michigan State career. If the Spartans can salvage their November it could be remembered as his “if we could get through that we can get through anything” moment.

Tucker has a mini-crisis on his hands. Now his goal is preventing it from morphing into a full-blown one.",,,,,,

OCEAN CITY Md. – Jeff Jacobs has been officially recognized by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) as the new state record holder for the Atlantic Division 393-pound swordfish (Xiphias gladius) he caught in the canyons off the coast of Ocean City.

Jacobs 38 was on charter boat RoShamBo with Captain Willie Zimmerman and crew and preparing to return to shore following a successful day on the water. Just then the boat’s Shimano Tyrnos 50 two-speed reel baited with eel and a blue-white skirt was tugging

Before long the fish “jumped out of the water and looked like a Volkswagen” Jacobs said.

Already exhausted from an eight-hour fishing trip Jacobs spent the next five and a half hours fighting to pull the huge fish aboard.

“Giving up wasn’t an option” Jacobs said. “When (we) saw it we all knew it was a state record.”

The swordfish weight was officially certified by Hunter Dorchenzo at Ocean City Fishing Center. A Maryland DNR biologist confirmed the catch.

The swordfish is more than 90 pounds larger than the previous record set in 2021 by New Jersey resident Jake Bertonazzi. The department maintains state records for sport fish in four divisions – Atlantic Chesapeake Nontidal and Invasive – and awards plaques to anglers who achieve record catches.

Anglers who think they have a potential record catch should download and fill out the state record application and call 443-569-1381 or 410-260-8325. The department recommends the fish be immersed in ice water to preserve its weight until it can be checked confirmed and certified.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMjUvcmVhbGVzdGF0ZS9icm9va2x5bi1iZWQtc3R1eS1kYW5nbGVyLW1hbnNpb24uaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Bed-Stuy Mansion Has Become Rubble.

The old-time image of an anarchist that has long been fixed in popular imagination is of a guy with wild hair and a deranged smile holding a circular bomb with a lit fuse. Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman looked nothing like that. Photographs of them from more than a century ago show them to be quite proper and well dressed; they could have been any elegant couple decked out for a stroll along Fifth Avenue.

But Berkman and the better-known Goldman onetime lovers born in the Russian Empire were indeed anarchists believing in a society without leaders one rooted in an egalitarian spirit free of the top-down organization that has defined governance for oh only forever. Sure many anarchists were unruly: In their heyday roughly from 1880 to 1920 they went around blowing things up employing the dynamite invented by a Swedish gent Alfred Nobel whose name now graces the world’s most coveted peace prize.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd2hudC5jb20vbmV3cy8xOS1pbnNpZGVyL3N0ZXZlLWpvaG5zb24tcHJlcGFyaW5nLWZvci1yZXRpcmVtZW50LWFmdGVyLW92ZXItNDcteWVhcnMtYXQtbmV3cy0xOS_SAWtodHRwczovL3dobnQuY29tL25ld3MvMTktaW5zaWRlci9zdGV2ZS1qb2huc29uLXByZXBhcmluZy1mb3ItcmV0aXJlbWVudC1hZnRlci1vdmVyLTQ3LXllYXJzLWF0LW5ld3MtMTkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steve Johnson preparing for retirement after over 47 years at News 19,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://whnt.com/news/19-insider/steve-johnson-preparing-for-retirement-after-over-47-years-at-news-19/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd2hudC5jb20vbmV3cy8xOS1pbnNpZGVyL3N0ZXZlLWpvaG5zb24tcHJlcGFyaW5nLWZvci1yZXRpcmVtZW50LWFmdGVyLW92ZXItNDcteWVhcnMtYXQtbmV3cy0xOS_SAWtodHRwczovL3dobnQuY29tL25ld3MvMTktaW5zaWRlci9zdGV2ZS1qb2huc29uLXByZXBhcmluZy1mb3ItcmV0aXJlbWVudC1hZnRlci1vdmVyLTQ3LXllYXJzLWF0LW5ld3MtMTkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d0b3AuY29tL2xvY2FsLXNwb3J0cy8yMDI0LzA1L2luY3JlZGlibHktc3BlY2lhbC1yYXJlLTE5MjAtamVyc2V5LXdvcm4tYnktd2FsdGVyLWpvaG5zb24td2hlbi10aGUtc2VuYXRvcnMtYmVhdC1iYWJlLXJ1dGgtaXMtbm93LXVwLWZvci1hdWN0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Incredibly special’: Rare 1920 jersey worn by Walter Johnson when the Senators beat Babe Ruth is now up for auction,"A piece of D.C. baseball history is up for sale and for sports memorabilia collectors its rarity is bringing up…

A piece of D.C. baseball history is up for sale and for sports memorabilia collectors its rarity is bringing up its value.

A game-worn jersey that belonged to Washington Senators pitcher and Baseball Hall of Famer Walter Johnson is currently at auction. Heritage House which is hosting the auction says the unique uniform is over a century old and valued at $3 million.

Production Manager Mike Provenzale told WTOP in the 20 years he’s worked for Heritage House Johnson’s jersey ranks at the top of all the items they’ve ever sold.

“It’s one of the most impressive items we’ve ever offered” he said calling the right-hander “one of the greatest sportsmen of all time.”

Using photo-matching the auction house traced the jersey back to April 29 1920 when the Washington Senators defeated the New York Yankees 2-1 at the Polo Grounds. It was the first time Johnson faced legendary hitter Babe Ruth. According to Provenzale Johnson earned his 299th career win while Ruth was only able to get a an RBI off a sacrifice fly.

“Through that photo-matching you’re able to identify the exact moment he was wearing it and when you can do that and it’s an important game with a lot of significant notes like that that just really piques the interest of high level collectors” he said.

This jersey was gifted by Johnson to teammate Eric “Swat” Erickson as a retirement gift after the 1920 season. Provenzale said Erickson brought a ranch in New York and had a barn where he kept all his sports collectibles including Johnson’s jersey.

“Decades later his granddaughter discovered it in the barn” Provenzale said adding that she was the one who initially sold it to a private seller.

Johnson’s legacy added an additional element that makes the jersey extremely valuable.

Known as “The Big Train” Johnson helped the Senators win its only World Series championship in 1924. He spent his entire 20-year playing career in Washington earning a record of 417-279 with a 2.17 ERA. For more than 50 years his 3509 strikeouts were the most thrown by a pitcher in the majors. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1936 prior to his death 10 years later.

“He was the most dominant pitcher. He holds numerous records. He has the most scoreless games the most consecutive years leading the league in strikeouts” Provenzale said. “Essentially it’s him and Cy Young who are considered … the greatest pitchers of all time.”

Unlike modern jerseys which teams and players hold on to due to their value at the time uniforms were not seen with much significance other than being work clothes. The fact that Johnson’s gift survived is “a miracle” Provenzale said.

“Jerseys in that era were considered disposable” he said. “They were worn and worn and repaired until they could no longer be repaired.”

There is only one other known jersey worn by Johnson that exists and it is sitting in the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown New York. Combined with the disposable nature of uniforms in the past it is unlikely that another game-worn Johnson jersey will surface Provenzale said.

“So if you’re interested” he said. “This is the opportunity to get it”

The auction ends on May 17.

Melody Felicano Johnson 40 pleaded guilty last month to two counts of poisoning food or drink for putting trace amounts of bleach into husband Roby Johnson’s coffee maker on July 11 and July 18 2023 Arizona’s 13 News reported.

Johnson was sentenced to a probation sentence that includes mandatory mental health treatment that goes into effect immediately and she is not allowed to have contact with her husband unless a legal team is present.

Roby Johnson said he believed his wife was trying to kill him to collect death benefits according to court documents.

She was initially arrested and charged with attempted first-degree murder aggravated assault and adding harmful substances to food drink or medicine but agreed to a plea deal instead.

The couple have a child together and were going through a divorce during the times she tried to poison her husband court documents show.

Roby began to notice his coffee tasted odd while he was drinking a cup in March 2023 when the family was stationed in Germany.

He drank the coffee for two or three weeks before purchasing pool testing strips to determine what was wrong with it.

First he tested the tap water which came back normal but after conducting the test on his coffee he discovered the drink contained high levels of chlorine.

He stated she knew that he would prep his coffee pot to be ready at night so that in the morning he just needed to turn it on to make his coffee.

Roby pretended to drink the coffee while stationed in Germany and waited until the family moved back to Tucson Arizona last summer to alert authorities because he did not want to report his findings in Europe the court documents state.

Johnson is seen in the family’s laundry room pouring bleach into a small container. ABC 7

When the family returned to the US in late June Roby set up a camera inside their temporary housing near Davis Monthan Air Force Base to observe his wife’s behavior – and the camera allegedly captured Melody pouring bleach into his coffee.

On July 6 he filed a report with the Tucson Police Department but police did not follow up because the video did not clearly show what liquid his wife was pouring into his drink prompting Roby to set up a second camera disguised as a fire alarm.

Roby returned to the police department on July 18 to provide additional video evidence and the new footage allegedly showed his wife pouring bleach into the coffee machine before brewing. Johnson was then detained."

WORCESTER MA — The opening of the first Chase Bank branch in Worcester will come with a spotlight on the practices of the retail bank's parent company.

Worcester's first Chase will open Monday at 81 Gold Star Boulevard and activists from 350 Central Mass plan to be there to spotlight investments in the fossil fuel industry made by JPMorgan Chase Bank — the owner of the retail bank chain. The group says JPMorgan has invested an estimated $382 billion in fossil fuels like coal and oil since 2016 according to a 2022 report on the finance industry making it No. 1 bank investor in fossil fuels by about $100 billion.

""The fossil fuel industry can’t pay for new coal oil and gas projects by itself. It relies on banks led by JP Morgan to lend it money"" 350 Central Mass said in a news release. ""When we support banks such as Chase we directly support further fossil fuel development and delay the transition to renewable non-fossil-fuel sources of energy."" RELATED: Activists Use New Tactics To Stop Coal Trains Leaving Worcester

Chase is a relatively new retail bank presence in Massachusetts. The first branch opened in Boston in 2018 but there are now 36 across the state. Chase is planning to open four more Worcester-area branches by 2025 plus the first Springfield branch next year. The first Worcester location is across from Chick-fil-A. 350 Central Mass is asking locals to boycott Chase and use local credit unions and banks instead.

The demonstration outside the bank at 81 Gold Star Boulevard will take place between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9jaGFzZS1tYWtlcy1vdmVyLTUtYmlsbGlvbi1vbi1jcmVkaXQtY2FyZHMtd2FudHMtdG8tZHJpdmUtdGhhdC10by16ZXJvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chase Makes Over $5 Billion On Credit Cards Wants To Drive That To Zero,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9jaGFzZS1tYWtlcy1vdmVyLTUtYmlsbGlvbi1vbi1jcmVkaXQtY2FyZHMtd2FudHMtdG8tZHJpdmUtdGhhdC10by16ZXJvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000026740674E50>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

A storage area network (SAN) is a computer network that provides high-speed and dedicated access to block-level data storage.

SANs deliver shared resource pools for data storage that’s used to access storage hardware through external devices.

They enable external storage devices such as disk arrays and tape libraries to connect as direct-attached storage (DAS) when accessed by the operating system.

See below to learn all about the global SAN market:

Storage area network market

The server SAN market was estimated at $16 billion in 2020. It’s forecast to maintain a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 45.7% from 2020 to 2027 reaching a value of $222.5 billion by the end of it.

Regionally the SAN market is segmented as follows:

The U.S. market was estimated at $4.8 billion in 2020

The Chinese market is forecast for a CAGR of 43.2% reaching $35.1 billion by 2027

Japan and Canada are forecast to grow at a CAGR of 42% and 38.9% over the forecast period

Within Europe Germany is projected to maintain one of the highest CAGRs at 31.1%

By industry the banking financial services and insurance (BFSI) and IT and telecommunications sectors are expected to remain the biggest drivers of the SAN market bringing in an estimated $10 billion by the end of 2022.

Other notable industries in the SAN market include:

Storage area network features

A SAN is a communication infrastructure that physically connects storage devices to user devices and applications through the network.

Unlike direct connections of storage servers SAN infrastructure is able to bypass regular network traffic and bottlenecks allowing for high-speed data access and transfer.

SAN can connect components from server to server server to storage or storage to storage depending on its role and location in the environment.

A SAN has several primary network components:

Storage

The size and type of data being stored affects the hardware being used from solid-state drives (SSDs) and hard disk drives (HDDs) to tape drives.

Server

SAN solutions have their own underlying infrastructure of servers. The type and connection of the server from platforms to consolidated servers over the internet depend on the type of network and the data stored on it.

Networking infrastructure

A SAN moves data around through its hardware and software components using communications channels. A Fibre Channel for instance network protocol allows for fast and prioritized data travel and can be integrated into networking hardware.

Network management software

SAN management software is the intermediary interface between the connected devices storage arrays and the network’s host. It enables users to control the access and routes of data as well as the infrastructure map of user devices storage devices switches and SAN zoning.

Benefits of storage area network

The use of a SAN as the primary or one of many data storage access solutions can result in several key benefits for companies such as:

Reduces bandwidth and traffic bottlenecks

Improved data security

Enables reliable data recovery

Increases scalability options

Simplifies responsive data backups

Enables reliable disaster recovery

Higher fault tolerance

Optimizes storage capacity

Reduces storage costs

“The block-level access allows enterprises to eliminate the need for local storage and facilitate environments with network boot where host devices access all storage needs from the SAN including the operating system” according to a post at BMC.

“SAN can provide nearly unlimited capacity and scalability compared to other solutions as any number of SAN devices can be added to a storage solution.”

Optimizing storage capacity with SAN

Direct storage networks use about 30% of disk space while SAN solutions use around 80% of disk storage utilization.

“A storage area network leads to increased data protection and ensures security. It helps in business continuity management activities such as handling crises dealing with disasters and facing incidents. It can also withstand storage failures and improper coordination” according to a post by Thomastech an IT infrastructure and maintenance services company.

Storage area network use cases

The following case studies highlight how different organizations are using SAN solutions:

Helse Nord

Helse Nord is a health authority in Norway running 11 hospitals and serving just under 500000 residents. It employs more than 19000 people.

Helse Nord’s IT department is responsible for the storage and management of the entire region’s patient data. They were looking to meet more advanced security requirements in the health care industry including GDPR and local standards.

Working with VMware Helse Nord was able to transform their three-layer data infrastructure into a modern software-defined data center (SDDC) using VMware vSphere and VMware vSAN.

“We now have patients in their hospital beds accessing their personal records via their mobile devices” says Vegard Jørgensen senior advisor Helse Nord Department of Services.

”And when the doctor returns to them the following day they have seen all the notes researched their condition and treatment and are much better informed.”

With VMware Helse Nord’s IT department was able to unify their data infrastructure for the region increase the efficiency and scalability of the infrastructure and set up an improved foundation for newer Internet of Things (IoT) and tech services.

The Heart of Worcester College

The Heart of Worcester College (HoW College) has four campuses across the area with an enrolment of over 10000 students along with 700 staff members.

Following the merger of the North East Worcestershire College and the Worcester College of Technology the expansion introduced a pool of 33 TB of storage data in-house applications and security apps spread out over 200 virtual machines (VMs).

Partnering with DataCore HoW College was able to implement SANsymphony as the primary framework for their digital innovation and data infrastructure management.

“It’s difficult to put a price on actual savings using SDS. What I can tell you confidently is that we haven’t had to spend IT budget on spinning disks for over four years allowing us to re-allocate the budget into the student’s digital experience” says Ed Haworth IT lead engineer Heart of Worcestershire College.

“But it’s also a reflection on the peace of mind that DataCore affords seamlessly doing everything for us without complaining or demanding.”

With DataCore HoW College was able to stretch their budget by replacing existing HP hardware gain a complete management overview of their IT environment and implement auto-tiering and correct allocation of data for storage optimization.

Shibuya External Link

Shibuya External Link is named after Tokyo’s busiest intersection where thousands of people are estimated to cross every hour. Based in Sweden the company aims to offer customized IT solutions throughout the Nordic region.

As a provider of data-intensive applications that use big data data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) Shibuya sought a cost-efficient solution for their IT infrastructure. Working with IBM for the past 16 years Shibuya decided to deploy IBM Storage Networking SAN46B-6 to meet their increasing customer demand.

“IBM technology is designed for seamless scalability which means that both we and our clients can seize growth opportunities with confidence” says Christian Wibeck head of business development Shibuya.

“Whether it’s exceptionally high performance or incredible resilience we have the tools to deliver.”

With IBM Shibuya was able to implement round-the-clock customer operations ensure 100% data availability and build the ideal data centers.

Senior quarterback Will Levis threw for 303 yards and four touchdowns on Saturday to help the No. 8 Wildcats hold off upset-minded Northern Illinois 31-23 at Kroger Field.

Three of the touchdown passes were big plays -- a 69-yard strike to senior wide receiver Tayvion Robinson a 70-yard connection with freshman wideout Barion Brown and another score from Robinson on a 40-yard play.

Brown also had a 15-yard touchdown catch as he and Robinson combined for 11 receptions for 249 yards and four scores for Kentucky (4-0 1-0 SEC).

Levis completed 18 of 26 passes on the night with no interceptions and recorded his third 300-yard effort of the season.

""You gotta be who you are"" UK head coach Mark Stoops said ""and right now we have a very talented quarterback and we have some explosive wide receivers so we're creating some big plays.""

""Great protection first and foremost"" Levis said of the explosive plays ""... and receivers being where I knew they would be. It was really cool to see it all come together.""

Kentucky is poised to get star running back Chris Rodriguez back in the mix next week as SEC play resumes with a Top 25 matchup at Ole Miss. The Cats are hoping his return will bolster a rushing attack that has struggled to find consistency through the first four games of the season.

Northern Illinois (1-3 0-0 MAC) outrushed the Cats 128-103 on Saturday although UK did get a solid 12-carry 85-yard effort from tailback Kavosiey Smoke.

Kentucky broke a 14-14 tie at the half with a 70-yard touchdown pass from Levis to Brown on the third play of the third quarter. A 49-yard field goal by Matt Ruffolo extended the lead to 24-14 late in the third quarter and things looked good for the Cats after Robinson's second TD grab of the day made it 31-14 with 8:46 to go.



But the Huskies who are expected to challenge for the MAC championship this season battled back within one score on a 38-yard field goal by John Richardson with 5:26 to go a defensive stop and Justin Lynch's 2-yard touchdown run with 2;47 remaining.

Kentucky stopped a two-point conversion attempt and recovered an onside kick to preserve the tougher-than-expected victory its nation-leading 19th in a row against non-conference opponents.

""Just overall a sluggish game. Good to get it behind us"" Stoops said. ""We know that's a good football team that's tough and gonna play hard and will compete for its conference championship.""

*****

In this ""Rapid Recap"" feature we touch on some quick-hitters from the UK victory...

KEY MOMENT:

After giving up a late touchdown to NIU to tie the game at 14-14 going into halftime the Cats' collective mood was not all that good. That changed quickly however as Will Levis found speedy freshman Barion Brown on a slant pass across the middle with the third play from scrimmage and Brown was off to the races. It seemed to be just what the Cats needed to get their energy back and a build a comfortable lead.

GAME BALL:

Tayvion Robinson Kentucky -- The transfer wideout was targeted seven times on Saturday and he delivered seven receptions. Two of them went to the house. He finished with 147 yards on the night in a Wan'Dale-esque performance.

BY THE NUMBERS:

1st - Kentucky quarterback Will Levis to have back to back 300-yard passing performances since Patrick Towles (EKU Auburn) in the 2015 season.

5 - Sacks by the NIU defense.

8 - Game winning streak is the fifth-longest in UK program history. The longest is 12 spanning the 1909-10 seasons.

10-for-16 - Cats' conversions on third down.

12 - Tackles by UK super senior linebacker Jacquez Jones to lead the Cats.

16.8 - Average yards per pass completion by UK quarterback Will Levis.

209 - Yards after catch by the UK receiving corps.

QUOTABLE:

""He's got that team on his back right now. The kid is a beast."" -- UK head coach Mark Stoops on Wildcats quarterback Will Levis

UP NEXT:

Kentucky returns to action next week at Ole Miss. The Rebels (4-0 0-0 SEC) defeated Tulsa 35-27 on Saturday in Oxford."

It is no longer owned by tech conglomerate Tsinghua Unigroup  which was acquired in July by Beijing Zhiguangxin Holding . Meanwhile former Tsinghua Unigroup chairman Zhao Weiguo who accompanied Xi on that chip factory tour has been put under investigation

Many of those reports carried Xinhua’s picture of Xi and his entourage clad in white protective coats on a tour of the facilities at Wuhan Xinxin Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp (XMC) a subsidiary of China’s top memory chip maker Yangtze Memory Technologies Co (YMTC).

A few months before the US-China trade war started in July 2018 local media coverage of President Xi Jinping was focused on his efforts to rally the country’s top scientists and engineers to pursue breakthroughs in core technologies  as tensions simmered between Beijing and Washington.

More importantly YMTC faces pressure amid the possibility that it might come under new US trade sanctions . The firm based in Wuhan capital of central Hubei province did not reply to requests for comment.

As such YMTC finds itself leading the way for China’s semiconductor industry to cut reliance on imported technologies while continuing to pursue innovation.

“YMTC is not a copycat with trailing-edge technology like [how] many erroneously perceive Chinese semiconductor companies [to be]” Dylan Patel chief analyst at Los Angeles-based SemiAnalysis wrote in a newsletter last month. “They are building their own innovative and unique products.”

The memory chip maker according to a Nikkei Asia report published in May 2021 had set up a task force of more than 800 people to review its supply chain with the ultimate goal of replacing US suppliers. Although that report was subsequently denied by YMTC it reflected how the company has become an integral part of the global semiconductor supply chain.

Privately-held YMTC was established in July 2016 after Tsinghua Unigroup took over the memory chip unit of Wuhan XMC which was founded in 2006 and operates two chip fabrication plants. XMC had collaborated with and licensed the Flash memory technology of US firm Spansion since 2008. Spansion was later acquired by Cypress Semiconductor which was then bought in 2020 by German firm Infineon Technologies

The state-backed China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund  also known as the Big Fund and Hubei Science & Technology Investment Group provided seed capital of about 18.9 billion yuan (US$2.67 billion) to YMTC. Total investments to YMTC reached US$24 billion according to the company’s website.

In October 2017 YMTC designed and manufactured China’s first 3D NAND flash memory wafer through its own research and development and international cooperation according to the firm’s website. Its 3D NAND flash memory packaged chips are embedded in various storage devices as well as consumer and enterprise solid-state drives which are widely used in mobile devices personal computers servers and various consumer electronics products.

YMTC has more than 10000 employees worldwide including 6000 engineers involved in research and development activities. The company is looking to hire graduates to fill dozens of positions at its operations in Wuhan Shanghai and Beijing according to its latest recruitment post.

One of the company’s latest NAND chip products according to Chinese media reports is a 232-layer chip that puts the firm on par with if not better than the world’s leading memory chip manufacturers that include Samsung Electronics Micron and SK Hynix . There has been no official YMTC confirmation about that reported breakthrough.

China is the world’s second-largest market for NAND flash products making up more than 31 per cent of the global market according to data from Minsheng Securities. YMTC however only had a 1 per cent share of the global memory chip market in 2020.

Samsung Toshiba Western Digital Intel Micron and SK Hynix controlled 95 per cent in the same period according to Minsheng Securities. By 2025 it expected YMTC to increase its share to 6 per cent.

Still YMTC has been expected to become a memory chip supplier to Apple  with the iPhone and iPad maker reportedly keen to use the Chinese firm’s products for devices sold on the mainland.

“YMTC’s chance to enter Apple’s supply chain as a key player of the Chinese memory industry has great symbolic significance for the industry and is a recognition of its technological prowess” said Arisa Liu a senior semiconductor research fellow at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research.

That potential development however has reportedly raised eyebrows back in the US.

Washington according to reports in August has been contemplating a ban on selling US semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China’s advanced NAND Flash chip foundries  which would mark the first time this segment of the mainland’s integrated circuit industry has been targeted by the US government.

The possibility of the US expanding the scope of its trade sanctions to include YMTC is real given the memory chip maker’s technological progress according to Liu from the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research.

US Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer renewed calls on Washington to add YMTC to its trade blacklist for violating export controls by supplying chips to Huawei  based upon findings from a third-party teardown report by the Canada-based consulting firm IP Research Group according to a Financial Times report on Thursday. The teardown showed that YMTC supplied NAND memory chips to Huawei’s foldable smartphone  the Mate Xs 2 the report said.

But Siva Manoharan IP Research Group’s founder and managing partner downplayed the significance of their teardown analysis in an emailed response to the South China Morning Post. He said the group just “supplied a picture of the chips found on the phone nothing more – there is no evidence or opinion on the dates or sources of any chips on the phone or when the phone was manufactured”.

YMTC which last year denied US politicians’ claims that it had ties to the Chinese military has remained mum on the prospects of being hit by US sanctions . Such trade restrictions could impact the firm’s operations which uses semiconductor manufacturing gear from Lam Research and licensed technology from Adeia part of Xperi Holding Corp according to Patel from SemiAnalysis.

The NAND Flash memory chip market is currently “frosty” according to a research note by TrendForce analyst Bryan Ao who said inventories are at a “breaking point” and that chip makers are being forced to cut prices.

YMTC had previously planned to process a monthly capacity of 30000 wafers by 2020 which would reach 1 million by 2030 after its three fabs reach full capacity in 2025.",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After US sanctions Leading memory chip manufacturer in China carefully navigates the path to semiconductor self-sufficiency,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='english.newstracklive.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/after-us-sanctions-leading-memory-chip-manufacturer-in-china-carefully-navigates-the-path-to-semiconductor-self-sufficiency-sc71-nu355-ta355-1251330-1.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000267413BA860>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,

The security agencies handling security at the airport have raised multiple concerns over the system not being able to detect several objects and some “black spots” coming through the machine during the trial phase.

Sources both within the security establishment and officials at the Delhi Airport confirmed to The Sunday Guardian that the lone body scanner machine that was roped in for trial at Delhi airport’s Terminal 2 is currently not being used and is lying idle inside the terminal building. A source in the security establishment of the Delhi airport told The Sunday Guardian “The body scanner trial has not been much of a success so far. There were several issues that emerged during the trial phase; the machine was throwing up several black spots when a person was passing through the body scanner and in such a case the machine was not meeting the purpose for which it had been brought into service. Therefore the body scanner machine is not being used anymore.”

Sources within Delhi Airport and its security establishment have said that the report on the trial of the body scanner has been submitted to the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) and to the Ministry of Civil Aviation who would take a further call on what the next steps would be.

A full body scanner is a device that detects objects without making physical contact. Unlike metal detectors full-body scanners can detect non-metal objects which are hard to detect with the conventional door frame metal detector (DFMD) such as narcotics plastic explosives and prohibited or illegal objects made of substances like rubber that cannot be detected by metal detectors. The scanners detect the size shape and location of objects concealed in body cavities or organs as well.

These full body scanners incorporate advanced technology and are meant to replace physical frisking at the airports where passengers can move from the check-in lounge to the Security Hold Area (SHA) of the airport without having to spend long time in queue. Full body scanners use millimetre wave technology to detect both metallic and non-metallic objects. Millimetre waves easily pass through common clothing materials and reflect off any concealed objects. An imaging system uses the reflected wavefronts to construct a three-dimensional image on a monitor revealing the size shape and orientation of the concealed object.

In 2019 BCAS and the Ministry of Civil Aviation mandated that 84 airports which are categorised as hyper sensitive and sensitive airports must install full body scanners as part of the enhanced security protocols measures in these airports. However BCAS had to push the 2019 deadline to March 2022 keeping in mind the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak across the globe.

Despite the extension in the deadline it was only Delhi Airport that roped in a full body scanner in June 2022 to start the trial phase. The trial of the full body scanner was carried out for a period of 60 days and during the initial days of the trial problems with regards to the detection and imaging started to crop up following which the use of body scanners was stopped. The full body scanner used in the trial phase was procured by the Delhi airport from Leidos an American defence aviation and information technology company. The cost of a full body scanner ranges somewhere between Rs 4-7 crore and the high cost of the machine has been one of the impediments of the airport operators across the country for the delay in procuring these machines.

NAVSEA press release

The ship is the 12th Freedom-variant Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) designed and delivered by the Lockheed Martin-led industry team. Delivery marks the official transfer of the ship from the shipbuilder to the Navy. Following delivery the ship will sail away for a commissioning ceremony in New York City before transiting to its homeport in Mayport Florida.

“Today marks a significant shipbuilding milestone in the life of the future USS Cooperstown ‘America’s Away Team’ an exceptional ship and the latest inductee into the Navy’s arsenal conducting operations around the globe.”

Capt. Andy Gold PMS 501 (Littoral Combat Ships) program manager.

LCS 23 is the second Freedom-variant ship outfitted with the combining gear correction that will allow unrestricted operations. The correction addresses a class-wide flaw that was identified as the Fleet deployed these ships in greater numbers.

The future USS Cooperstown will be the first naval ship to honor the Village of Cooperstown in Otsego County New York. The village is located at the southern end of the historic Otsego Lake in the central region of the state. Cooperstown New York is the home of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum which is the source of the ship’s motto “America’s Away Team.”

Several more Freedom variant ships are under construction at the Fincantieri Marinette Marine shipyard in Marinette Wisconsin. The future USS Marinette (LCS 25) is scheduled for delivery in early 2023. Additional ships in various stages of construction include the future ships USS Nantucket (LCS 27) USS Beloit (LCS 29) and USS Cleveland (LCS 31). LCS 31 will be the final Freedom-variant LCS.

The LCS class is now the second-largest surface ship class in production. The future USS Cooperstown is the fourth LCS delivered in Fiscal Year 2022 following the deliveries of the Freedom-variant USS Minneapolis-Saint Paul (LCS 21) Independence-variant USS Canberra (LCS 30) and Independence-variant USS Santa Barbara (LCS 32).

The LCS is a fast agile mission-focused platform designed to operate in near-shore and open ocean environments capable of winning against 21st-century coastal threats such as mines and swarming small craft. The ships are capable of supporting forward presence maritime security sea control and deterrence.

“I look forward to seeing Cooperstown step up to the plate with her sister ships in Mayport to bring her slugging capabilities to the Fleet.” Gold said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbG9jYWxwcm92LmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL3Uucy4tbmF2eS12ZXRlcmFuLXRob21hcy1qLi1iZW1iZW5lay1vZi1qYW1lc3Rvd24tZGllcy1hdC04MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. Navy Veteran Thomas J. Bembenek of Jamestown Dies at 81,"U.S. Navy Veteran Thomas J. Bembenek of Jamestown Dies at 81

Thomas J. Bembenek of Jamestown RI passed away Monday September 19th at the age of 81. He was born in Webster MA on December 21 1940 the son of Chester and Carolyn Bembenek and brother of the late Roseann (Bembenek) Olszta and Richard Bembenek.

Tom is survived by his wife of 39 years Gail (Trifoglio) Bembenek of Jamestown; his sons Thomas C. Bembenek and wife Adona of Rainier OR Anthony Bembenek of Worcester MA and Timothy Bembenek of Auburn MA; daughters Carolyn Peabody of Ayer MA and Rosemarie Tremblay of Orlando FL; and three grandsons Jacob Peabody and Tommy and Sebastian Bembenek. He is also survived by his nephew John Olszta and wife Heather of Dudley MA; grand-nephew's Joshua and Jeremy; and his former wife Haydee Bembenek of Auburn MA.

After graduating from Bartlett High School in 1958 he enlisted in the US Navy proudly remaining on active duty for more than 24 years. During that time some of his assignments included serving aboard a wooden hull minesweep The USS Jacana and several Navy destroyers (USS Willard Keith USS Basilone and USS Dyess.) He also served at the Naval Air Station in Port Hueneme CA (where he proudly earned his air wings) as an instructor at the Navy Surface Warfare Officer's School and the Naval Education and Training Center both in Newport RI.

Upon retirement from active duty Tom began a second career as a civilian computer systems analyst with emphasis on submarine firing and weapons systems while working for several small defense contracting firms and then finally Lockheed Martin until he retired once again in the mid-2000s.

Tom enjoyed many forms of vocation and hobbies and was enthralled by anything mechanical but his true love was anything with wheels - he worked on mostly older vehicles both muscle and classic cars and trucks as well as the occasional motorcycle. Over the years he tackled a myriad of restoration and rebuilding projects - enjoying every minute - and so happy to discuss the details of each project.

They represent the culmination of the eternal dream of flight of countless generations. They are majestic flying machines and their air abilities are unmatched.

Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada teases us with a couple of masterpieces one courtesy of the Air Combat Command Instagram account and the other via the Nellis AFB’s social media post. Two equally spectacular moments with two fantastic protagonists.The first one is an F-15E of the 422d Test and Evaluation Squadron and the video – tantalizingly slow-motioned – gives us a glimpse of what a take-off in style is all about. Filmed during a Black Flag exercise held recently at the Nevada airfield the jet – majestically liveried in dark matte colors – ripples through the hot air of the desert with the stream of hot gasses ejecting out its engine nozzle.Just as spectacular if not more so is the F-35 that takes to the air at dawn with the stunning Las Vegas backdrop shining behind the turbulent superheated flow of jet engine flames. To me that gives the “firepower” a whole new twist and puts the “power” in that “firepower.”Separated by nearly 40 decades the two combat aircraft serve the same ultimate purpose – reign supreme in the sky and keep all foes at bay. Although the older F-15 is more prominent in all aspects (wingspan length and height) it is also lighter than its younger sibling. And the 40 years in avionics development become apparent with the fifth-generation fighter backed by a single engine almost as powerful as the F-15’s twin turbofans.The Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-220 afterburning pair on the Eagle can generate 29180 lbf (64.9 kN) of thrust – 47440 lbf (105.7 kN) with an afterburner. The Lightning’s Pratt & Whitney F135-PW-100 is suitable for 28000 lbf (125 kN) of thrust dry and 43000 lbf (191 kN) with a full afterburner.However the stealthy youngster is seriously outpaced in the top speed ferry and combat range and service ceiling. The F-15 can hit Mach 2.5 (1650 mph 2655 kph) at high altitude and Mach 1.2 (921 mph; 1482 kph) at sea level which is way faster than the maximum speed (at altitude) of Mach 1.6 on which the F-35 can rely. On the other hand since no one can see it coming the F-35 is just as formidable a striker at lower speeds.As for firepower suffice to say that any of these two can unleash doomsday with one push of a button given their devastating arsenal-carrying capacities. That’s why these great warbirds are best seen during regular exercise flights and not in their natural habitat. I can’t choose a favorite from the two videos but feel free to take sides. Either way it’s a win-win scenario."

White and Elsie M. White. Marilyn passed away on September 16 2022 at the age of 86 surrounded by the love and grace of her family. Marilyn suffered from complications from an anoxic brain injury sustained during a medical procedure in April. She fought hard to recover to return to her lifetime passion for teaching piano.

Marilyn attended Knox College in Galesburg Illinois where she received degrees in liberal arts and piano performance. She received her master's degree with distinction in piano from Indiana University Bloomington where she was a student of Menahem Pressler and also studied organ and church music. She excelled in all of her studies receiving top honors awards honorary memberships and fellowships for continuing doctoral studies in music theory. Her love of education continued throughout her life with her most recent college courses in Jazz in the fall 2021 and spring 2022 semesters. She attended First and Calvary Presbyterian Church and later joined Trinity Presbyterian in Springfield.

In Marilyn’s early career she performed professionally as a piano and organ soloist worldwide. She also performed as a pianist with the world-renowned Fine Arts Trio in Columbia Missouri and was an ensemble performer with many college and university faculty members. As a professor she taught at Christian College (now Columbia College) in Columbia Missouri Evangel University and Southwest Missouri State University (now Missouri State University) in Springfield Missouri. She was also active in church music as an organist choir director and handbell choir director.

Marilyn had a deep love for teaching and genuinely loved her students and the teachers she worked with for over 50 years. Marilyn used these experiences and the knowledge she gained through research and teaching to develop and author a non-traditional piano series Music Moves for Piano™ which is a piano method series based on Edwin E. Gordon's Music Learning Theory. Marilyn has successfully used this new teaching approach with her own students since 1992.

Music Moves for Piano™ has received international recognition and has been published translated and used worldwide as a new standard for music education resulting in speaking engagements on the topics of composition improvisation piano pedagogy and audiation at conferences throughout the world including the World Piano Pedagogy Conference the Early Childhood Music & Movement Convention the GIML International Conference the National Conference on Keyboard Pedagogy and the Music Teachers National Association Conference. Most noteworthy she was most recently selected to be the keynote speaker at the 2023 International Conference on Music Learning theory sponsored by the Gordon Institute for Music Learning.

Marilyn was active in many local and state music organizations. She was a founding member of the Springfield Area Arts Council the Springfield Piano Teachers Forum and a member of the Springfield Symphony Orchestra Board of Directors for 14 years. She also served two years as Convention Chair and two years as President for the Missouri Music Teachers Association and was honored by the Missouri Music Teachers Association as the 2007 ""Teacher of the Year."" In the fall of 2008 Andrea Apostoli President of the Italian Gordon Organization ""AIGAM"" presented her with honorary membership in AIGAM for outstanding work in the field of piano pedagogy.

Marilyn was married to Dr. Howard J. Lowe on June 4 1960. She is survived by her son Doug Lowe (wife Melanie) and their three children Jennifer James and Jonathan; son Dr. David Lowe and his three children Matthew Sarah and Lauren; and her twins; Susan Libiez (husband Dave) and their two children Michael and Anna; and William Lowe (fiancée Ashley Brown) and his three children Nicholas (fiancée Olivia Bible) Caroline and Whitney. She is also survived by her brother Dr. Roger White (wife Dr. Marilyn White) and sister Karen Avalos.

She was preceded in death by her husband Dr. Howard J. Lowe brother Dr. David White and the recent passing of her brother Steve White (survived by his wife Dr. Cathy White).

Marilyn was loved by so many as she traveled the world to meet her friends and colleagues and enjoy some of the best fine arts performances in the world. Our family is extremely grateful for the overwhelming amount of kind words and for learning about and reading the amazing stories of the profound impact she had on so many people's lives. It is important to her family to keep her work and legacy alive and to honor her desire to continue to promote and encourage music education and learning. As such the family is establishing the Marilyn Lowe Foundation to provide support in the nature of scholarships resources and materials to teachers students and organizations to continue her legacy of being a difference maker in the lives of others. More information will be made available shortly at http://www.marilynlowe.com/

The family plans to have a private family burial service and to provide an online forum virtual celebration of her life so that her many online international and other friends and families can participate together.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy91ay1lbmdsYW5kLW1hbmNoZXN0ZXItNjI3OTM3NjfSATtodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY29tL25ld3MvdWstZW5nbGFuZC1tYW5jaGVzdGVyLTYyNzkzNzY3LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The weekend: The campaigning duo who helped get workers two days off,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL21pY2hhZWwtbG93ZS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNjY0ODI0NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michael Lowe Obituary - Regency Mortuary - Sun City - 2022,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/michael-lowe-obituary?id=36648246 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL21pY2hhZWwtbG93ZS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNjY0ODI0NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMivAFodHRwczovL2ZhZGVhd2F5d29ybGQubmV0L3phY2gtbG93ZS1hbmQtcmFtb25hLXNoZWxidXJuZS13YXJuLXRoYXQtdGhlLWltZS11ZG9rYS1zaXR1YXRpb24taXMtd2F5LXdvcnNlLXRoYW4td2UtdGhpbmstaXRzLXVnbHktYW5kLWl0cy1nb2luZy10by1iZS1yZWFsbHktc2FkLXRoZXJlcy1nb2luZy10by1iZS1kYW1hZ2UtaGVyZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Zach Lowe And Ramona Shelburne Warn That The Ime Udoka Situation Is Way Worse Than We Think: ""It's Ugly And ...","ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMivAFodHRwczovL2ZhZGVhd2F5d29ybGQubmV0L3phY2gtbG93ZS1hbmQtcmFtb25hLXNoZWxidXJuZS13YXJuLXRoYXQtdGhlLWltZS11ZG9rYS1zaXR1YXRpb24taXMtd2F5LXdvcnNlLXRoYW4td2UtdGhpbmstaXRzLXVnbHktYW5kLWl0cy1nb2luZy10by1iZS1yZWFsbHktc2FkLXRoZXJlcy1nb2luZy10by1iZS1kYW1hZ2UtaGVyZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002674225A4A0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The settlement which follows an investigation from a coalition of 50 attorneys general requires the three companies to make their advertisements more transparent.

Under the terms of the agreement Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T can only advertise their plans as “unlimited” if there are no limits on how much data someone can use during a billing cycle. The ads must “clearly and conspicuously” say that restrictions on speed may apply as well as specify the amount of data customers can use before triggering the slowdown.

Additionally the attorneys general went after the allegedly misleading claims Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T made in ads promising to “pay” customers to switch carriers. All three companies must now clearly disclose the terms and conditions associated with the offer including how much a customer will be paid and when they will receive their payment. The carriers must also disclose the requirements customers must meet to receive “free” phone offers along with any hidden fees.

“AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile lied to millions of consumers making false promises of free phones and ‘unlimited’ data plans that were simply untrue” New York Attorney General Letitia James says in a statement. “Big companies are not excused from following the law and cannot trick consumers into paying for services they will never receive.”

Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T will also have to appoint a “dedicated representative” to field customer complaints. The three companies deny any wrongdoing. “These voluntary agreements reflect no finding of improper conduct and reaffirm the wireless industry’s longstanding commitment to clarity and integrity in advertising so that consumers can make informed decisions about the products and services that best suit them” Nick Ludlum the senior vice president of the CTIA the trade group representing the carriers tells The Verge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0aWNvLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9jb21tZXJjZS8yMDI0L2dyZWctb2xzZW4teW91dGgtc3BvcnRzLXBsYXRmb3JtLXJlZWxzLWluLTQtNW0taW4tc2VlZC1tb25leS0xMjM0Nzc4NjYzL9IBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0aWNvLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9jb21tZXJjZS8yMDI0L2dyZWctb2xzZW4teW91dGgtc3BvcnRzLXBsYXRmb3JtLXJlZWxzLWluLTQtNW0taW4tc2VlZC1tb25leS0xMjM0Nzc4NjYzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Greg Olsen’s Youth Sports Platform Reels in $4.5M in Seed Money,"Former NFL star Greg Olsen is turning his passion for youth sports into a venture that he believes will help millions nationwide navigate a disjointed and fragmented landscape.

The three-time Pro Bowler turned Fox Sports broadcaster has closed on a $4.5M seed round for his new youth sports content and commerce company Youth Inc. a platform that aims to not only entertain and educate listeners but serve as a direct-to-consumer merchandise marketplace.

“This is something that I live every day whether it’s through my own kids or spending time training other people’s kids” Olsen a father of three said in an interview. “Five six days a week I’m in the community living the youth sports experience as a dad as a coach and as a former athlete … If we build out this platform the right way this can be a lasting resource that millions of families throughout the country can rely on.”

The initial funding round was led by Will Ventures with co-investments from Ryan Sports Ventures Hello Sunshine co-founder Jim Toth and private equity fund ISOS Ventures.

Olsen who founded Youth Inc. parent company Audiorama with former Carolina Panthers teammate Ryan Kalil received help from other football brethren. Star quarterbacks Josh Allen (Buffalo Bills) and CJ Stroud (Houston Texans) as well as Ohio State head coach Ryan Day contributed to the round.

Audiorama which is backed by Powerhouse Capital was launched by Olsen Kalil and Hollywood actor Vince Vaughn in March of 2022. The production company debuted its first podcast (Youth Inc.) that same month originally as a pure content play where parents coaches and others can explore the changing world of youth sports nationwide during a show hosted by Olsen.

It wasn’t long after season one was complete that Olsen developed bigger ambitions of creating an all-encompassing youth sports platform that can satisfy a wider range of needs in the market. Fueled by new capital Olsen and his team are pivoting with plans to launch the new Youth Inc. platform later this year.

Youth Inc. has tapped some of the more experienced executives in the space to lead the company’s evolution as it goes from podcast to a standalone media and e-commerce company that will be based in Nashville and the greater Philadelphia area.

Tim Murphy who is the former executive vice president of strategy and business development at Audacy will serve as the company’s president of media while former Fanatics director of business development Ryan Baise will serve as CEO and will spearhead the brand’s on-demand DTC marketplace.

Baise who oversaw new ventures for e-commerce giant Fanatics understands the complexities and logistic challenges that come with delivering merchandise for a range of different teams and sports from tennis to basketball. The former Illinois quarterback says what will be key is building a destination brand and creating brand affinity.

“We’re going to build this commerce platform that services the market with a completely differentiated supply chain than anything that exists out there today” he said.

The leaders of Youth Inc. are hoping that within a handful of years their platform will be a streamlined one-stop shop for customers to experience premium media content or score their favorite team’s uniform while also offering business-to-business services including helping larger youth sports organizations manage its merchandise functions.

“Once people get exposed to us then we can service all of their needs on our e-commerce site whether that’s team store fan wear player uniform and other merchandise” said Olsen the son of longtime high school football coach Chris Olsen. “We think the content piece really feeds the commerce and obviously the commerce feeds back into people finding us and having access to our content information that we publish.”"

MTCH,Match Group,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA5LzI1LzEtYmVhdGVuLWRvd24tc3RvY2stdG8tYnV5LWR1cmluZy10aGUtMjAyMi1iZWFyLW1hL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,1 Beaten-Down Stock to Buy During the 2022 Bear Market,"Investors are unreasonably pessimistic about this company.

You couldn't be faulted for swiping left on dating app company Match Group (MTCH 0.36%) in 2022. Down over 60% this year the owner of Tinder Hinge and Match.com is one of the worst performers of the S&P 500 index even lagging behind big losers like Netflix. With foreign exchange headwinds disappointing guidance and an unexpected managerial shake-up at Tinder its most important app investors have lost faith in Match Group stock this year.

But the long-term thesis with online dating is still intact and this short-term pessimism is providing investors with a fantastic buying opportunity. Here's why now is the time to get greedy and pick up some shares of Match Group.

Headwinds should abate soon

There are two major headwinds Match Group is facing in 2022: the devaluation of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar and a lack of execution at Tinder. Both developments caused Match Group to revise its upcoming quarterly revenue guidance to be flat year over year as opposed to the 15%-20% growth the company was expecting at the start of 2022.

Match Group is an international company that makes sales through in-app purchases in many countries outside of its home market the U.S. In 2022 currencies like the euro and Japanese yen have gotten devalued significantly versus the U.S. dollar. When this happens sales translate to become a lot weaker in U.S. dollars even if the products are priced the same in their respective domestic markets hurting Match Group's consolidated revenue growth.

For example in Q2 of this year Match Group's revenue would have grown 19% year over year without foreign currency headwinds as opposed to the 12% growth it actually posted. Foreign exchange rates are unpredictable but it is unlikely these ahistorical moves versus the U.S. dollar will continue in the years ahead which should help Match Group's financials.

With Tinder Match Group updated investors in Q2 that it has been disappointed with product execution at its flagship app in 2022. The team has subsequently been fired and new management is taking the reins along with a search for a new president/CEO of the division. With poor and delayed product releases at the app this year Match Group now expects muted growth at Tinder this year. While this will hurt in 2022 it is likely the best long-term move and if Tinder can get its new features like better subscription packages and a female-focused product by the end of this year the app should resume its growth trajectory in 2023.

On top of these revenue headwinds Match Group just hired a new CEO Bernard Kim. Kim has experience within the mobile app space helping run Zynga which I think will help him efficiently run Match Group's dating apps. But there is always uncertainty when a new leader takes the helm of a public company. This is likely adding even more fear for investors at the moment leading Match Group's stock to decline.

Long-term tailwinds are still alive

Still interested in Match Group even with all these short-term headwinds? Good because the long-term opportunity for mobile dating apps is phenomenal.

According to Match Group's internal research fewer than 50% of eligible singles on every major continent have tried an online dating product. In North America industry penetration is 43% and in Asia Pacific it is only 18%. In my view this shows that online dating still has many years -- if not decades -- to grow around the world. With minimal competition outside of Bumble Match Group has the best shot of capturing these users with apps like Tinder and Hinge once it regains its footing in 2023.

For example from 2017-2021 Match Group's revenue grew at a compound annual rate of 22%. Some of this was due to great execution but a lot of it was because the company was in the right business riding the right long-term tailwind. I expect this tailwind to continue this decade helping Match Group grow its revenue at a double-digit rate from 2023 onwards.

If you squint the stock is cheap

As of this writing Match Group stock trades at a market cap of approximately $15 billion. While its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio looks expensive at 162 this is actually masking the true earnings power of the dating app business because of one-time write-offs and non-cash charges.

From 2017-2021 Match Group's adjusted operating margin was 35% or higher. Historically the company has converted a little bit less of its adjusted earnings into free cash flow. Free cash flow is the true measure of profitability for a business as it is the actual cash being generated for shareholders. Conservatively let's assume Match Group generates an average free cash flow margin of 30% in the future.

With $3.2 billion in trailing-12-month revenue this would equate to $960 million in annual free cash flow or a price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) ratio of 15.6. This is below the market average which looks cheap considering the industry growth of online dating. If Match Group can grow its revenue by 15% a year for the next three years it will be doing $4.86 billion in annual sales. At a 30% margin this would equate to $1.46 billion in free cash flow and a P/FCF ratio of 10.

Even though there are major short-term headwinds Match Group is a high-margin cash-generating business riding a secular tailwind. At current prices that makes the stock a buy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHA6Ly9lbmdsaXNoLm5ld3MuY24vMjAyMjA5MjUvNmM4NTU4Y2E3ZDM0NDliZWE4YjJlZDE3Y2NlY2M5NTUvYy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup 2022 Group B match: Australia vs. Serbia,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiR2h0dHA6Ly9lbmdsaXNoLm5ld3MuY24vMjAyMjA5MjUvNmM4NTU4Y2E3ZDM0NDliZWE4YjJlZDE3Y2NlY2M5NTUvYy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000026740606920>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The team known as the Green Falcons led by German coach Monika Staab drew 3-3 with visitors Bhutan at the Prince Sultan bin Abdul Aziz Stadium in Abha with a late equaliser in the 90th minute by Noura Al-Ibrahim. The Saudi team will face the same opponents again on Wednesday.

Staab was appointed as coach last year by the Saudi Arabian Football Federation (SAFF) of the then-newly established women’s national team just under a year following the formation of the Saudi Women’s Football League.

“Win lose or draw these home matches are a historic moment in the transformative journey that women’s football is on in Saudi Arabia” said Saudi Arabian Football Federation (SAFF) President Yasser Al-Misehal.

“As well as developing and improving on-pitch the team’s impact is being felt by the number of women and girls throughout the country who are being inspired to play and follow football.”

Prior to yesterday’s match the Saudi team only had two previous games against the Seychelles and Maldives in February both ending in 2-0 victories and earned the praise of Brazilian football legend Pele.

On 15 September the SAFF launched the first edition of the Saudi Women’s Premier League with the participation of eight teams. The new season will start on 13 October on a home-and-away basis with a total of 56 matches reported Arab News. The federation also approved the establishment of a Division One which will kick off in November.

The Saudi women’s national team and the domestic league are considered to be part of the kingdom’s Vision2030 under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman with sports and female empowerment among the areas included in the social and economic reforms.

“Sports is an important part of the economy. Not only does football add to the economy directly through the commercial part or marketing part but also to the economy in an indirect way” SAFF General Secretary Ibrahim Al-Kassim was quoted as saying by Goal earlier in the week.

“The importance of football in the country’s Vision 2030 is evident in the fact that Saudi Arabia have bid for hosting rights of the 2027 Asian Cup and 2026 Women’s Asian Cup” the article added.

The American who beat Roger Federer in the Swiss great’s last competitive match on Friday proved a fly in Europe’s ointment once again with a scintillating victory.

He was outplayed in the first set but roared back to win 1-6 7-6(11) [10-8] to give Team World an unassailable 13-8 lead.

Team World who had lost the four previous editions of the team event began the day trailing 8-4 but Canada’s Felix Auger-Aliassime stunned Novak Djokovic 6-3 7-6(3) having earlier partnered Jack Sock to a 2-6 6-3 10-8 victory against Andy Murray and Matteo Berrettini.

Tsitsipas had the chance to take the match to a deciding singles but Tiafoe was inspired in front of a raucous O2 Arena crowd who loved his showman antics.

After winning the match point he collapsed to the court and was buried under a pile of his team mates and captain John McEnroe who then treated the crowd to some dance moves.

“It’s an unbelievable feeling” Tiafoe who reached the U.S. Open semi-final said on court. “John McEnroe dropped a lot of F bombs saying we can’t lose again. Felix beat Novak today and we all did it together it wasn’t just me.”

McEnroe was clearly overjoyed to finally end a long wait to taste victory and get one over old rival Bjorn Borg who was captain of a Team Europe side who were big favourites.

“No one beats Team World five times in a row” the American said. “Felix stepped up big time.

McCormick listened to struggles and challenges in the community firsthand from commonwealth veterans who attended.

He was welcomed to speak by Congressman Glenn “GT” Thompson and the chairman of the Clinton County Republican Party Kurt Smith who praised McCormick for what he’s been doing during his campaign.

Some of the topics McCormick touched on were the economy immigration the fentanyl crisis term limits the country’s spiritual decline and support of veterans across the country.

He answered questions from the crowd using his perspective as someone who served in the U.S. military and spoke about what he would do to better support veterans as Pennsylvania’s next U.S. Senator.

Those in attendance had the opportunity to sign McCormick’s bus which he hopes to fill with signatures from across the commonwealth.

Mr McCormick's decision not to pursue a leadership bid leaves Mr Swinney as the only official candidate after Humza Yousaf announced he is stepping down.

Mr Yousaf said he was resigning last week after he decided to end the power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Green Party.

Reports of a contest began early on Sunday when Mr McCormick said he had secured the 100 nominations from 20 branches needed to run against Mr Swinney.

But in a statement shared with Sky News the party activist said he had had a ""lengthy and fruitful conversation"" with Mr Swinney adding he had ""met the threshold set by the party rules"".

""John and I agreed the challenges which the SNP our government and our people face and explored new thinking on a range of issues which I am confident as they are advanced will inspire activists both within the SNP and wider independence movement in the following weeks and months"" he said.

""This is a fresh start for our members and our politicians and I'm sure that John's determination to deliver Independence will be rewarded at the forthcoming general election.

""I have therefore concluded that I shall not proceed with my nomination for party leader but instead support John Swinney's nomination for party leader and first minister of Scotland.""

It means the party will avoid a three-week leadership contest which would have been triggered had Mr McCormick not stepped aside and received the required 100 nominations.

Assuming there are no last-minute challengers the leadership bid will not have to be put to SNP members and Mr Swinney is likely to become Scotland's next first minister as early as Tuesday.

Barring a bombshell - Swinney will become leader today Connor Gillies Scotland correspondent @ConnorGillies The SNP establishment is quietly breathing a sigh of relief after a wildcard challenger pulled the plug. Grassroots member Graeme McCormick has been a thorn in the side of the party hierarchy for a long time but the truth is he never stood a chance of becoming leader. Apparently he was gathering the required 100 signatures from party members on his clipboard at an independence rally in Glasgow on Saturday. It doesn't get more grassroots than that. His move to trigger a contest would have delayed the inevitable Swinney win but it would have forced the party to spend three weeks having another internal debate. It would have been difficult (and embarrassing) for Mr Swinney and co as they try and pull a divided party back together. Mr McCormick told Sky News he had a discussion with Mr Swinney on Sunday and it seems the pair came to some sort of agreement. Many will see this as a small diplomatic win for the incoming first minister as he uses soft power to spare the SNP’s blushes. Barring a bombshell Mr Swinney will become leader tomorrow and first minister of Scotland on Tuesday as Humza Yousaf packs his bags and heads for the same door he kicked the Greens out of a few weeks ago.

Who is John Swinney?

What direction will the SNP take?

Earlier on Sunday Mr Swinney warned potential challengers from entering the race saying it would delay the party from ""rebuilding"".

""My bid to become SNP leader has received very very comprehensive support within the SNP. I have sent out a message which is about unifying the SNP to strengthen our party and win Scottish independence"" he told Sky's Trevor Phillips.

""I think that is necessary as the SNP is not as cohesive today as the party needs to be and my campaign has attracted very wide support.

""So I think the SNP has got a chance to start rebuilding from the difficult period that we've had under my leadership and bluntly I would just like to get on with that as quickly as I can do because every day that we spend in an internal contest which I think we all probably know the outcome of we delay the ability for the SNP to start its rebuilding and I want to get on with that as quickly as I possibly can do."""

McDonald’s is being sued for $10 billion by a media company for allegations of “racial stereotyping” by not advertising with Black-owned media companies according to a press release from Allen Media Group the company suing the fast food chain.

The news: On Sept. 19 U.S. District Judge Fernando Olguin from Los Angeles ruled that Byron Allen — of Allen Media Group — could attempt to prove that McDonald’s has violated Californian civil rights laws by refusing to use his networks for advertising.

The judge concluded that Allen has reasonable evidence to prove his claims and will allow him to continue pursuing the lawsuit.

Allen claims that McDonald’s has placed his studio into an “African-American tier” with a separate ad agency that uses a smaller budget per Reuters.

McDonald’s response: Loretta Lynch the fast-food chain’s lawyer states that Allen doesn’t have the evidence to prove these claims according to CNN.

“Their complaint is about revenue not race and plaintiffs’ groundless allegations ignore both McDonald’s legitimate business reasons for not investing more on their channels and the company’s long-standing business relationships with many other diverse-owned partners” Lynch said.

Details: In a statement Allen claims that 40% of fast food customers are Black however McDonald’s spent 0.3% of its $1.6 billion advertising budget on Black-owned media in 2019.

Allen says that the case is “about economic inclusion of African American-owned businesses in the U.S. economy. McDonald’s takes billions from African American consumers and gives almost nothing back.”

About Allen Media Group: Based out of Los Angeles Allen Media Group owns 10 television networks including the Weather Channel and 43 broadcast and cable television programs according to their website.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbWNkb25hbGRzLWZhY2VzLTEwLWJpbGxpb24tbGF3c3VpdC1ieXJvbi1hbGxlbi1hZHZlcnRpc2luZy1zcGVuZC0yMDIyLTnSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL21jZG9uYWxkcy1mYWNlcy0xMC1iaWxsaW9uLWxhd3N1aXQtYnlyb24tYWxsZW4tYWR2ZXJ0aXNpbmctc3BlbmQtMjAyMi05P2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Byron Allen is suing McDonald's for $10 billion over its ad spending,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbWNkb25hbGRzLWZhY2VzLTEwLWJpbGxpb24tbGF3c3VpdC1ieXJvbi1hbGxlbi1hZHZlcnRpc2luZy1zcGVuZC0yMDIyLTnSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL21jZG9uYWxkcy1mYWNlcy0xMC1iaWxsaW9uLWxhd3N1aXQtYnlyb24tYWxsZW4tYWR2ZXJ0aXNpbmctc3BlbmQtMjAyMi05P2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002674385B670>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

We Wanted to Find Out,"The pumpkin spice latte — or PSL — has reigned supreme over autumn since first emerging coffee shops back in the early aughts. Before the autumnal espresso-charged beverage's meteoric rise to fame ""pumpkin spice"" was merely known as a blend of spices typically including nutmeg cinnamon ginger and cloves. But the popularity of pumpkin spice has spread like wildfire since the early aughts evolving into a phenomena so huge that the term ""pumpkin spice"" was even given its own entry in Merriam-Webster.

This all began when former Starbucks Director of Espresso Peter Dukes decided it was time to bring pumpkin spice to coffee cups everywhere. According to Food & Wine Starbucks actually tested possible recipes for its now famous PSL by literally pouring espresso shots onto pumpkin pies. However after much experimentation the perfect PSL was born in 2003 — and since then Starbucks has reportedly sold over 600 million of them according to CNN.

While Starbucks may have originated the mainstream pumpkin spice latte as we now know it many other coffee and fast-food chains have since followed suit. Dunkin' debuted its Pumpkin Spice Signature Latte in 2020 successfully slinging this fall drink ever since. Krispy Kreme Panera and McDonald's have also jumped on board the fall fanatic train with their own versions of the PSL in addition to many small local cafes also brewing up their own pumpkin concoctions. Today you can even find bottled PSLs in grocery stores.

Given all the hype around PSLs I figured what better way to celebrate fall than with a taste test of the most popular PSLs from coffee chains. I set out to try different PSLs at Starbucks Dunkin' Panera Krispy Kreme and McDonald's. However as I tirelessly searched around New York City for these five fall beverages I ran into a huge roadblock: I could only find three!

Where are all the PSLs?

It was easy to get my hands on some pumpkin spice lattes. But despite what I saw on menus and have had in the past PSLs at Panera and McDonald's were nowhere to be found.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

McDonald's is a bit of a mystery because their McCafe Pumpkin Spice Latte is easily found on their website. Yet while on the prowl the perfect PSL I walked into multiple McDonald's locations and none of the employees had any idea of when — or if — the pumpkin spice latte was going to drop this year.

As for Panera it released the Cinnamon Crunch Latte in 2021 alongside its version of the PSL. But when Panera released the Cinnamon Crunch for the second time — the PSL was nowhere to be found. According to Thrillist when the fast-casual bakery-café conducted a survey to measure the popularity of PSLs it reportedly found that 60% of those who participated believed that pumpkin spice latte was ""overrated"" and on its way out.

While I was saddened I couldn't get a PSL from McDonald's or Panera I decided to continue my search and treat myself to a PSL taste test since it doesn't seem like Starbucks Dunkin' or Krispy Kreme were putting a halt to the PSL trend anytime soon. Here are my results in order of least favorite to favorite.

Third Place: Krispy Kreme

I'll preface by saying that I actually really liked all three lattes so there isn't a real ""loser"" here. That said Krispy Kreme was my least favorite simply because it was the sweetest of them all. And while none of the pumpkin spice lattes I tried should be considered healthy by any means the sugary sweet taste was a bit overpowering. Also the only customizations you're really able to make to a Krispy Kreme PSL are the size your milk choice — going from 2% to skim milk and getting whipped cream versus not.

Runner Up: Dunkin' Donuts

Dunkin' has been in the pumpkin game for a little while now and their fall season confidence shows. When I walked in I was overwhelmed by the amount of autumnal options; from the Pumpkin Spice Signature Latte to their New Nutty Pumpkin Coffee to even a Blood Orange Refresher. I also stared at the Maple Bacon Breakfast Sandwich for what seemed like 10 minutes before talking myself out of buying one.

Their Pumpkin Spice Signature Latte (PSSL) comes in second place because of the intensity of its pumpkin flavor. While still being alarmingly sweet I at least was able to taste a bit of pumpkin. This was less so the case with the Krispy Kreme latte.

Dunkin' also implemented a $3 Medium PSSL promotion through September 13 2022 which caught me off guard — the medium cost less than a small! This was another reason I put it in the second spot and beat out Krispy Kreme where my small order cost around $4.50.

RELATED: 12 Secrets Dunkin' Doesn't Want You to Know

The Winner: Starbucks

The classic Starbucks PSL came in at No. 1 for a few different reasons: To start I truly do think their pumpkin flavoring is the best. But one of the defining characteristics of the Starbucks PSL is how easy it is to alter the creation to cater toward toward your individual desires. You can choose the size exactly how many pumps of pumpkin syrup you want how much espresso you prefer which type of milk (including nondairy options) whether you want whipped cream and even the type of sprinkles you want on top. It's the ultimate customer customization experience.

Overall I was a bit saddened by the reality that maybe pumpkin spice lattes really are slowly dying out. While I'm sure will always remain a true fan of the PSL it also seems like a sign that it's time for me to branch out and try the other fall-flavored lattes around town."

(Reuters) -Merck said on Monday it had discontinued an experimental combination treatment testing a new type of immunotherapy in patients with a severe form of skin cancer after side effects led to high discontinuation.

This is the latest setback for the experimental drug vibostolimab and the related promising new class of immunotherapies called anti-TIGIT.

Merck was testing vibostolimab along with Keytruda its top-selling cancer drug in a late-stage study in patients with resected high-risk melanoma.

An analysis showed the trial will not achieve the main goal of statistically significant improvement in recurrence-free survival as more side effects led to several patients discontinuing the combination treatment versus those on Keytruda alone Merck said.

The company will recommend patients receiving the combination treatment be offered the Keytruda monotherapy.

Vibostolimab works by selectively binding itself to TIGIT a receptor on immune cells to activate the immune system against cancer cells.

Merck said it still had an extensive clinical development program evaluating the vibostolimab-Keytruda combination.

The combination treatment had earlier failed to significantly slow disease progression in lung cancer patients in a late-stage study last year.

Data from another trial in March last year had also showed that it was less effective than a generic medicine called docetaxel in some patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

Gilead Sciences Roche and GSK are among half a dozen drugmakers looking to grab a share of the lucrative anti-TIGIT cancer drug market but the field has seen multiple setbacks.

Gilead and its partner Arcus Biosciences in January stopped a late-stage trial involving their anti-TIGIT candidate domvanalimab in a type of lung cancer. Gilead has announced a $320 million investment in its biotech partner as it refocused its anti-TIGIT push.

Seemingly science fiction comes to life the metaverse promises a highly advanced future where people’s digital and physical lives are more closely united in wealth productivity socialization shopping and entertainment.

An idea of a centralized virtual world mirroring the physical world the metaverse draws upon a diverse ensemble of technologies including gaming machine learning blockchain 3-D graphics digital currencies sensors and VR-enabled headsets garnering great interest from technology titans and gaming giants such as Meta Microsoft Epic Games and Roblox.

However one must consider the myriad of online issues one has to face if the metaverse is an extension of the internet hacking — from catfishing harassment and hate speech — when projecting metaverse into and its radicalization of the future.

“It’s important to recognize [the] five important problems we haven’t yet solved in the mobile internet: data rights data security radicalization misinformation and platform power” Matthew Ball author of the forthcoming “The Metaverse: And How it Will Revolutionize Everything” said to Time magazine. “Every one of those five problems [will be] exacerbated. The amount of data captured and the importance of that data goes up or the risks of data loss are intensified.”

Indeed this may provide backing to why fictional recreations of a metaverse such as “Ready Player One” and “Snow Crash” are situated in dystopias.

Others differ. They believe that the metaverse can expand access opportunity social networks and mental health — though even they have to admit the potential benefits of the metaverse are based on speculation.

In the workplace metaverse solutions only require a computer mouse and keyboard keys. Ongoing improvements in computer-generated holography seeks to replace headsets by deploying holographic pods to project people into actual space at events. Companies are pioneering haptic (touch) gloves for interactions with 3-D virtual objects and experiencing movement texture and pressure.

The metaverse will reshape the world of work in at least four major ways: new immersive forms of team collaboration; the emergence of new digital AI-enabled colleagues; the acceleration of learning and skills acquisition through virtualization and gamified technologies; and the eventual rise of a metaverse economy with completely new enterprises and work roles.

The emergence of metaverse-native enterprises companies entirely conceived within the virtual 3-D world are highly plausible. And similarly to the internet birthing unforeseen roles — such as digital marketing managers and social media advisors — so too will the metaverse introduce roles previously existing in works of science fiction: avatar conversation designers and “holoporting” travel agents to ease mobility across virtual worlds.

Outside of work the metaverse has expanded into medicine and even into the realm of K-pop.

Ever since Meta Platforms acquired Oculus and its VR headset technology in 2014 numerous healthcare applications were invented. Its value was epitomized in a collaboration with Facebook Reality Labs and Nexus Studios and the WHO Academy. A mobile learning app was designed for health workers battling COVID-19 worldwide including training courses that involve AR to simulate the proper techniques to operate PPE.

Additionally Johns Hopkins neurosurgeons performed the institution’s first-ever AR surgeries on living patients. During a spinal fusion two teams donned Augmedics headsets equipped with a see-through eye display that projects images of a patient’s internal anatomy based on CT scans.

At the forefront of the hottest internet trends is South Korean internet conglomerate Naver Group the name behind messaging giant app Line and popular selfie app Snow. Its subsidiary Zepeto a 3D-avatar app with more than 300 million users worldwide is the company’s venture into the metaverse. Zepeto which provides an amalgam of entertainment gaming and social networking experiences allows its users to render their selfies in 3D avatars and design digital spaces.

Since its launch in 2018 Zepeto sold more than 2.3 billion pieces of metaverse items and last year its top-selling creator generated a gross revenue of $500000.

Moreover Zepeto’s growth has been driven by joining hands with global luxury fashion brands such as Christian Dior Gucci Nike and Ralph Lauren as well as celebrities Blackpink and Selena Gomez whose Zepeto avatars performed in their “Ice Cream” dance music video. Zepeto who also partnered with entertainment agencies including JYP and YG stated their plans for further expansion of its partnership with global companies that own intellectual properties.

The metaverse sees no stop in its expansion. Only time will tell of the implications of an internet-forward race towards a burgeoning future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vbWl4ZWQtbmV3cy5jb20vZW4vbWV0YS1xdWVzdC0yLWltbWVyZ2FsbGVyeS12ci1waG90by1nYWxsZXJ5LWFwcC1yZXZpZXcv0gFWaHR0cHM6Ly9taXhlZC1uZXdzLmNvbS9lbi9tZXRhLXF1ZXN0LTItaW1tZXJnYWxsZXJ5LXZyLXBob3RvLWdhbGxlcnktYXBwLXJldmlldy8_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meta Quest 2: immerGallery - VR photo gallery app review,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='mixed-news.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /en/meta-quest-2-immergallery-vr-photo-gallery-app-review/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002674225B190>, 'Connection to mixed-news.com timed out.

Newsday’s Tom Rock offered the first best and still-applicable assessment after a media tour before the place opened in the form of this April 8 2010 tweet:

“Overall stadium impression: like a battleship — big gray and expensive.”

Pretty much.

But as lacking as MetLife Stadium is in charm its image would have been helped immensely over these past 13 seasons if it had received a little help from its marquee tenants.

Sure there have been some big games there notably including the Giants’ 29-14 victory over the Jets on Dec. 24 2011 a key step on the road to winning Super Bowl XLII.

But overall . . . meh. The Giants’ and Jets’ lack of success during the past decade too often has rendered the stadium big gray expensive and empty come late autumn.

Shockingly there has been only one Jets or Giants playoff game there — the Giants’ 24-2 rout of the Falcons in the wild-card round on Jan. 8 2012.

Robert Saleh the Jets’ current head coach was on the Seahawks’ staff when they won Super Bowl XLVIII at MetLife in 2014 but no head coach has led the Jets into a playoff game there.

One of the most infamous games in the stadium’s history rose from the dead just last weekend when the Dolphins’ comeback from a 21-point fourth-quarter deficit to beat the Ravens marked an NFL first since the Eagles did it to the Giants in MetLife’s first season in 2010.

All of which is a long way of getting around to the fact that the stadium finally is ready for an early-season close-up this weekend.

The Jets are 1-1 and host the defending AFC champion Bengals on Sunday. The Giants are 2-0 and host the Cowboys on Monday night. They are planning a “white-out” in which fans are being asked to wear white same as the Giants will.

Rarely in recent seasons have the teams been a combined 3-1 after two weeks and the fact that both are at home in Week 3 adds to the football juice even as the Yankees and Mets command most of the local sports attention.

What are the chances that both teams will come through? Not great especially for the Jets who are facing a presumably angry 0-2 Cincinnati team.

But the point here is that there is reason to care and at least a reasonable hope for more games to care about beyond the baseball playoffs.

All of the current generation of New York-area sports arenas — a building and renovating spree that began with the Prudential Center in 2007 and ended with the opening of UBS Arena in 2021 — provide more creature comforts than their predecessors.

But some like Citi Field have more charm than others.

MetLife is one of the others. But here is the thing about that ocean of gray seats which were designed to be neutral — and as far from green or blue as possible:

They are not gray when there are people sitting in them especially when said people are waving white rally towels as Giants fans will be encouraged to do on Monday night.

Jets and Giants fans are desperate for something to get excited about and two winning teams would go a long way toward making people like their stadium or at least dislike it less.

Come midnight Monday a combined 5-1 record would make the place feel a lot more like home.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN0aW5zaWRlci5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9RLUEtd2l0aC1QYXVsLUJsYW5jby1vZi1CYXJudW0tRmluYW5jaWFsLUdyb3VwLTE3NDYwMTQ3LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Q&A with Paul Blanco of Barnum Financial Group,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.ctinsider.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /business/article/Q-A-with-Paul-Blanco-of-Barnum-Financial-Group-17460147.php (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002674004F610>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN0aW5zaWRlci5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9RLUEtd2l0aC1QYXVsLUJsYW5jby1vZi1CYXJudW0tRmluYW5jaWFsLUdyb3VwLTE3NDYwMTQ3LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9uZmwvamV0cy9uZXdzL25ldy15b3JrLWpldHMtcXVpbmN5LXdpbGxpYW1zLWNhcnRlZC1vZmYtZmllbGQtYW5rbGUtaW5qdXJ5LWFnYWluc3QtY2luY2lubmF0aS1iZW5nYWxz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jets' Quincy Williams Carted Off With Ankle Injury,"Williams got hurt making a tackle in the third quarter on Sunday against the Bengals.

Jets linebacker Quincy Williams was carted off the field at MetLife Stadium with an ankle injury during the third quarter of Sunday's game against the Cincinnati Bengals.

Williams was making a tackle near the sideline with four minutes remaining in the third quarter hitting Chris Evans as the Bengals running back made a leaping catch. When Williams came down he landed awkwardly instantly grabbing at his left ankle as he twisted on the turf in pain.

His brother tackle Quinnen Williams was one of the first Jets defenders to circle around the linebacker waiting as New York's training staff rushed over.

A few minutes later Williams was lifted into a cart and taken off the field with an air cast on his left leg. He was spotted speaking with some of his teammates and coaches shortly after being raised onto the cart but had a towel over his head and face as he was driven away toward the locker room.

Williams leaves the game with seven tackles leading those in green and white. He's been a spark of energy for this defense playing hard and contributing each week since he was claimed by the Jets last September. The 26-year-old is a former third-round pick beginning his career with two seasons (18 total games played) with the Jaguars.

New York's official update on Williams is that the linebacker sustained an ankle injury and that he's doubtful to return on Sunday against Cincinnati.

Considering the apparent severity of the injury and how Williams was acting as he was carted off it's safe to assume he won't be back. The question is how long will the linebacker miss? If he's out for a long time it would be a pretty significant blow for New York's defense.

Las Vegas Boulevard the epicenter of American gambling is dominated by New York landlords.

Now a big company from Las Vegas wants a bite of the Big Apple.

New York real estate heavyweight Related Companies announced recently that it’s partnering with Wynn Resorts to pursue a casino license with plans for a project in Related’s Hudson Yards development in Manhattan.

Their news release did not provide specifics on the project saying only it would be a “resort entertainment and gaming destination along the Hudson River” and that it would be near the sprawling Javits Center convention facility.

But Wynn’s venture marks a reversal of sorts from what Las Vegas has seen in recent years: New Yorkers snapping up property in Southern Nevada’s most lucrative stretch of real estate.

Of course Las Vegas has long been a destination for out-of-town developers house flippers and commercial-property landlords. (I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve written about Southern California firms buying apartment complexes here.)

But when it comes to the Strip one city in particular has emerged as the main source of buyers lately.

New York-based Vici Properties a Caesars Entertainment spinoff vastly expanded its holdings in Las Vegas when it acquired casino giant MGM Resorts International’s real estate spinoff in a $17 billion-plus deal.

As part of the buyout which closed this spring Vici acquired several MGM-operated properties along Las Vegas Boulevard including The Mirage Park MGM New York-New York Luxor and Excalibur.

Before that Vici also acquired casino operator Las Vegas Sands Corp.’s real estate on the Strip — The Venetian Palazzo and The Venetian Expo — for $4 billion in a deal that closed in February.

All told Vici now owns 660 acres of real estate along the Strip “the most economically productive street in the world” the company said this spring.

Another major landlord from New York is investment giant Blackstone whose portfolio includes Bellagio Aria and Vdara. It purchased those three for more than $8 billion combined and leased them back to MGM Resorts.

It also owns two other MGM-operated properties — Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand — in a joint venture with Vici.

Blackstone had kicked off a real estate buying spree in Southern Nevada after the economy crashed a decade or so ago and it owned and operated The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas for years.

It bought the flashy hotel-casino in 2014 for $1.73 billion and sold it for $5.65 billion. The sale which closed in May marked the “most profitable single asset sale ever” for Blackstone’s real estate business the company previously said.

Meanwhile New York’s Dreamscape Companies acquired the off-Strip Rio for $516.3 million in 2019 and New York investment firm Gindi Capital after it teamed up to buy Showcase Mall several years ago purchased more property along Las Vegas Boulevard in 2019 for $172 million.

Last month Clark County commissioners approved Gindi’s plans for a new three-story retail complex spanning more than 300000 square feet on that roughly 9.5-acre site — which Gindi had acquired from Spectrum Group Management another New York firm.

Related Wynn’s casino partner in New York is no stranger to Las Vegas either. Among other ventures here it partnered on the development of World Market Center downtown’s massive furniture-showroom hall that was acquired in 2017 by (drum roll) Blackstone.

Time will tell whether other Las Vegas firms plant a flag in New York. But odds are a company there is bound to buy something here first.

It is understandable that with ever-growing popularity the demand for tickets goes up and circuits may then charge more to increase their revenue.

But there comes the point where enough is enough and the fans deserve to be listened to. The biggest offender and best example is Las Vegas which is going to cost you an arm and a leg and probably a kidney too if you want to experience it.According to MGM Resorts CEO William Hornbuckle the chain is planning to buy 20 to 25 million dollars worth of Grand Prix tickets to create accommodation and event packages. With the increase in hotel rates they could impose for the GP weekend those offers could end up costing up to $100000. But F1 is milking the fans all over the world with 2023 Monaco GP tickets reaching up to 4720 euros ($4574) while the Mexican GP is even more expensive with admission to the Paddock Club nearing 7000 euros ($6783).More recently we’ve had the entire Silverstone ticket debacle which caused a severe uproar from fans. One of the main issues is that their system crashed not once but twice while people were trying to purchase tickets. However there was an even bigger problem. They introduced a dynamic pricing system this year which was not a smash hit with the fans.Supposedly up to 210000 people queued up on the first day trying to buy their tickets. With this in mind it’s not really a surprise that the system failed. But you cannot just increase the prices based on demand and how many tickets are left only for the system to crash and cause people to pay more than they originally should have.In the past you could get general admission tickets at Silverstone for only 100 GBP ($109). However with the dynamic pricing system for next year  the last batch of these tickets went for a jaw-dropping 319 ($346) GBP.Needless to say this angered a lot of people. So much so that the organizers of the British Grand Prix had to publicly apologize and pledge to improve their system. Hopefully this step back after the public outrage is a sign that things are not headed to a point where a normal person is not going to be able to afford an F1 ticket."

While the concept of touchscreens has existed since the 1960s it was only in the past couple of decades that compact and affordable touch sensor panels (such as capacitive and resistive ones) have entered the market revolutionizing consumer electronics and becoming a staple of modern life.

Touch controllers are a vital component of modern display technology.

Still many people believe touch panels lack the tactile feel and feedback of traditional buttons knobs and switches. Some manufacturers are working on new ways to improve the user experience of consumer electronics by creating technologies that mimic the feeling of these components and even infuse touch sensors with mechanical elements.

This article focuses on the control side of this equation diving into the details of three ICs announced in recent months by prominent semiconductor manufacturers. These devices were designed to enhance the input methods of next-generation electronic devices.

Microchip Supports Rotary Encoders on Top of Touchscreens

In June Microchip Technology announced a new type of touch display chip that makes it easier for engineers to integrate the interactive input capabilities of multi-touch displays with the tactile feel of mechanical rotary encoders.

maXTouch Knob-on-Display (KoD) is a family of touch controller ICs that natively support capacitive rotary encoders and mechanical switches mounted onto existing touch displays without needing custom panel shapes and cutouts.

According to the company the Knob-on-Display chips would allow designers to incorporate multiple turnkey knobs of different styles into a single traditional touch display for use in various types of products ranging from in-vehicle systems to smart household appliances.

Microchip aims to simplify the development process of these devices through a comprehensive suite of both hardware and software tools while also improving the user experience and increasing automotive safety. With the new touch controller technology users can manage volume and temperature without looking away from the road and at a display.

The maXTouch KoD family includes two variants (KD and MK) of two different LQFP packaged chips: the 112 touch channel ATMXT2912TD-A and the 97 touch channel ATMXT2113TD-A. The KD chip variants allow manufacturers to create their own knob design based on a reference provided by Microchip in partnership with BNL Bearings while the MK chip variants support Panasonic’s capacitive rotary Magic Knob element.

ST Develops Touch Controller for Flexible AMOLED Displays

Another recent development in touch technology comes from STMicroelectronics with a new touch controller IC. The FingerTip FTG2-SLP is designed to operate with the latest energy-saving and efficiency-oriented AMOLED displays which can dynamically control their refresh rates depending on the types of apps they’re showing.

Created primarily for the smartphone industry the FingerTip FTG2-SLP is a 32-bit Arm Cortex-M4 core-based capacitive multitouch screen controller capable of running in synchronous and asynchronous modes. The device is also said to maintain a seamless interaction between the user and the device with a display refresh rate that changes dynamically.

ST's touch controller comprises advanced features such as enhanced noise suppression and filtering and a fast report rate of 240 Hz. The FTG2-SLP also supports thin flat curved and even flexible LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) AMOLED panels thanks to its differential and node compensation hardware and differential data processing software.

The chip also features a special hibernation mode designed to further increase battery life on top of its low-power displays. ST has already launched production of the FTG2-SLP to find a home in the next generation of flexible and foldable smartphones.

CTT Makes Control SoC for Piezoelectric Touch Panel

Earlier this year Cambridge Touch Technologies (CTT) a company established in 2011 as a spinoff from the University of Cambridge announced the development of a new force touch controller system-on-chip (SoC) to improve the user experience in smart devices.

Named UTA3221 this chip was designed to work in conjunction with CTT’s proprietary UltraTouch sensor platform that combines a thin and flexible piezoelectric film with advanced AI and machine learning algorithms to provide a more pleasant and tactile interaction method.

According to the company its force touch technology can deliver the feel of mechanical buttons while also operating in the rain underwater and even while the user is wearing gloves which is difficult to achieve with other touch input methods like capacitive touchscreens.

The UTA3221 IC itself is a low-powered Arm Cortex-M CPU-based touch controller that comes in a 76-pin QFN package. CTT claims this chip can process up to ten different force touch points at once. It also includes a standout sensitivity and noise floor making it useful for the types of signals generated by piezoelectric devices.

CTT offers samples and evaluation kits to manufacturers and designers interested in incorporating UltraTouch and the UTA3221 into their own technology targeting the automotive industrial and medical fields.

Advancing Touch Input for Consumer Electronics

As embedded microprocessors become more powerful and more versatile combining them with the latest sensor and display technologies is a surefire way to enhance the level of interaction between humans and machines.

Sitting at the forefront of this field are companies like Microchip ST and CTT that offer engineers more options to develop and design systems and products ranging from advanced and alternative tactile touch components to ultra-high refresh and response rate sensors. Touch is likely to remain the primary input method in the smartphone automotive and appliance industries and new advances at the chip level may be key to enhancing the safety and user experience of these consumer electronics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMjYvaG93LWluZGlhLWlzLXRyeWluZy10by10dXJuLWl0c2VsZi1pbnRvLWEtc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3Rvci1wb3dlcmhvdXNlLmh0bWzSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMi8wOS8yNi9ob3ctaW5kaWEtaXMtdHJ5aW5nLXRvLXR1cm4taXRzZWxmLWludG8tYS1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLXBvd2VyaG91c2UuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'India has a big role to play': New Delhi is trying to turn the country into a chip powerhouse,"The government of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has looked to boost the country's chipmaking prowess. Money Sharma | AFP | Getty Images

India could have a large role to play in the semiconductor industry analysts say as the world's fifth-largest economy looks to boost its domestic chip sector. Along with other countries like the U.S. India has been looking to forge strategic alliances around semiconductors a critical technology that goes into many of the devices we use from smartphones to refrigerators. But India has also been making moves to bring the manufacturing of chips to the country and has laid out incentives for the industry. ""I think India has a crucial role to play"" Pranay Kotasthane chairperson of the high tech geopolitics program at the Takshashila Institution told CNBC's ""Beyond the Valley"" podcast published last week.

India tries to woo giants

The issue for many countries looking to boost their chipmaking prowess is that the companies and countries that dominate the industry are few and far between. For example Taiwan and South Korea make up about 80% of the global foundry market. Foundries are facilities that manufacture chips that other companies design.

India has typically not been in the mix of the top countries for semiconductors. So there aren't many giant Indian chip firms and certainly no leading-edge manufacturing companies. While India might not have native semiconductor firms it's plan under the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi relies on trying to attract foreign giants. In December India greenlit a $10 billion incentive plan for the semiconductor industry. Therefore New Delhi's strategy seems to be twofold — lure in foreign companies and build on areas where India has an advantage.

Indian strengths

The large amount of capital required the time it takes to set up factories and uncertainty over the business tax and trade environment has often put companies off setting up in India. ""Previous attempts in India failed because of apprehensions on these counts"" Kotasthane said. However there are signs that things are changing. ""The track record has been not great but the new government has been heading in the right direction ... [with] policies to drive impetus and attract leading semi and fab companies"" Neil Shah partner at tech consultancy Counterpoint Research told CNBC.

India's strength is the huge domestic consumption market when it comes to semiconductors being the second-largest populous economy in the world. Neil Shah Partner Counterpoint Research

India has a number of strengths which could back up its bid to be a global chipmaking hub. ""India's strength is the huge domestic consumption market when it comes to semiconductors being the second-largest populous economy in the world"" Shah said. The analyst also said incentive plans will help. ""Also India has loads of English speaking engineering talent and [a] cheaper labor force making it cost effective"" Shah added. That well-educated and cheap labor force could help India in a specific area of the semiconductor supply chain — chip design — an area that requires a large number of skilled workers.

""I have no doubt that India has a big role to play"" Kotasthane said. ""India has semiconductor humanpower. Semiconductor design requires large numbers of skilled engineers and this is where India's strength lies"" he added. Kotasthane said that of the largest semiconductor firms in the world eight have design houses in India. While also in the early stages India is trying to boost its domestic companies to build technology. ""What we are now seeing from the Indian government side is trying to take the next step. We have design centers of international firms but India doesn't have a lot of intellectual property which can be termed Indian ... because these are companies from other countries which are doing this. So now the next step is the effort to build an ecosystem where there is some Indian IP (intellectual property) by Indian companies"" Kotasthane said.

Manufacturing in focus

While design is one area the analysts say that India can find success manufacturing is a little more difficult. In terms of the most cutting-edge chips such as those in the latest flagship smartphones Taiwan's TSMC dominates the manufacturing arena. India doesn't have any fabs or semiconductor fabrication plants which manufacture chips. However the government has looked to woo foreign chipmakers. ISMC Digital a consortium of investors is planning to build a $3 billion manufacturing facility in India. Tower Semiconductor an Israeli company would be the technology partner on that project.

This article explains how to set up and use the Microsoft Family Safety app for your child's Android phone.



How to Use the Microsoft Family Safety App

The Microsoft Family Safety app is Microsoft's answer to Google's Family Link app. It provides insights into how your child is using their phone their location and even lets you set time limits on app use and game time.

Using Microsoft Family Safety has a few prerequisites. You need to have a Microsoft Family Group your child needs to have Microsoft Launcher and Edge installed on their phone and you need to add your child as a member of your family group.

To get started visit the Microsoft Family Safety page. If you haven't signed in with your Microsoft account yet you'll be prompted to. Then you can select Create a family group to get started. To create your family group for the first time you'll need to answer a few questions such as your region how many children you have in the family and their ages. When you're logged into your Microsoft account select the Add a member link in the Family section to start adding family members to the group. You'll be prompted to add a new family member to your group. If you're adding a spouse select Organizer. If you're adding a child select Member. Enter the email address the correct Captcha code and select Send invite. When the child account is first added you'll need to configure what organizers in your Microsoft Family Group can see. Under your Child's account select Manage permissions. Enable organizer permissions under all sections. Your child should receive an email with the invite to the Microsoft Family Group. Have them open the email and select Join Now. Once your child has joined the group they'll also need to install the Microsoft Launcher app onto their phone so that you can track their location. Currently this app is only available for Android. Help your child go into the app permissions for the Microsoft Launcher app and enable at least the Location setting. For other Microsoft Family Safety features to work you'll need take make sure your child also has Microsoft Edge installed on their mobile device. You'll need to give the Microsoft Safety Family app some time to sync with the Microsoft Launcher app before you'll see all of the menus appear.

Monitoring Mobile Usage With Microsoft Family Safety

Once the Microsoft Family Safety group is synced there are a lot of things you can see and control on your child's mobile device.

The Activity tab is where you can access all of the settings on one page. This is also where you can enable or disable overall monitoring. One of the first things you should do is enable Activity reporting as well as Email weekly reports to me if you'd like to receive email updates about their mobile usage. The Screen time tab is where you can control at what time of day your child is allowed to use their devices. Currently these settings are only for Windows 10 or Xbox devices and not mobile phones. App and game limits is where you can either block the child from using certain apps or you can set a time range when they're allowed to use them. Content restrictions lets you manage what kind of content or apps your child is allowed to access based on age limit. Toward the bottom of this page you can either always block or always allow specific websites as well regardless of the browser your child is using. On the Spending page you can require your child to ask permission if they ever want to buy an app from the Microsoft Store. You can also add money to their Microsoft account balance. One of the coolest features in Microsoft Family Safety is the Find your child page. On this page you'll see the current location of your child.

Microsoft Family Safety for Android

If your child has an Android phone the Microsoft Family Safety app because it's less intrusive is a useful alternative to other parental control apps.

Keep in mind however that using Microsoft Family Safety requires your child to willingly join your Microsoft Family Safety group and keep the required apps installed. So make sure to talk with your child before setting everything up so that everyone is on the same page regarding appropriate use of mobile devices.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydW1zLm1hY3J1bW9ycy5jb20vdGhyZWFkcy93aHktZG8tdHdvLW1pY3Jvc29mdC1lZGdlLWFwcGVhci1pbi10aGUtbWFjcy1kZWZhdWx0LWJyb3dzZXItbGlzdC4yMzYyMDg2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why do two Microsoft Edge appear in the Mac's default browser list?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydW1zLm1hY3J1bW9ycy5jb20vdGhyZWFkcy93aHktZG8tdHdvLW1pY3Jvc29mdC1lZGdlLWFwcGVhci1pbi10aGUtbWFjcy1kZWZhdWx0LWJyb3dzZXItbGlzdC4yMzYyMDg2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000267438B6B30>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Dorsey’s reaction may have been warranted although he probably could’ve chosen another outlet for his anger (like a stress ball perhaps?). The Bills had a chance to run one more play to win the game but the team ultimately ran out of time losing to the Dolphins 19-21.

MS-SQL servers are database management systems holding data for internet services and apps. Disrupting them can cause severe business trouble.

BleepingComputer has reported similar attacks in February dropping Cobalt Strike beacons and in July when threat actors hijacked vulnerable MS-SQL servers to steal bandwidth for proxy services.

The latest wave is more catastrophic aiming for a quick and easy profit by blackmailing database owners.

FARGO ransomware a.k.a. TargetCompany

Security researchers at AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC) say that FARGO is one of the most prominent ransomware strains that focus on MS-SQL servers along with GlobeImposter.

This malware family has been referred to as “Mallox” in the past because it used to append the “.mallox” extension to the files it encrypts.

Also this strain is the same that Avast researchers named “TargetCompany” in a report in February highlighting that files encrypted by it may be recovered for free in some cases.

Statistical data about ransomware attacks on the ID Ransomware platform indicate that the FARGO family of file-encrypting malware is quite active.

FARGO activity in the last 30 days (ID Ransomware)

Infection and execution

The researchers note that the ransomware infection starts with the MS-SQL process on the compromised machine downloading a .NET file using cmd.exe and powershell.exe.

The payload fetches additional malware (including the locker) generates and runs a BAT file that terminates specific processes and services.

Next the ransomware payload injects itself into AppLaunch.exe a legitimate Windows process and tries to delete the registry key for the open-source ransomware “vaccine” called Raccine.

Additionally the malware executes the recovery deactivation command and terminates database-related processes to make their contents available for encryption.

Processes killed by FARGO prior to initiating encryption (ASEC)

The FARGO ransomware strain excludes some software and directories from encryption to prevent the attacked system from becoming completely unusable.

Exempt from encryption are several Microsoft Windows system directories the boot files Tor Browser Internet Explorer user customizations and settings the debug log file or the thumbnail database.

After the encryption completes the locked files are renamed using the “.Fargo3” extension and the malware generates the ransom note (“RECOVERY FILES.txt”).

FARGO ransom note

Victims are being threatened with leaking the stolen files on the threat actor's Telegram channel unless they pay the ransom.

Database servers are often compromised through brute-force and dictionary attacks that are successful against accounts protected with weak credentials. Alternatively cybercriminals try to exploit known vulnerabilities that the target has not patched.

The recommendation for MS-SQL server administrators is to make sure that they use strong enough and unique passwords. Additionally keeping the machine up-to-date with the latest fixes for security vulnerabilities is advice that never goes out of fashion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vYXdzLmFtYXpvbi5jb20vYmxvZ3MvbW9kZXJuaXppbmctd2l0aC1hd3MvdGhlLXJlZnJlc2hlZC1hd3MtbGF1bmNoLXdpemFyZC1mb3ItYWN0aXZlLWRpcmVjdG9yeS1kZXBsb3ltZW50LXJlbGVhc2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The refreshed AWS Launch Wizard for Active Directory deployment release | Amazon Web Services,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vYXdzLmFtYXpvbi5jb20vYmxvZ3MvbW9kZXJuaXppbmctd2l0aC1hd3MvdGhlLXJlZnJlc2hlZC1hd3MtbGF1bmNoLXdpemFyZC1mb3ItYWN0aXZlLWRpcmVjdG9yeS1kZXBsb3ltZW50LXJlbGVhc2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000267438B6770>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

David Roth chairman of the Investment Subcommittee of Hartford HealthCare’s Finance Committee said he was shocked by the announcement by top management in a phone call Tuesday. He said he does not know how many on the investment staff are affected by the decision.

“We acknowledge the board’s right to do it but we don’t know why” he said Friday in a phone interview.

Hartford HealthCare said in a statement it reorganized its investment department and related functions after “careful review” and with the Board of Directors’ approval to select a full-time investment firm to manage its portfolio.

“We are confident that Morgan Stanley a respected multinational investment management and financial services company that manages $6.5 trillion in client assets will be a valued partner” Hartford HealthCare said.

The sprawling health care organization which operates Hartford Hospital and six other acute care hospitals behavioral health and physician organizations and other outlets provided no details. Roth said management gave no reason for its decision.

He criticized the process in which the investment oversight subcommittee was not consulted or informed. He said he wrote Thursday to Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Flaks telling him the process was unacceptable. He said he has not heard back.

“We were not engaged informed or consulted” Roth said. “I can only guess at things and I don’t want to do that.”

The Investment Subcommittee a group of volunteers meets quarterly to review Hartford HealthCare’s investment portfolio performance occasionally meets other times reviews market analyses and must be familiar with alternative assets and other details Roth said.

Roth a lawyer by training who first got involved in finance with then-state Treasurer Francisco Lopes Borges who served from 1987 to 1993 has been a member of Hartford HealthCare’s advisory committee for nine years and chairman for three years.

He said the decision to terminate the staff is particularly difficult to understand because Hartford HealthCare is the No. 1 performing health care organization in the U.S. In the last five or six years it has generated as much as $750 million in additional earnings from its investments Roth said.

Hartford HealthCare said its “investment team’s acumen has earned national recognition from investment industry experts.”

“We are grateful for their many contributions of these colleagues and will support them through this transition either into new roles within the organization or to positions outside of Hartford HealthCare” it said in a statement.

Roth who has been active in numerous organizations including the Jewish Community Foundation Connecticut Children’s Medical Center Hartford Symphony Orchestra and Bushnell Center for the Performing Arts will not be lacking in civic activities.

“I’ve got a million things going” he said.

Ewhurst Park near Basingstoke in Hampshire was bought by Malaysian-born model actress and entrepreneur Mandy Lieu two years ago.

She said the project would make the land an ""edible mosaic"" of habitats to provide food for humans and wildlife alike.

The 925-acre site once belonged to the Duke of Wellington.

Rewilding is where ecosystems are restored and sometimes species reintroduced with the idea that in the end they will manage themselves.

To realize the promise of the Internet of Things (IoT) companies cannot continue to use legacy technologies. Legacy data centers process discrete files and objects but the constant flow of data from IoT devices represent something new: data streams.

Data streams don’t have a beginning or an end to provide natural starting and stopping points for processing. Legacy data processing technology that depends upon batch processing cannot expand quickly enough to avoid throughput bottlenecks and the resulting delays affect the critical functions of ingestion processing and analysis.

To make practical use of real-time data streams from sensors security cameras medical devices and other time-critical information flows the data must be ingested and processed quickly. Dell’s Streaming Data Platform provides a scalable solution to rapidly accommodate high volumes of IoT data and make it available for real-time analysis.

See below to learn all about Dell Streaming Data Platform and where it stands in the storage sector:

Dell Streaming Data Platform key benefits

Customers that pursue solutions such as the Dell Streaming Data Platform hope to gain the following key benefits.

Consolidate infrastructure

Dell’s Streaming Data Platform not only enables rapid data flows that keep up with IoT information sources it also can expand to encompass and replace existing legacy infrastructure. The expandability of a single platform eliminates the need to maintain and secure multiple technologies.

Edge data control

The Dell Streaming Platform solution installs into local or cloud data centers completely under the control of the organization. The solution directly ingests data feeds and provides a single solution incorporating analysis and alerting. After processing the Streaming Data Platform can directly feed the data into local data centers or whatever cloud storage provider might be desired for long-term storage.

Maximize IoT information insights

The surging quantities of information from IoT devices continues to grow in number and in richness. However if an organization cannot keep up with the pace of the information it will fail to receive information on a timely basis and be able to act.

Adopting the Dell Streaming Data Platform enables an enterprise to continuously match the growing needs of the IoT feeds for ingestion processing and analysis. If needed the system can also scale to incorporate historical data flows to help catch up to information backlogs and provide the maximum information for alerts and artificial intelligence (AI) analysis and to minimize the delays for intelligent reactions.

Simplified deployment

Enterprises always have the option to build their own stream solution but these do-it-yourself (DIY) solutions consume enormous development time for integration vulnerability testing debugging and deployment. The true value to the company comes from the information extracted from the data stream so deploying a packaged solution enables companies to extract value more efficiently and much faster.

Dell Streaming Data Platform use cases

RWTH Aachen University

The scientists mathematicians and software developers collaborating in the Laboratory for Machine Tools for RWTH Aachen University (WZL) seek new insights from machine product and manufacturing data. Various sensors in WZL’s custom metal fineblanking incubators generate more than 1 million data points per second and small localized data processing created huge delays in making necessary adjustments.

“We wanted to use high-frequency data to help manufacturers analyze changes in their processes monitor output and process quality and make adjustments in real time” explained Philipp Niemietz head of digital technologies for WZL.

Adopting Dell’s Streaming Data Platform provided the lab with the capabilities to make AI-guided adjustments based on real-time analysis of the sensor data.

“No matter how many sensors we use once we set up the analytics pipeline and the data streams we don’t have to address any load-balancing issues” said Niemietz.

Other use cases

Itzik Reich VP technologist of ISG at Dell published a blog in which he illustrates real-world test cases to which the Dell Streaming Data Platform was successfully applied to replace batch and real-time processes. These use cases cover a broad variety of applications such as:

Video feeds from a fleet of drones monitor the real time health of cattle.

A sheet metal manufacturer uses real-time temperature sensor data streams to replace ineffective real-time and variance batch pipelines to make automated adjustments and maintain temperature within optimal thresholds.

Real-time video footage of airplane take-offs and landings can be used to automatically detect abnormalities that might require maintenance.

The faster data processing of the Streaming Data Platform permits more responsive preventative measures and subtle adjustments than legacy solutions.

While the blog does not quote specific customers Reich notes that customers often enjoy a reduction in their physical infrastructure and management time required for software and stack operations. The blog also focuses on the infrastructure savings from simplified IT architecture and the elimination of redundant data storage.

Dell Streaming Data Platform differentiators

When selecting the Dell Streaming Data Platform over other possible edge processing solutions an organization will typically do so because of the following differentiators.

Dell management platform

Dell’s proprietary management software for the Streaming Data Platform uses dynamic and automatic management of systems to turbo-charge the open-source foundation of the platform. The management software:

Distributes data processing and analytical jobs over the available infrastructure

Satisfies processing requirements in real time

Configures data stream properties

Controls application deployment

Provides critical information such as operations metrics and job status

Deployment options

Streaming Data Platform is available in various versions for flexible deployment:

SDP Core: On-premises data center implementation that enables real-time data ingestion and feeds from other SDP deployments. Supports 3–12 nodes.

SDP Edge: Edge deployment implementation with local processing filtering and enriching capabilities. Deployable on single (no high availability requirement) or three physical nodes (high availability requirement).

SDP Micro: Lightweight version of SDP Edge specifically for low-volume data from sensors without gateways. Can only be installed on a single virtual or physical node.

Open-source with support

Built on open-source community built-and-tested components Dell’s Streaming Data Platform provides the flexibility to avoid future vendor lock-in. However the solution is also backed by Dell ProSupport Plus as well as Dell’s enormous sales and support network. This support network delivers the expert consulting needs an organization may want for an effective implementation.

Unified platform

Organizations can create their own mix of technologies to duplicate the capabilities of the Dell Streaming Data Platform. Yet Dell’s unified solution provides turn-key availability for rapid deployment and integrated features that eliminate the need for tedious operational and security testing.

Conclusions

Not all enterprises have a need to process real-time data streams. However as IoT and operational technology (OT) continues to evolve and become network connected more businesses and governments will find themselves developing the need to handle streaming data sources.

Real-time processing and analysis of streaming data can enable nimble and accurate adjustments of processes or rapid detection of issues that could save a fortune — if addressed early. The Dell Streaming Data Platform enables scalable support for data streams of all types and should be evaluated as a potential solution for in-house data streaming needs.",,,,,,

This is because Gold producing member companies of the Ghana Chamber of Mines will sell about 125000 ounces of gold the equivalent of 3.5 tonnes of gold to the Bank of Ghana (BoG) under the central bank’s Domestic Gold Purchase Programme.

This will increase BoG’s gold holdings from the existing 8.7 tonnes to 12.2 tonnes by end of this year.

The plan is to double its gold holdings in the next five years from 8.7 tonnes the equivalent 306883 ounces to 17.4 tonnes the equivalent 613766.9 ounces.

Already Newmont Ghana had sold 3500 ounces of gold to the Bank of Ghana as part of the programme.

The announcement followed a meeting between Vice-President Alhaji Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia some other members of the Economic Management Team (BoG) the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources Minerals Commission PMMC as well as the leadership of the Chamber.

It was to consider the implementation of the BoG’s Gold Purchase Programme in the light of the country’s economic challenges.

Dr. Bawumia noted after the meeting that “it was agreed that to help shore up the foreign exchange reserves of the Bank of Ghana starting September 1 BoG will purchase a portion of the output of the gold mining companies on a continuous basis at world market prices but payment will be made in Ghana cedis”.

He stated that this will represent a significant and sustainable addition to Ghana’s foreign exchange reserves over time and strengthen the country’s balance of payments position.

President of the Chamber Joshua Mortoti stated that “as good corporate citizens the Chamber supports the programme”. Noting that the Gold Purchase Programme will be mutually beneficial to all stakeholders.

On his part the Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber Dr. Sulemanu Koney stated that members of the Chamber will further engage the Central Bank to fast-track the implementation of the programme.

Discussions on the Gold Purchase Programme started in 2020 between the BoG and gold producing member companies of the Chamber to support the Ghana’s foreign exchange reserves.",,,,,,

REA India part of Australia's REA Group and US-based News Corp owns three real estate portals -- Housing.com PropTiger and Makaan.com.

In an interview with PTI Agarwala highlighted that the turnover of REA India rose 92 per cent during 2021-22 fiscal (July-June) to nearly Rs 300 crore.

Housing.com -- one of the leading real estate classified platforms in India -- contributed around 80 per cent to the total revenue and housing brokerage platform PropTiger.com the balance 20 per cent. Makaan.com's revenue was negligible.

REA India will continue to invest in technology brand promotion and talent acquisition to grow Housing.com business. It has already announced Rs 40 crore investment in FY'23 for Housing.com and could raise it further looking at competitors.

At present Agarwala said the company has around 1500 staffers.

""We have plans to get to around 1700 people by the end of FY'23. So we are hiring. We have clear ambitions of making Housing.com the clear market leader. We have already achieved audience leadership. We crossed our closest competitor in terms of revenue for the quarter ended June"" he said.

Housing.com would primarily be hiring for the product tech and design teams.

On the financial performance in FY'22 Agarwala said: ""Last (fiscal) year was a very good year for us. We grew our total revenue by 92 per cent and for the first time on Housing.com we achieved market leadership in October 2021 and that leadership position has continued.""



Agarwala attributed the rise in revenue of both Housing.com and PropTiger.com to strong revival in housing demand after the second wave of the pandemic



He highlighted that Housing.com's revenue in the quarter ended June was for the first time higher than its closest competitor 99acres.com.

On the outlook for the current financial year Agarwala said REA India expects high double-digit growth but it would be difficult to match last year's performance of 92 per cent increase in revenue. Losses will start reducing from 2023-24 fiscal year.

He attributed the growth in revenue to the company's ""brave"" decision to keep investing in business technology and brand during the pandemic and that ""paid off"".

""We never laid off anybody we in fact hired more people. We continued to invest in our product and technology and also launched a new platform such as Housing Edge which is doing very well for us. We continue to spend money on our brand and were the leading spender in terms of brand building during all of COVID"" he observed.

Increased digital adoption in the real estate sector also helped Housing.com.

""Third thing is I think residential real estate received a big boost in a funny way because of COVID. I think people's relationship and equation with a home changed. Everybody realised that during a time like COVID home was their only safe haven. That I think gives a renewed lease of life to residential real estate"" Agarwala said.

Low interest rates on home loans and stamp duty cuts in a few states were also major demand drivers for residential properties.

In December 2020 Australia's REA Group acquired a controlling stake in Elara Technologies that owned these three portals. Elara Technologies has been renamed as REA India which currently as 17 offices across India.

REA India assists consumers through their entire home seeking journey all the way from initial search and discovery to financing to the final step of transaction closure.

Housing.com which was founded in 2012 is a full stack proptech platform for homeowners/home seekers landlords developers and real estate brokers. It offers listings for new homes resale homes rentals plots commercial spaces and co-living spaces in India.

It had been reported that the Trust were held liable for failing to meet contractual obligations to a private sector company Mitie FM Ltd.

However a statement released by the Western Trust insists they are not liable for these penalties and that Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contract providers the Northern Ireland Health Group (NIHG) are responsible for any financial penalties incurred.

A Western trust spokeswoman said: “The Western Trust does not pay financial penalties.

“The penalties are paid by the contracted PFI provider NIHG when agreed Service Level Agreements/Performance Standards that were built into the PFI contract are not met.

“For example if a piece of equipment such as an endoscopy washer is broken and the Trust is unable to use it then the Trust would issue a penalty to the contractor.

“Like all PFI contracts the South West Acute Hospital PFI Contract has an extensive performance specification and a penalties regime which was agreed at the outset.”

The Western Trust also stated reports from elsewhere that stated the cost owed by them for the building of the SWAH did not make clear that the total sum included additional costs that help with the functioning of the hospital.

“The PFI contract covers both the construction costs of building of the South West Acute Hospital and the additional costs associated with PFI contract” added the Trust’s spokesperson.

“These include payment for services whole life costs (such as specialist medical equipment maintenance and operating service costs).

Services included within the unitary charge are estates services energy & utilities grounds and gardens and helpdesk.

“The total cost stated elsewhere covers both the building of the hospital and associated services provided by NIHG over the 30 year contract period.

“The Western Trust pays the PFI contractor from funding that was secured centrally from Department of Health. The PFI contract for the South West Acute Hospital does not impact on the Trust’s ability to fund other services.

“Following a process that was approved by the Department of Health and the then Health & Social Care Board (HSCB) this funding has been made available to the Trust for the delivery of this acute hospital facility.”

Northrop Grumman the aviation defense company behind some of the United States’ most advanced aircraft announced that it would unveil the B-21 Raider bomber in early December. The stealth bomber outwardly reminiscent of the B-2 Spirit bomber is expected to be the stealthiest aircraft ever built and will be an incredibly important asset for American nuclear deterrence.

“The B-21 is the most advanced military aircraft ever built and is a product of pioneering innovation and technological excellence” Doug Young sector vice president and general manager at Northrop Grumman Aeronautics Systems said in the company statement.

“The Raider showcases the dedication and skills of the thousands of people working every day to deliver this aircraft” Young added.

“Northrop Grumman is proud of our partnership with the U.S. Air Force as we deliver the B-21 Raider a sixth-generation aircraft optimized for operations in highly contested environments” Tom Jones corporate vice president and president at Northrop Grumman Aeronautics Systems said in the announcement.

Though both the B-21 Raider and the B-2 Spirit are flying wing-type aircraft—lacking a traditional tail assembly—the newer Raider bomber is expected to be a much stealthier aircraft. Unlike the B-2 the Raider will not require specialized climate-controlled hangars to maintain its stealth coating. Officials have said previously that the B-21’s stealth capabilities will be two generations beyond the B-2’s.

Ultimate procurement numbers are unknown but the Air Force may ultimately choose to purchase 80 to 100 B-21s and potentially as many as 200.

Northrop Grumman explained that “six B-21 test aircraft are in various stages of final assembly in Palmdale California. Northrop Grumman and the U.S. Air Force confirmed in May that the B-21 first flight is projected for 2023. The actual timing of first flight will be based on ground test outcomes.”

The company added that “the unveiling will take place at Northrop Grumman’s Palmdale site during an invitation-only event.” Though Northrop has published several computer-generated images of the strategic bomber and a commercial that showcased a cloth-draped B-21 fuselage photographs of the bomber have not been released.

Given the gravity of the Raider program most aspects of the new bomber have been shrouded in secrecy including financial information related to the project. However available metrics and evidence indicate that the program is moving along according to budget and at a relatively quick pace considering the B-21’s advanced nature.

Though Northrop will reveal the B-21 soon the stealth aircraft is not expected to make its first flight until next year and the bomber is slated to enter service with the U.S. Air Force in the mid-2020s.

The US Air Force already has the Self-Protect High Energy Laser Demonstrator (SHiELD) to shoot down missiles and this week they selected Raytheon Missiles & Defense to develop a hypersonic air-breathing attack cruise missile (HACM). This scramjet powered munition utilizes high vehicle speed to forcibly compress incoming air before combustion which allows sustained flight at hypersonic speeds – Mach 5 or greater.





By traveling at Mach 5 or greater hypersonic weapons like the HACM are capable of reaching their targets more quickly than similar traditional missiles allowing them to potentially evade defensive systems. Raytheon Technologies and Northrop Grumman have been collaborating since 2019 to develop produce and integrate Northrop Grumman’s scramjet engines onto Raytheon’s air-breathing hypersonic weapons.

Future Title Performance Gains With DLSS 3 Tech

Moore’s Law has been at the beating heart of technology advancement ever since it was first posited in 1965. Gordon Moore coined the golden rule which observes and predicts that the number of transistors in a microchip double roughly every two years. This is largely accomplished by making transistors ever smaller but eventually the physics of semiconductor fabrication like anything else has its limits.The 2015 International Technology Roadmap pinned 2021 as the year when miniaturization would hit its limit. While further progress can arguably be made it becomes economically infeasible to do so. Now that we are 2022 it is arguable whether we have quite reached this point. For its part Intel believes it has ways of extending Moore’s Law into the Angstrom Era using techniques like the stacked forksheet transistor NVIDIA is not quite so optimistic about beating the limits of Moore’s Law but has some other tricks up its sleeve. We had the opportunity to ask NVIDIA Founder and CEO Jensen Huang about his thoughts on process tech in the wake of GTC 2022 and the launch of the Ada Lovelace GeForce 40-Series graphics cards.Dave Altavilla our Editor-in-Chief asked “How impactful was the move from Samsung 8N to TSMC 4N? It seems TSMC 4N was a major advantage for you [NVIDIA]. I just wanted to understand how process plays in the success of Ada Lovelace because it’s an impressive chip.”The response from Huang was that gains were surprisingly modest. “Processed generationally from 8N to 4N that process gain was probably about 15%. But unfortunately the cost goes up by more than 15%” he explained.While he did not elaborate on just how much cost increased he did liken Moore’s Law to a transistor density versus cost curve that historically had been going up. He stated “But for the very first time starting with about I think around seven nanometer yeah around seven nanometer the curve actually turned down. It didn’t flatten out. It turned down.” The NVIDIA CEO then just put it bluntly noting “Moore’s Law is dead.”As process tech has approached physical limits the intricacy of production has dramatically increased. Jensen explained that its chip development is accomplished in a series of steps with approximately one step completed in fab per day. Current cycle times have ballooned to around four months from start to finish.“It’s not because TSMC is trying to capture more profit. That’s just not true” he assured “That’s a lot of steps. And so you could say that the equipment’s more expensive it takes more time in the fabs.”Huang explains that “the way that we solved it Dave with Ada is architecture .” Ada combines multiple architectures—CUDA Tensor and RT. While traditional progress has been made via CUDA for rendering and rasterization Jensen noted that Tensor and artificial intelligence are the “giant lever” for Ada.“I would say that DLSS produces a better-looking pixel than GroundTruth than the rendered pixel that we computed in the past” elaborated Huang claiming objectivity. He continued saying “And the reason for that is because DLSS learned that pixel not by computing it learned from a 16K image. Not a 4K resolution image a 16K resolution image. And so the pixels that it learned from were beautiful. There were no pixels. It’s close to raw. And so we had AI learn the colors to put in there and it puts in a better looking color.”Interestingly NVIDIA's technology advancement with DLSS 3 does also in a way mark a reduced need for pure GPU rendering at least when graphical demands are high. The CEO has asserted that artificial intelligence does it better. “It’s sufficiently subtle that in my opinion it’s better than GroundTruth” he stated “It’s definitely different than GroundTruth but it’s better than GroundTruth.”To accomplish this graphics rendering has transcended a set of operations running in individually siloed machines across the world. “Ada is generating computer graphics not just at the moment. There’s a supercomputer in the background that was training the neural network” says Huang “And so in a lot of ways Ada is Ada plus the supercomputer we have. And that’s the future. That’s the future and that’s the reason why computer graphics is so amazing.”Huang went on further to note that “...the combination between the supercomputer for priority training and coding the knowledge of pixels into the neural network and then processing the neural network which is structurally really good for tensor core processing we effectively multiply the throughput of our GPUs by a factor of eight. Well that more than overcame the weakness of Moore’s Law.”Speaking about DLSS 3 specifically  Huang reflected “Without the CPU even doing anything we generated an extra frame. It’s not predicting the future yet but it’s close and it predicted an extra frame without the CPU ever having to touch it.” If these frames are accurate and look just as good as traditional rendering—if not better—then we are excited to see what advancements this brings in the future.“Well we just doubled the frame rate but the neural network is doing all the work. And so I think we have to overcome the weakness that we’re at the end of Moore’s Law not by giving up but by coming up with a lot more clever techniques and thank goodness artificial intelligence came just in time.”Some have been resistant to the advent of neural networks and a shift way from the “ground truth” of raw GPU rendering in general. To that end we could ask what the purpose of a graphics card is—Is it not to generate as much pleasing eye-candy as possible?Yes the way this has been accomplished historically is through rendering but it is not the only path forward. Our desires alone cannot beat physics. While AI upscaling techniques have had a shaky start with some peculiar artifacts and quirks the technology has advanced and improved rapidly and dramatically. And of course we can't pretend that traditional rendering has been immune to issues either.The unfortunate consequence as alluded to in the process tech discussion is that costs have increased. Hitting the Moore’s Law wall hurts but AI could likely provide the avenue forward and back to lower cost solutions eventually. For those who expect or depend on “pure” rendering and rasterization though the way ahead will likely only become more expensive."

NORFOLK Va. – Old Dominion won its first Sun Belt Conference football game Saturday night in memorable fashion.



The Monarch defense forced two second-half turnovers that led to touchdowns and ODU twice rallied from second-half deficits to claim a 29-26 victory over Arkansas State before a boisterous crowd of 20655 at S.B. Ballard Stadium.



It wasn't an artful game – ODU's offense was shut out in the first half – but in clutch situations when the Monarchs needed big plays players on both sides of the ball made them.



""This was obviously a great win"" said Ricky Rahne ODU's Thurmond Family Head Coach. ""I thought we did some great things in the second half.



""The defense played well throughout and made some plays obviously there at the end to give us a chance to win it.



""But I thought the offense in the second half made the plays they needed to win the game.""



Defensive end Deeve Harris a transfer from Minnesota returned an interception 16 yards for a touchdown late in the third quarter that briefly gave ODU a 21-19 lead.



Then late in the fourth with Arkansas State leading 26-21 safety Terry Jones forced a fumble recovered by defensive tackle Tyre Bibby that led to the game-winner.



The fumble recovery gave ODU a first down at the 29. On fourth down and 3 at the 23 ODU quarterback Hayden Wolff threw a pass intended for Javon Harvey who was pulled down by Arkansas State defensive back Kenneth Harris. That drew a flag for pass interference.



That gave ODU a first down at the seven. Wolff then passed to tight end Zack Kuntz for the touchdown.







ODU went for two and Obie Sanni the 5-foot-9 196-pound redshirt freshman from Aurora Colorado broke a tackle to give the Monarchs a 29-26 lead with 6:33 left.



ODU then needed two stops from its defense and got them.



On fourth down and two at the Arkansas State 40 a pass from quarterback James Blackman fell incomplete.



Arkansas State regained possession in the final minute at its own two after a 38-yard punt by Ethan Duane but could not move the ball. On the game's final play a desperation pass led to two laterals and then a fumble.



ODU (2-2 overall 1-0 Sun Belt) mustered just 126 offensive yards in a first half in which the Monarchs only came close to scoring once when freshman Ethan Sanchez missed a 48-yard field goal.



But the Monarch offense emerged from that nightmarish start with its batteries recharged.



ODU began the second half by driving 78 yards in five plays as Kuntz (34 yards) and Ali Jennings III (33) each hauled in long passes. Jennings' catch was originally ruled a touchdown but after review the ball was placed at the one.



Keshawn Wicks the redshirt freshman from Moncks Corner South Carolina scored on the next play.







Arkansas State retaliated quickly with Blackman finding wide receiver Jeff Foreman on a 49-yard touchdown pass which gave the Red Wolves a 19-7 lead.



ODU again quickly responded with Wolff finding Jennings with a 77-yard touchdown pass the longest play of the season.



ODU's defense which has forced a ton of turnovers this season then forced the first of two. With defensive end Marcus Haynes hanging onto him Blackman threw a pass intercepted by Harris who returned it 16 yards for a touchdown.



It was the second interception of his career and third career TD. A Sanchez PAT gave ODU a 21-19 lead.



The lead was short-lived as the Red Wolves drove 60 yards with AJ Mayer scoring from 23 yards to with 12:10 left.



ODU's defense then stepped up again forcing a fumble that led to the game-winner.



Linebacker Jason Henderson broke a school record with 21 tackles and linebacker Ryan Henry added 12. The Monarchs had seven sacks each by a different player.



Arkansas State had 22 first downs to ODU's 12 and 397 offensive yards to ODU's 330. But ODU forced two turnovers and had none and that proved to be critical. Wolff completed 19-of-32 passes for 279 yards and two touchdowns.







Rahne said he can't really explain why the Monarchs were shut out in the first half and scored 29 points in the second half.



""Yeah everyone asked me that"" he said. ""If I knew that we wouldn't have a tale of two halves.



""I just told the guys that we have to have more belief. And I felt like I needed to have more passion in the second half.



""They need to see me excited and they need to see me yelling and stuff. So maybe I have to do that more in practice too.""



Rahne smiled when asked about the significance of his team winning the first Sun Belt football game.



""You work just as hard for every single win so they're all big"" he said. ""You want to start off the season on the right note. You want to start off conference play on the right note.



""That was a good football team we played tonight. They're probably better than their record last year (2-10) indicated and even better than their record this year (1-3 0-1). This was a good victory.



""Obviously we didn't play our best football in the first half. And I don't think we played our best football in the second half.



""But we did a lot of things that gave us a chance to win the game.""



NOTES: Running back Keshawn Wicks and safety Tahj Ra-El made their first career starts … Wicks scored the first touchdown of his career in the third quarter … Wolff's 77-yard TD pass to Jennings in the third quarter was the fifth longest pass play in ODU history and longest since David Washington hit Jonathan Duhart for an 83-yard gain at UTEP in 2016 … The 140-yard receiving game was the sixth time Jennings has been over 100 yards … Linebacker Jason Henderson registered his fourth-straight double-digit tackle game to begin the year … Henderson's 21 tackles breaks the school record of 18 held by Henderson earlier this season and TJ Ricks who had 18 in 2015 against Charlotte … The 21 tackles is the sixth most in Sun Belt Conference history and the most by an FBS player so far this season … Deeve Harris' three touchdowns are the most by an ODU defensive player in program history as well as the two interception returns for a touchdowns … The seven sacks is tied for the second most in a single game.

NORFOLK Va. — Old Dominion won its first Sun Belt Conference football game Saturday night in memorable fashion. The Monarch defense forced two second-half turnovers that led to touchdowns and ODU twice rallied from second-half deficits to claim a 29-26 victory over Arkansas State before a boisterous crowd of 20655 at S.B. Ballard Stadium.



It wasn't an artful game – ODU's offense was shut out in the first half – but in clutch situations when the Monarchs needed big plays players on both sides of the ball made them.



""This was obviously a great win"" said Ricky Rahne ODU's Thurmond Family Head Coach. ""I thought we did some great things in the second half.



""The defense played well throughout and made some plays obviously there at the end to give us a chance to win it. But I thought the offense in the second half made the plays they needed to win the game.""



Defensive end Deeve Harris a transfer from Minnesota returned an interception 16 yards for a touchdown late in the third quarter that briefly gave ODU 21-19 lead.



Then late in the fourth with Arkansas State leading 26-21 safety Terry Jones forced a fumble recovered by defensive tackle Tyre Bibby that led to the game-winner.



The fumble recovery gave ODU a first down at the 29. On fourth down and 3 at the 23 ODU quarterback Hayden Wolff threw a pass intended for Javon Harvey who was pulled down by Arkansas State defensive back Kenneth Harris. That drew a flag for pass interference.



That gave ODU a first down at the seven. Wolff then passed to tight end Zack Kuntz for the touchdown. ODU went for two and Obie Sanni the 5-foot-9 196-pound redshirt freshman from Aurora Colorado broke a tackle to give the Monarchs a 29-26 lead with 6:33 left.

Countries with robust semiconductor industries like the US South Korea Japan and Taiwan have attempted to form alliances around crucial technology.

Regarding the alliances Pranay Kotasthane director of the Takshashila Institution's High Tech Geopolitics Programme asserted that China was the immediate cause of everything.

The collaboration highlights the significance of chips for national security and economies as well as the desire of nations to halt Chinese technological growth.

Because semiconductors are used in so many of the things we use including smartphones vehicles and refrigerators semiconductors are a crucial component of modern technology. They are also essential for applications of artificial intelligence and even for armament.

The Covid pandemic-related shortage of chips along with a rise in consumer electronics demand and supply chain interruptions brought the significance of chips into sharp focus.

Governments all across the world were informed of the necessity to secure chip supplies as a result. President Joe Biden of the United States has promoted the revival of the industry.

The largest chip importer in the world China is a crucial market for chip manufacturers worldwide including Qualcomm in the United States and Samsung in South Korea. Political and commercial interactions may lead to increased conflict between governments in these high-tech alliances.

It is no longer owned by tech conglomerate Tsinghua Unigroup  which was acquired in July by Beijing Zhiguangxin Holding . Meanwhile former Tsinghua Unigroup chairman Zhao Weiguo who accompanied Xi on that chip factory tour has been put under investigation

Many of those reports carried Xinhua’s picture of Xi and his entourage clad in white protective coats on a tour of the facilities at Wuhan Xinxin Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp (XMC) a subsidiary of China’s top memory chip maker Yangtze Memory Technologies Co (YMTC).

A few months before the US-China trade war started in July 2018 local media coverage of President Xi Jinping was focused on his efforts to rally the country’s top scientists and engineers to pursue breakthroughs in core technologies  as tensions simmered between Beijing and Washington.

More importantly YMTC faces pressure amid the possibility that it might come under new US trade sanctions . The firm based in Wuhan capital of central Hubei province did not reply to requests for comment.

As such YMTC finds itself leading the way for China’s semiconductor industry to cut reliance on imported technologies while continuing to pursue innovation.

“YMTC is not a copycat with trailing-edge technology like [how] many erroneously perceive Chinese semiconductor companies [to be]” Dylan Patel chief analyst at Los Angeles-based SemiAnalysis wrote in a newsletter last month. “They are building their own innovative and unique products.”

The memory chip maker according to a Nikkei Asia report published in May 2021 had set up a task force of more than 800 people to review its supply chain with the ultimate goal of replacing US suppliers. Although that report was subsequently denied by YMTC it reflected how the company has become an integral part of the global semiconductor supply chain.

Privately-held YMTC was established in July 2016 after Tsinghua Unigroup took over the memory chip unit of Wuhan XMC which was founded in 2006 and operates two chip fabrication plants. XMC had collaborated with and licensed the Flash memory technology of US firm Spansion since 2008. Spansion was later acquired by Cypress Semiconductor which was then bought in 2020 by German firm Infineon Technologies

The state-backed China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund  also known as the Big Fund and Hubei Science & Technology Investment Group provided seed capital of about 18.9 billion yuan (US$2.67 billion) to YMTC. Total investments to YMTC reached US$24 billion according to the company’s website.

In October 2017 YMTC designed and manufactured China’s first 3D NAND flash memory wafer through its own research and development and international cooperation according to the firm’s website. Its 3D NAND flash memory packaged chips are embedded in various storage devices as well as consumer and enterprise solid-state drives which are widely used in mobile devices personal computers servers and various consumer electronics products.

YMTC has more than 10000 employees worldwide including 6000 engineers involved in research and development activities. The company is looking to hire graduates to fill dozens of positions at its operations in Wuhan Shanghai and Beijing according to its latest recruitment post.

One of the company’s latest NAND chip products according to Chinese media reports is a 232-layer chip that puts the firm on par with if not better than the world’s leading memory chip manufacturers that include Samsung Electronics Micron and SK Hynix . There has been no official YMTC confirmation about that reported breakthrough.

China is the world’s second-largest market for NAND flash products making up more than 31 per cent of the global market according to data from Minsheng Securities. YMTC however only had a 1 per cent share of the global memory chip market in 2020.

Samsung Toshiba Western Digital Intel Micron and SK Hynix controlled 95 per cent in the same period according to Minsheng Securities. By 2025 it expected YMTC to increase its share to 6 per cent.

Still YMTC has been expected to become a memory chip supplier to Apple  with the iPhone and iPad maker reportedly keen to use the Chinese firm’s products for devices sold on the mainland.

“YMTC’s chance to enter Apple’s supply chain as a key player of the Chinese memory industry has great symbolic significance for the industry and is a recognition of its technological prowess” said Arisa Liu a senior semiconductor research fellow at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research.

That potential development however has reportedly raised eyebrows back in the US.

Washington according to reports in August has been contemplating a ban on selling US semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China’s advanced NAND Flash chip foundries  which would mark the first time this segment of the mainland’s integrated circuit industry has been targeted by the US government.

The possibility of the US expanding the scope of its trade sanctions to include YMTC is real given the memory chip maker’s technological progress according to Liu from the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research.

US Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer renewed calls on Washington to add YMTC to its trade blacklist for violating export controls by supplying chips to Huawei  based upon findings from a third-party teardown report by the Canada-based consulting firm IP Research Group according to a Financial Times report on Thursday. The teardown showed that YMTC supplied NAND memory chips to Huawei’s foldable smartphone  the Mate Xs 2 the report said.

But Siva Manoharan IP Research Group’s founder and managing partner downplayed the significance of their teardown analysis in an emailed response to the South China Morning Post. He said the group just “supplied a picture of the chips found on the phone nothing more – there is no evidence or opinion on the dates or sources of any chips on the phone or when the phone was manufactured”.

YMTC which last year denied US politicians’ claims that it had ties to the Chinese military has remained mum on the prospects of being hit by US sanctions . Such trade restrictions could impact the firm’s operations which uses semiconductor manufacturing gear from Lam Research and licensed technology from Adeia part of Xperi Holding Corp according to Patel from SemiAnalysis.

The NAND Flash memory chip market is currently “frosty” according to a research note by TrendForce analyst Bryan Ao who said inventories are at a “breaking point” and that chip makers are being forced to cut prices.

YMTC had previously planned to process a monthly capacity of 30000 wafers by 2020 which would reach 1 million by 2030 after its three fabs reach full capacity in 2025.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVwdC5jYS8yMDIyLzA5L3NlbWljb25kdWN0b3ItbWFya2V0cy1zbG93ZG93bi1jb250aW51ZXMtc2xpZGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Semiconductor market's slowdown continues slide,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.ept.ca', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/09/semiconductor-markets-slowdown-continues-slide/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002674225A230>, 'Connection to www.ept.ca timed out.

“My dream job was to work in an ice cream shop” Catz told Time in a 2010 interview. “Two weeks and five pounds later I realized it wasn’t for me. For many years I had planned to be a corporate lawyer. As luck would have it other than a summer internship I didn’t end up doing that either.”

As luck would have it with some grit and perseverance mixed in Catz went on to shape the present and future of the computer world as president and then CEO of Oracle one of the world’s largest software companies.

Catz 60 graduated from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1983 before earning a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1986.

She joined the Oracle Corporation in 1999 and quickly rose through the ranks joining the board of directors in 2001. She became president in 2004 CFO in 2005 co-CEO in 2011 and sole CEO in 2019 after fellow chief executive Mark Hurd died.

Taking Oracle to new heights in cloud computing

During Catz’s tenure Oracle has overtaken several rival companies and become a significant force in cloud-based computing. Since 2008 Catz has also served on the board of HSBC Group one of the largest banking institutions in the world. Regularly ranked by Forbes and Fortune magazines as one of the most powerful women in business she was named the highest-paid female in a Fortune 1000 company in 2011 by Fortune.

Catz was born in Holon to a physicist father and a Holocaust survivor mother from Romania. At age six Catz moved with her parents to Massachusetts but she remains connected to her birthplace both in and out of the boardroom. Oracle opened facilities in Israel in 1996 and currently employs some 400 in the Jewish state. Since 1997 she’s been married to former Israeli soccer coach Gal Tirosh. The couple has two sons Gary and Scott.

“Larry (Ellison) and I are deeply committed to Israel” Catz has said. “We built an amazing highly secured data center for Oracle Cloud in Israel because we love Israel and we know the country needs it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vZmludHkuY29tL3VzL25ldC13b3J0aC9sYXJyeS1lbGxpc29uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Larry Ellison's Net Worth - How Rich is the Oracle Co-founder?,"Ellison has been married and divorced several times. He has two children his son David and his daughter Megan.

Ellison attended South Shore High School in Chicago. He studied at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign where he excelled. However when his adoptive mother passed away Larry dropped out without sitting the final exams of his sophomore year. He returned to university to study physics and mathematics after spending the summer in California. It was a pivotal year in his life since this was when Ellison first learned about computer design.

Larry Ellison was born in New York City's Bronx on August 17 1944. His biological father was a pilot in the U.S. Army Air Corps. When he was 9 months old Larry contracted pneumonia and his biological mother decided to give him to her aunt and uncle for adoption. Larry grew up on Chicago's South Shore. It wasn't until he was 48 that he next met his biological mother.

How did Larry Ellison build his worth?

Due to his fascination with IBM’s relational database design he decided to form a company called Oracle. This company was a database vendor servicing low-range and mid-range systems.

Larry Ellison's immense net worth can be traced back to a relational database he designed for the CIA he called ""Oracle"" while working for Ampex Corporation.

In 1977 Ellison and two partners invested $2000 of seed capital — a lot of money at the time — and co-founded Software Development Laboratories (SDL). Two years later SDL changed its name to Relational Software Inc. Its flagship product was a database called Oracle. In 1983 taking inspiration from their flagship product SDL was rebranded as Oracle Systems Corporation.

By 2005 Ellison's salary at Oracle was almost $1 million a year with additional performance bonuses and compensation. As of 2007 Ellison was earning just over $61 million from the company that year alone. The following year he earned $84 million and in 2009 $54 million.

In 2010 Oracle purchased Sun Microsystems which gave them a bevy of products and rights to the HP lineup.

Ellison has a stake in several other tech companies including 3 million shares of Elon Musk's Tesla where he is also a director.

How has Larry Ellison spent his wealth?

Larry Ellison famously admires sailing and has owned several superyachts over the years. He gives all his yachts Japanese names. Musashi a luxury yacht worth approximately $160 million is 88 meters long with the capacity to sleep up to 18 visitors and carry a crew of 23.

Still no matter how spacious and luxurious the yacht is he can't live on it and he doesn't. He owns a home in Florida worth $173 million on a 22-acre island. The main house consists of two parts: one faces the ocean and the other a lake. All in all this property has 2500 feet of waterfront.

PCAR,Paccar,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZWN0cml2ZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8yNC9oZWxpb3gtdG8tYmUtZ2xvYmFsLWNoYXJnaW5nLXBhcnRuZXItZm9yLXBhY2Nhci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Heliox to be global charging partner for Paccar,"Dutch charging infrastructure specialist Heliox is joining forces with US commercial vehicle group Paccar to supply DC chargers for electric trucks in both North America and Europe.

The deal will involve Paccar’s DAF brand in Europe and the Kenworth and Peterbilt brands in North America. In Europe Paccar will offer its customers and dealers 40 kW mobile chargers and stationary fast chargers with outputs ranging from 150 kW to 360 kW. Heliox says that one of the fast chargers can be used to charge an electric truck during a lunch break or three lower-power electric trucks overnight.

In North America Heliox will supply 40 kW and 50 kW mobile chargers to Paccar dealers and customers. Mobile chargers are often used by companies that are just making the switch to electric vehicles and are only testing whether it is worthwhile to build stationary charging infrastructure.

“The truck market is at a turning point in embracing the future of electric driving” says Dick Leek General Manager at Paccar Parts Europe. “Heliox will work closely with DAF to meet their customers’ charging needs facilitating the transition of their fleet from diesel to electric transport.” Heliox CEO Michael Colijn added: “This partnership has come at the perfect time as Heliox continues to expand its European operations for the e-truck market.”

DAF very recently unveiled two new electric at the IAA Transportation in Hanover the XD Electric and XF Electric series. Both models feature modular powertrains with Paccar e-motors producing between 170 to 350 kW and a range of battery packs for ranges from 200 to over 500 kilometres which can be charged at up to 325 kW. DAF already has four locally emission-free trucks in various weight classes.

In May last year Dutch truck manufacturer DAF Trucks began offering its customers a complete range of charging stations with outputs from 20 kW to 350 kW. Mobile chargers with an output of 24 kW to 40 kW were also put on offer.

With the new chargers from Heliox the company underlined that ongoing interoperability testing with new medium- to heavy-duty vehicles will ensure that “Heliox equipment is among the most consistent and reliable on the market.” Heliox explains that its chargers can be monitored and controlled using EV Service Provider software via the cloud-based Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP).

Paccar has previously partnered with ABB for commercial vehicle charging solutions in North America and Europe. This partnership includes various chargers from 20 kW mobile units to 350 kW HPCs.

The 4×4 Light Protected Vehicle called Maatla means Power in Setswana language and has already received orders for 50 vehicles from two customers Paramount said.

“The latest addition to Paramount’s family of protected vehicles is already in production for an African country with one of the most challenging rugged and remote environments for land forces to operate in” the company stated.

Eric Ichikowitz Senior Vice President Paramount International stated: “Our customers can now take full advantage of three decades of armoured vehicle innovation engineering excellence and market leadership but in a lighter class vehicle designed in response to changing customer requirements. We are very excited to offer border patrol gendarmerie police units and armed forces in Africa and around the world with best-in-class technologies and capability. The vehicle’s lighter weight and commercial components ultimately enable greater customer affordability and faster production rates.”

The Maatla has been manufactured on a commercial vehicle chassis which provides class-leading reliability and proven capability while capable of addressing all types of terrain for its nine-crew personnel. It further features “Smart Floor” technology enabling the seating to be quickly removed and the vehicle to be configured as either an ambulance command vehicle or customisable for alternative mission requirements such as border patrol military support policing or peacekeeping missions. Day/night vision devices and extra sensors can also be fitted to provide 24/7 operability.

The Maatla provides as a minimum ballistic and blast protection to STANAG 4569 Level 1 and can protect against handguns and other small caliber ball rounds. It also provides underbelly protection against M26 hand grenades or a blast equivalent.

Deon Grobler CEO of Paramount Land Systems stated that: “Personnel safety and soldier survivability in the field are key priorities of the Paramount Group’s design and manufacturing philosophy. The Maatla is a multi-purpose vehicle offering excellent cross-country performance and reliability. Designed to handle a 2-tonne payload the Maatla offers near infinite-configurability in terms of onboarding mission-specific equipment weapons and armour scalability.”

The Maatla can reach a road speed of up to 100 km/hr with a cruising range of up to 600 km when traveling at 80 km/hr and a fording depth of up to 750 mm without preparation.

Watching TV was not active enough Mr. Zuckerberg said. Compared with social media TV was “beta.”

Elon Musk who signed a deal to buy Twitter seemingly on a whim and is now headed to court because he wants to back out of the purchase has lobbed “debate me bro” taunts at Twitter’s chief executive in between doling out advice about intermittent fasting and worrying about population collapse.

And Marc Andreessen the high-profile tech investor recently opposed a plan to build multifamily housing in the Silicon Valley town where he lives and then announced his latest and largest deal: a residential real estate start-up led by Adam Neumann the entrepreneur who notoriously incinerated billions of dollars in value at WeWork.

You can watch movies explore the volcanos get a workout in and play video games. But only a few of these experiences are free of charge. Most games and apps require a one-time purchase so you need to create your Oculus account and choose a payment method at the same time.

However you are not obligated to keep the same payment method the entire time you’re using the VR headset. You can easily change it on your Oculus smartphone or desktop app.

What Payment Options Are Available with Oculus Quest 2



Before we go into detail on how to add and remove payment methods on Oculus Quest let’s see what your options are in the first place.

For now you can officially link your credit or debit Visa Mastercard and American Express card. Those who prefer paying via digital wallets can connect their PayPal account as a payment method.

How to Change Your Oculus Quest 2 Payment Method using a Phone

One of the simplest ways to change your payment settings for Oculus Quest is to tap into your mobile app. Make sure to download the latest version of the Oculus app from either App Store or Google Play store. You also need to make sure you’re signed in with your Oculus credentials.

From there follow these steps to add a new payment method:

Tap Menu located in the bottom-right corner.

Select Settings.

Select Payment Methods.

Choose between Add credit or debit card or Add a PayPal account.

Fill out all the necessary payment information.



Now that you’ve added the new payment method you’ll be using; you can remove the one you won’t need anymore. Here’s how:

Go to Payment Methods again by tapping on the Menu button. Select the payment option you want to delete and select Remove.

That’s all there is to it. Oculus will charge your purchases using the new payment method from that moment on.

How to Change Your Oculus Quest 2 Payment Method using a Computer

Some people prefer to enter their billing information via computer. The good news is that Oculus payment info can be modified using the Oculus desktop app.

You can download the app from the official website and log in with your username and password. To change your payment method follow these steps:

Launch the Oculus desktop app on your computer.

Select Settings from the left-side panel.

Navigate to the Payment tab.

Select either Credit or Debit Card or PayPal Account.

Enter valid billing information.



Don’t forget that you need to remove the payment method you will no longer be using. All you need to do is click on the Remove button next to the payment method.

Additional FAQs

Can you use the Oculus app to change the payment method for Gear VR headset?

Yes you can. If you have a Gear VR headset created by Samsung in collaboration with Oculus you use the official Oculus Android app for all settings. That means you can change the payment methods the same way Oculus Quest 2 users do.

What happens if Oculus doesn’t authorize a payment method?

Every time you buy something in the Oculus store this request is processed by the bank or PayPal. If it doesn’t go through you’re most likely dealing with a lack of funds in your account. It’s best to check with the bank or payment provider to see what the issue is.

Managing Oculus Quest 2 Payment Options Successfully

Regardless of how long you’ve been using one payment method on Oculus you can always change it. As the number of Oculus VR games challenges and experiences grows it’s best to know all your options when it comes to payments.

If you want to replace the debit card with a credit card the update process is fairly simple and quick. Also if you don’t want to enter all the payment info manually and link your cards to Oculus PayPal is always an option.

Well Paypal is one of the fastest options. However in Nigeria you can only use your Paypal account to send money abroad. This means since it’s not functional here you need Paypal alternatives to receive foreign currencies.

While many Nigerians opt for a foreign verified Paypal account the risk associated with this method outweighs the pros. For one you could get scammed. That’s why we recommend signing up for financial apps that allow you receive foreign payments directly into your account. In this article we’ll be listing out a few of these Paypal alternatives so you can try them out.

Advertisement - Continue reading below

1. Grey Finance

Grey formerly known as Aboki Africa allows you to create foreign bank accounts in USD EUR or GBP. This is an excellent choice if you’re a freelancer or remote worker looking for a Paypal alternative to directly receive payments online. Especially since each bank account comes with an IBAN and routing number – making it suitable for business transactions. With Grey you can also swap your foreign currencies to Naira at competitive rates and withdraw it directly to your local bank account.

Opening a Grey account is completely free and you don’t need a minimum account balance to start receiving payments. Although you’d be required to verify your account with a government-issued ID. It’s also an ideal option if you’re looking to send money from Nigeria abroad.

2. Skrill

Skrill is an international payment solution that allows you to receive money from anywhere in the world. It’s very similar to Paypal and it’s available to Nigerians. All you have to do is create a personal account on Skrill. Once you’ve set up and verified your account with a government-issued ID share your registered email address to get paid. Again ensure you only share the email address linked to your Skrill account.

RELATED:

Once you’ve received payments withdraw directly to your Nigerian bank account. The downside to using Skrill is that the withdrawal charges are a bit high. However if you don’t mind paying 5 Euros to withdraw then it’s an excellent alternative.

3. Chipper Cash

Looking to receive USD? While Chippercash allows you to send and receive payments across Africa. Recently they launched money transfers to and from the United States. On the app however you can still receive money from the UK and Uganda. Although the payments will be immediately converted to US dollars.

Unfortunately since you can’t carry out currency exchange directly on the app you’d have to connect a domiciliary account to withdraw your USD. This means you need a dom account with any of their partner banks – First Bank Zenith FCMB or UBA. Once this is sorted simply withdraw and head over to the nearest branch to get your cash.

4. Eversend

Eversend is a multicurrency app that allows you to receive foreign currencies hold and exchange them. So far you can receive USD EUR GBP and Naira on the Eversend app. Each currency has its wallet so if you receive USD for example it’ll automatically be in your USD wallet. You can then choose to swap this USD to Naira and withdraw it to your local bank account.

However to receive foreign currencies on Eversend your sender has to also create an Eversend account. This is because since it’s a wallet you don’t get a foreign bank account for receiving direct transfers. If you’d like to explore this solution download the app to get started.

5. Payoneer

As a Nigerian business owner Payoneer is a great way to manage your international business transactions. Like most examples on this list you’d get a foreign bank account from any of the available eight countries of your choice. Some of these countries include the United States the United Kingdom and Canada. This means you can get paid like a local.

Once you receive payments you can connect your Payoneer account to a Nigerian bank for seamless withdrawals. With this you get the equivalent of whatever currency you’re trying to exchange. The only downside to using Payoneer is that it can take days to get your funds after a withdrawal.

6. Lemonade Finance

Do you want to receive foreign payments from the United Kingdom or Canada? Then Lemonade Finance is a Paypal alternative focusing on these two regions. Although it’s more of a wallet-based system so it’s more suitable if you’re receiving money from a family member or loved one. Simply get them to download the mobile app and create a GBP or CAD wallet. Thereafter they can fund their lemonade wallet via direct debit.

From the Lemonade app they can transfer the equivalent of a foreign currency directly to your bank account. You don’t have to worry about any conversions or fees as all transfers on Lemonade are free.

7. Geegpay

A news release from the ministry said the bivalent booster vaccines may offer more targeted protection against COVID-19 Omicron variants.

""With the start of the fall and winter respiratory illness season it is especially important to make sure people stay up to date with their vaccines"" Deputy Premier and Minister of Health Sylvia Jones said in a statement.

""COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters are the best tool to keep people healthy and out of hospitals and to ensure Ontario's economy stays open as the weather cools and people spend more time indoors.""

People eligible for a bivalent booster can receive it at a recommended interval of six months (168) days from their previous dose or a minimum interval of three months (84 days) regardless of how many booster doses they already received the ministry said.

It also ""strongly"" recommends vulnerable people aged 70 and older and moderately to severely immunocompromised individuals aged 12 and over to receive the bivalent booster as soon as they are eligible after speaking with their health-care provider.

While adults over 18 were able to book bivalent booster appointments since Sept. 12 the province said it would prioritize vulnerable groups until Sept. 26.

New pediatric vaccine available

The release also notes the new pediatric Pfizer vaccine will be available for children aged between six months to under five years old. The vaccine was approved by Health Canada on Sep. 9 and the province confirmed to CBC Toronto that the first shipment arrived last week.

Similarly Moderna's pediatric vaccine for the same age group was approved in mid-July and made available in Ontario shortly after.

""We also know that getting your child vaccinated improves their immune response to COVID-19 infection and reduces the possibility of severe disease and hospitalization and post COVID-19 symptoms"" said Dr. Kieran Moore Chief Medical Officer of Health in the release.

Despite the availability only about six per cent of eligible kids have had their first dose — a number Moore previously said is lower than he thought he'd see by this point.

The ministry states the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for infants and children is a three-dose primary series with a recommended dosing interval of eight weeks between doses.

It stresses mixing vaccine products for infants or children's primary series doses is not recommended.

""Your child should receive the same product for all their primary series doses whether it is Pfizer or Moderna"" the release reads.

People eligible for a booster or pediatric vaccine can book through the COVID-19 vaccination portal through the Provincial Vaccine Contact Centre or directly through local public health units Indigenous-led vaccination clinics and at participating health-care providers and pharmacies."

It’s too early to know how or if the 19-month-long strike connects with this lawsuit filed Wednesday in Lucas County (Ohio) Common Pleas Court by Allan Block of Toledo Ohio. He’s the CEO of Block Communications Inc. which owns the PG its Toledo sister paper The Blade as well as Pittsburgh City Paper and other businesses including cable companies and TV stations. His suit accuses others in his family of scheming to sell all of it without his input.

The suit doesn’t mention the PG strike. Zack Tanner president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh one of the unions that walked out in October 2022 said the lawsuit has no impact on the strike.

“The Blocks are no strangers to infighting” Tanner said on Thursday. “If you worked at the paper for a minute or for 50 years you know the Blocks like to fight with each other. No big news there. But our fight is our fight. They can fight internally but we’re still committed to winning the strike.”

Tanner said he remains confident the striking unions will prevail. A National Labor Relations Board judge has ruled strongly in the strikers’ favor he noted and the NLRB’s regional office recently took the unusual step of signaling its intent to seek an injunction that could bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and compel the company to bargain in good faith a new one.

“We’ll have our day in court and we will win the strike” Tanner said “no matter whether the Blocks are fighting with each other.”

In the suit Allan Block seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent BCI from being sold by his brother Pittsburgh’s John R. Block and others who run the company several of whom also live in the Pittsburgh area.

The motion says John Block — the publisher and editor-in-chief of the two newspapers — several times has tried and failed to replace the plaintiff Allan Block as CEO a position he is contracted to hold until 2028. “Now in a last-ditch effort to assert his so-called ‘sovereignty’ John Block has conspired with the rest of the Director Defendants to exclude Plaintiff from the most major decision to ever face BCI in its over 100 years of existence: a full sale of all its assets.”

The privately-held BCI started in 1901 by the Block brothers’ grandfather Paul Block is not currently for sale but the motion says that in January John Block “caused BCI to form a strategic transaction committee to pursue a merger or acquisition of the company.” That committee the suit says excluded Allan Block.

That news and the possibility raised in the motion that this committee making a “rushed and haphazard” sale “will result in significant job losses” was concerning to people who are working for those businesses as well as those who are on strike especially at a time when newspapers specifically and media in generally are struggling.

The Block family’s struggle for control of BCI looks to play out in court as does the strikers’ struggle for a contract.

The motion confirms that Allan and John Block each have a 25% stake in BCI while the other 50% is owned by family trusts that benefit family members.

Listed as defendants in the suit in addition to BCE and John Block are William Block Jr. exempt and non-exempt trusts Donald G. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Karen D. Johnese exempt and non-exempt trusts Barbara L. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Block Family trust No. 2 Karen Johnese Diana Block Ron Davenport Nancy Reid and Emily Escalante.

Donald Block who lives in Fox Chapel in February was named president of Pittsburgh City Paper after it was purchased by a BCI subsidiary.

Meanwhile workers in four production unions went on strike at the Post-Gazette in October 2022 over a dispute that left them without health care coverage. Journalists in the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh joined them later in their own unfair labor practices strike which is now in its 19th month. The Guild’s issues go back farther than that in that the union’s last contract expired in 2017 and in 2020 the PG citing an impasse in contract bargaining imposed conditions including a company health plan on the workers.

In April the striking journalists learned that the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board had received approval from the NLRB to seek an injunction in their case in which a NLRB administrative law judge had in January 2023 ruled strongly in favor of the union. The judge ruled that the company had to bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and bargain a new one. The company appealed that decision and the appeal has yet to be heard by the NLRB. The union is expecting the regional NLRB office to file the injunction — called a 10(j) injunction — any day now but until it is doesn’t know the scope of what the NLRB wants a judge to order.

It’s a complicated situation and one with many moving and not moving parts.

Also in April one union the distribution workers ended its strike with the PG agreeing to do so and dissolve their union in exchange for severance payments.

The remaining unions still on strike have stressed that the Post-Gazette could settle with them at any time. The most recent actual bargaining sessions that the Pittsburgh Union Progress knows about and attended were in September of 2023. (One union met with company representatives in February to set bargaining dates but the Union Progress doesn’t know if any subsequent sessions happened.)

The Blocks’ commitment to the Post-Gazette is unclear though John Block said on Wednesday in a statement to The Blade that he remains “committed” to the PG as well as The Blade.

In a brief statement given to The Blade and other outlets a representative of Allan Block seemed to contradict that writing “It is unfortunate that certain Block family members would choose to further enrich themselves at the expense of local jobs and the communities that depend on local news coverage.”

Phone calls and messages from the Pittsburgh Union Progress to Allan Block John Block and Donald Block seeking interviews or comments about the lawsuit and the strike were not returned.

A small contingent of striking journalists went to John Block’s home on Wednesday and he was not home so a small group returned on Thursday evening. A man who answered the door said Block was not home and that the group could try again Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vYmxlYWNoZXJyZXBvcnQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzEwMTIwNTMzLW5iYS10cmFkZS1ydW1vcnMtY2otbWNjb2xsdW0tbm90LXVudG91Y2hhYmxlLWluLXRhbGtzLXBlbGljYW5zLXBnLXNlZW4tYXMtbGVhZGVy0gGNAWh0dHBzOi8vc3luZGljYXRpb24uYmxlYWNoZXJyZXBvcnQuY29tL2FtcC8xMDEyMDUzMy1uYmEtdHJhZGUtcnVtb3JzLWNqLW1jY29sbHVtLW5vdC11bnRvdWNoYWJsZS1pbi10YWxrcy1wZWxpY2Fucy1wZy1zZWVuLWFzLWxlYWRlci5hbXAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NBA Trade Rumors: CJ McCollum 'Not Untouchable' in Talks; Pelicans PG Seen as Leader,"Jeff Haynes/NBAE via Getty Images

Faced with the possibility of going into the luxury tax next season the New Orleans Pelicans could going into the offseason trying to cut payroll with several trade candidates on their roster.

Michael Scotto said on the latest episode of the HoopsHype podcast that CJ McCollum is ""not untouchable"" in trade talks but he's considered a ""grown-up in the room for a young Pelicans squad providing stability on the court and a good locker room presence for the team.""

The Pelicans currently have $167.4 million in salary on their books for next season. That total doesn't include cap holds that bring their total up to $199.7 million which is nearly $10 million over the projected second tax apron.

Jonas Valančiūnas who has a $23.2 million cap hold is the biggest question mark for the Pelicans among their potential free agents.

ESPN's Bobby Marks noted the Pelicans have never paid the luxury tax in franchise history and the front office's decision regarding Valančiūnas and Naji Marshall who is also a free agent will determine if the club has the full nontaxpayer mid-level exception of $12.9 million or the taxpayer mid-level of $5.1 million available.

Of the potential trade candidates for the Pelicans Brandon Ingram has been the most-talked about thus far. The 26-year-old will be playing on a $36 million expiring contract next season but his deal includes a 15 percent trade kicker that could complicate any potential deal.

ESPN's Brian Windhorst has cited the Philadelphia 76ers as a potential landing spot for Ingram this summer. Scotto noted rival executives consider him to be the ""most likely"" Pelicans player to be moved because the fit on the court ""isn't ideal"" with Zion Williamson.

Next season will mark the first year of McCollum's two-year $64 million deal he signed in September 2022. The contract has descending salaries of $33.3 million in 2024-25 and $30.7 million in 2025-26 that could make it easier to trade.

The Pelicans have invested a lot of money in this core that hasn't produced great results. They have made the playoffs in two of the past three years but lost in the first round both times.

The collaboration launched this week and supports LADF’s efforts to provide hands-on STEM curriculum and programming in partnership with Science of Sport to elementary and middle school students through teacher training in local underserved communities.

“Teaming up with 76® affords us the opportunity to further our mission of providing STEM curriculum to youth in Los Angeles” LADF chief executive office Nichol Whiteman said in a statement.

“With the 76 brand’s support we’re able to train more teachers and offer a first of its kind STEM curriculum and accompanying kits to keep students engaged in science and math as they hit the age where their interests and test scores tend to decline.”

The collaboration between the official Dodgers foundation and 76 includes a custom pin featuring the iconic Smilin’ Jack; the fuel company started the campaign with a $35000 donation. The first 500 fans to make a minimum $76 donation will receive the limited-edition Smilin’ Jack pin and a co-branded corduroy cap while supplies last.

“Smilin’ Jack has been a Halloween tradition since 1952” said Juliana Moreno public affairs advisor at the Phillips 66 Los Angeles Refinery. “Phillips 66 is proud to support LADF’s efforts advancing education and fostering strong and resilient communities.”

Dodgers fans can support the initiative by texting “FUEL” to 41623 or by visiting the Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation Homebase in the center field plaza at Dodger Stadium where 100 sets of six historical Dodgers pins are available with a donation of $76 or more while supplies last.

The Dodgers are also hosting an online auction from Sept. 27-Oct.7 which features game-used items and autographed memorabilia. Plus 50% of the pot from the 50/50 raffle at Dodger Stadium on Saturday Oct. 1 will benefit the STEM programming.

Dodgers pins by 76

Earlier this year new Dodgers pins were made available to fans who purchased at least eight gallons of fuel through the My 76 mobile app.

The Dodgers and 76 have a longstanding partnership and a pins series in 2019 coincided with the brand’s iconic logos returning above the scoreboards at Dodger Stadium.

In Pakistan Kazuya Hiraide and Kenro Nakajima have summited 6977m Karun Koh. The Japanese pair made it via a new line on the previously unexplored Northwest Face. Climbing in a single push they set off on September 19 spent two nights on the face and summited on September 21 at 2:50 pm local time. They are now safely back in Base Camp exhausted but safe.

Jungle approach to Manaslu West

Meanwhile in Nepal a wild time is assured on the West Face of Manaslu where the French team has spotted a highly difficult yet possible line. Charles Dubouloz reported his first impressions of the West Face.

“To our knowledge since Beghin and Muller’s ascent of the West Face no one has come this way” he said. “We walked for three days in the pouring rain set up our tent in wet tall grass and observed the face for days.” At least during those few hours when the clouds parted and revealed the mountain. It didn’t look easy.

“It’s filled with seracs!!!” he said. “We have five in total each more threatening than the other. We even nicknamed the main one Nazaré [after the Portuguese beach famous for big-wave surfing] it looks so imposing.”

Dubouloz also noted that routes are scarce but they see one possibility up a steep rocky pinnacle. “Nothing certain but we’ll try” he promised.

Before their single push however the French trio will move to the other side of the mountain and “join the hordes of walkers” to acclimatize on Manaslu’s normal route.

“I do not criticize the dreams and projects of others” Dubouloz added. “I am just happy to be on an uncertain adventure where our only chances of success rest on our fragile shoulders.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9wb3N0LW1hZ2F6aW5lL2Zhc2hpb24vYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTkzNTg2L2Rpb3JzLWFydGlzdGljLWRpcmVjdG9yLW1hcmlhLWdyYXppYS1jaGl1cmktd29ya2luZ9IBeGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9wb3N0LW1hZ2F6aW5lL2Zhc2hpb24vYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTkzNTg2L2Rpb3JzLWFydGlzdGljLWRpcmVjdG9yLW1hcmlhLWdyYXppYS1jaGl1cmktd29ya2luZw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dior artistic director on working at the top of male-dominated fashion biz,"The crown jewel of luxury group LVMH – owner of brands such as Louis Vuitton Bulgari and Givenchy – Dior has always been the more refined and elegant sibling to mega brand Louis Vuitton.

Fashion however is a funny world one where unbound creativity – often of the male kind – gets all the attention at the expense of commercial success even though making clothes that women actually want to wear should be the ultimate seal of approval.

Since taking over as women’s artistic director of Dior six years ago designer Maria Grazia Chiuri has turned the LVMH-owned label into a commercial juggernaut which you’d think would earn her plenty of praise.

Less ostentatious and very Parisian Dior like Chanel is one of the few houses that make haute couture that rarefied niche devoted to one-of-a-kind custom garments made in Paris and purchased by a handful of clients who can afford dresses worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Maria Grazia Chiuri became Dior’s artistic director in 2016.

Before Chiuri’s arrival – and that of her partner in crime CEO Pietro Beccari who joined the label not long after her appointment – Dior was known for its elegance and refinement what the French call bon chic bon genre a specific aesthetic rooted in Parisian allure and a tad old-fashioned and snobbish.

Chiuri who had worked at Italian brands Fendi and Valentino didn’t waste time in changing things when she joined the house.

“I arrived in Paris and the first thing I saw at Dior was how isolated the brand was from the world with this attitude of navel-gazing” she says when we meet at the Dior headquarters in Paris during the haute couture shows in early July.

“The studio was full of closed doors something I had never experienced before. I literally opened the doors to have a different conversation with the ateliers and to create a real team.

Working with the Fendi sisters really helped me achieve that at Dior because back then it was a spirit of team and sisterhood. Fendi was a matriarchal company; it was always ‘us’ never ‘I’.”

Chiuri made the concept of womanhood a central theme at Dior from day one. Her first show spring/summer 2017 famously featured a T-shirt emblazoned with the words “We Should All Be Feminists” taken from an essay by Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.

That’s when the griping among fashion insiders began. Why mix politics and fashion? What does a fashion designer selling ultra-expensive clothing know about feminism? That was before the #MeToo movement and the wave of social activism embraced by many companies in recent years. Chiuri however doesn’t feel vindicated.

She just says that the motive behind that gesture which she has followed with plenty of similar ones throughout her tenure at Dior originated from her own experience as a woman working in fashion.

Garments showcased at Dior’s autumn/winter 2022 show in Paris.

She recalls how when her appointment at Dior was announced all the headlines focused on her being the first female to helm the brand while completely ignoring her résumé.

“It was as if I had never been a creative director before” she says. “I have known this industry since I was 20. I’m 58 now and I know how hard it is for a woman to make a name for herself in fashion and in other creative fields because there is still the stereotype of the male creator and male genius.

It’s a patriarchal culture even though I had the luck to work with the Fendi sisters and I also had many female role models in my family coming from the south of Italy.”

Chiuri however did not champion her cause just by placing slogans on €700 (US$680) T-shirts. She has made a point of collaborating with female artists for many of her collections and of hiring female talent for campaigns and other high-profile projects.

“The first campaign I did was with Brigitte Lacombe one of the top photographers in the world who had never done a fashion campaign or a fashion shoot” she says. “It’s not a coincidence but a flaw in the system.”

She explains that her bias has led to some criticism but she wouldn’t have it any other way. “I made those choices consciously” she says. “Now it’s a bit different because many brands and magazines use female photographers.

Dior’s autumn/winter 2022 show in Paris.

I believe that in an ideal world you should just pick the person who can best convey that idea and create an image but objectively when you see such imparities you can’t be neutral and have to be biased when making these decisions.”

In spite of the initial backlash she has stayed the course. “I was in my early 50s and I had reached a certain self-awareness when I joined Dior and I could make some choices and express my opinion and take some risks because I had nothing to lose at that stage in my life and career” she says. “It was a privilege also because Dior is a strong brand.”

Her inclusive approach also translates into her designs which – cost aside – are accessible and have been snapped up by young women who want to look well put together but not precious or like they’re trying too hard.

The silhouette that Chiuri has made a signature of Dior – a simple top like a T-shirt or her version of Dior’s Bar Jacket paired with a long skirt – has become a leitmotif of her work. She has built an entire portfolio of new hero products and collections that may not always earn rave reviews but never fail to succeed with the toughest judges of all: customers.

“My approach to design comes from my background in accessories which were my first passion” she says. “I always say that accessories are objects and not relative to the body and you can mix and match and interpret them the way you like.

I give my point of view obviously but then the wearer interprets the look and doesn’t have to follow what I say. Fashion used to be very dictatorial but now it’s not contemporary to impose a full look.”

Preparations for a Dior show in Seville Spain.

Whether she’s designing an everyday bag – such as the bestselling Book Tote – or a couture gown meant for a special occasion Chiuri sees herself at the service of her clients and loves staying behind the scenes even while in charge of one of the top fashion labels in the world:

“We come from a world in fashion that has often celebrated the creator as creator. For me it’s not about the school of thought that you have to celebrate yourself when you design a garment so my approach is less influenced by the media and by [the idea] of the designer as a pop star which has come with Instagram.”

Chiuri ultimately “was forced to” join Instagram she says with a laugh. And although she’s not active on the platform that does not mean that she doesn’t have her finger on the pulse.

Chiuri is also close to personalities such as Chiara Ferragni the Italian mega-influencer and pioneering fashion blogger (back in the days when blogging was still a thing). She sees the rise of disrupters such as Ferragni as a parallel to what she has been trying to do at Dior.

“At the beginning of her career as a blogger Chiara wasn’t even invited to shows because that new way of reading and approaching fashion from new generations was seen as an attack on the status quo” says Chiuri adding that for her fashion ultimately has to be about “exchange and empathy”.

She has championed those values not just with her activism but also by collaborating with artisans from around the world when holding destination shows in far-flung places such as the Moroccan city of Marrakech Italy’s Lecce and more recently Seville Spain.

The Dior Cruise 2023 show in Seville Spain took place in June.

Chiuri says she’s looking forward to exploring the more traditional aspects of Asia a continent she has only known through metropolises such as Shanghai and Tokyo.

Splitting her time between Paris and her native Italy where she goes to recharge – “Paris to me is work” – Chiuri is a confident woman who by acting rather than just talking or obsessively posting on social media has done more to change current fashion than many of her more famous peers.

She says that growing up in a middle-class family she always needed to work and still remembers how as a teenager she had an incredible yearning for a pair of patchwork jeans from a store in Rome that her mother wouldn’t let her buy.

That longing for that hard-to-get item is her first fashion memory she says a strong desire to buy something and wear it – an urge so simple and yet so vital in turning the wheels of this glamorous machine that is fashion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGx0b2RheS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9zdGNoYXJsZXMvd2FudC10by1leHBlcmllbmNlLWZhbGwtY29sb3JzLWhlYWQtbm9ydGgtb24tbWlzc291cmktaGlnaHdheS03OS9hcnRpY2xlXzBlZTA2ZGI0LTQ3MWItNTJlYS04OGMzLTEzYmZhOWY0ODA0MS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Want to experience fall colors? Head north on Missouri Highway 79,"Just when you think you can’t stand one more day of simmering on summer’s griddle fall arrives. Ah fall — so welcome. Of course along with it come shorter days and cooler temperatures. Then before long the trees abandon their summer greens for showier hues and woods become tapestries of vibrant color Missouri is famous for.

It may seem like Mother Nature’s alchemy but science tells us that fewer daylight hours and longer cooler nights work in concert to achieve the change by slowing and eventually stopping production of the chlorophyll in leaves (it’s what keeps them green). The lack of chlorophyll allows other pigments to be revealed: carotinoids that display the yellow orange and brown shades and anthocyanins for the stunning reds and purples.

Missouri is laced with interesting drives and many become technicolor tunnels in fall so there are plenty to choose from for a scenic road trip. One of our favorites is Missouri Highway 79 which begins at Interstate 70 in St. Peters and paralleling the Mississippi River runs north 90 miles ending at Highway 36/Interstate 72 in Hannibal.

Our mid-September trip was too early for much fall color — though the scenery along the route is spectacular any time of year. And within a few weeks there will be color.

For the most part it’s a rural landscape the road bordered by seemingly endless fields of corn and beans and a handful of small towns. But historically important river towns Clarksville and Louisiana in addition to Hannibal are also on the route and offer a variety of attractions. Along the way rolling hills become near-mountains and towering limestone bluffs line the road. Signs direct you to pull-offs for dramatic scenic overlooks.

A few miles north of I-70 the road runs through quaint Winfield. Here County Road N runs east to the river at Lock and Dam 25. In winter it becomes the area’s most popular attraction as eagle enthusiasts gather to watch the dozens of the birds that have fled the frozen north and fish at the dam.

Ahead on Highway 79 County Road M (north of Foley) leads three miles east to BK Leach Memorial Conservation Area our first stop. The conservation area 4300-acres of wetlands marshes and sloughs is home to a variety of marsh birds and other wildlife and also provides food for thousands of migrating waterfowl. In fall it’s richly decorated with acres of bright yellow black-eyed Susans on 6-foot stems (a small parking area amid the flowers offers fine views of distant blue hills to the north).

Antique Clarksville 20 miles ahead on Highway 79 is home to Lock and Dam 24. A viewing platform (handicap accessible) offers an excellent vantage of the dam and placards provide information. One reads that storage space on one 15-barge tow is equal to that of 225 railroad hopper cars or 870 tractor trailers.

Another states that although it’s nearly 28 miles north to tiny Saverton and Lock and Dam 22 there is no Lock and Dam 23. One was planned years ago but the pool created by Lock and Dam 24 made it unnecessary. Thus Lock and Dam 23 “has been lost to history but the numbering stuck.”

The stretch of highway that strings together Clarksville Louisiana and Hannibal is nicknamed “Little Dixie Highway of the Great River Road” and is also a designated National Scenic Byway. As to a reason for the nickname there is some debate. One source says it’s because early settlers were from Kentucky and Tennessee. Another that the numerous Victorian and Italianate mansions in the towns give them a “southern flavor.”

The road there has also been dubbed “Fifty Miles of Art” for the many artists crafters and art galleries in the towns. By chance we met one of the artists in Louisiana. The town also called “Mural City” for its two dozen outdoor murals commemorating historic events is a jewel in the crown of Missouri towns — for a number of reasons.

High on the limestone bluffs along the Mississippi the historic town offers superb views of the river such as those at Riverview Park. On this day workers were building a memorial at the overlook clearly under the direction of a distinguished-looking white-haired gentleman.

Nearby is a bronze bust of John Brooks Henderson (1826-1913) with a placard explaining he was a local teacher lawyer state legislator and a brigadier general in the Union Army. In 1862 he was appointed a U.S. senator and within six weeks “was holding regular meetings with President Lincoln.”

As I was reading it the white-haired gentleman walked over and asked if he could be of help. He introduced himself as John Stoeckley 79 a local artist who said he had designed the bronze as part of the 2018 celebration of Louisiana’s bicentennial. He also designed the memorial in the works.

Henderson he said had helped keep Missouri in the Union and in 1864 wrote the immortal words of the constitutional amendment outlawing slavery that Congress approved a year later (the 13th Amendment).

Other Louisiana attractions include two historic districts and numerous historic homes many of which are on the National Register of Historic Places. Self-guided walking tours are available at the Louisiana Convention and Visitors Bureau.

We’d planned to visit the Louisiana Area Historical Museum but found it closed for renovation. It will reopen according to a sign on the door for the 36th annual Louisiana Colorfest Oct. 15-16.

We’d read that the highest point on the Mississippi 850 feet above sea level is the Pinnacle at Louisiana. But we didn’t know where it was and the first three local people we asked didn’t know anything about it.

But the (closed) museum is in a historic area and nearby Third Street is lined with elegant 19th century homes. There walking we passed a man carrying antiques to a table on the sidewalk. We wondered if he knew how to get to the Pinnacle. He did.

Pinnacle is off Cemetery Road in Louisiana Cemetery he said and gave us directions. Nondescript Cemetery Road — watch carefully or you’ll miss it — runs north several blocks off the quarter-mile stretch where Highways 79 and 54 run together in town. Inside the gates of the cemetery you see two narrow symmetrical roads that arc steeply to the top (limited parking there).

The view from that high-up vantage is one of the most spectacular anywhere. You can see virtually 360 degrees — of the surrounding countryside the town the incredibly huge cemetery that blankets these grassy hills and far below the arcs of the deeply blue river appearing between lushly green banks. It was a pleasantly warm afternoon a gentle breeze was wafting — and oh the view. If there is a more peaceful beautiful place anywhere I can’t imagine what it would be.

At the very top of Pinnacle which you reach on foot is a 10-foot obelisk marking the grave of Lloyd Crow Stark Missouri governor from 1937 to 1941. His family founded Stark Brothers Nursery and Orchards Co. in Louisiana in 1816. It’s been in business ever since. Stark’s monument reads: “We gave the world the golden delicious apple.”

On to lovely Hannibal a town rich with fine historic homes — Victorian Queen Anne Italianate. Along thriving Main Street just one block west of the river ornate 19th century buildings now house dozens of inviting shops and eateries. (We chose at random and recommend Java & Jive “the first coffee shop west of the Mississippi.” The menu is varied and features elegant pastries.)

Nicknamed “America’s Home Town” Hannibal was once a thriving port for steamboats flat boats and pocket steamers. Today it’s popular among tourists with many of its attractions centered around favorite son Samuel Clemens aka Mark Twain. (Mark Twain Museum Mark Twain Cave Cave Hollow Winery Mark Twain Riverboat which offers cruises Plantation Theater for performances by actor Richard Garey of “Mark Twain Himself” and others.)

Born in Florida Missouri in 1835 Twain lived in Hannibal from 1839 until 1853 and set two of the world’s favorite novels — “ The Adventures of Tom Sawyer” (1876) and “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” (1885) — in fictional St. Petersburg but based on Hannibal. Twain died in 1910 and two years later his boyhood home opened for tours.

Nearby Cardiff Hill towers over the north end of Main Street. A lighthouse high on the hill was built in 1935 to “shine a beacon on festivities” at the celebration of Twain’s 100th birthday. Bronze statues of two carefree-looking boys “Tom and Huck” stand at the foot of the hill.

The world of sports has also had its share of ruling powers and though their prominence is much shorter lived the imprint they leave on respective fan-bases keeps the flame of loyal fervor burning for generations. Regardless of athletic discipline individual or franchise one team has resoundingly usurped any other claim to that crown in recent years—Formula 1’s Mercedes-AMG Petronas.

Mercedes-Benz had early success in motorsport with its famed “Silver Arrows” race cars piercing through the competition as early as 1934 and continuing on into the 1950s. But the already storied marque’s success became truly epic when after a hiatus from competition since 1955 it once again entered the premier race series as a constructor in 2010 becoming Mercedes-AMG Petronas two years later. Since 2014 it has won every World Constructors’ Championship through last season. Sure Ferrari has garnered twice as many but it has taken 70 years to get them.

Concurrent with the team’s streak Sir Lewis Hamilton had consecutively earned the World Drivers’ Championship title up until last year when the deciding final race in Abu Dhabi concluded in controversy leaving him equal for now with Michael Schumacher in the title tally.

WATCH

The road this season though has been uncharacteristically bumpy for the three-pointed star as new regulations and specifications resulted in Silver Arrows that have not been on point. A few hours after the last qualifying session for the Italian Grand Prix in Monza Toto Wolff the team’s principal and Ola Källenius the global CEO of Mercedes-Benz sat down with Robb Report to discuss the end of last season their current expectations and what continues to drive the dynasty.

First off walk us through the decision-making process that led to not contesting the Drivers’ Championship last season.

Toto Wolff: Ola and I were 100 percent aligned in our initial reaction of “that didn’t possibly happen; we’re not going to allow this to happen.” We came together in a meeting room with the engineers and a lawyer and discussed the alternatives. The first thing you need to do is protest to appeal the result which we did. And then we looked at all angles and it became pretty clear the same evening that even if we were to win the case they would probably struggle to undo the final result. But we left our options open. It was quite a process because we realized we owed it to Lewis. It was a tough tough decision.

Ola Källenius: Whereas we felt very strongly that we were in the right were we going to unravel the whole world championship? Does that even make sense? If we try to fight them how does that reflect on us? Are we perceived as a sore loser? So we said “okay let’s just be rational about this move on and we fight next season.” It was literally four days after the race when we ultimately made the decision not to uphold the appeal.

Are you satisfied with the changes the FIA made in the aftermath?

Wolff: I think that like everything it can always improve. With any sport there will always be a team that is not happy with the referee and you just need to accept that. I think the FIA learned a lot from that. It was a controversy that was absolutely not necessary. There’s a new race director in place and a new president who is definitely a strong advocate for transparency. These are the positives.

Källenius: The FIA made a genuine effort to understand what happened and changed the structure of running the race. As Toto said in a split second a referee can misjudge the situation. In some sports like American football or now soccer the team has challenges and there’s an instant replay. You can’t do that going 180 mph which means that human judgment in Formula 1 is always going to be there. I don’t think that discussions about calls will ever ultimately go away. But the FIA did do a very genuine analysis and have attempted to improve the governance. And more often than not it works.

As seen with Abu Dhabi and this year’s Dutch Grand Prix the safety car and virtual safety car have had a major bearing on how certain races have ended. In your opinion what if anything needs to be improved with how they are implemented?

Wolff: With the VC [virtual safety car] and also the normal safety car you can be on the receiving end or you can benefit from it. Normally when in the lead of the race you don’t want it because you need to decide whether you stop for new tires and lose position or stay out with the old ones. This was the first race of the year [Dutch Grand Prix] where we were in the lead . . . and the VC comes out. Tough luck.

Källenius: I agree the concept of the virtual safety car is good. It’s a necessary tool to run a safe race and it was applied correctly in the last race. We were just unlucky because we were in the lead—that’s the bottom line.

What were the regulation changes this season that posed the greatest challenge for the team?

Wolff: The mechanical and aerodynamic basis of the car was changed. The cars generate downforce in a very different area than the years before; now they generate downforce through the floor and the regulations constrained very much what we were able to do. It was meant to mix the field up and give the smaller teams a chance to come forward but it actually didn’t change a lot. It’s still the usual suspects in the front middle and rear—except we moved out of position because we got the physics wrong. It was literally deciding on prioritization of a certain area of the car that we got wrong as a team.

How easy is that to remedy as the season progresses?

Wolff: First of all it’s a moving target. We’ve had a few moments this year where we thought “now we understand” but we didn’t. There seems to be a picture developing of where we got it profoundly wrong but it’s inherent in the car design and not something we can change during the season.

Considering the overall success of Mercedes-AMG Petronas what are key components to a winning team?

Wolff: We have the might of the Mercedes company in the background with its huge branding power that attracts the right people and retains our talent. We got Lewis Hamilton on board based on the vision Mercedes had back in the day. And then on the other side we have the flexibility in the long leash that’s been given by Ola and Mercedes to act as a midsize racing team. That combination is one of the very important contributors.

Källenius: But you still have to make it work. When Toto came on board as a partner as an investor and as our new leader of motorsports the first thing he said was that all our facilities are not where they need to be for a championship-winning team. So you have got to put in the infrastructure and that was done. He took the guys that were there assembled a couple of others and then created magic with those people. Other teams have the physical infrastructure as well but you have got to have that group of people that trust each other have the right leadership stay calm and make it happen in any situation of adversity. Those are the ingredients.

Toto what have the team’s uncharacteristic struggles this season taught you on a personal level?

Wolff: We had eight consecutive World Championships and that hasn’t been done in any other sport so we pushed the needle quite far. We knew that one day it was going to be difficult. All of these years we’ve been preaching about our values how we would react when it happens and how we would continue to empower and trust. But when you are in that situation it’s actually different.

Personally I’m actively learning to look at myself from the outside and asking if I’m staying true to what I’ve been preaching all those years. I’m very emotional and there are certain pressures the team feels with me getting involved in many areas. Every day I need to be introspective and ask myself if I’m doing the right thing here. But in the end I need to stay authentic to who I am and what I am. I will be able to write more about what happened this year than all the other eight.

Ola how does your skillset complement that of Toto’s when it comes to the team?

Källenius: In the beginning Toto reminded us that we were sitting on a sport franchise like a Champions League football club in Europe. Whereas Toto has done the heavy lifting and unearthed the value of what this team is those aspects from the corporate side whether it’s working with sponsors or creating business relationships are where I’ve been able to pitch in.

Wolff: Ola runs a multinational company but has a profound understanding of motor racing and Formula 1—he was there before I was. Sometimes when I need to make decisions and I question or doubt I have a sparring partner in Ola. And if I need a second opinion I know I’m going to get a competent answer. That’s important for me.

Do you communicate with each other during races?

Källenius: We do but try not to overdo it. The passion gets the better of me. We have one little group thread an open forum but sometimes I just send a direct message to Toto giving him unsolicited advice that he carefully chooses to ether listen to or not listen to.

Have you been surprised by George Russell’s consistency this season?

Wolff: He was a very very good kid in the Junior Formula. He won his rookie season in F4 his rookie season in F3 his rookie season in F2 and he did a brilliant job at Williams. So we knew about his talent and way of working diligently then realized very early that he can be a world champion. We are not benchmarking him for that directly this year because he’s driving a product that’s not good enough.

When it comes to identifying a rising talent what are some of the intangibles that you look for in a driver?

Wolff: You can clearly see that there is a nature thing—a genetic predisposition and cognitive ability. But it needs to be nurtured. Nature alone doesn’t work. Nurture alone doesn’t work. You have these exceptional talents that come up from time to time . . . [Editor’s note: At this point in the interview Lewis Hamilton walks in unexpectedly]. That’s an exceptional talent [gesturing to Hamilton]. Lewis we were asked what we look for in a driver at the early stage of development.

Hamilton: When you jot it down let me know.

Källenius: The first time I met Lewis was when he was 15 or 16 years old maybe even before that. I remember talking to him briefly and thinking “this guy has it.”

Hamilton: What’s important also is that it takes many people to manifest. You guys told me about that believed it was possible and created the opportunity. Obviously as an individual I was trying to manifest getting to Formula 1 and being at the top but it has taken all of us being connected. Without the support of Mercedes I would not be here today.

Wolff: Determination.

Källenius: Yes determination. Talent alone is not going to get you there.

How do you balance keeping your drivers on that competitive edge while also building camaraderie within the team?

Wolff: Fundamentally teammates are direct competitors. You need to accept that these two will sometimes have diverse objectives. If a driver is intelligent and knows about a long-term future with a team generally they can tame the lion. But there will always be situations where it comes out. You can’t expect a lion in the car and a puppy outside. This is a natural tension or pressure point that’s just part of the job.

Källenius: The first great racer to realize that he needed to beat his teammate was [Juan Manuel] Fangio. He was the first guy that came up with the concept that each driver should have his own mechanics crew as there are two competitions going on—one against everybody else and one against your teammate. That concept from 1954 or thereabout is still true today. You still have two pit crews and two race engineers totally focused on making their guy win. You have to have that tension.

How has the business model of Formula 1 teams and their perceived value changed in recent years?

Källenius: For us the brand building and strong brand messaging is still the core commercial value of what we’re doing here. But Toto had a very strong belief that this needs to be a franchise and have franchise value. I don’t think he would have invested some of his own money if he didn’t think it could yield a return. Here we are 10-plus years later and he proved it. Of course a lot happened to the sport with the growing popularity and Liberty Media’s further expansion into the US which we love. We have now put teams where they can have revenues above their costs—just a small detail if you want to run a business with a financial future. We have a double dividend now; the brand value plus a financial dividend which had been unheard of in Formula 1. It’s a game changer and Toto is one of the leaders that has pulled the whole grid with him.

Wolff: Because the sport is growing from strength to strength our top-line revenue is growing strong. And because of the cost cap that was implemented we have a stable cost base and good visibility of future profits. When McLaren or Ferrari gets a sponsorship pitch I’m actually happy about that because all of us need to grow together.

Do you think the internal combustion engine will always be a part of Formula 1?

Källenius: We talk about this a lot. There’s no doubt we need to go CO2 neutral. It’s not even a discussion. We have made a clear plan for Mercedes as a whole as has the Formula 1 team. We’ve got to decarbonize full stop. But how do you keep the speed and spectacle of the greatest racing series and go zero emission? The energy density of batteries is not yet at the point where you can do that. One day they probably will be but we don’t know when that day is. For 2026 we have decided that the relevance of the electric piece will grow and for combustion Formula 1 will be producing CO2-free fuels.

Wolff: Formula 1’s aim is to be the fastest laboratory in the world and develop a high-performance fuel that’s 100 percent sustainable and available at the pump station for your road car. If we can be pioneers in developing such a fuel and showcase it on the racetrack that is part of the energy transition. In my opinion whenever batteries are in a position where we can properly race with them Formula 1 is probably going to go electric.

Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.

Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

Customer complaints have been piling up regarding the non-settlement of insurance claims by it.

According to its officials the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC) has come to know about a large number of customer complaints that the company has not been settling the claims despite the maturity of their insurance policies.

The regulator suspects there might have been some financial irregularities within the life insurer said a senior BSEC official adding that stock investors had a bad experience with Fareast Life Insurance as its previous directors embezzled most of the company funds.

Mohammad Rezaul Karim executive director and spokesman for the BSEC told The Business Standard ""The inquiry team will review the company's last ten years' financials.""

The Insurance Development and Regulatory Authority (Idra) officials said thousands of insurance policies have matured but the clients did not get any money against their claims.

In recent weeks the insurance regulator has received over a thousand complaints from Progressive Life customers in this regard.

Md Johir Uddin company secretary of Progressive Life is aware of the committee formation. He however declined to comment on what has gone wrong within the firm while talking to The Business Standard.

In its 2019 annual report a statutory auditor informed the users of the company about some non-transparency in the firm's premium income buying disputed properties negative cash flow and huge unpaid claims.

Idra sources citing the company's latest unaudited report said that at the end of 2021 over 40% of insurance claims with Progressive Life remained unsettled while the death claims settlement rate was only 30% at the end of last year.

Headed by BSEC Additional Director Mohammad Delowar Hossain the inquiry panel set up last week will also look into Progressive Life's balance sheets and other elements of its financial statements management and other expenses investments and also if any related party transactions are there before it submits its findings within 30 working days.

Life revenue accounts petty cash balances valuation of life fund contingencies and provisions and unpaid claims of the company would be reviewed.

The committee which includes BSEC deputy directors Md Sirajul Islam and Mawdud Momen as members will also examine all term deposits investments in land and land development property plant and equipment of the company.

In addition the panel will examine the internal control system of the company and its effectiveness in ensuring operational efficiency reliable financial reporting and compliance with laws regulations and policies.

Incorporated in 2000 Progressive Life Insurance Company Limited was listed on the capital market in 2006.

It has been engaged in all kinds of life insurance businesses whether individual or group including pension and health.

The life insurer also operates a micro life insurance business under the name of Sujan Bima Surid Bima Darussalam Bima Progressive Deposit Pension Scheme (DPS) and Progressive Islami Bima Prakalpa.

Since 2019 the company has not been calling any general meetings of its shareholders and over time its financials have been on a declining trend.

According to the unaudited financial report from January to September 2020 its life revenue account decreased by nearly Tk5 crore and the life insurance fund stood at Tk272 crore.

The life fund dipped below Tk250 crore at the end of 2021 said Idra sources.

But it looks as though Selfridge Air National Guard Base (SANG) is once again in the running to become a training center for the F-35 Lightning II fighter jets.

The Department of the Air Force (DAF) issued a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) Tuesday for the beddown of a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Pilot Training Center (PTC) at Ebbing Air National Guard Base (ANGB) in Arkansas or SANG in Harrison Township.

“We continue to work the Air Force on the draft EIS and encourage our community to participate in the hearing” said Brig. Gen. Rolf Mammen 127th Wing commander. “Although we are the alternate location being considered for this Selfridge remains postured and ready for a next generation fighter aircraft to be based here.”

The proposed action would establish a permanent center for up to 36 aircraft including the F-35 and F-16 fighter planes require use of respective fields and airspace military construction projects facilities sustainment restoration and modernizations projects and an increase in personnel. Ebbing ANGB is the preferred alternate site while Selfridge ANGB stands as the second alternate. The number of personnel at each location would increase. Having the new center at SANG however would not require changes to airspace configuration to support the new personnel.

The latest news is yet another opportunity for SANG as local officials have been pining for Lockheed Martin’s state-of-the-art jets for a decade. Since 2013 the base and the communities surrounding the base have supported the idea but other bases have been chosen for the fighter planes.

This past December U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks paid SANG a visit and while she was not there specifically to address the possibility of a pilot training center for the F-35 officials who joined her tour said she was definitely impressed by what she saw which may have contributed to the recent announcement by the DAF.

What do you think?

As part of the process members of the public are invited to view the Draft EIS on the project website at FMSPTICEIS.com and provide any input on the project during a 45-day public comment period and public hearing stage. The hearings will give the public an opportunity to comment on the environmental impacts of the proposed actions presented in the Draft EIS.

The public hearings for SANG will be held on Sept. 28 from 6 to 8 p.m. at a location near the base. There will also be a virtual hearing held on Oct. 5 from 6 to 8 p.m.

Those who wish to participate in the public hearing must register and sign up to provide an oral comment at FMSPTCEIS.com. Pre-registration is required for all meetings to comply with the Secretary of the Air Force COVID mitigation process. Meeting locations links and instructions will be distributed after registering and prior to all public hearings. If unable to pre-register online for a hearing interested participants may all call the public affairs office to register: 586-239-4735.

Comments on the Draft EIS must be submitted to the website or mailed by Oct. 17 2022. Those being sent via the U.S. Post Office go to: FMS PTC EIS Project Manager AFCEC/CZN 2261 Hughes Avenue Suite 155 JBSA Lackland TX 78236-9853. Those being sent by FedEX and UPS go to: FMS PTC EIS Project Manager AFCEC/CZN 3515 S. General McMullen Suite 155 San Antonio TX 78226-2018.

The plaza's anchor store a Big K K-Mart closed in December of 2019 and there have been a rotation of tenants in the adjacent smaller spaces and out buildings. Some of the spaces including the old K-Mart have been used for temporary purposes. Storage for the Maine CDC during the pandemic hosting a concert put on by a local church and the location of a Spirit Halloween store.

The owner of the plaza and developer Patriot Holdings have been working on several uses for the plaza They have also previously presented several of these ideas before the Augusta city council. At one point they were hoping to build a new self storage facility. That plan however was ended because they were unable to get a required zoning change. They have also attempted to entice a construction company to turn the building into apartments. That plan was determined to not be economically feasible.

Google Maps Google Maps loading...

Their latest plan has a lot of people excited.

According to the KJ the latest plan involves turning a portion of the plaza's large parking lot into a green space. A portion of the lot would be used as a dog park the other part of the green space would be used as a park / playground for families.

Considering the amount of residences a short walk (or drive) from the plaza this seems like a great idea.

For the owner and the developer the hope is that adding the parks to the plaza which would bring people (potential customers) to the plaza would make the empty retail spaces more attractive to potential tenants.

The City of Augusta will still need to make a zoning change in order for the plan to move forward. At this time the city council has not weighed in on whether or not they will approve that change.

​As a precautionary measure a state of emergency is in effect for all of Florida. This kicks in price gauging laws. If you suspect price gouging report this information to the Attorney General’s Price Gouging Hotline at 1-866-966-7226.

Price Gouging Frequently Asked Questions

1. What is Price Gouging?

Florida Statute 501.160 states that during a state of emergency it is unlawful to rent sell lease offer to rent sell or lease essential commodities dwelling units or self-storage facilities at an unconscionable price. A price is presumed to be unconscionable if: (1) there is a gross disparity between the price charged during the state of emergency and the average price during the 30 days before the state of emergency or (2) the price grossly exceeds the average price the same or similar commodity was available in the trade area during the 30 days before the declaration of the state of emergency unless the seller can justify the price by showing increases in its costs or market trends. Examples of necessary commodities for storm events are food water ice gas lodging and lumber.

2. How do I know if I’m being price gouged?

The law compares the reported price of the commodity or service during the state of emergency to the average price charged over the 30-day period prior to the declared state of emergency. If there is a gross disparity between the prior price and the current charge it could be considered price gouging.

3. What is covered under the Price Gouging Statute?

The Price Gouging Statute covers lodging and storage facilities and essential commodities necessary for use or consumption as a direct result of the emergency. A “commodity” means any good service material merchandise supplies equipment resources or other article of commerce and includes without limitation food water ice chemicals petroleum products and lumber. Commodities covered under the statute include those rented sold or offered for rent or sale within the area of the declared state of emergency and necessary for consumption or use as a direct result of the emergency. The law also requires those selling goods and services to possess a business tax receipt. Examples of non-essential items are alcoholic beverages and cigarettes.

4. What evidence do I need to help enforce the Price Gouging Statute?

If you suspect price gouging obtain as much information as possible in the form of photographs of signs displaying the price receipts estimates reservation numbers and prices invoices or bills. Include as much information as possible including the product name size or quantity manufacturer item number and unit price. For lumber products note the grade thickness and quality. If it is gasoline note the grade of gas and price per gallon. If it is a service such as storage or towing note the per-mile (or other distance) charge removal charges per-day storage charges and other charges such as security clean up or other “add-ons.” Report this information to the Attorney General’s Price Gouging Hotline at 1-866-966-7226.

It’s bad for nonfungible tokens (NFTs). It gives critics ammo and distracts from the technology which is where the real value lies.

For those on the outside looking in NFTs are nothing more than overpriced monkey JPEGs — or whichever choice of animated animal profile picture is in the firing line.

NFTs of course are much more than that.

But because of Bored Apes and the countless imitations they’ve spawned NFTs are getting a bad rep. “Bubble” “money laundering” and “scams” are all terminology associated by critics with the new “Beanie Babies craze.”

It’s a disparaging distraction.

Yes Bored Apes are still priced at more than $100000 (a fifth of what they were worth at the market’s peak). But they’re tied to the tumult of cryptocurrency volatility and market sentiment which has fallen along with the tumbling crypto market.

You also have Ape-backed borrowers on the verge of liquidation and 143 Apes already stolen including Seth Green’s Bored Ape which he was forced to pay to get back. And of course there are also the fans who slammed Eminem and Snoop Dogg when they performed as their Apes at the latest MTA Video Music Awards.

Bored Apes are the face of the NFT hype cycle. They might be the closest thing to the aforementioned Beanie Babies in the NFT space because of their status. But there’s a categorical mistake in painting an entire industry with the same brush: The hype is not the technology.

If you look past what’s on the market you’ll find unique ideas with real-world value.

Here’s one: carrying medical data. Researchers at Baylor College of Medicine have suggested that NFT ownership powered by smart contracts could provide citizens control of who accesses their personal health records. Citizens already give up their information to medical applications but smart contracts could allow them to sell their data as NFTs if they choose.

Hospitals and private institutions routinely sell patients’ data via so-called data brokers to companies like Pfizer — it’s a multibillion-dollar industry. This might seem harmless but you never agreed to it. Maybe you wouldn’t have if you knew how much your data was worth.

Selling or securing your data as an NFT could become a real option as long as the right hack-prevention measures are in place. Adding encryption to NFTs can keep content private while also enabling it to remain in public storage.

Another service NFTs can perform: streamlining royalty payments. Artist resale royalty rights haven’t been codified into U.S. law only proposed. The EIP-2981 royalty standard made this a coding choice on Ethereum leading the way for Polygon and other chains.

With enhanced security and the versatility of NFTs private documents can be airdropped into users’ wallets. These could be legal documents served by law firms or deeds to properties. Hypothetically we could see a work contract on the blockchain which interfaces with decentralized finance payment protocols to provide salaries based on duties completed.

Despite the endless cries of “wen utility” that have echoed through NFT communities the utility was always there: A token on the blockchain is verified that promises interoperability via a self-executing hard-coded agreement. It’s the gateway to digital and physical real estate and on-chain gaming experiences or whatever content your digital identity unlocks.

It’s still growing. On trading platform NFTGo 10x more Ethereum wallets hold an NFT compared with August 2020. Doodles just raised $54 million to strengthen its intellectual property. Creators are building and many skilled underground artists are making more now than ever before.

NFT art has flipped the traditional art industry on its head — not just because of the headline-grabbing numbers but also the promise of provenance. Even if profile pictures stole the show the technology came first and will thrive without its Bored Ape counterparts.

It might also be better to leave the term “NFTs” in the past as a genre only defined by a limited boom-and-bust cycle and to move forward with “digital collectible” a term that some have started using.

Some kind of split is inevitable — and healthy — to free builders from the burden of overinflated expectations market collapses and celebrity cash grabs.

If you still don’t see the value you might still have Bored Ape goggles. Take them off. There’s a whole suite of NFT technology use cases on the rise.

Earlier this year the tech giant announced a partnership with six HBCUs who would be provided with free access to coursework lectures immersive training experiences certifications IBM Cloud-hosted software and professional development resources.

IBM develops a customized cybersecurity curriculum for each school and offers students as well as professors access to simulated cyberattacks through IBM Security's Command Center.

Programs at North Carolina A&T State University Southern University System Clark Atlanta University Xavier University of Louisiana Morgan State University South Carolina State University began in May.

An IBM spokesperson said students and professors from the first six schools have already participated in cyberattack simulation training exercises security expert lectures and workshops.

The new slate of schools — which include Alabama A&M University Tuskegee University Vorhees University and others — will have immediate access to the coursework training curriculum and certifications.

“These are universities IBM has long worked with and we have confidence in the school’s commitment and execution on this multi-year collaboration. HBCUs make excellent collaborators for preparing students for tech-related careers” the spokesperson said tying the program to a larger effort to train more than 150000 people in cybersecurity over the next three years. In all there are more than 100 HBCUs nationwide.

Alcorn State University president Dr. Felecia Nave said the initiative was an important step as Mississippi seeks to fill a cybersecurity expertise gap that is leaving businesses in the state at risk.

CyberSeek — a project supported by the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) a program of the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the U.S. Department of Commerce — estimated last November that the U.S. cybersecurity workforce has more than 950000 positions with nearly half of them unfilled.

According to CyberSeek the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects “information security analyst” to be the 10th fastest growing occupation over the next decade.

“The need for highly trained workers in the cybersecurity field has never been more clear and this partnership with IBM will help ensure that West Virginia State University will be at the forefront of addressing this critical need both in West Virginia and throughout the nation” said Ericke Cage president of West Virginia State University.

The programs may also help the schools themselves as HBCU’s have been targeted in recent months by ransomware groups and other cybercriminals. Howard University canceled classes last September after announcing a ransomware attack and North Carolina A&T University was attacked in April.

IBM staff visited the campus of South Carolina State University in July for a series of workshops to help students and professors with the company's security software. In addition to being the only public HBCU to offer a standalone degree in cybersecurity the university is the only such school to be an NSA-designated National Center of Academic Excellence.

Jordan Brown age 22 is one of the beneficiaries of IBM's program. He graduated from SC State in May with a degree in computer science but he stayed on this fall to be one of the first students to complete a bachelor’s degree in cybersecurity at the school.

“The software and courses that IBM have brought to SC State has helped both my academic and professional career tremendously” Brown said. “IBM offers modules that break down subjects that are usually too hard to understand studying independently into interactive projects and real-world situations that relate the information to what we may experience after college.”

Two weeks ago the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) announced a partnership with the nonprofit National Cybersecurity Alliance to create a new cybersecurity program at the HBCUs Prairie View A&M Southern University St. Philip's College and Texas Southern University.

From brand new phones seemingly every day to brand new cars with brand new features…you get the point. All these innovations are more and more interconnected and Qualcomm is one of the companies enabling that.

Qualcomm is the world’s “leading wireless tech innovator” and a top player in the semiconductor space powering 29% of the smartphones on the market in Q2 2022. Even though it’s a top dog in the mobile space in recent years the company has managed to diversify its business beyond mobile devices wearables and connectivity solutions.“The Snapdragon Digital Chassis combined with our relationships with automakers has resulted in a $30 billion design-win pipeline” the company recently stated. Not too bad considering it was operating at a loss in the 90s. But back to those automakers…In order to equip its vehicles with the latest and greatest digital capabilities Mercedes-Benz will work with Qualcomm to leverage the chip maker’s “Digital Chassis” solutions. (Back in January Honda Renault and Volvo did the same thing followed by Stellantis in April.) Mercedes will make use of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Cockpit Platforms for its digital cockpits as well as the Snapdragon Automotive Connectivity Platforms for its telematics systems in future vehicles.For now Qualcomm’s Digital Chassis is the only open scalable and upgradeable platform for new vehicles so it’s no wonder so many carmakers are adopting it.“Our strong relationship is vital to guiding the automotive industry through a time of exceptional growth and technological disruption” said Magnus Ostberg chief software officer of Mercedes-Benz AG about the company’s collaboration with Qualcomm.Since virtually every new car has at least some digital elements these days it’s safe to say that the chipmaker will probably continue stacking on many more collaborations in the automotive space.

Recently it was revealed that Mercedes-Benz is now joining other automakers like BMW Volkswagen Hyundai Renault Volvo and Stellantis in adopting the company’s new Snapdragon platform for vehicles.

According to a report from Automotive News Mercedes is looking to integrate the new Qualcomm Snapdragon automobile platform in powering its vehicles’ digital cockpits and telematics system. Through the partnership the California-based tech giant will provide new AI and computing solutions to the German automaker’s products. It will also include a series of performance- and safety-related upgrades to the luxury brand’s next generation of vehicles.

Based on Qualcomm’s description the new Snapdragon Digital Chassis offers a full suite of scalable cloud-connected automotive platforms for telematics and connectivity computing and driving assistance systems and autonomy. With new technological innovations and on-demand digital services it enables automakers to create intelligent and interconnected experiences that are safer highly customizable and immersive. In particular the platform opens up vehicles to enhanced connectivity brought about by 5G C-V2X (Cellular vehicle-to-everything) Wi-Fi Bluetooth and precise positioning service (PPS) technologies.

Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon stated that the new partnership gives Mercedes access to their automotive design-win pipeline worth $30 billion. In addition it benefits from the tech company’s other partnership with open-source provider Red Hat which utilizes Linux-based operating systems (OS) for next-generation vehicles.

Sign up for our amNewYork email newsletter to get news updates and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!

Kadarius Toney is trending in the wrong direction for Monday night’s Giants showdown with the Dallas Cowboys. Toney had been listed on the team injury report and the receiver did not practice on Saturday.

All of that is lining up for Toney to likely miss Monday’s game at MetLife Stadium after the team listed him as doubtful. The wideout had been dealing with a hamstring issue but the decision about his status had yet to be decided when head coach Brian Daboll spoke with reporters before practice at Quest Diagnostics Training Center.

“We’ll reconvene like we normally do after practice and sit down with (senior vice president medical services/head athletic trainer) Ronnie (Barnes) and the medical staff. We usually do that Friday after practice when we make our final decisions on the injury report” Daboll said.

There has been plenty of focus on Toney and the limited usage the Giants have given him. Toney has been on the field for just 33 snaps in the first two games of the year and has just four touches for 23 yards.

Though after last week it was Kenny Golladay who had been getting a lot of the focus after he played just two snaps in the win over the Carolina Panthers.

While it’s unlikely that Toney does play Daboll did say that he was comfortable making the final call so close to game time.

“I think anybody that’s injured we try if we think maybe there’s a chance maybe there’s not a chance” he said. “Again those discussions happen after this practice after they go through some rehab sessions or light work on the practice field. And if they can’t go they can’t go. But (we) try to hold out hope as long as we can to see if those guys can go.”

And asked if he was comfortable with a guy playing after missing so much practice time during the week that was more on a case by case basis.

“Yeah it’s usually tough. I think it’s case-by-case. That’s how we’ll take this one” Daboll said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Brady and the Bucs lost 14-12 to the Green Bay Packers for their first loss of the season but the focus of many fans was off the field to see if his wife Gisele Bündchen would be present at Raymond James Stadium which did not happen and fueled the suspicion that the famous couple's reconciliation is unlikely.

Are Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen on the brink of the divorce?

Jack Benjamin and Vivian Brady were at the Raymond James Stadium

The Brazilian top model was not present however TB12 was not alone he received the tender visit of his three children Jack (15 years old) Benjamin (12 years old) and Vivian (9 years old) the first of them product of his past relationship with Bridget Moynahan and the other two he has had with Gisele Bündchen.

According to a report by People Magazine the three children of the seven-time Super Bowl winner were brought to the Buccaneers' home by TB12's mother and sisters who were also in attendance to support their son/brother.

Is Brady and Bündchen's reconciliation becoming more and more remote?

According to a report from Page Six Brady had hoped that Bündchen would attend the game so the disappointment may have been great although surely being able to hug his three children was a nice moment for the former New England Patriots player's current situation.

Brady and Bündchen have been married since 2009 however they live moments of tension since the Brazilian top model did not agree with the quarterback's decision to regret retiring after 22 seasons in the NFL.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy90b20tYnJhZHktc2VuZHMtcmVtaW5kZXItbmZsLWJlZm9yZS1nYW1lLXZzLXBhY2tlcnPSAVZodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3huZXdzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvdG9tLWJyYWR5LXNlbmRzLXJlbWluZGVyLW5mbC1iZWZvcmUtZ2FtZS12cy1wYWNrZXJzLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tom Brady sends reminder to NFL before game vs Packers,"Tom Brady appeared to make a fashion statement ahead of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ Week 3 game against the Green Bay Packers.

""Greatness lasts forever"" the message read.

Two of the NFL’s greats will match up in the game. Brady will go head-to-head against Aaron Rodgers the two-time NFL MVP who is taking snaps for the Green Bay Packers.

Brady had kind words for Rodgers in the days leading up to the game.

TOM BRADY AARON RODGERS READY FOR EPIC REGULAR-SEASON BATTLE

""He's an amazing player has been for a long time. I love watching him play and he's from California too so I feel like we always have a little bit of a connection. He's an older guy now. He's been a great player in the same place for a long time"" Brady said.

""There definitely are some challenges with that but he's navigated them pretty well and has done a great job leads the team. They've won a lot of games since he's been there. And I knew Brett [Favre] pretty well; with those two guys are two pretty great quarterbacks for a long period of time in one place.""

Co. Ltd. is announcing the new VERTEX Series of power supplies developed and constructed to power new PC components demanding the new ATX 3.0 and PCIe 5.0 standards seen in most next-gen systems.

SEASONIC officially launches Vertex series PSUs consistent with ATX 3.0 and PCIe 5.0 standards

The PSU has a significant function in new computer systems. After NVIDIA's September announcement about releasing the new GeForce RTX 4090 graphics cards Seasonic evolved into a new generation of power supplies. The company's most unique PSU designs should resolve problems such as VGA excursion power and cable integrity (now with high-grade 12VHPWR connectors).

Seasonic's new Vertex PSU offers ATX 3.0 and PCIe 5.0 standards to new systems. Image source: Seasonic.

ATX 3.0 is the most notable update in the long-running Advanced Technology eXtended (ATX) standard launched by Intel in 1995. Newer PCIe standards significantly boost bandwidth connection to GPUs SSDs and other computer peripherals. For instance Intel's 12th Gen Core systems added support for PCIe 5.0 while the company's previous 11th Gen systems added support for PCIe 4.0. However all generations of PCIe are backward compatible so there is no reason not to upgrade.

The new VERTEX Series PSUs will provide 1200 W / 1000 W / 850 W and 750 Watts of true power in both Platinum and Gold levels of efficiency with all the finest attributes you can expect from a Seasonic power supply unit such as:

I really thought we'd see NVIDIA unveil its next-gen GeForce RTX 40 series graphics cards and the new Ada Lovelace GPU architecture sporting an also next-gen display connectivity: DisplayPort 2.0 aka DP2.0 but nope.

NVIDIA's huge GeForce RTX 40 series GPU reveal came and went and after it all happened one of the biggest disappointments was the lack of DisplayPort 2.0 connectivity. We've had DisplayPort 1.4 connectors forever now and while HDMI 2.1 has joined the party that's really for big high refresh rate TVs (HDMI 2.1 is capable of 4K120).

But DisplayPort 2.0 is the future... people using GeForce RTX 4090s and GeForce RTX 4080s and other GeForce RTX 40 series graphics cards in 2023 2024 and 2025... all without DP2.0 connectivity. So DP2.0 starts taking off in 2023 more prevalent in 2024 and 2025 yet the biggest quantum leap in GPUs doesn't have the very latest display standard in the tail end of 2022 which sucks.

DP2.0 is a huge upgrade over DP1.4 and DP1.4 + DSC (Display Stream Compression) where the new DisplayPort 2.0 connector is capable of 8K 120Hz and 4K 240Hz over a single cable. This blows away HDMI 2.1 and the fun gets even better when you think about there's not just a single port for DisplayPort on the back of modern graphics cards but rather enough room for 3 monitors powered by DisplayPort.

If the next-gen GeForce RTX 40 series GPUs had DP2.0 support we'd have 3 x DP2.0 ports that were each capable of 8K120 and 4K240. This would mean your display connectivity is pretty darn future-proof because it'll be years yet (and many generations) before we're gaming higher than that (8K240 and 4K480).

It's disappointing to say the least to see NVIDIA launching such an absolute monster of silicon in the new GeForce RTX 40 series GPUs -- especially that tasty new GeForce RTX 4090 -- without DisplayPort 2.0 connectivity. I'm a huge GPU enthusiast but I also love display technology.

I run most of the displays in my lab through DP1.4 while using HDMI 2.1 for my OLED TV (because it's 4K120-capable and it only has HDMI 2.1 connectors). DisplayPort 2.0 would've been a match made in heaven: a next-gen GPU capable of at least driving 8K120 and 4K240 (especially so with DLSS 3 support on Ada Lovelace). But nope.

The kicker?

Intel's not-even-bloody-out-yet Arc GPUs have DisplayPort 2.0 connectivity meanwhile 75.3 billion transistors worth of silicon and DP2.0 can't join the party.

What's Next?,"In a move that few saw coming the only real estate investment trust in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio has agreed to be acquired.

In a surprising move earlier this month the real estate investment trust (REIT) STORE Capital (STOR) announced that it had agreed to be acquired by the large real estate company GIC and Oak Street a division of Blue Owl Capital. The deal values STORE at $14 billion and will pay shareholders $32.25 per share in cash which is a more-than-20% premium over what STORE traded at after market close on Sept. 14.

STORE Capital is the only REIT in the large equities portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway the conglomerate run by the legendary investor Warren Buffett. Berkshire owns slightly less than 7 million shares of STORE which accounts for just 0.1% of the portfolio.

While one might think that shareholders would be happy to see a 20% premium STORE's stock is still below pre-pandemic levels even after the post-announcement pop and is only up about 24.4% over the last five years. What will Buffett and other shareholders do next?

Is it a good deal?

STORE's single-tenant operator model involves purchasing properties from business owners and then turning around and renting those properties back to those owners under triple net-lease plans. The businesses are then responsible for maintenance and covering expenses such as property taxes and insurance.

This model relieves STORE from serving in the tedious landlord role but is also beneficial for business owners looking for an alternative to buying a property outright and potentially taking on a lot of debt or renting.

It's hard to say that STORE hasn't performed well since going public back in 2014. The REIT's adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) have increased at a nearly 6% compound annual growth rate since its IPO. Furthermore management this year guided for AFFO per share to grow between 9.8% and 10.7% from 2021. STORE has also consistently raised its dividend every year and currently pays out a very healthy 4.85% yield.

Given that STORE has traded at higher valuations in the past it probably is fair for shareholders to be disappointed in the deal considering the success the REIT has previously had. On the flip side management may be doing what it believes is best to get ahead of a much more difficult environment with inflation remaining stubbornly high right now and many investors expecting some kind of more severe recession in 2023.

What's next?

There is still some hope for shareholders that a better deal might emerge because the acquisition agreement includes a 30-day ""go-shop"" period that lasts until Oct. 15.

This means STORE can actively go out and try to find a better deal. While I'm sure STORE's management team considered all of the options available before accepting this buyout offer having a price in place can help to establish a new market.

Perhaps even Buffett and Berkshire will get interested. While an immediate 20% gain is nice REIT investors will lose out on future streams of income from dividends and as mentioned above STORE has done a good job of growing the business.

Berkshire has also been quite active on the buying front this year although it's hard to imagine that it wouldn't have had a chance to bid on STORE given its position as a large shareholder. Berkshire did invest in STORE in 2017 during a year in which the latter's stock price only got as high as $26 so Buffett and Berkshire could call it quits and still come out ahead.

The best thing shareholders can likely do right now is sit tight and hope a better offer finds its way onto the table. If it doesn't then there are other REITs that shareholders could buy that can provide similar value such as Realty Income.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9uZXdzL2luZGlhL3JlYWx0eS1wb3J0YWwtaG91c2luZy1jb20tdG8taGlyZS1hYm91dC0yMDAtcGVvcGxlLXRoaXMtZmlzY2FsLTExNjY0MDkyMTkwMzgxLmh0bWzSAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vbmV3cy9pbmRpYS9yZWFsdHktcG9ydGFsLWhvdXNpbmctY29tLXRvLWhpcmUtYWJvdXQtMjAwLXBlb3BsZS10aGlzLWZpc2NhbC9hbXAtMTE2NjQwOTIxOTAzODEuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Realty portal Housing.com to hire about 200 people this fiscal | Mint,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9uZXdzL2luZGlhL3JlYWx0eS1wb3J0YWwtaG91c2luZy1jb20tdG8taGlyZS1hYm91dC0yMDAtcGVvcGxlLXRoaXMtZmlzY2FsLTExNjY0MDkyMTkwMzgxLmh0bWzSAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vbmV3cy9pbmRpYS9yZWFsdHktcG9ydGFsLWhvdXNpbmctY29tLXRvLWhpcmUtYWJvdXQtMjAwLXBlb3BsZS10aGlzLWZpc2NhbC9hbXAtMTE2NjQwOTIxOTAzODEuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673E566A10>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Overall coordination of these disparate groups is carried out by the Supreme National Security Council headed by the Supreme Leader the President the Interior Minister commanders of the above-mentioned organizations and the heads of Iran’s legislature and judiciary. It is this group that decides what to do when protests break out in Iran.

Each Iranian province has its own Security Council. Members include the provincial governor his deputies and representatives of the IRGC and the local police and intelligence bureau. These councils are responsible for managing provincial security issues including protests. They are also in charge of implementing nationwide crackdowns on the ground.

Generally the first group to engage protesters will be the riot police known as “special units” in Iran alongside the Basij and the IRGC. The IRGC-IO and the Intelligence Ministry usually have the joint task of identifying and arresting individuals placing activists under house arrest and intimidating the free media.

The National Police: The First Line of Offence

During the recent protests sparked by the murder of Mahsa Amini the police and plainclothes officers have been most prominently seen in the streets. This has varied from place to place however: in Kurdistan which is constantly monitored by the so-called “security” services the IRGC and the military have been more visible.

As riot police commander General Hassan Karami put it: “When the police stations [ordinary police officers] and other forces can no longer control the situation... and unrest spreads then the special units are tasked with stepping into action.”

Riot police in Iran be identified by their black or brindled uniforms helmets and masks and also by the high chassis of their motorcycles.

In 2011 acting commander General Asadollah Hadinejad reported that riot police units were permanently stationed in the capitals of 30 Iranian provinces. Force members he said had to be at least 175cm tall and would be equipped with batons teargas guns teargas grenades pepper spray and “other items”.

Riot police are not supposed to shoot directly at protesters and are told to disperse them using only batons and teargas. But since 2017-18 they have been seen more and more frequently opening fire on civilians with both rubber bullets and live ammunition. Around 1500 people are believed to have been shot dead by riot police and other security forces in Iran’s November 2019 protests. As of now at least 70 people are thought to have died from shots fired at demonstrators this month.

In April 2021 the European Union added General Hassan Karami commander of the special units to its sanctions list. General Hossein Ashtari commander of the National Police is also sanctioned by the US.

One of the differences between the 2022 protests and previous waves of mass demonstrations in Iran is that they come after a change of structure in the national police. Formerly known as the Law Enforcement Force of the Islamic Republic of Iran (NAJA) the police have now been re-titled Law Enforcement Command of the Islamic Republic of Iran (FARAJA) and granted more power and facilities. The new FARAJA Intelligence Organization is the outcome. The body works with the IRGC-IO and Intelligence Ministry to gather information about protesters.

The Women’s Special Units

Mehr News Agency recently shared a video that indicated female riot police had been deployed for the first time to break up the current protests. Last year General Karami had reported such units would be formed in Tehran and nine other provinces.

The Basij and the IRGC

Each Iranian province has its own IRGC branch whose commander is appointed by the chief commander of the Revolutionary Guards. The paramilitary Basij act under the local IRGC’s supervision.

In each province Basij forces are organized in battalions to take part in violent crackdowns on protesters. Every year Basiji forces go through several rounds of training some military and some “political”. The political training is meant to motivate them to fight against protesters.

Usually during small protests in single cities the IRGC and the Basij do not take part in suppression operations. But when a revolt spreads to multiple cities they are called on very early on.

Plainclothes Agents

At most protests in Iranian cities individuals without a uniform will be present beating people and taking them away. These plainclothesmen are generally believed to be Basijis but they can also hail from the Intelligence Ministry the IRGC and the police.

Their mission is often to gather intelligence rather than arresting people. But there are also some other plainclothesmen belong to vigilante groups such as Ansar-e Hezbollah which has been active since the 1990s in attacking gatherings of political groups especially those who do not support Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Some of the plainclothesmen who participate in cracking down on protests are known in Iran as “thugs” hired convicted criminals. In November 2019 groups of “thugs” were dispatched into the crowds to stir people up smash windows set fire to banks and incite riots – thus giving other forces a pretext on which to open fire.

According to General Hossein Hamedani a senior IRGC commander “thugs” have been used to deal with protests since 2009. “We had identified and monitored 5000 violent criminals and firstly ordered all of them to stay at home when there was any protest” he said in 2019. “But later I thought: why not employ these thugs? So I organized them in three regiments to engage with the protesters on our behalf. They proved me right ... if we want to train mujahids (fighters) we need these types of violent people who are not afraid of a few drops of blood.”

The IRGC’s Sarollah Headquarters and the Military

The IRGC’s Sarollah Headquarters in Tehran is known as the Islamic Republic’s principal hub of suppression. It is led by the commander-in-chief of the IRGC sometimes with an appointee to manage it day-to-day. During protests the IRGC’s local branches in Tehran and Alborz act under its direction.

When protests spread across the country however it is the Sarollah Headquarters that takes over. If the situation is critical the Headquarters sends in special troops of IRGC forces who are much better trained than the Basij.

In normal conditions IRGC and Iranian Army ground forces play no role in dispersing protests but may be called in if things escalate. The army tends to protect government buildings and other sensitive locations freeing up police to engage with protesters. In border provinces like Khuzestan they may also take part in direct confrontations.

Detention Centers and Forced Confessions

Detained protesters are often tortured and/or made to “confess” to fabricated crimes on Iranian state television. These scripted confessions are usually extracted by security agents who provide the recordings to Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting and other media outlets.

When protests are ongoing arrested parties are often taken to unmarked detention centers rather than police stations or prison. They might remain in custody there or be released on a heavy bail. Arrest orders – when the arrests are not simply random – are nominally issued by judges but in reality this task is generally taken over by the security apparatus.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdvdi5wbC93ZWIvc291dGhhZnJpY2EvcHJlc2VudGF0aW9uLW9mLXRoZS1leGhpYml0aW9uLW1vbS1pLWRvbnQtd2FudC13YXItaW4tcHJldG9yaWHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Presentation of the exhibition ""Mom I don't want war"" in Pretoria - Poland in South Africa","The event attracted many audiences including the citizens of Pretoria representatives of the diplomatic corps artistic and academic circles and the Polish and Ukrainian diaspora.

It’s time for price controls,"On Wednesday policymakers at the Federal Reserve – America’s central bank – continued their battle against inflation with a third straight supersize interest-rate increase. And they warned that they’re not done. They’ll continue to raise borrowing costs until inflation is tamed.

They assume that the underlying economic problem is a tight labor market causing wages to rise – and prices to rise in response. And they believe interest rate increases are necessary to slow this wage-price inflation.

This is dead wrong.

Wage increases have not even kept up with inflation. Most workers’ paychecks are shrinking in terms of real purchasing power. Rather than causing inflation wages are actually reducing inflationary pressures.

The underlying economic problem is profit-price inflation. It’s caused by corporations raising their prices above their increasing costs.

Corporations are using those increasing costs – of materials components and labor – as excuses to increase their prices even higher resulting in bigger profits. This is why corporate profits are close to levels not seen in over half a century.

Corporations have the power to raise prices without losing customers because they face so little competition. Since the 1980s two-thirds of all American industries have become more concentrated.

Why are grocery prices through the roof? Because just four companies control 85% of meat and poultry processing. Just one corporation sets the price for most of the nation’s seed corn. And two giant firms dominate consumer staples.

All are raising prices and increasing profits because they can.

Big pharma comprising five giants is causing drug prices to soar.

The airline industry has gone from 12 carriers in 1980 to just four today all rapidly raising ticket prices.

Wall Street has consolidated into five giant banks raking in record profits on the spreads between the interest they pay on deposits and what they charge on loans.

Broadband is dominated by three giant cable companies all raising their prices.

Automobile dealers are enjoying record profits as they raise the retail prices of automobiles.

Gas prices have started to drop but big oil still has the power to raise prices at the pump far higher than the costs of crude.

And so on.

This is why Congress and the administration need to take direct action against profit-price inflation rather than rely solely on the Fed to raise interest rates and put the burden of fighting inflation on average working people who are not responsible for it.

Bold antitrust enforcement is essential. Even the credible threat of antitrust enforcement can deter corporations from raising prices higher than their costs.

A windfall profits tax could also be helpful. This would be a temporary tax on price increases exceeding the producer price index’s costs of producing consumer goods.

Price controls should be a backstop. The current inflation emerging from the pandemic is analogous to the inflation after the second world war when economists advocated temporary price controls to buy time to overcome supply bottlenecks and prevent corporate profiteering.

Limited price controls should be considered now for the same reasons.

The inflation we are now experiencing is not due to wage gains from excessive worker power. It is due to profit gains from excessive corporate power.

It’s profits not wages that need to be controlled.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3J0aGplcnNleS5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL2hpZ2gtc2Nob29sL2Zvb3RiYWxsLzIwMjIvMDkvMjQvcmFtc2V5LW5qLWZvb3RiYWxsLXJvbGxzLXBhc3QtcmlkZ2VmaWVsZC1wYXJrLWluLWhpZ2gtcG93ZXJlZC1zaG93ZG93bi82OTUwNzQyMzAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ramsey football rolls past Ridgefield Park in high-powered divisional showdown,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.northjersey.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /story/sports/high-school/football/2022/09/24/ramsey-nj-football-rolls-past-ridgefield-park-in-high-powered-showdown/69507423007/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000026742258E80>, 'Connection to www.northjersey.com timed out.

NASHVILLE Tenn. (AP) — Ryan Tannehill threw for 264 yards and a touchdown and ran for another score and the Tennessee Titans never trailed Sunday holding off the Las Vegas Raiders 24-22 for their first victory this season.

Derrick Henry also ran for 85 yards and a touchdown. Henry also added 58 yards more receiving as the Titans (1-2) avoided their worst start since 2009 when they lost the first six games that season.

The Raiders (0-3) are off to their worst start since 2018. A week after blowing a 20-point lead in losing to Arizona in overtime the Raiders had every chance to get back in this game in the second half as they blanked Tennessee after halftime.

Two-time All-Pro safety Kevin Byard celebrated his 100th regular-season game by picking off a Derek Carr pass in the end zone with 9:22 left.

Kristian Fulton broke up a pass to Raiders receiver Mack Collins in the end zone with 3:33 left.

Trailing 24-16 the Raiders converted a fourth-and-15 and a fourth-and-10 to keep their final drive alive. Carr then hit Mack Hollins with a 9-yard TD pass on fourth-and-goal from the Titans 9. But Carr’s 2-point conversion pass to tie the game was broken up by linebacker Dylan Cole.

Austin Hooper then recovered the onside kick for Tennessee which knelt down for the win.

Carr was 26 of 44 for 303 yards and two touchdowns. Hollins finished with eight catches for 158 yards and five-time Pro Bowl wide receiver Davante Adams was held to five catches and 36 yards with a TD.

Coach Mike Vrabel said the Titans would get back to their bread and butter on offense. They made sure their two-time NFL rushing champ touched the ball six times on a 12-play drive to open the game. Henry ran four times for 16 yards including 19 on back-to-back carries. He also had two catches for 26 yards.

The Titans also got the ball to some of their other top players. As a result they scored touchdowns on each of their first three possessions with drives of at least 75 yards for just the third time since 2000 and led 24-10 at halftime.

It also was the first time the Raiders allowed three straight such TDs since a 44-7 loss to the New York Giants on Oct. 11 2009.

The Raiders tried switching gears in the third quarter. But they had to settle for a second field goal by Daniel Carlson this a 32-yarder after using up 8:03 of the third. Even after safety Duron Harmon picked off the pass and returned it 11 yards to the Titans 31 the Raiders wound up punting.

A holding call on right tackle Jermaine Eluemunor wiped out a 29-yard pass by Carr to Darren Waller. Adams couldn’t get both feet down on a catch then they were flagged for delay backing them up even more. Carr’s pass to Brandon Bolden was stopped for a 2-yard loss.

INJURIES

Raiders cornerback Rock Ya-Sin went down on Tannehill’s 41-yard pass to Robert Woods that set up Henry’s first TD. Ya-Sin returned quickly but went down again in the fourth quarter. Raiders cornerback Nate Hobbs was evaluated for a concussion.

Titans linebacker Zach Cunningham who was on the injury report with an injured knee went straight to the locker room with an injured elbow in the third quarter. Titans cornerback Kristian Fulton went down with 1:22 left.

The cruise line industry has seen some unprecedented twists and turns over the last few years but it's started to rebound now that pandemic-related headwinds have lessened. Carnival (CCL 1.63%) and Royal Caribbean (RCL 0.99%) are two of the biggest players in the space and investors might be wondering which of these companies is the better investment now that trip demand is rebounding.

Read on to see why two Motley Fool contributors have very different takes on the question of whether Carnival or Royal Caribbean is the better buy.

Resiliency is key

George Budwell: Carnival's management painted a fairly optimistic picture about its ongoing recovery efforts from the COVID-19 pandemic when it reported 2022 second-quarter earnings back in June. During the three-month period cash from operations turned positive revenue rose by a healthy 50% from the prior quarter and booking rates on Carnival's leisure cruises were up substantially quarter over quarter.

Best of all Carnival was sailing into the busiest part of the year for the industry -- the third quarter. Even so Carnival's stock is still trading near its pandemic low. The cruise ship's equity in fact isn't far removed from its 52-week low right now.

Why are investors not buying into this turnaround story? The culprit behind Carnival's failure to launch so to speak on its overall positive Q2 report is the weakening global macroeconomic environment. Inflation is stubbornly high interest rates are on the rise and global supply chains are far from peak operating efficiency. In short Wall Street is concerned that these macroeconomic headwinds will spill over into the leisure cruising industry in the form of lower bookings and shrinking revenues in 2023. Unfortunately this key risk factor is hard to ignore given the stark warning signs that the U.S. and European economies are indeed headed for a slowdown.

Does this mean that investors ought to avoid cruise stocks altogether? Quite the contrary. The bottom line is that Carnival is the largest operator in the space and it has the liquidity necessary ($8.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents at last count) to push through yet another hardship. So if you're looking for a value stock that could double or triple in value within the next two to three years Carnival should definitely be on your list. That being said investors will probably want to slowly build a position in this beaten-down cruise ship stock over the next six to 12 months as the company works through these ongoing challenges.

Royal Caribbean has been less dilutive and has less debt

Keith Noonan: While Royal Caribbean still has a major issue with debt on the heels of pandemic-related challenges it's taken a much lighter approach than Carnival to selling new shares in order to raise funds.

Both cruise stocks have seen huge sell-offs over the last year but dilution has been a contributing factor in Carnival posting the worse performance of the two and I think it remains a key risk factor for investors going forward.

On the other hand Royal Caribbean has been selling convertible notes and refinancing debt at relatively high interest rates recently and some of these notes will likely be converted into stock. With revenue for both companies still well below pre-pandemic levels I think Royal Caribbean's financial positioning and corporate governance have looked stronger than Carnival's lately. But it's clear that debt cash flows and the threat of continued dilution are risks for both cruise stocks.

Royal Caribbean has been increasing revenue per customer and recently posted its best-ever results along those lines. The company's high-end Celebrity and Silversea lines in particular look capable of driving high-margin sales as demand continues to improve. Both Royal Caribbean and Carnival saw cash from operations turn positive in the second quarter but both posted big losses due to high capital expenditures. There are signs that each business is on the path to recovery but Royal Caribbean's financial position and greater focus on the high-end market makes me think it's the better buy.

Which cruise stock should you invest in?

Both Carnival and Royal Caribbean are investment plays characterized by somewhat shaky financials rebounding sales and the potential for explosive turnarounds. These stocks seemingly trade at value-level prices but there's uncertainty about whether the underlying companies will be able to bounce back to pre-pandemic performance and pay down high levels of debt.

Carnival's business has higher levels of debt but it currently has more liquidity to navigate the turnaround and its beaten-down stock could have more upside if the company manages to improve its financial position. Royal Caribbean looks more sound in terms of fundamentals but it's also possible that this will be confounded by the company taking on more debt or pursing new share offerings to raise funds.

If you see the cruise industry making a strong recovery over the long term investing in both stocks could be the right move. Otherwise it's probably best to consider each company's financial position and business strengths to determine which has the more attractive risk-reward profile.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vY3J1aXNlaW5kdXN0cnluZXdzLmNvbS9jcnVpc2UtbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA5L3BvcnQtb2YtZ2FsdmVzdG9uLWludmVzdGluZy1pbi10cmFmZmljLW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtZm9yLWNydWlzZS1ncm93dGgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Port of Galveston Investing in Traffic Management for Cruise Growth,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='cruiseindustrynews.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /cruise-news/2022/09/port-of-galveston-investing-in-traffic-management-for-cruise-growth/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002674219B760>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vY3J1aXNlaW5kdXN0cnluZXdzLmNvbS9jcnVpc2UtbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA5L3BvcnQtb2YtZ2FsdmVzdG9uLWludmVzdGluZy1pbi10cmFmZmljLW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtZm9yLWNydWlzZS1ncm93dGgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90cmF2ZWwvY3J1aXNlcy8yMDIyLzA5LzI2L2h1cnJpY2FuZS1pYW4tY3J1aXNlLWNoYW5nZS1pdGluZXJhcmllcy84MTIyNTM3MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hurricane Ian forces cruise lines to change itineraries,"Major cruise lines have adjusted plans due to Hurricane Ian in some cases changing nearly entire itineraries or canceling sailings altogether.

Norwegian Cruise Line rerouted a Sept. 25 round-trip cruise from Miami with scheduled stops in George Town Grand Cayman Roatán Honduras and Harvest Caye Belize and Cozumel Mexico a spokesperson told USA TODAY in an email. The Norwegian Sky will instead visit San Juan Puerto Rico Saint Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands Tortola in the British Virgin Islands and Nassau in the Bahamas.

""The safety and security of our guests and crew is always our number one priority"" the spokesperson said adding that passengers with shore excursions booked through Norwegian at impacted ports would be refunded via their onboard accounts.

The cruise line also canceled a 10-day Caribbean sailing on Norwegian Getaway scheduled to leave on Thursday from Orlando Florida according to a statement on its website.

MSC Cruises also made major changes to MSC Seashore's Sept. 24 sailing from Miami swapping its Western Caribbean itinerary for Eastern Caribbean stops including the line's private island Ocean Cay Nassau in the Bahamas and Puerto Plata Dominican Republic.

""Guests received a full refund of any shore excursion booked for destinations the ship will no longer be calling at and shore excursions booked for Ocean Cay were automatically rescheduled for the new call date there"" MSC spokesperson Field Sutton said in an email.

MSC Divina also skipped a stop at Ocean Cay Tuesday making its way to Puerto Plata Dominican Republic instead and ""tentatively plans"" to head back to Florida's Port Canaveral on Friday a day later than planned Sutton said. A three-night sailing on the ship scheduled for Thursday has been canceled as well.

The changes come after Hurricane Fiona disrupted cruise schedules forcing Norwegian to reroute a cruise bound for Bermuda to Canada last week.

Other major lines such as Carnival Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean International have similarly altered itineraries as a result of Hurricane Ian.

What other cruise lines have made changes?

► Carnival canceled three sailings due to port closures in Jacksonville Tampa and Port Canaveral in Florida. The cruise line called off four-day sailings on Carnival Elation and Carnival Paradise from Jacksonville and Tampa respectively and a three-day trip on Carnival Liberty from Port Canaveral spokesperson Matt Lupoli said in an email. Carnival Elation and Carnival Paradise were scheduled to leave Thursday with Carnival Liberty departing on Friday and all passengers will get full refunds and 25% future cruise credits.

The line delayed a Saturday sailing on Carnival Sunshine as well. The ship will now leave on Sunday due to a port closure in Charleston South Carolina that has delayed its return. Passengers will ""receive a one-day pro-rated refund of our cruise fare and a $50 onboard credit"" and those who decide not to sail will get a full refund according to Lupoli.

Carnival Elation also swapped its scheduled visit to Princess Cays for a day at sea Tuesday and visited Freeport in the Bahamas Wednesday in place of a planned sea day during a sailing from Jacksonville. The ship which had been scheduled to come back on Thursday is set to dock in Jacksonville when the port reopens which Lupoli said is expected to take place Saturday.

Carnival Liberty did not stop at Princess Cays Wednesday during a sailing from Port Canaveral and Carnival Horizon did not stop at Grand Cayman on its sailing from Miami opting for a sea day instead. The ship is expected to get back to Port Canaveral Saturday one day later than scheduled.

Carnival Paradise which is on a sailing from Tampa extended its Tuesday stop in Cozumel through Wednesday. The vessel is set to dock in Tampa when the port reopens. That is expected to take place Saturday though the ship had been scheduled to return Thursday.

Carnival Sunrise also skipped a stop in Bimini in the Bahamas Wednesday during a sailing from Miami spending a day at sea instead.

Lupoli said Carnival Ecstasy which left from Mobile Alabama Monday would reorder its visits to Cozumel and Progreso Mexico stopping in Progreso first. Another ship Carnival Glory departed New Orleans on Sept. 25 and was set to stop in Mahogany Bay and Roatán Honduras as well as Belize and Cozumel rather than its previously planned stops which included Key West Florida and Nassau.

► Royal Caribbean International has adjusted plans and its ships have skipped several ports as a result of the storm. Mariner of the Seas' Thursday sailing from Port Canaveral – which is currently closed – will now depart on Saturday the cruise line said on its website. The ship will not visit Nassau but will visit Perfect Day at CocoCay on Sunday.

Independence of the Seas' Friday voyage will now leave on Saturday as well and will not visit Perfect Day at CocoCay but will stop in Nassau on Sunday as scheduled.

Those who sail will be compensated in on board credits while passengers who decide to cancel can get a full refund.

Mariner of the Seas also skipped a visit to Labadee Haiti Monday on a sailing from Florida's Port Canaveral a Royal Caribbean Group spokesperson said in an email. The spokesperson said Allure of the Seas would skip its scheduled visit to Roatán Tuesday during its sailing from Fort Lauderdale and Liberty of the Seas would not stop in Cozumel as planned Tuesday.

► Celebrity Cruises replaced stops in Belize and Cozumel on a Celebrity Infinity sailing from Fort Lauderdale Sept. 24 with visits to Nassau and Labadee the Royal Caribbean Group spokesperson said.

► Disney Cruise Line canceled a Friday sailing on its Disney Wish ship according to its website. Passengers booked on the cruise which was scheduled to leave from Port Canaveral ""will automatically receive a full refund back to their original form of payment"" a Disney Cruise Line spokesperson said in an email. ""Additionally we’re providing each guest with a 20% future cruise discount.""

Duke University/Instagram Jerry Seinfeld gives the commencement address at Duke University on May 12 2024

Jerry Seinfeld has some apologies to offer nearly two decades after the release of Bee Movie.

On Sunday May 12 the Seinfeld alum 70 gave a commencement address to the graduating seniors at Duke University in Durham North Carolina — where his son Julian currently attends and his daughter Sascha previously graduated from.

During his speech the comedian took time to reflect on his 2007 animated film Bee Movie — specifically one controversial element of the storyline.

""I made a cartoon movie about bees you may have watched as a child"" Seinfeld said in a video captured by an attendee and shared on TikTok.

""If any of you felt slightly uncomfortable about the sexual undertones in the relationship between Barry B. Benson and Vanessa the florist who saves his life I would like to apologize for that now"" he continued earning laughs from the crowd. ""I may not have calibrated that perfectly.""

Fans of the DreamWorks kids' movie have previously made long-running jokes about the romantic tension between Seinfeld's character in the film Barry (a bee) and Renée Zellweger's character Vanessa (a human). Back in October 2021 Seinfeld addressed the same issue during an appearance on The Tonight Show apologizing once again for the innuendo.

""I apologize for what seems to be a certain uncomfortable subtle sexual aspect of the Bee Movie"" he said at the time. ""[It] really was not intentional but after it came out I realized this is really not appropriate for children. Because the bee seems to have a thing for the girl and we don’t really want to pursue that as an idea in children’s entertainment.""

Seinfeld's commencement speech at Duke also drew public attention when anti-war protesters walked out of the ceremony and booed from the audience when the TV star took the podium according to NBC News and CBS News.

Seinfeld has been making a slew of public appearances in recent weeks in support of his newest movie Unfrosted which marks his feature-film directorial debut. Speaking with PEOPLE at the premiere of the movie on April 30 Seinfeld opened up about taking on the role of director for the first time in his career.

""You don't want to think about that this is a really big important job. Like the pilot never wants to come on the PA system and go 'I'm going to try and get this plane in the air.' You have to be confident"" he said.

Seinfeld previously told PEOPLE that he has ""been obsessed with Pop-Tarts my whole life"" which is what inspired him to take on the movie.

""My friend Spike Feresten who was a writer on my show and is still a good friend of mine thought we should make a movie out of the story the real story which we did"" he explained.



Unfrosted — which features a star-studded cast including Melissa McCarthy Jim Gaffigan Hugh Grant and more — is set in 1963 Battle Creek Mich. when ""Kellogg's and Post sworn cereal rivals race to create a pastry that will change the face of breakfast forever"" according to a synopsis.

Looking suave in a baby blue suit the actor 52 marched along a downtown street followed by a mob of extras. He also sported a white button-down and beige shoes a casual but-classy look.

The scene for Salesforce commercial with whom he is a brand partner featured businessmen and women construction workers and a firefighter among other professions. McConaughey was at their head looking determined.

The pics come on the heels of the announcement that McConaughey's film Dallas Sting would be shelved for good only six weeks ahead of principal photography.

According to The Hollywood Reporter production company Skydance Media scrapped the project — a biographical movie based on Bill Kinder a legendary women's soccer coach from the '80s with McConaughey playing Kinder.

The outlet reported that producers on the film reportedly received ""disturbing allegations surrounding aspects of the true story on which the drama was based.""

According to The Daily Mail the movie was scrapped after anonymous allegations against Kinder 83 were sent to the production company. In a letter from an unknown source Kinder was accused of calling players by ""inappropriate nicknames"" and touching one player ""outside their clothes"" 40 years ago The Mail reported.

“Today we are talking as if renewable energy can carry the baseload. We are going to have to run parallel systems to make sure we transition effectively” stated Moagi adding that“We need to be mindful of how we move forward how we transition and we need to make sure it is at the scale we expect to carry the demand. However we need to carry on and keep moving.”

Vance in Ohio’s U.S. Senate race?,"COLUMBUS Ohio – Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan’s huge fundraising edge over J.D. Vance his Republican opponent in Ohio’s U.S. Senate race largely is thanks to a wave of small-dollar donations from around the country.

Vance meanwhile has struggled to keep up financially not launching general election campaign ads until last month. But backing from a single donor famously helped him win the Republican primary in May.

The unusual fundraising dynamic has helped give Ryan an opening in what was considered Republicans’ seat to lose. Airing uncontested ads Ryan has attempted to brand himself in the eyes of voters who might be skeptical of Democrats as a political independent. The result has been on paper a Senate race that appears closer than expected in a state ex-President Donald Trump won twice.

National Republicans recently responded with a massive cash influx funding tens of millions of dollars in anti-Ryan attack ads. Vance has tried to boost his fundraising and Republicans say they remain confident about the race but time will tell.

Data provided to cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer by a political ad-tracking source tells the story of how each candidates’ ads are being funded.

From September through the Nov. 8 election Ryan and his allies have reserved $13.6 million in TV ads throughout the state. Ryan’s campaign funded the vast majority – about 83% – with the rest coming from outside groups including Save America Fund a pro-Ryan group.

Meanwhile Vance and his allies have spent about $30.6 million on ads. Ninety-two percent of that is coming from outside groups nearly all of which is from Senate Leadership Fund PAC which has close ties to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. About $2.4 million is coming directly from Vance’s campaign.

Even though Vance and his allies are spending almost three times as much as Ryan they’re only getting about 20% more airtime. That’s largely because candidates under federal law get much better prices compared to outside PACs.

“Vance is lucky that he’s got somebody bailing him out” said Jeff Rusnak a Cleveland-based Democratic strategist.

But to get an idea of who’s actually been paying for the ads cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer reviewed both candidates’ campaign-finance reports documenting all campaign spending through June as well as analyses prepared by Political Moneyline a campaign-spending subscription service and The Center for Money in Politics also known as OpenSecrets.org.

Both candidates are expected to report new campaign-finance numbers reflecting activity from July through September on Oct. 15. Those reports will show whether Vance has made progress in closing the fundraising gap.

Until then here is a breakdown of both candidates as well as the outside groups backing them.

Tim Ryan

Federal campaign finance records show Ryan reported he had raised $21.7 million through June for his Senate campaign and had spent almost $18 million much of which went toward ads.

Of the money Ryan raised $8.7 million came from small-dollar donors who gave $200 each or less. The rest came from larger donors and committee transfers – money sent to the campaign from affiliates and the like.

Ryan likes to plug the low-dollar contributions he says are fueling his campaign as a way to contrast himself with Vance whose Republican primary campaign was almost singlehandedly bankrolled by Peter Thiel the billionaire PayPal co-founder.

“I don’t have a billion-dollar donor here to fund me” Ryan said during an interview on MSNBC earlier this month. “I need the low-dollar people who can go to TimForOH.com and chip in a couple of bucks and help us put this extremist to bed so we can move on with being Americans again.”

Vance has countered with his own shots against Ryan’s reliance on ActBlue the national Democrats’ small-dollar fundraising software platform when he’s been asked about Ryan’s fundraising advantage.

“We’ve been outspent by a massive margin from all of the national Democratic money that’s coming into the race and Tim Ryan has presented a picture of himself that’s a false moderate” Vance said during an interview earlier this month with WTVN a Columbus radio station. “And we’re going to be in a position in the next two months where we’re actually matching Tim Ryan’s firepower with our own. And what that means is he’s not going to have the airwaves to himself. He’s not going to be able to continue to tell dishonest things to the American people. And because of that I think we’re going to have a good shot.”

Most of Ryan’s smaller contributions came through that platform but most are well below the legal threshold to qualify as small-dollar contributions. About three-fourths of the more than 70400 contributions Ryan received through ActBlue were for $50 or less.

Under federal campaign-finance rules campaigns don’t have to report information about small-dollar donors. But OpenSecrets tracks where the other contributions come from.

In Ryan’s case OpenSecrets’ analysis shows about a third of those contributions came from Ohio donors with the rest coming from out of state.

The national political climate appears to have been key to Ryan’s fundraising too. Five of Ryan’s top 10 days for fundraising came in the week after the U.S. Supreme Court voted to strike down national legal protections for abortion in late June.

Ryan raised $777827 across those five days. That was more than the $718422 he raised the day after he announced his candidacy in April 2021 and compares to the $285233 he raised the day after he won the Democratic primary in May.

The bulk of Ryan’s fundraising though has come from contributors who gave more than the $200 small-dollar threshold. At least 324 different contributors gave Ryan the $5800 maximum allowed by law.

Among Ryan’s maximum contributors were:

Ryan also got $918000 in contributions from Political Action Committees including at least $214700 from PACs affiliated with organized-labor groups.

More than half of Ryan’s PAC contributions were from single-issue groups – such as NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio which advocates for abortion rights and gave Ryan $7500 and the National League of Conservation Voters an environmentalist group that gave $5900 according to Political Moneyline.

Officially national Democratic money largely has sat on the sidelines in Ohio’s Senate race as Democrats either prioritize holding Democratic-held seats in states like Arizona Georgia New Hampshire and Nevada or strive to pick up Republican-held seats in states deemed as more winnable like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

But one national Democratic group has spent in Ohio. The Future Forward PAC which is part of a California-based network of progressive political groups spent $2.8 million on ads that aired in July attacking Vance for his near-absolute position opposing abortion federal campaign finance records show.

The group’s donors include Stephen Mandel a hedge fund manager from Massachusetts known for giving to Democrats. Mandel gave Future Forward PAC $5 million in April. Six months before that he also gave the maximum $5800 to Ryan’s campaign committee.

Save America Fund a pro-Ryan Super PAC has spent $1.3 million on ads that scheduled to disappear from the air at the end of this month. More information about the group’s funding wasn’t immediately available but it’s run by Eric Hyers a Democratic operative who specializes in working in red states who worked on former Cincinnati mayor John Cranley’s unsuccessful campaign for governor earlier this year.

The group is semi-sanctioned by the Ryan campaign. Dave Chase Ryan’s campaign manager gave the group his stamp of approval in a Twitter post in June.

J.D. Vance

Vance’s fundraising problem is apparent at the top of his campaign’s reports.

Ryan has raised seven times as much as Vance who reported $3.6 million in contributions since June.

But Vance also spent $2.6 million on the path to winning the bitterly contested Republican primary in May – while Ryan defeated two lesser-known opponents with relative ease – leaving Vance with less money in his own campaign war chest to use in the general election.

In the primary Vance was able to rely on Thiel’s backing. But that has dried up in the general election.

Thiel gave $15 million to Protect Ohio Values a pro-Vance Super PAC that bought pro-Vance ads conducted polling and otherwise aided his campaign.

Protect Ohio Values has been less active since the primary although it recently spent $500000 on digital and text ads boosting Vance.

Vance’s fundraising lagged in the weeks following the primary with Republicans chalking it up in part to the expectation that Thiel might write another eight-figure check. But Vance has taken steps to shore things up including hiring staff from other Republican Senate campaigns.

There have been increasing signs of traditional Republican donors backing Vance. For instance Cleveland Browns co-owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam have scheduled a pair of fundraisers for Vance – one earlier this month in Columbus and the other on Oct. 12 at the Haslams’ home in Bratenahl.

The event’s host committee includes a who’s who of Cleveland GOP donors including a number of notable businesspeople: investor and philanthropist Monte Ahuja and his wife Usha; Jay Lucarelli CEO of Minutemen Staffing; Frank Sullivan CEO of RPM International; and Umberto Fedeli CEO of the Fedeli Group insurance brokerage and his wife Mary Ellen. Three former Republican Senate candidates who are major Republican donors in their own right – Mike Gibbons Bernie Moreno and Jane Timken – all also appear on the event billing. Jane Timken’s husband Tim is the former CEO of TimkenSteel and his family is one of Ohio’s most well-known Republican families.

Of Vance’s $3.6 million reported donations about $95500 came from small-dollar contributions that are untrackable.

Among the contributions that OpenSecrets.org could track one-third came from within Ohio while the rest were from out of state. That’s similar to the proportions of Ryan’s in- and out-of-state contributions.

Vance had 82 donors who gave the maximum $5800. Among them are some regular major Ohio Republican donors:

Sam Covelli CEO of a fast-food franchising company in Warren.

Ed Crawford a Cleveland-area businessman whom ex-President Donald Trump appointed as ambassador to Ireland.

Tim Smucker the former chairman of the J.M. Smucker Co. in Orville.

and Alex Wright chairman of the Ariel Corp. in Mount Vernon.

They also include some well-known national Republican mega-donors such as Steve Wynn the casino magnate whom Republicans previously cut off donations over sexual misconduct allegations; and Rebekah Mercer whose family helped fund Breitbart the right-wing political news website.

Vance took in more than $310000 in money from PACS of which $248000 came from single-issue groups. That includes $5000 from the anti-abortion CatholicVote.org PAC $5000 from the conservative Koch Industries and fossil fuel interests like Marathon Petroleum Corp. and Phillips 66 PAC which each gave $5000.

Concerns over Vance’s lack of funding led the Senate Leadership Fund the McConnell-aligned Super PAC to reserve $28 million in TV ads that began airing after Labor Day. The SLF raises vast amounts of money from across the country including $31.5 million from One Nation an affiliated dark-money group that doesn’t have to disclose its donors $10 million from Kenneth Griffin a Chicago-based hedge-fund manager.

Vance has acknowledged hearing from Republicans who are concerned about the lack of TV ads through the summer. He’s chalked it up to Ryan’s national fundraising advantage while blaming tech companies for hindering his solicitations. And his campaign has started to spend its own money on ads trying to pierce Ryan’s image as a political independent.

“I guarantee we’re starting to hit him and we’ll hit him hard” Vance said at a local Republican Party event in Western Ohio earlier this month. “My whole strategy just to be direct and clear with you was to save our resources to when people were really paying attention and that’s right now.”

Rusnak the Democratic strategist in Cleveland said the question is whether it’s too late.

“The biggest problem they’ve got is how do they overcome Vance’s negatives” Rusnak said. “He’s dug himself into such a deep hole I’m not sure he can get out of it.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Scheuplein found Adam Okun for a 15-yard touchdown pass capping a 14-play 98-yard drive to put the Indians up 7-0. Scheuplein then got an interception of defense before running a touchdown drive on the short field ending with a one-yard keeper. A 19-yard touchdown run later in the second quarter by the quarterback gave Wayne Valley a 21-0 halftime lead.

Wayne Hills was undone by miscues all night long including a bobbled snap on a punt that bounced into the end zone for a safety in the third quarter.

Danny Smith and Joe Costa rushed for second half touchdowns for the Indians. Sandwiched between those scores Wayne Hills avoided the shutout with a 13-yard touchdown run by Johnny Mongelli in the fourth quarter.

What it means

Wayne Valley gets a rare win in the history of this rivalry series. Never playing in the regular season until 2009 Friday was the 20th all-time meeting between the schools that includes six playoff clashes. It was only the fifth win by Wayne Valley in the history of the series with the 30-point margin of victory being the largest by the Indians in the rivalry's history. Wayne Valley has beaten Wayne Hills in three of the last four games between the schools.

The 5-0 start by Wayne Valley is the first for the program since 2015. It is also the first time since 2019 that the Indians have won five straight games. During that season Wayne Valley won five straight games twice winning 11 games and ending with a regional championship at MetLife Stadium.

For the third time in four seasons Wayne Hills has a 2-2 record through four games. It remains to be seen what the fate will be the rest of the way for the Patriots. Last season saw the rocky start snowball into a rough end of the season and missing the playoffs. In 2019 Wayne Hills rallied from a 2-2 start to win five of the next six games and reach the playoffs. The Patriots would be undone in the first round of the playoffs by — who else Wayne Valley.

Key play

Wayne Hills forced a three-and-out to begin the game and then was driving in search of the upset bid. One play after Tyler Demikoff spun to the one-yard line on a run Demikoff could not handle the snap and put the ball on the ground. On the doorstep of scoring the game's first points Wayne Hills turned the ball over as it was recovered by Wayne Valley.

Wayne Valley drove 98 yards on the ensuing drive scored the first points of the night and never relinquished the lead.

""It was huge"" said Wayne Valley head coach Roger Kotlarz. ""Sometimes with a game of this magnitude you need to settle in. They made some plays early on and put our backs against the wall so to get a turnover there and then a first down to get it out of danger was able to get us going.""

Game ball

Senior Cole Wolford was involved in much of the action on Friday night defensively often becoming a thorn in the side of Wayne Hills players even after the play. Wolford was the player to come up with the fumble recovery in the first quarter with Wayne Hills on the verge of taking a lead. Wolford also had sacks on consecutive downs at the end of the first half as the Patriots reached the 10-yard line and threatened to cut into the lead before halftime.

""It gave us a lot of momentum to get a turnover early"" said Wolford. ""We were able to convert after and capitalize. Then we just kept scoring.""

Rivals unite for a cause

One Town. One Heart.

Those were the four words on display on Friday night long before any trash talk or pushing and shoving after the play occurred.

Normally two rival schools dueling with maroon and blue on either sideline student sections on both sides were sporting orange on Friday night as the two Wayne schools paid tribute to one of their own. Wayne Valley football player Rocco Sivolella was remembered before game after he died in May of acute myeloid leukemia at the age of 15.

Sivolella:Wayne high schools raise money for a scholarship in honor of student who died of leukemia

Players and coaches from both sides wore orange accessories the color used to symbolize leukemia awareness. Well over a thousand shirts were sold before the game to students from both schools with money raised to begin a scholarship in Sivolella's name.

""It was an amazing visual"" said Kotlarz. ""It's just an amazing show of town support. I'm really proud of the community and for us to band together. The loss of Rocco has been really tough for our program and our school and to see people come out and support this cause has been so special.""

They said it

""Once we gained momentum our kids did a great job of keeping gas to the pedal and never really giving them momentum back. They had a couple of moments after but nothing to panic about."" - Wayne Valley coach Roger Kotlarz.

""I started off with a speech during warmups tonight to do it for your brothers. And if that still wasn't enough do it for Rocco."" - Wayne Valley senior Cole Wolford.

Olivia Wilde and Florence Pugh have shared celebratory photos of each other behind the scenes of Don’t Worry Darling to mark its release.

The psychological thriller directed by Wilde and which stars Harry Styles alongside Florence in the leading roles was released this week to major excitement from fans.

Don’t Worry Darling had an incredibly dramatic and headline-stealing publicity run featuring awe-inspiring drama at the premiere including a genuine debate over whether Harry had spit spit on his co-star Chris Pine in full few of cameras (spoiler alert: he didn’t.)

The release comes amid rumours of tension between Olivia and Florence with the Midsommar actress having limited her promotion of the flick to just Venice Film Festival.

And on the day of the film’s release a new source claimed that the women got into a ‘screaming match’ on set with Warner Bros bosses having to intervene to ensure Florence would finish filming the movie.

Now the pair have shared some behind-the-scenes photos from Don’t Worry Darling to celebrate the film’s international release featuring the cast and crew spending time together between takes – and from the photos it all looks totally drama-free.

Olivia shared a sweet snap of the stars going over lines outside a trailer during the film’s production with Harry Olivia and Florence each posing for the shot Florence throwing her arms out wide.

She wrote: ‘Don’t Worry Darling is officially open. Aaahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!

‘I’m so deeply grateful for this experience and for the extraordinary effort of the group of artists who made it happen. We got together to tell a story for you and we hope you have fun with it.’

Florence meanwhile shared multiple behind-the-scenes snaps from the cast relaxing in the desert between takes to her sitting in hair and makeup.

One snap sees her and Olivia in full 1950’s-style get-up in what looks like it could be a still from the film itself while another playful photo sees Olivia sticking her fingers up her nose.

Seemingly more than ready to keep the rumoured drama on the sidelines Florence shared the photos to her 8 million followers with the caption: ‘It’s here.. and ready to be seen.

‘We met so many talented people visited some insane locations worked hard in the desert dust and looked good whilst doing so’ she wrote thanking the hair and makeup team.

‘Thank you to all those who have bought tickets and those who have already seen it’ she went on reflecting on the massive amount of work that went in to producing the film.

‘This film was such an epic story on such a large scale to shoot all while during peak Covid times. For that I will always be grateful.

‘To all of you who helped make this your dedication and love was seen daily – thank you.’

While Don’t Worry Darling has been receiving mixed reviews from critics the gssip around the cast means it has become one of the most eagerly-anticipated films of the year.

Olivia has continuously heaped praise on her leading actress in interviews stating she did an ‘exquisite’ job and addressed the rumours of a rift in an interview with Vanity Fair where she said it was ‘ironic’ people were focusing on gossip in a film centred on the ‘incredible power of women.’

‘It is ironic that now with my second film – which is again about the incredible power of women what we’re capable of when we unite and how easy it is to strip a woman of power by using other women to judge and shame them – we’re talking about this’ she said.

She clarified thatFlorence’s character Alice is on a challenging journey and a ‘cataclysmic existential breakdown’ throughout the film which put may have Florence in a different mindset to her castmates.

‘My tendency is to be everyone’s best friend and to socialize and I think she often just needed the time and space to focus so the way I supported her was to give her space and to be there if she needed anything’ she continued.

‘Florence was very focused on turning out that performance which I can assure you took all of her energy.’

Don’t Worry Darling is out now.

“Margot is 2 weeks old today…& she’s just given me my first performance review” Sam joked in the caption.

Sam looks at the camera with an unamused expression while resting his daughter on his chest.

A closer look reveals that Margot has her middle finger up and has also left a vomit stain on the host’s top.

His girlfriend Rebecca James offered some words of encouragement writing: “Hahaha you’re doing amazing sweetie.”

Fans were delighted by Sam’s post with many warning him that being a parent ‘gets worse’.

“Hahaha I thought you were talking about the spit up and then I zoomed in and saw her middle finger” a fan commented.

“She’s flipping the bird after a [spew]! Just wait until she starts bossing you around” another quipped.

“Lmfao chuck then the middle finger at 2 weeks. You’re in trouble” a third remarked.

“It’s the spew stain that really makes it real. You’re doing great” added a fan.

Others chimed in with parenting horror stories of their own.

“Have you had the leaking nappy all over your lap yet? Then you’ll know you’re alive” one joked.

“Mate that’s nothing at 2 weeks I was shat on from the change table. On my face in my hair up the wall behind me. Now that’s amazing” a second added.

“The attitude has just started. It only gets worse from here” another commented.

Sam Mac's controversial gift

This comes after Sam's present for new mother Rebecca divided fans.

Sharing a snap of Rebecca and their newborn daughter Margot on Instagram the stylist holds an oversized glass of wine while smiling.

“My darling Rebecca has been looking forward to a glass of wine for 9 months. You’re welcs boo” the weatherman wrote in the caption.

The glass filled with rosé wine appears bigger than Rebecca’s face and their newborn baby.

Sam's followers were delighted by the lighthearted post with many relating to Rebecca.

“Bec so deserves it. Enjoy Margot is just perfect. Enjoy all she brings” a fan wrote.

“She has the postpartum glow. Or is her face lit up from the giant glass of wine? I think both” another fan quipped.

However there were some fans critical of Rebecca’s choice to drink wine after giving birth.

“Should you be drinking while breastfeeding? Or are [you] bottle feeding?” one asked.

“Umm…not supposed to drink if breastfeeding” another pointed out.

“Not breastfeeding? But if you are remember what you have baby has also” a third added.

Fans quickly jumped to defend the new mum saying that whether Rebecca is breastfeeding or not isn’t anyone’s ‘damned business’.

""None of yours or our business! They are a well-educated couple who don't need strangers' advice or questioning"" a fan fired back.

In a surprising incident every passenger travelling from California to Hawaii on Southwest Airlines got ukuleles as a gift and a 20-minute inflight lesson on how to play the instrument at about 30000 feet above ocean level. The airlines partnered with a Guitar company called Guitar Center to promote the Hawaiian culture and ""underscore our everyday commitment to serve and celebrate the spirit of Aloha"" the airlines told Today.

Southwest airlines tweeted a photo in which passengers can be seen holding ukuleles in their hands. The airlines in the captions said by the time the passengers reached Hawaii they were all pros. ""We teamed up with @guitarcenter to surprise a flight full of Customers flying out of Long Beach with a ukulele and a lesson. By the time they arrived in Honolulu they were pros"" read the caption.

The passengers got a new Mitchell MU40 Soprano ukulele from Guitar Center. While the passengers in the picture and video look quite elated with the surprise the social media users were less keen on the idea.

A user on Twitter wrote ""Seems like not everyone enjoyed this PR stunt. Might be a good idea to send a survey to those booking their tickets to ascertain if this is worthwhile rather than subjecting passengers to something they may hate. This makes me less likely to fly with you."" Another user read ""That sounds like a really really horrible surprise. I'm autistic and sensitive to sound. Being trapped on a plane full of people trying to play the ukulele for the first time would be an absolute nightmare for me."" ""You harassed an entire flight for a promotional partnership?! As someone with sensory processing issues related to noise I would literally have been bent double in my seat arms over my head sobbing and having a panic attack"" the third commented.

Another thing I never do is check a bag. In case you're new here I famously wrote in a newsletter earlier this year that I would ""rather die than check a bag."" A flare for the dramatics (I am a Leo after all) I simply lack the patience required to retrieve checked baggage following a flight.

However I recognize that some of you prefer to check bags when flying. While I promise to only judge you slightly for doing so checking a bag does not necessarily have to inconvenience you beyond the time you spend waiting for it to arrive on the luggage carousel after deplaning. Unless of course you miss your flight and your bag has already been checked.

One common scenario occurs when you check a bag but miss your flight and therefore have to rebook yourself on a new flight or cancel altogether.

Another time this often happens is when you miss a connecting flight because your original flight was delayed.

How can you retrieve your checked luggage? Most airlines will try their best to reroute a passenger's bag to their final destination.

This guide details how five major U.S. airlines handle these scenarios and what happens to checked luggage when a traveler fails to board a flight as planned.

Domestic versus international requirements

To start you should know that there are different regulations regarding checked bags on domestic and international flights. If you were to miss a domestic flight after checking your bag the airline should be able to transfer your bag to any other domestic flight since every bag is screened.

However federal regulations for international flights known as Positive Passenger Bag Match (PPBM) or sometimes Passenger Bag Match (PBM) require airlines to off-load checked bags if the passenger is not onboard. Of course there are few exemptions to this rule such as if a bag is misconnected and needs to get to a passenger's final destination.

This explains why if a passenger is missing for an international flight and they have a checked bag there will probably be a delay in you receiving your bag since the airline has to manually pull that bag from the cargo hold.

Keep these rules in mind when reading the below airline baggage policies.

Delta Air Lines

CRAIG HASTINGS/GETTY IMAGES

If a Delta passenger checks a bag but misses their flight the resulting situation depends on the reason why they missed their flight.

""Presumably if it is due to being late they wouldn't have been able to check their bag anyways as there is a cut-off for that"" a Delta spokesperson said. However if a Delta passenger checks their bag and is rebooked on a new flight due to their own volition their bag will be re-routed to the new flight's final destination.

However if either the customer or Delta cancels the flight any checked bags will be returned to baggage claim where the customer can expect to retrieve them. This is also the case for those who miss their connecting flights.

""The bag would continue to the destination it is ticketed for but if for some reason the customer has a very tight connection and doesn't make it there is a possibility that could be the same for the bag"" Delta told me.

For what it's worth Delta has invested in bag tracking technology since 2016 and it became the first airline to allow travelers to track their checked bags in real-time via the Fly Delta App.

United Airlines

""If a customer is re-booked or re-routed we do our best to re-route the bag tag so it travels with them"" a United spokesperson confirmed.

If you are connecting on a United flight and miss that connection likely your bag will also miss that connection — which is probably a best-case scenario.

But if for some reason your bag does not end up at your final destination with you United encourages passengers to file a delayed baggage claim which you can read about here.

As a reminder United flyers can use the United mobile app to track their bags in real-time from the time they check in at their departure airport to the time it arrives at their destination airport; this includes on layovers and connections. Just note that you'll need either your confirmation number or bag tag number to do so.

Alaska Airlines

Unlike the other carriers Alaska's policy for checked baggage differs on international versus domestic flights.

""Internationally we are required to pull a bag if the guest does not board"" according to an Alaska spokesperson. ""Domestically there is no such requirement and actions may be based on multiple factors like timelines and proximity between connecting flights.""

Keeping in line with the other carriers though Alaska says that checked bags will be re-routed to one's final destination pending it was transferred in time in the case of missed domestic flights.

""It's generally quicker for a guest to connect than their bag but...the bag would travel on to the final destination if it was transferred in time even if the guest was not"" a spokesperson said.

American Airlines

In perhaps the most straightforward policy of the mentioned carriers American Airlines has one rule for missed flights and one for canceled flights.

""If the customer misses their flight and catches another their bags will automatically be routed to their final destination and can be picked up from the luggage claim"" a spokesperson said. ""If a flight is canceled checked bags will be returned in the departure airport's luggage claim.""

Southwest Airlines

Generally speaking checked baggage on domestic Southwest flights will make it to a customer's final destination listed on a baggage tag.

Even so should baggage make it to the carousel without its traveler companion Southwest travelers should look for their baggage at Southwest's baggage service office at the final airport location to claim it upon arrival.

Bottom line

Travelers hope to arrive at their destinations with their bags and airlines want the same. Therefore airlines will do their best to reroute a passenger's bag to its final destination.

Sometimes though that's not logistically possible given the constraints of customers with tight flight connections and little time for error. If you arrive at your destination without your bag your best bet is to check the local baggage service office for your carrier at your final airport. This should be located near the baggage claim area or the ticket counter.

Also be sure to download the mobile app for each carrier as those can also help you track your bags. If you want even more reassurance consider purchasing and using Apple AirTags which allow you to track your bags via Bluetooth.

Jim Lee is now a pilot for Southwest Airlines but his path to get there was anything but turbulence free.

He's hoping to be a beacon for those afraid to take the risk and go after their dreams.

Lee took his first flight at three years old and from that day forward his love of flying would follow him throughout his life.

Raised in Tulsa Lee always knew he wanted to be a pilot.

He was turned down to be a Navy pilot due to having asthma so he pursued his other passion ministry.

After years of ministry his love for flying was still there.

“I got my graduate degree at Dallas Theological Seminary. Got a job out in Newport Beach California out in beautiful Orange County and drove by John Wayne Airport every single day. And one day I literally just walked into a flight school and said hey how much would it cost how long would it take to earn my private pilot’s certificate”

So he chose to take another risk which he said turned out to be the best decision for Lee and his family.

Lee took the first step by getting a pilot's certificate but he wouldn't put on the Southwest uniform until more than two decades later.

“He said over the years we’ve found that guys like you that have been gone a long time and try to come back it’s just too hard. And I told him that may be true of other people but I won't fail nobody will work harder than me"" Lee said.

Lee said he wouldn't change his path and he's thankful for all the changes thrown at him.

“Believe it or not I got an interview with Southwest and they hired me or extended an offer and invited me to start training last June. And it was only a year after I started with Republic. And I finished training about a month and here I am and I can’t believe that at 58 I get to do this again” Lee said.

He said growing up he didn't see pilots that looked like him.

So now that he's finally in the cockpit he can show others that anyone can fly if they work hard and study.

“When a little kid pokes their head in the cockpit and sees someone that looks like me or flying with a captain that’s female or a minority and they see themselves we look at them right away” Lee said.

Lee also attended his 40th high school reunion where he got to show off his new title.

He's a graduate of Memorial High School and said his love for planes began in Tulsa.

Lee said “I’m an incredibly blessed person in so many ways. I’m fortunate enough I think to have one passion and do it for a living and get paid. To do two I think that’s extremely rare particularly at my age”

Pilots are forced to retire at sixty-five so Lee has another seven years of flying.

He said once he retires he plans to not only continue flying private planes but continue his ministry work and recruiting aviation students from all backgrounds.

“I don’t think this is going to be a good thing for Starbucks because I think one of the reasons people go there in the first place is because it was a meeting place” host Ursula Reutin said.

“I’m not just going for the coffee. I am going for the partners that work there. I love the community aspect of Starbucks” host Gee Scott agreed.

Starbucks closes 5 Seattle locations more across the nation citing increased crime

The Seattle Times report notes that Starbucks plans to open some 2000 locations in the U.S. over the next three years a high number that is subsidized by convenience-first store openings — 35% will be drive-thrus 14% pick-up only and 5% delivery.

“Starbucks has been out gamed in their third place idea” producer Andrew “Chef” Lanier noted.

“But it is a place with generally a very clean bathroom. You know what you’re getting gonna get in terms of atmosphere and environment. It’s a great place for a quick meeting. If you take that away what does Starbucks have left?”

The women filed their lawsuit in 2016 after the university facing a budget crisis eliminated six of its sports teams including women’s tennis and Nordic skiing. They argued that the university had continually under-resourced women’s athletics including providing lesser practice facilities.

In 2019 after a trial a federal judge found that St. Cloud State was in violation of Title IX at least since 2014. He ordered the university to take steps to bring gender equity to its athletic programs.

Since then St. Cloud State has taken steps to comply including the controversial decision to cut its men’s football program in 2019 partly for budget reasons. It also cut men’s and women’s golf added men’s soccer and improved practice facilities and locker rooms.

SCSU wants permanent injunction dissolved

The university has filed updates on its progress with the court every six months. It asked the court to dissolve a permanent injunction filed after the 2019 decision arguing that it is now in compliance with Title IX.

In a ruling filed Sept. 7 U.S. District Court Judge John Tunheim ruled that the St. Cloud State is providing equitable opportunities for participation for male and female athletes.

But he said the university failed to show it’s in full compliance with Title IX relating to travel and per diem and needs to update its policies to ensure equal treatment for both men’s and women’s teams.

Judith Siminoe special adviser to the university’s president called the ruling “absolutely good news.”

“Our preference would have been that the order would have indicated that the university is in compliance overall” she said.

Interim athletic director Holly Schreiner said the ruling shows that St. Cloud State has worked hard to meet the law.

""We're really excited to hopefully move out of being under the court ruling and to just be able to maintain moving forward and making sure that internally we're still in compliance with Title IX” she said.

Schreiner said they’re working on travel and per diem policies and hope to submit a plan to the court within the next few weeks.

It will cover how frequently teams travel by bus or plane how far they travel hotel stays and per diem for meals.

Siminoe said in the past many of those decisions have been left up to the coaches but the judge said that’s not good enough.

“You need to actually have a written policy to make certain that these individual decisions are going to result in an equitable program overall” she said.

Compliance with the law

Attorney Donald Chance Mark Jr. represents the female athletes who sued. He said the university has made some improvements but still isn’t where it needs to be when it comes to gender equity.

“We will certainly agree that they've made some progress” Mark said. “But either you're in compliance with the law or you aren't.”

Mark said he and his clients disagreed with St. Cloud State’s decision to cut men’s football. A better solution would have been to add another women’s program such as lacrosse he said.

“They had a much easier solution that they should have abided by” he said.

Creating a men’s soccer team didn’t make sense because there aren’t other university-level teams in Minnesota for St. Cloud to play Mark said so the team ends up traveling extensively out of state.

And while the university did reinstate women’s tennis and Nordic skiing Mark said it isn’t adequately recruiting or promoting those programs. Nordic skiing fielded just a couple of athletes last year despite the rising popularity of the sport in Minnesota thanks to Olympian Jessie Diggins he said.

Schreiner said adding another sport such as lacrosse when the university was already stretched for funding didn’t make sense.

“It's more than just the financial burden that comes with paying for a coach and student athletes. It’s support staff it’s athletic trainers it’s equipment people” she said. “To just keep adding when you don't have the support staff to be able to maintain them isn't always the right answer.”

Schreiner said men’s soccer is growing exponentially in the St. Cloud region so adding a team made sense. She said they hope other colleges and universities in Minnesota will add teams in the near future.

The female athletes who sued St. Cloud State have all moved on. Some live and work in Minnesota and some are in other states or abroad. But Mark said they’re all still following the case.

“They're proud of what they've done” he said. “And they're certainly interested in what steps St. Cloud State takes in the future to make sure that there's equity for all athletes.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vaG9tZW5ld3NoZXJlLmNvbS90ZXdrc2J1cnlfdG93bl9jcmllci9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVfOTQ4ZGU3YjgtMzllMi0xMWVkLWI5NDgtMzM0ODIxYjI0MTBmLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,11-year old St. Germain to walk for Jimmy Fund,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='homenewshere.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /tewksbury_town_crier/news/article_948de7b8-39e2-11ed-b948-334821b2410f.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673EB08100>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vaG9tZW5ld3NoZXJlLmNvbS90ZXdrc2J1cnlfdG93bl9jcmllci9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVfOTQ4ZGU3YjgtMzllMi0xMWVkLWI5NDgtMzM0ODIxYjI0MTBmLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS81MC1tb3N0LWluZmx1ZW50aWFsLWpld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS03MTc3MzXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The most powerful man on Wall Street: Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.jpost.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /50-most-influential-jews/article-717735 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673EB09090>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS81MC1tb3N0LWluZmx1ZW50aWFsLWpld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS03MTc3MzXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zaGFyb25oZXJhbGQuY29tL25ld3MvaGlzdG9yeS1ncm91cC10YWtlcy12aXNpdG9ycy1vbi1hLXN0cm9sbC10aHJvdWdoLWEtc2hhcm9uLW5laWdoYm9yaG9vZHMtcGFzdC9hcnRpY2xlX2FhZTlhY2VhLTNjZTktMTFlZC05NjY4LTRiZmIwMTMwZGE0NC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,History group takes visitors on a stroll through a Sharon neighborhood's past,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

LOUIS — The 97 books banned in schools across St. Louis this fall cover topics like anatomy photography and the Holocaust. There are books that are also popular TV series including “Game of Thrones” “The Handmaid’s Tale” “The Walking Dead” and “Watchmen.”

And as life imitates art Kirkwood School District banned a comic book adaptation of George Orwell’s “1984” the cautionary tale about government mind control.

A new state law banning “explicit sexual material” — defined as any visual depiction of sex acts or genitalia with exceptions for artistic or scientific significance — went into effect at the end of August and applies to both public and private schools.

Teachers and librarians have scoured their book lists for any applicable content at the direction of lawyers. But interpretation of the law varies by geography according to a Post-Dispatch analysis of public records:

• Ten school districts in St. Louis city and mostly inner suburbs plan to ignore the law and not change their library collections. University City posted a photo this week of banned books displayed in the middle school library along with a sign reading “We Read Banned Books.”

• Four suburban districts — Francis Howell in St. Charles County and Kirkwood Lindbergh and Rockwood in St. Louis County — each removed more than 12 books from their schools.

• Wentzville School District banned one book and pulled 223 others “for further review” including dozens of art history books and “Children’s Bible Stories.”

• Two Jefferson County districts Fox and Festus banned no books. A Festus spokesman clarified that materials falling under the law “were never in school libraries in the first place.”

The number of book bans nationwide this school year is on track to top last year’s record total according to the American Library Association. The spike comes amid a culture war over how educators should teach about race gender and sexuality.

“When you dictate what people can read what people can choose from that’s the mark of an authoritarian society not a democratic society” said Deborah Caldwell-Stone director of the association’s office for intellectual freedom. “We really have to question what we intend for the education of our young people.”

The local map of banned books tends to align with political leanings with districts in conservative areas removing more titles. Suburban school boards in St. Charles County and west St. Louis County have also faced repeated book challenges from residents over the last two years.

The three books most frequently targeted were “The Handmaid’s Tale” graphic novel banned in 10 local school districts; “Gender Queer” banned in seven districts and “Watchmen” banned in four districts. Half of the 10 books most frequently pulled from classrooms and school libraries feature LGBTQ characters and themes and several others involve racism.

Of the 97 books that have been banned by schools in the St. Louis area 86 were targeted by just one district. High-profile examples include:

• Ritenour School District banned “Maus” by Art Spiegelman a Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic novel about the Holocaust that depicts Jews as mice and Nazis as cats. When “Maus” was banned earlier this year by a Tennessee school district the U.S. Holocaust Museum said the book “has played a vital role in educating about the Holocaust through sharing detailed and personal experiences of victims and survivors.”

• Lindbergh banned “A Dangerous Woman: The Graphic Biography of Emma Goldman” about the radical political activist and anarchist along with several volumes in the “Game of Thrones” and “The Walking Dead” series.

• In addition to “1984: The Graphic Novel” Kirkwood banned “Crime and Punishment: A Graphic Novel” “Annie Leibovitz at Work” about the celebrity photographer and “The Human Body in Action” a 1999 textbook with a chapter called “Making Babies.”

The ACLU of Missouri issued a statement last month saying school library books are not subject to the new state law because they have “already been screened under nationally well-established standards for selecting material that take into account the entire piece.”

But some school leaders said the threat of prosecution requires a conservative approach to culling books.

“The unfortunate reality of Senate Bill 775 is that now in effect it includes criminal penalties for individual educators. We are not willing to risk those potential consequences and will err on the side of caution on behalf of the individuals who serve our students” said Kirkwood spokeswoman Steph Deidrick.

The Missouri Library Association denounced the book bans saying schools need to protect academic freedom for their students and autonomy for their educators.

“In choosing to preemptively remove graphic novels from your collection you are sending the message to your students that you support (the law’s) intent which is to chill access to information art and culturally relevant materials in your collection” reads a Sept. 9 letter from the association to Rockwood administrators. “We ask you as leaders in your district to have courage in the face of this law to support your staff and your students and to stand with us against censorship.”

The bill’s sponsor state Sen. Rick Brattin R-Harrisonville tweeted this month that he is “proud to have banned these books in school libraries. It’s sick that people think this is appropriate for school age children.”

Students react to book bans

No private schools have reported pulling books in response to the law. High school students in an AP Literature course at Crossroads College Prep in St. Louis described the book bans as patronizing insulting and disturbing.

“Banning these books weaves another layer onto this blanket of ignorance” said Tré Humphries 17.

In a recent class Crossroads students discussed “Invisible Man” by Ralph Ellison and other books that have been banned. English teacher and co-head of school Sarah Pierson Wolff said a lawyer for Crossroads has advised administrators about the new state law but that no books have been removed.

“The idea of trying to limit what people have access to is something we are fighting against” Wolff said. “For somebody to say a book is dangerous is scary.”

Book bans are also known to backfire inspiring students to seek out books that otherwise would sit untouched on the library shelf.

“The fact is if you’re an enterprising teenager and you want a copy of ‘Gender Queer’ you’re going to get it” said Linda Johnson president and CEO of the Brooklyn Public Library in New York. “Either the elected officials or parents or school administrators are naïve or there’s something else at play.”

In April the library launched Books Unbanned offering free online access to its entire collection for 13- to 21-year-olds. There have been spikes in demand from students living in school districts that banned titles Johnson said.

Families in Wentzville where the school district is being sued over book bans will partner with the ACLU to host a “students’ rights” strategy session on Oct. 2 at the local library.

“It’s important for students to learn how to advocate for themselves” said Zebrina Looney whose four children attended Wentzville schools. “They’re the ones going off to college and potentially not equipped with the knowledge that their counterparts had.”

Graphic novels targeted

Jerry Craft hated reading as a kid and thinks it’s because the African American protagonists were either enslaved imprisoned or fighting for civil rights.

“As a 12-year-old why couldn’t I have a Harry Potter?” Craft said. “I write the books I wish I had when I was a kid. Kids just want to be seen.”

When Craft heard his book “New Kid” had been challenged by parents in Texas because of “critical race theory” he had to Google the term. The Newbery Award-winning graphic novel is about a Black boy who experiences culture shock when he transfers to a private school.

“My goal was to tell a story that was loosely based on my life and the lives of my two sons and the lives of a bunch of my friends” said Craft who spoke about banned comic books Thursday at St. Louis Central Library. “One of the things that most people don’t do is actually read the book or ask a kid what they think of the book. That’s one of the biggest problems — the kids are often an afterthought.”

Teachers say graphic novels are valuable tools for engaging reluctant readers English learners and those with learning disabilities. The visuals combined with text can lead to deeper understanding and analysis of a book.

But there is a general misunderstanding of the term graphic novel which refers to the comic-strip illustrated format of the books and not the content said Jeff Trexler interim director of the New York-based Comic Book Legal Defense Fund.

Federal lawmakers on Thursday marked Banned Books Week by introducing resolutions condemning school book bans calling them unconstitutional.

“The general tragedy of banning books in schools is they are protected classes against discrimination” Trexler said. “You’re going to have people thrown into jail for showing material that’s protected by the First Amendment.”

LONDON -- After nationwide protests in Iran enter a second week the U.S. Treasury Department allowed tech companies in a statement to offer software that skirts the Islamic Republic's crackdown on internet access.

The Islamic Republic clamped down on anti-regime protests online -- the most restrictive internet measure the country has seen in years. According to NetBlocks internet access in most Iranian cities was cut on Wednesday making the already interrupted flow of information almost impossible.

Protests against the Iranian regime started across the country last Friday following the suspicious death of a young woman who was arrested and detained for allegedly wearing a hijab improperly by the country's so-called morality police three days earlier.

""As courageous Iranians take to the streets to protest the death of Mahsa Amini the United States is redoubling its support for the free flow of information to the Iranian people"" said United States Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo said Friday. ""We are helping the Iranian people be better equipped to counter the government's efforts to surveil and censor them.""

Instagram -- the last social media outlet still accessible in Iran -- was blocked on Wednesday. Next the Iranian government restricted access to WhatsApp NetBlocks reported.

At least 50 people were killed in the protests as of Friday Iran Human Rights group reported.

It is not the first time the regime blocked internet access to control protests.

In 2019 the Iranian government forced the country into digital darkness from Nov. 16 to Nov. 27 during a crackdown on nationwide protests. The death toll of the 2019 protests was reported between more than 300 according to Amnesty International.

Amid the interrupted internet access a person presumably Iranian addressed Elon Musk on Twitter asking if there was a way for Starlink -- a satellite internet constellation operated by Musk's SpaceX -. to provide service for Iranians. Musk responded he would ask for a sanction ""exemption.""

Due to the U.S. sanctions on Iran companies cannot provide services for Iran unless granted an exemption from the Treasury Department.

Three hours after the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken tweeted about the Treasury's statement on the increase support of the Internet freedom in Iran Musk responded with two words: ""Activating Starlink.""

While the first legal steps of providing Iranians with Starlink service is set Dawood Sajjadi a cybersecurity expert told ABC News that ""we shouldn't expect to see a significant outcome in a near future.""

""From a technical point of view Starlink needs multiple ground stations around Iran to provide internet access to users in the country"" he said explaining that such a deployment of equipment ""might increase the political tensions.""

Despite the technical obstacles the project might have to be fully implemented some Iranians expressed optimism over the Treasury Department's and Musk's tweets.

""Mahsa your voice will no longer be silenced in the world. #Mahsa_Amini"" an Iranian user wrote in response to Musk's tweet.

According to newly published DMs with the infamous GTA 6 hacker the upcoming Grand Theft Auto game could be the most expensive title in the series. The leaker colloquially known as ""teapotuberhacker"" was reportedly in discussions with other hackers regarding the stolen Rockstar Games data. Throughout the DMs the hacker claims that Rockstar has spent $2.5 billion on GTA 6 so far--a number which has since been amended.

This is an incredibly high budget for any entertainment property and would make Grand Theft Auto 6 the most expensive video game ever made. The information is incredibly shaky however and shouldn't be taken as 100% fact.

If genuine this number would reflect the entire budget for the game including: years of development costs (GTA 6 has reportedly been in early planning phases since 2014); marketing and advertising deals which can be expensive; full publishing and distribution costs of physical and digital media including overseas shipments; any post-launch content including expansions and story DLC; and the lucrative online component for GTA 6.

The last spending point could be pretty expensive if Rockstar Games is aiming to use GTA Online to bridge both GTA 5 and GTA 6 similar to how Warzone connects multiple mainline Call of Duty games.

Again we have absolutely no idea how much money Take-Two Interactive or Rockstar Games have ear-marked for GTA 6 but bear in mind the game dind't enter principal development until 2018.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS9ndGEvNS1tYWpvci1ndGEtbW9kcy1zaHV0LXRha2UtdHdv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 major GTA mods that have been shut down by Take-Two,"The Grand Theft Auto (GTA) modding community is arguably one of the most popular and thriving modding communities. This can be directly attributed to skilled modders who have consistently produced amazing patches that transform every GTA game into something new and exciting.

Unfortunately the modding scene is not openly accepted by many companies especially when modders decide to involve any form of monetary transaction.

Take-Two Interactive the parent company of Rockstar Games has been very restrictive with mods that have come out of the GTA modding community and have attempted to prevent them from being released.

To shed some more light on the matter here are some prominent GTA mods that have been shut down by Take-Two Interactive.

Note: This article reflects the writer's subjective opinion.

Here are five of the biggest GTA mods that have been stopped or entirely shut down by Take-Two Interactive

5) Flat2VR

Expand Tweet

Flat2VR was one of the most recent mods that suffered a DMCA takedown by Take-Two Interactive. It allowed players to play GTA 5 in virtual reality and the majority of the GTA community hoped to try it out.

But in July 2022 Luke Ross the developer of Flat2VR revealed that they have been hit with a DMCA strike and Take-Two Interactive has barred them from releasing the VR mod for any of their games. The move was heavily criticized by the community.

Luke Ross said that the mod is not built with any software made by Take-Two Interactive and did not provide any clarification as to why the strike occurred. The mod has been taken down.

Ozark Mod Menu

Ozark was a popular paid mod menu used by many GTA 5 players offering multiple options and features that they could use to manipulate gameplay. Thus players could become invincible or rich in the game.

But last year it was taken down by Take-Two Interactive. The creator also provided an official statement explaining the situation to the Ozark Community.

The main reason for the take-down might be due to the rampant use of this mod menu in GTA Online as mods in the multiplayer mode are strictly not allowed and players caught using them get instantly banned.

3) Vice Cry

Expand Tweet

Vice Cry was one of the most popular graphic overhaul mods for GTA Vice City. Its core function was to replace any old textures and models with new high-quality ones.

Unfortunately even though all of the replacement textures were original Take-Two Interactive still took down the mod.

Many fans suspect the takedown happened because of the GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition release which provided the community with an official remaster of Grand Theft Auto Vice City.

2) OpenIV's Liberty City

OpenIV are known for building some amazing GTA mods. So in 2017 when they announced that they were developing a mod that would allow players to visit Liberty City in Grand Theft Auto 5 the entire GTA community was abuzz with excitement.

However the mod never saw an official release as it was canceled the same year after the developers were hit with a DMCA takedown from Take-Two Interactive.

Although the modders have not provided an extensive explanation of why this happened they did inform fans that the main reason is that the mod would have imported Grand Theft Auto 4's version of Liberty City to Grand Theft Auto 5 thereby violating Rockstar Games' modding policy.

1) Grand Theft Auto Underground

Grand Theft Auto Underground was one of the most ambitious GTA mods created aiming to combine the settings from almost all other major 3D universe games into Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

This meant that players with the mod would be able to visit locations such as Bullworth Vice City Carcer City etc. But this wasn't all as many features from all the 3D universe games were also adapted and integrated into the mod creating the ultimate Grand Theft Auto experience.

But like with every other mod on this list Grand Theft Auto Underground was hit by a DMCA strike from Take-Two Interactive and the modders had to cease its development.

Now going on 140 years in business Cincinnati-based Kroger sped up its push into digital retailing during the pandemic and the grocery store chain isn't looking back. Kroger has adopted an omnichannel strategy integration of offline or in-store sales with online orders and logistics. It's a concept that originated in China in 2016 when founder Jack Ma of e-commerce giant Alibaba coined the term ""New Retail"" and proceeded to open 300 high-tech Freshippo-branded supermarkets in 27 Chinese cities. This ""New Retail"" model has been ""cut and pasted from businesses that worked in China"" said Michael Zakkour founder of digital commerce and retail consultancy 5 New Digital in New York. ""We are seeing it with Kroger Target and Walmart. They looked at the New Retail model born in China for complete integration of offline and online channels"" he said. ""Same-day delivery restaurants in store app-driven sales and QR codes are all bright spots in every single one of them and all happened first in China."" At first the highly competitive and fragmented U.S. food retailing business was slow to catch on. But the action was jumpstarted when Amazon bought Whole Foods Market in 2017 and began introducing several advanced technologies to streamline in-store shopping a shift that also spread to large retailers Walmart and Target . ""You just can't be a 1990s grocer. You have to be courageous break things and quickly adapt"" said Yael Cosset senior vice president and chief information officer at Kroger who is leading its tech and digital initiatives. In a nod to Alibaba  he said the Chinese e-commerce company ""has done a fantastic job in reinventing the retail model a convergence of brick and mortar with e-commerce in an online and offline world.""

Cosset has been spearheading introduction of the omnichannel shopping experience. Kroger's new retailing links together shopping e-commerce and logistics: automated fulfillment centers bag groceries; vans make same-day deliveries to households; data analytics provide an early read on customer trends; mobile apps distribute customer promotions and coupons; on-premise ""ghost kitchens"" prepare meals for in-store pickup or van delivery; QR codes handle payments online at self check-outs; and large online fulfillment centers and warehouses rely on robots for packing sorting and loading orders. New automated fulfillment centers are a critical part of the technology effort. These centers use AI and robotics to replace labor-intensive work of sorting and bagging groceries for delivery while on-site employees handle such operations as engineering and inventory management. ""When you look at retail there are two big enablers: tech and data science and secondly supply chain logistics and fulfillment"" Zakkour said. ""The lesson that American retailers are learning is that their operations can be more efficient with higher margins when retail and e-commerce are seamlessly integrated."" Zakkour credited Kroger for being one of the more progressive U.S. retailers in implementing this omnichannel approach. Competitors Walmart and Target are spending heavily even in a slowing economy and with technology a focus among current capex investments. ""A company that doesn't have a laser beam focus on tech that Kroger does is vulnerable"" said Jim Russell principal at investment firm Bahl & Gaynor in Cincinnati. ""These digital trends continue to roll forward and Kroger is delivering very strong results in the pandemic and post-pandemic period.""

Digital grocery shopping took off during Covid as customers favored e-commerce eating at home and prepared meals. Kroger's digital business scaled to more than $10 billion in 2020 and has grown by 113 percent during the past two years. Building on this momentum Kroger aims to double its digital revenues by the end of 2023. Kroger digital sales gained by 8 percent in the second quarter of 2022 while in-store and online combined gained 5.8 percent from a year earlier. Supermarkets had been lagging other sectors in e-commerce with three to four percent of total sales but tripled during the pandemic according to McKinsey which predicts that e-commerce will represent 18 percent of supermarket sales within the next three to five years. ""We are finding out now how well this digital shift is working at Kroger"" Russell said. He pointed out that ""half of Kroger's app stores are bringing in incremental business and half are cannibalizing in-store sales."" Total company sales rose 4.1 percent in 2021 to $137.9 billion and Kroger is expecting a gain in the range of 4 percent to 4.5 percent for 2022.

Kyncl formerly the chief business officer at YouTube and an executive at Netflix will receive a base salary of $2 million a target performance-based bonus of $3 million and an annual grant of performance share units with an aggregate pre-tax value of $10 million (the first grant will be in January 2023). He will be reimbursed for expenses up to $500000 for relocating from Los Angeles to the New York metropolitan area. Kyncl’s employment agreement has an indefinite term and includes non-competition and non-solicitation covenants applicable during and for one year following his employment.

Trending on Billboard

With target annual compensation valued at $15 million — subject to Kyncl and WMG hitting performance metrics — Kyncl’s target compensation is less than Cooper’s $17 million ($3 million base salary $7 million target annual bonus and $7 million in annual grant of $7 million worth of restricted stock units according to WMG’s Jan. 19 2022 definitive proxy statement) but not by much. Universal Music’s Grainge earned $48.4 million in 2021 (excluding one-time bonuses paid by UMG’s former owner Vivendi) and topped Billboard‘s inaugural list of most-compensated executives at public music companies. Kyncl’s compensation is more similar to the $13.8 million Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino’s earned in 2021.

On Jan. 31 Cooper will resign from WMG and from the board of directors. He will provide consulting services to WMG through Jan. 31 2024 at his current base salary of $3 million. In addition Cooper will receive equity awards in WMG’s 2023 and 2024 fiscal years with a grant date value of $7 million.

Cooper became WMG’s CEO in 2011 following its acquisition by Access Industries for $3.3 billion. He led the company to a successful IPO in 2020 that valued the company at $12.75 billion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJwcmVhbHR5cGx1cy5jb20vbmV3cy12aWV3cy9wYWxsYXZpLW1vaGFuLXRvLWhlYWQtbWFya2V0aW5nLWNvbW11bmljYXRpb24tZm9yLWVsYW4tZ3JvdXAtMTA3ODQwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pallavi Mohan to Head Marketing & Communication For Elan Group,"Pallavi Mohan a seasoned marketing and communications professional has joined Elan Group as Head of Marketing & Communications.

Tim Levin/Insider

Teslas are by far the most popular electric vehicles in the US — and for good reason.

I tested a 2022 Model Y SUV and came away impressed by its quick acceleration roomy cabin and tech features.

Tesla's extensive Supercharger network is another great reason to buy one of its EVs.

Driving a Tesla for the first time showed me Elon Musk's electric vehicles aren't all hype. In fact there are several solid reasons to strongly consider buying from Tesla instead of one of its many rivals depending on your particular preferences.

The 2022 Model Y SUV I borrowed from a friend recently (Tesla doesn't offer press loans) delivered an attractive combination of cutting-edge tech minimalist design and speedy acceleration. For those reasons and more the popular Y is a great choice for certain buyers — if you can get past its flaws.

Sporty driving

The Tesla Model Y. Tim Levin/Insider

Despite not being the higher-priced Performance version the Model Y Long Range I sampled was plenty sporty. It leaped forward with the fierce acceleration intrinsic to high-powered electric cars. Pair that quickness with precise steering and a stiff suspension and you get an all-wheel-drive SUV that's more agile and exciting to drive than most.

Range fit for road trips

The Tesla Model Y. Tim Levin/Insider

Tesla remains one of the range leaders in the US. The Model Y earns a healthy 330-mile estimate from the Environmental Protection Agency. The model I drove has an EPA range of 318 miles (on account of its larger wheels) which is still more than many EVs on offer today.

Packed with tech

The Tesla Model Y. Tim Levin/Insider

The SUV's crisp and feature-packed touchscreen makes it a tech-lover's paradise.

Practically everything in the vehicle is controlled through the super-responsive display which includes whimsical features like games a digital whoopee cushion for pranking passengers and a web browser. Sentry Mode surveils the area around your parked car and records if it senses something fishy.

Moreover Tesla frequently tweaks capabilities through software updates just like you'd get on a smartphone.

The Tesla Model Y. Tim Levin/Insider

Some people may be repelled by the idea of relying on a digital interface for basic functions like the A/C and windshield wipers. That's understandable. But for anyone interested in a car that's sort of like an iPhone on wheels a Tesla is tough to beat.

Room to stretch out







The Tesla Model Y. Tim Levin/Insider

Tesla takes full advantage of the compactness of electric powertrains to maximize interior space and make things comfortable. After all doing away with a transmission engine and gas tank should open up lots of room for more important things like people.

The Model Y has a flat floor which increases legroom. And its tall glass roof (which is standard) adds to the sense of openness and boosts headroom.

Tons of cargo space

The Tesla Model Y. Tim Levin/Insider

Between bonus areas like an under-floor bin and frunk (front trunk) the Model Y offers loads of storage space before you even get to the regular cargo area.

The Tesla Model Y. Tim Levin/Insider

In all the Y has 76.2 cubic feet of usable storage space with the back seats folded more than most rivals.

Unique minimalist design

The Tesla Model Y. Tim Levin/Insider

Lacking the typical clutter of gauges buttons and vents the Model Y's interior is strikingly minimalist and unlike that of any other car on the road. Some pretty wood trim ensures the cabin doesn't come off as too sterile.

The whole environment made me feel like I was driving something special and bleeding-edge not a regular car.

Effortless Supercharging

The Tesla Model Y. Tim Levin/Insider

Tesla's extensive and exclusive network of Supercharger stations makes it incredibly easy to charge when on the go. I quickly found an available plug in the Y's screen plotted a route and when I showed up the vehicle had already been warming the battery to the ideal temperature for quick charging.

Then I simply hopped out plugged in and the Model Y began slurping up those sweet sweet electrons. This isn't the typical charging experience with other models which can involve fumbling with credit cards phone apps or customer service.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVuY2FycmVwb3J0cy5jb20vbmV3cy8xMTM3MjY4X3Rlc2xhLWNjcy1hZGFwdGVyLW5vcnRoLWFtZXJpY2EtdXAtdG8tMjUwLWt30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,$250 CCS adapter lets Tesla EVs roam other charging networks,"Tesla last week finally released a “CCS Combo 1” adapter for the North American market that will enable some recent models from the automaker to be charged at up to 250 kw at third-party stations such as those from Electrify America or EVgo.

In compatible models it will allow owners to take advantage of a vast network of fast-chargers in the U.S. allowing better access to cross-country charging than those with any other EV.

For now compatibility is limited to newer Model 3 and Model Y vehicles plus the Model S and Model X starting with their 2021 refresh. According to Tesla the adapter will require a retrofit to enable its use for some vehicles and that retrofit won’t be detailed until early 2023. Owners can sign in to see if their vehicle is compatible.

The company also cautions that charge rates may vary from those advertised by third-party stations and that Tesla “does not regulate the pricing or charging experience” at them. That’s by and large an experience that only serves to underscore Tesla’s competitive advantage.

“Most third-party stations are not capable of charging Tesla vehicles at 250 kw” it states outright—essentially setting the bar low and suggesting that the adapter might not deliver near the peak 250 kw even at increasingly common 350-kw charging stations.

Use of the adapter is simple enough. The adapter must first be attached into the end of the charging station’s connector then the adapted Tesla connector is plugged into the vehicle waiting for it to latch the adapter in place before following any on-screen instructions to initiate charging.

Tesla vehicles are not of course compatible with the Plug and Charge functionality allowing some CCS cars to be automatically identified for billing. That will mean Tesla owners will need to initiate a charge with screen prompts an app and/or credit-card swipes.

The experience at CCS stations might get better over time too. “Although the CCS Combo 1 Adapter is designed to work with all CCS 1 charging stations it may be incompatible with some” Tesla also states noting that occasional software updates may affect—and perhaps improve—charging with the adapter.

Starting with the Tesla Model 3’s arrival in Europe in early 2019 every Tesla has included a CCS charge port for that market enabled with a different module behind the charging receptacle. Around the same time Tesla started offering a CCS adapter for Model S and Model X vehicles.

Tesla has offered a CHAdeMO fast-charging adapter for the Model S and Model X for nearly a decade and it opened access to CHAdeMO charging with an adapter for the Model 3 in 2019—a unit that also still applies to the Model Y.

That’s great news for Tesla owners who are less interested in taking a long road trip but simply need an extra 100 miles or more for weekend errands. Although Tesla’s Supercharger network is unrivaled for highway-trip consistency and performance CCS has it beat in terms of close-in metro-area locations. With Tesla’s decision starting earlier this year to no longer include a mobile charger with its vehicles more owners may be seeking CCS as a stopgap in some situations.

GM and EVgo expand major-metro fast charging

According to the U.S. Department of Energy in data regularly updated there are currently 1496 U.S. Tesla Supercharger network locations including 15339 fast-charging connectors. To compare there are 4491 locations offering CCS fast-charging including 8986 connectors.

Tesla has long suggested that it will make the Supercharger network available to those with vehicles of other brands with a CCS adapter—with likely surcharges for slow-charging non-Tesla EVs. Although it’s tested and enabled the idea with a pilot applying to other markets including Norway the UK and much of Europe it hasn’t yet come to the U.S.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvcnF1ZW5ld3MuY29tLzE0MzM1L3doeS10ZXNsYS1tb2RlbC15LWJlc3QtdmVoaWNsZS1idXnSAUdodHRwczovL3d3dy50b3JxdWVuZXdzLmNvbS8xNDMzNS93aHktdGVzbGEtbW9kZWwteS1iZXN0LXZlaGljbGUtYnV5L2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why the Tesla Model Y is the Best Vehicle To Buy,"Follow us today...

Why the Tesla Model Y is the Best Vehicle To Buy

Tesla's are by far the most popular electric vehicles in the US - and for good reason. A 2022 Model Y SUV was tested and the tester came away impressed by its quick acceleration roomy cabin and tech features. A Model Y was recently tested and feedback given.

Tesla's extensive Supercharger network is another great reason to buy one of its EVs. This is incredibly important for any EV so that you can drive on road trips or long range drives and not have to worry about your battery running out of energy.

Driving a Tesla for the first time showed this tester that Elon Musk's EV's are not all hype. There are several solid reasons to buy from Tesla rather than its rivals depending on your particular preferences of course.

The 2022 Model Y SUV that was borrowed from a friend recently delivered an attractive combination of cutting-edge tech minimalist design and speedy acceleration. For these reasons and more the Model Y is a great choice for buyers if you can get past its flaws.

The Tesla Model Y Is Superior

Despite this Model Y not being the higher priced performance version the long range was still plenty sporty. It leaped forward with the fierce acceleration intrinsic to high-powered electric vehicles and that quickness was paired with precise steering and a stiff suspension with the all-wheel-drive.

Tesla vehicles remain the range leaders in the U.S. The Model Y has a healthy 330 mile estimate from the Environmental Protection Agency. The Model that this tester drove has an EPA range of 318 miles which is still more than most EVs available today.

The Model Y SUV has a feature-packed touchscreen. It's a tech-lover's paradise. Practically everything in the vehicle is controlled through the super-responsive center display which includes many different features and everything needed to manage your vehicle. It's like a giant smart phone with wheels.

Some people could be annoyed by the idea of relying on a digital interface for basic functions like the air conditioning and the windshield wipers. That is understandable because cars for many many decades have used buttons and stalks to manage these features. But it's way better to use the center console and your car is like an iPhone on wheels.

There is room to stretch out in the Model Y. There is maximized interior space. Because there is no transmission engine and gas tank there is much more room. There is a tall glass roof and plenty of interior space for people to sit.

The Model Y frunk - the front area has plenty of space. There is an abundance of room so a frunk was added for extra storage. Tesla has better engineering than other EV makers. The Model Y also has plenty of storage space in the back of the vehicle. There is 76.2 cubic feet of usable storage space with the back seats folded.

The interior is a strikingly minimalist feature set. There are plenty of Tesla Super Chargers which when you navigate to will warm your battery to start charging right away. This isn't a typical charging experience. There isn't fumbling with a credit card customer service or anything. Once you link your payment you just plugin and that is it.

What do you think about the Tesla Model Y? Is it the best vehicle on the market today?

Firstly we sought to explore the capacity of XNAzyme FR6_1 to be re-targeted to a variety of classic cancer-associated ‘oncomiR’ microRNAs. Although we have previously found the substrate-binding arms of FR6_1 can be readily redesigned to generate active variants we have observed sequence preferences for the site of RNA cleavage; although catalysis can be observed with substrates bearing all possible nucleobase combinations immediately adjacent to the cleaved phosphodiester the XNAzyme is only able to cleave when an adenine is positioned one nucleotide 3′ of this position (A +1 )(Fig. 1a). We therefore sought to engineer FR6_1 variants to target N^NA motifs (with ^ representing the cleavage site) in mature microRNAs corresponding to members of the miR-17 family in the classic miR-17/92 (oncomiR-1) cluster and its paralogues42 (Fig. 1b). One instance of this motif at positions 10-12 (U^UA) in miR-17 is also the principal location of sequence variation between family members (Fig. 1b) which suggested that targeting this region may yield XNAzymes capable of discriminating between them.

Targeting FR6_1 to this position in miR-17 yielded an active XNAzyme “Fz_miR_17” (Fig. 1c) which site-specifically cleaves a substrate equivalent to the mature miR-17-5p microRNA under quasi-physiological conditions (1 mM Mg2+ pH 7.4 37 °C)(Fig. 1d) with a pseudo-first order pre-steady state catalytic rate constant (k obs = 0.5 h−1)(Fig. 1e) comparable to previous re-targeted variants of FR6_1 65. In order to test the specificity of Fz_miR_17 we compared reactions with miR-17 the other members of the miR-17 family (Fig. 1f) and the unrelated miR-21 for 5 h (the end of the steady-state phase of the cognate reaction): although some ‘off-target’ cleavage of miR-106a and miR-106b could be observed particularly when reactions were allowed to continue to the plateau phase (Supplementary Fig. 1a) Fz_miR_17 showed a clear preference for the cognate target miR-17 (Fig. 1f). These results demonstrate that substrate specificity may be conferred by: (1) the presence or absence (as in miR-93 (Fig. 1b)) of the required A +1  (2) choice of cleavage site dinucleotide (miR-17:U^U is preferred over miR-106a:U^A or miR-106b:U^G (Fig. 1b) consistent with our previous observations65) and/or (3) binding arm complementarity in particular at positions directly flanking the FR6_1 catalytic core – in miR-20a and miR-20b 12 C > U mutations (Fig. 1b) are predicted to replace the basepair rC12:fG7 (Fig. 1c) with a wobble pair which reduces activity. Guided by the latter observation we next prepared a variant of Fz_miR_17 bearing an 7fG > fA mutation in order to make a basepair at this position with miR-20a/b. This yielded “Fz_miR_20a” (Fig. 1g) which was found to be capable of site-specific cleavage of the mature miR-20a under quasi-physiological conditions (1 mM Mg2+ pH 7.4 37 °C)(Fig. 1h) with a similar catalytic rate constant (k obs = 0.4 h−1)(Fig. 1i) as Fz_miR_17 and is likewise selective for the cognate microRNA (Fig. 1j) with discrimination between miR-20a and miR-20b due to cleavage site dinucleotide preference (miR-20a:U^U > miR-20b:U^C). Both Fz_miR_17 and Fz_miR_20a were capable of multiple turnover catalysis under quasi-physiological conditions (Supplementary Fig. 1c d). Encouragingly both XNAzymes were also able to cleave their cognate microRNAs in both tissue culture media and HEK293 cell lysate (Supplementary Fig. 1e f).

We also attempted to design a variant of Fz_miR_17 to specifically target miR-106a (Supplementary Fig. 2a) by exploiting this family member’s 11U > A mutation (Fig. 1b) which creates a C^UA motif as a potential cleavage site specific to miR-106a. However this molecule was found to be inactive under quasi-physiological conditions (Supplementary Fig. 2a). This may be due to stabilisation of a non-catalytic conformation caused by pairing of rC8 in miR-106a with fG24 in the XNAzyme catalytic core (Supplementary Fig. 2a) the equivalent residue to fG27 in the parent FR6_1 which we have previously shown to be crucial for activity. However it is unclear why another variant of the FR6_1 XNAzyme “FR6_1NucSR” containing the same core sequence was previously found to be active on RNA substrate variants bearing an analogous rC including one with a C^UA motif65.

Next we sought to examine whether specific oncomiR cleavage could be extended beyond the miR-17~92 cluster. miR-21 is an abundant well-conserved microRNA implicated in the inflammatory response and inhibition of tumour suppressor gene expression. It is thought to play a key role in cardiovascular disease and is the most consistently upregulated miRNA in a range of aggressive cancers including glioblastoma in which levels of miR-21 significantly correlate with poor prognosis66. We designed a variant of FR6_1 re-targeted to a central N^NA motif in the mature miR-21 (residues 10-12; A^GA). Although this variant (“Fz_miR_21”) was found to be only modestly active (~10% cleavage observed after 20 h under quasi-physiological conditions)(Supplementary Fig. 2b) a screen of mutations in the catalytic core (Supplementary Fig. 2c) previously identified in a re-selection experiment to improve activity of a re-targeted FR6_1 variant65 revealed a variant “Fz_miR_21B” (Fig. 2a) bearing four core mutations that led to a ~14-fold improvement in activity (8fA > fG 10fC > fU 19fC > fU and 25fG > fU) (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Like the other anti-miR XNAzymes Fz_miR_21B site-specifically cleaves its target under quasi-physiological conditions (Fig. 2b) with a comparable catalytic rate constant (k obs = 0.2 h−1)(Fig. 2c) and is highly selective for miR-21 (Fig. 2d) and capable of multi-turnover catalysis (Supplementary Fig. 2d).

In order to benchmark the anti-miR XNAzymes to other microRNA-targeting oligonucleotide catalysts designed to cleave at or close to the same site targeted by Fz_miR_21B we also sought to examine the cleavage of miR-21 using previously described DNAzymes based on 8-17 or 10-23 catalysts (Supplementary Fig. 3) “miR21dz1”48 (Fig. 2e) and “RNV541”49 respectively or an extended variant of the hammerhead ribozyme (Supplementary Fig. 4) “miR21rz1_TLR”48 containing a ‘tetraloop receptor’ (TLR) motif previously shown to improve activity in low [Mg2+]67. However although DNAzyme miR21dz1 was found to be active under high magnesium conditions (10 mM Mg2+) both DNAzyme RNV541 and ribozyme miR21rz1_TLR were found to be inactive (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). Having identified possible errors in the published sequences we synthesised variants “RNV541B” (Fig. 2f) and “miR21rz1_TLRB” (Fig. 2g) with mutations that restored activity (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4).

Although miR-21 cleavage could be observed in high magnesium (10 mM [Mg2+]) catalytic activity of DNAzymes miR21dz1 and RNV541B was substantially reduced or entirely abolished at quasi-physiological magnesium concentrations (1 mM Mg2+)(Supplementary Fig. 3). Ribozyme miR21rz1_TLRB activity was likewise perturbed upon reduction of [Mg2+] (Supplementary Fig. 4) as indeed was Fz_miR_21B activity (Supplementary Fig. 3). Nevertheless in 1 mM [Mg2+] the Fz_miR_21B XNAzyme out-performed both analogous 8-17 and 10-23 DNAzymes (Fig. 2c h i) and the analogous hammerhead ribozyme (Fig. 2j).

We also compared the stability of Fz_miR_21B (FANA) miR21dz1 (DNA) RNV541B (DNA) (Supplementary Fig. 3) and miR21rz1_TLRB (RNA) (Supplementary Fig. 4). Consistent with our previous findings65 Fz_miR_21B (which was not further modified with for example phosphorothioate linkages in the backbone68) exhibited a comparable rate of degradation (half-life ~2 h) as RNV541B (~1.5 h) in 50% human serum at 37 °C whereas miR21dz1 and miR21rz1_TLRB were degraded within minutes or seconds (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4).

Engineering XNAzymes for selective cleavage of hY5 non-coding RNA

Encouraged by the capacity of the FR6_1 XNAzyme to generate catalysts tailored to specific microRNAs we wondered whether this could be extended to longer more structured non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Y RNAs are a family of highly conserved molecules involved in assembly of RNA-protein complexes with a variety of roles including DNA replication and RNA stability and quality control69. Recently Y RNAs were found to be among a set of ncRNAs that can be glycosylated and expressed on the cell surface70 potentially providing a range of ligands and receptors with as yet unknown roles in biology and disease – and may shed light on the involvement of non-coding RNA as antigens in automimmune disease; autoantibodies against the Y RNA hY5 for example can be detected in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)71.

In order to explore the possibility of precise targeting such molecules we chose hY5 as proof of concept and engineered and screened a series of FR6_1 variants targeting a subset of N^NA motifs informed by preferences for cut site dinucleotide combinations (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Two designs (“Fz_hY5_4” and “Fz_hY5_5”) were found to be weakly active (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Transferring the same set of catalytic core mutations found to improve activity of Fz_miR_21B (Fig. 2a) into one of these Fz_hY5_4 yielded “Fz_hY5_4B” (Fig. 3a) an XNAzyme targeted to hY5 residues 46-68 and cleaving between residues 56 and 57 (Fig. 2a)(Supplementary Fig. 5) albeit with a more modest (~10-fold slower) catalytic rate constant (k obs = 0.04 h−1) (Fig. 3b) than the anti-miR XNAzymes. Despite the extensive similarity between hY5 and the other Y RNA family members the Fz_hY5_4B target site contains an A +1 residue that is unique to hY5 (U in hY1/3/4) (Fig. 3c) enabling Fz_hY54B-induced cleavage to be limited specifically to this family member and target sequence. Incubation of Fz_hY5_4B with hY5 RNA (in quasi-physiological conditions) therefore results in cleavage into two RNA products of the expected electrophoretic mobility (55 nts and 28 nts) but no reaction with the other human Y RNAs (Fig. 3d).

Note that unglycosylated versions of the Y RNAs were used in this study as the site and chemical nature of glycosylation linkage to these RNAs is currently unknown70. Full size image

Assembly of a catalytic FANA nanostructure targeting multiple microRNAs

Next we sought to explore whether multiple ncRNA-targeting XNAzymes could be combined into a single multi-functional artificial enzyme. We have previously found that XNAs including FANA can be engineered to self-assemble into simple nanoscale polyhedra72. In principle nanostructure designs can improve biostability by sterically hindering access to 3′ termini by serum exonucleases and promote cellular uptake of nucleic acid catalysts73 and could enable synergistic targeting of multiple microRNAs74.

In order to examine whether this could be applied to the anti-miR XNAzymes we sought to modify the three component sequences of a DNA tetrahedron design previously described by Hollenstein Ahn et al.73 that presents three variants of the 17E DNAzyme on single-stranded edges of the nanostructure. The 17E DNAzyme sequences in the component strands (‘S3’ ‘S4’ and ‘S5’ in ref. 73) were replaced with those of the three anti-miR XNAzymes and the complete sequence of each component strand synthesised as fully-FANA oligonucleotides (“TFz_miR_17” “TFz_miR_20a” and “TFz_miR_21B”) – in principle each component strand contains sequences that hybridise to the other strands enabling self-assembly into the complete 3D catalytic nanostructure (“TFz_miR 3 ”) (Fig. 4a). Examination of self-assembly by non-denaturing native PAGE (Fig. 4b) revealed that in isolation components were somewhat heterogenous yielding smeared bands with electrophoretic mobility equivalent to a mixture of monomers and homodimers which exhibit identical mobility on denaturing page (Supplementary Fig. 6). However an electrophoretic mobility shift equivalent to the assembled tetrahedron (207 nts) was observed when all three components were annealed (Fig. 4b).

First there was celery. Then there was Holland Transplanter.

In 1856 George Taylor emigrated to Kalamazoo from Scotland and brought celery seeds with him. By 1866 many Hollanders had arrived in Kalamazoo and one a gardener named Cornelius DeBruyn developed a “modern” celery. By 1872 Dutch emigrants had turned the muck-lands around Kalamazoo into celery fields.

More:The foresight of the Walshes and Brooks

In 1884 George Souter introduced celery to the east side of Holland growing 25000 celery plants on 5000 acres of land. By 1914 celery production in Hudsonville had matched that of Kalamazoo and production in Hamilton wasn't far behind.

Louis Poll and his twin brothers Benjamin and Henry were well-acquainted with the back-breaking work of hand-planting celery. These three inventors believing they could find a better way began experimenting with hand-operated self-propelled machines that would make celery planting more efficient and less taxing on the body.

By then Louis was married and had his own farm south of Hamilton and Benjamin and Henry also married had moved to Holland. Together in Henry’s chicken coop behind his home — 353 E. Sixth St. — they invented a machine that worked 8-10 times faster than hand-planting.

Word spread quickly. By 1927 the brothers had quit their jobs to work full-time building machines. They called their business the Holland Celery Planter Company.

In the 1930s the brothers replaced their chicken coop manufacturing facility with a larger wooden building. By 1932 they were assembling machines that could transplant lettuce peppers and mint in addition to celery. After a fire in 1935 they added a tile building.

Then the brothers designed horse-drawn machines for planting tobacco and tomatoes. Later they created planters for tree seedlings and became international exporters sending machines to Canada and Northern Europe. Then Gerber Foods asked them to design a spinach harvester. They did but sold the design to a California company.

Next the brothers designed a small engine-propelled garden tractor. But supply chain issues during World War II stopped the project. The government ordered machines to plant grass seed and rubber trees. Uncle Sam wanted to grow grass on the land between newly constructed military runways to keep sand from blowing into plane engines; and rubber trees to supply latex for making tires.

After the war Louis decided to return to farming. He sold his share of the business to Ben and Henry. Because Ben and Henry needed someone to run the office they hired Raymond Kolk a brother-in-law. They also renamed the company Holland Transplanter to reflect its broadened product line.

In 1953 Henry retired to pursue his passion of restoring and collecting antique cars. To do so he and his son Clyde built car museums along U.S.-31. The first museum was south of Holland; the second north of Holland. That year Kolk also left to start his own business Mechanical Transplanter which is still located today at 1150 Central Ave.

To replace Henry and Raymond Ben asked his son-in-law Chuck Knooishuizen to run the office. Later he asked his son Howard and his son-in-law Vern Kraai to join the company as well. Holland Transplanter came out with the first tractor-mounted transplanter which could plant up to twelve rows simultaneously. Then it developed a new plant holder. Boosted by those inventions sales doubled for each of the next four years. Sales of tobacco planters led the way.

Needing more space in 1963 Holland Transplanter relocated to the former Standard Grocery facility at 510 E. 16th St. and over the next four years sold more machinery than its competitors combined.

By 1980 Holland Transplanter controlled over one-half of the market producing 6000 machines with 40 employees. Then the bubble burst as the high interest rates stalled the farm economy.

Next the business created a machine to plant potted greenhouse plants. Later it marketed a black plastic material used to cover crops to reduce weed growth and warm the soil a machine that could plant through it and a machine to lay and remove the plastic mulch. It even built a rotary planter and machine that could dig up tulip bulbs along city streets.

The business continues today.

The donation will help fund the construction of a 72-bed dormitory thereby extending the opportunity of a Williamson education to a greater number of students.

To recognize the gift the college’s new residence hall will bear the Howley name. Founder and chairman W. Nicholas Howley articulates that the foundation’s mission is to support social and economic mobility by providing educational opportunity. He asserts that a quality education combines strong academic instruction with an emphasis on character formation.

Howley is the founder and executive chairman of TransDigm Group Inc. a New York Stock Exchange-listed company. TransDigm is one of the largest worldwide producers of highly engineered aerospace components.

Howley said “We have been very impressed with the program at Williamson. It is a unique institution that offers students a mix of highly employable skills and sound character formation. We are pleased to be able to assist in the expansion of the school’s capacity to provide this outstanding educational opportunity to 20% more students.”

Williamson President Michael Rounds said “Increasing our enrollment over the next five years is one of our strategic goals. We turn away hundreds of applicants each year because we need to have the resources to fund the tuition-free educational costs inclusive of room and board for each student and the facility to house the students. The Howley Foundation’s commitment to Scholarships for Williamson students and Capital Support to build a new dormitory will significantly help us achieve our goals. We are deeply grateful for their partnership with us.”

Rounds stated that over the next five years Williamson will expand the size of its student body and add a new trade to its curriculum. With additional dormitory beds the college will be able to grow its freshman class from 101 to at least 124.

The new dormitory will have 36 double-occupancy student rooms. Each floor of the three-story building will have a student lounge with a kitchenette a large hall bathroom and an apartment for an adult dormitory manager.

Construction will begin in the first half of 2023 so that it will be ready for student occupancy in the fall of 2024.

Williamson students are prepared to be top-tier tradesmen in the workforce. Last year over 200 employers from 16 states attended the career fairs on campus to recruit one of the 65 graduating seniors.

Williamson was established in 1888 through a $2 million gift from Isaiah Williamson.

Williamson has provided an opportunity for financially- challenged young men to receive a tuition free education for a career in the trades. The Williamson educational model emphasizes character development and leadership training.

Williamson graduates 75 percent of students who enroll and 96 percent of the students have employment upon graduation. For more information visit http://Williamson.edu/.

Growing up on a Navajo reservation — coupled with extensive travel and exposure to multiple languages and cultures early on — gave Traci Snowden a unique perspective on the world. Now she’s bridging the equity gap through Apto Global a non-political platform dedicated to travelers and those relocating abroad. It’s designed to help them adapt and overcome cultural differences.

Encouraging us all to “speak human” Traci’s approach moves far beyond just the logistics of travel. And thanks to her incredible efforts to support local internationalization and diversification Mayor John Cooper recently declared June 12 through 19 “Speak Human” Nashville week. Please welcome this week’s FACE of Nashville CEO and co-founder of Apto Global Traci Snowden.

What was the journey that led to creating Apto Global?

I grew up with a lot of love but not a lot of money straddling multiple cultures and languages. By the time I was 12 I had traveled to all but 10 of the 50 states while accompanying my parents on the pow wow and native American art circuit. When I was 13 I was put into an exploratory course for German and thanks to my teacher and parental support I was able to travel to Germany for two summers in high school and my first full year of university. I also started working at age 13. I gained a lot of rudimentary business skills by helping and learning from my parents and my friends’ parents.

When I returned to the U.S. to finish my studies at Miami University of Ohio I started teaching at an immersive language school in downtown Cincinnati. We catered to Procter & Gamble expats from all over the world. That exposed me to the world of global mobility. It taught me two things: one that learning how to adapt to a new community language and culture within the context of that location was powerful and effective and two that there was little to no equity in that approach. I saw executives and upper management getting access to relocation services and resources that would set them up for success and everybody else getting a one-day training or nothing at all.

That stuck with me. Later I would remember that and ponder how technology could solve that equity gap in a world with 2.8 billion humans needing some variation of these services — from students to employees to expats travelers and people in diaspora.

Apto Global’s tagline is “Speak Human.” Can you tell us more about that concept?

For millennia humans have shared authentic stories to adapt connect and succeed. It’s part of our evolution survival and progress. So are war genocide and fear-based nationalism. These polar opposites have both advanced and destroyed us. Yet I’ve been to over 50 countries and everywhere I’ve traveled all humans have something in common. They want to be healthy and happy. They want the best life possible for their families. When we as communities seek to provide that for everyone it statistically yields better results for our local economies.

“Speak human” means a lot of things to a lot of people. Like art we often want people to interpret it for themselves. Internally we hope it will inspire people to find common ground to overcome our differences — like language culture and geography. We are an apolitical platform with no hidden agendas. We want people to explore culture together by sharing and listening to discover how to adapt to life anywhere.

What do you feel are the biggest challenges for those who are traveling or relocating abroad?

We’ve interviewed thousands of travelers and identified three common areas of challenge: logistics language and culture. People need to answer the question “How do I get prepared to travel relocate live adapt connect and succeed?” Organizations need to help them answer that question to attract onboard and retain. Cities need their organizations to do that to effectively thrive economically including attracting Foreign Direct Investment.

Most individuals recognize that logistics planning is hard because it’s the first thing that comes to mind — “I need housing cell phone service a bank account a driver’s license access to healthcare.” But it’s so much more nuanced than that. Most people simply do not have the time energy or funds to pull it all together for themselves. That’s why Apto exists to make it easy to know what to do what to say and how to act so you can feel like yourself and at home.

You’re a world traveler. What is your favorite place thus far?

That is a crazy tough question. I love so many different places for so many different reasons! I love the warmth and hospitality I felt in Ghana the joy of food and music I experienced in Brazil and the attention to detail and remnants of ancient culture that linger in the modern society of Japan … Don’t make me choose!

Where do you eat or shop for a dose of cultural diversity and flavor when you have the traveling bug but can’t leave Nashville?

I love Sonobana and Anatolia for Japanese and Turkish respectively (conveniently located in the same nondescript strip mall in West Nashville). [I love] Nolensville Road and Plaza Mariachi for street tacos and all things Hispanic not to mention there are some halal shops where you can get a whole sheep butchered which brings me back to my childhood on the Navajo reservation. I go to Korea House for my kimchi fix … I could go on and on.

What’s next on the horizon?

Growing the company. That means ensuring that Apto helps Nashville succeed in its mission for deep prosperity and international recognition. The mayor recently declared June 12 through 19 “Speak Human” Nashville week in honor of our efforts to support the internationalization and diversification of our beautiful city.

We’d like to see all universities multinational companies travel tourism and hospitality entities and non-profits taking advantage of our platform to further their goals and help local diverse and international communities interact successfully. Let’s make Nashville a model city. Then let’s do that in roadmap cities across the globe. If we do that successfully we’ll also make our investors very happy.

What’s the best advice you’ve ever received?

“Happiness is a choice.” That’s stuck with me since my mom told me that at age 12. It’s especially applicable to the life I’ve chosen. Entrepreneurship is HARD. You have to choose how you feel in response to all the hardship that will surely come your way; that’s the key to being both resilient and happy throughout that process. I’ll add to that don’t let a bad 24 hours turn into 48 and celebrate all the tiny victories along the way.

Outside of faith family and friends what are three things you can’t live without?

Good music good food and problems that need solving in order to make something about the world better.

You can download Apto Global’s smartphone app for free to experience the magic of this concept firsthand!

AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery is a service that provides recovery of on-premises and cloud-based applications to AWS.

The DR service is part of AWS’ storage portfolio and designed to minimize downtime and data loss.

See below to learn all about AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery:

The cloud disaster recovery market

The global cloud-based data backup and recovery market was estimated to be valued at $9.69 billion in 2021. It’s expected to maintain a CAGR of 9.8% from 2021 to 2030 reaching an estimated value of $22.22 billion by the end of it.

Some of AWS’s leading competitors in the global market include: MozyPro Cloud Backup; SolarWinds Backup; Carbonite; Sonian; ConnectWise Automate; and Rapid Recovery.

AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery key features

AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery works by minimizing the downtime and data loss windows through a seamless and reliable data recovery process from on-premises and cloud-based backups.

“AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (AWS DRS) provides scalable cost-effective recovery of applications to AWS. One of the benefits is that you only pay for what you use” says Jack Tilson Solutions Architect at AWS.

“When considering DR solutions it’s important to consider the target recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO) for the workloads you want to protect. Not all workloads are created equal. … With AWS DRS it’s possible to achieve an RPO of seconds and an RTO of minutes.”

AWS Elastic DR works directly on the source servers performing regular data replication for the backup process.

It maintains the readiness and availability of the replicated data during normal operations but the recovery process can be initiated within minutes restoring some or all of the data from a server or a set point in time.

Some of AWS Elastic DR’s key features include:

Reserves DR sites and computing power only when needed

Non-disruptive tests for recovery performed in the background

Fast recovery of applications to any point in time

Flexible access to AWS servers for replications and backups

On-premises to AWS servers recovery operations

Perform backups and recovery cross AWS regional servers

Ability to run cloud-based applications natively on AWS cloud

Optimizes for data availability

Offers multiple point-in-time recovery options

Streamlines recovery for cloud-based and on-premises applications

AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery use cases

The following case studies highlight how organizations in different industries are using AWS Elastic DR:

Southeast Iowa Regional Medical Center

The Southeast Iowa Regional Medical Center is a comprehensive health care facility.

Looking to improve their data management and HER system’s DR capabilities the medical center turned to Healthcare Triangle which assists health care facilities to scale their digital infrastructure.

Upon recommending AWS Elastic DR the Iowa hospital set up a secondary site for their data on AWS and used automated features.

“Using AWS we were able to offload the entire solution without anyone outside of our team knowing what was going on. There was no impact on database times and no impact on internet connectivity” says Shane Tapper systems executive of informatics Southeast Iowa Regional Medical Center.

“Point-in-time recovery was a nice benefit when we first looked at the product but it’s starting to become a requirement given how large a target health care now is.”

Switching to AWS Elastic DR Southeast Iowa Regional Medical Center was able to improve recovery time by 67% and reliably replicate and back up 14 TB of critical operations data.

Tyler Technologies

Tyler Technologies is a U.S.-based software company that works predominantly with the public sector.

Working in software means that Tyler Technologies is at any time responsible for large amounts of data belonging to the public sector.

With their on-premises DR solution unable to keep up with the company’s expansion they decided to start using AWS Elastic DR for their data recovery needs.

“It was exponentially faster than every other solution that we looked at which would build and then restore data elements after an event. Although those solutions were an option the tradeoff was definitely speed” says Christopher Armstrong director of information security Tyler Technologies.

“We are confident in our recoverability. Using AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery helps us to sleep better at night.”

By utilizing AWS Elastic DR Tyler Technologies was able to perform recovery 12x faster protect over 4000 virtual machines and effectively scale their DR infrastructure to correlate with business growth.

AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery Differentiators

AWS Elastic DR can stand out in the disaster recovery market for several reasons:

Regional availability

AWS Elastic DR allows users to recover data quickly from servers based all around the world: North America Africa Asia-Pacific Europe the Middle East and South America.

Operating in any of these locations AWS Elastic DR can be used to recover all systems databases and applications that run on Windows or Linux. It also enables users to recover applications from physical infrastructure on AWS VMware vSphere Microsoft Hyper-V and standard cloud infrastructure.

Non-disruptive fail-back testing

AWS Elastic DR supports non-disruptive fail-back testing allowing users to validate their system’s capacity in the event of a server failure and allocate the needed resources toward it.

Using this capability replication of databases and applications doesn’t get interrupted and the entirety of the test is conducted on a separate testing machine.

No public internet access

AWS Elastic DR doesn’t require a constant connection to a public internet network. It can function at full capacity using the AWS PrivateLink for connecting to fail-back testing servers and performing DR replications.

This enables users to keep databases and applications off public internet connections reducing security risks and optimizing bandwidth usage.

Process monitoring and management

Being connected to the AWS ecosystem of solutions AWS Elastic DR’s processes can be managed through identity access management (IAM) providing configurable and granular authorization control for APIs.

In just 40 seconds on the morning of Sept. 26 2002 Lola Elwood Lisa Bryant Jo Mausbach and Samuel Sun employees at the US Bank branch in the northeast Nebraska town and a customer at the counter Evonne Tuttle had been gunned down the terrible crime captured on video and in the accounts of two employees who survived the nightmare.

Jose Sandoval walked to the front quickly shooting Sun Tuttle and Mausbach.

Erick Vela and Jorge Galindo went to offices on either side Vela shooting Bryant and Galindo shooting Elwood then firing at a customer who started to walk in.

The three left empty-handed as the five died.

Police later would describe the acrid smell of spent gunpowder and blood heavy in the air when they arrived.

Within hours Sandoval Galindo and Vela would be locked up for it after stopping at a McDonald's in O'Neill 75 miles away.

But nothing else in the cases has happened quickly.

The three ultimately landed on death row Sandoval and Galindo after being found guilty at trial and Vela after pleading guilty.

Separate three-judge panels found their crimes warranted death sentences.

Then came automatic appeals all rejected.

But in the years since legal twists complicated matters. First a U.S. Supreme Court decision over how it's determined who gets life versus death. Then Nebraska lawmakers' repeal of the death penalty in 2015 which voters reinstated the next year.

Attorneys argued the sentences for everyone on the state's death row had been commuted to life in prison. And they've raised dozens of other issues that they say should lead to a new trial or a life sentence rather than death for them.

In March 2019 the state filed a response in Sandoval's case arguing the district judge should deny his motion for post-conviction relief without a hearing.

""The case files and records affirmatively show that the defendant is entitled to no relief"" Solicitor General James Smith wrote.

But court records indicate in the three and a half years since the filing District Judge Geoffrey C. Hall of Fremont has yet to rule either way.

In Vela's case his attorney Jerry Hug told a federal court judge this May that he anticipated progression of the state court proceedings ""with the understanding that the state court records of the petitioner’s capital case are voluminous and have necessarily involved considerable time to gather review and organize. Additional time will be required for briefing submission and a state court decision.""

And Hug referenced a number of postconviction cases pending resolution in the Nebraska Supreme Court including Galindo's.

At oral arguments Sept. 1 Adam Sipple Galindo's attorney tried to convince the justices that a district court judge was wrong to deny a hearing on a motion for post-conviction relief.

In a 138-page motion filed in 2019 he detailed a laundry list of issues including the state's last-minute disclosure it was going to present evidence of Galindo's alleged involvement in the death of Travis Lundell a 21-year-old who had gone missing a month before the bank robbery in pursuit of a death sentence.

""When Mr. Galindo's sentencing case is assessed and evaluated consistent with the law and consistent with the Constitution his youth his confession his cooperation and his demonstrated remorse provide a strong case to spare him from execution"" Sipple said.

He said there were two huge issues that could have led to a life sentence if the sentencing panel had known. One his trial counsel's failure to introduce the evidence of remorse. And two his failure to argue Galindo's youth as a mitigating factor.

Sipple said defense counsel at sentencing left sworn deposition testimony in his file from among others a captain at the jail who told a defense investigator that Galindo expressed remorse to him and another jail deputy and testimony from a teacher who said he was immature and easily influenced by others.

He also raised issues over a criminal investigation by the Nebraska State Patrol of the lead prosecutor Madison County Attorney Joe Smith ""including his associations with drug-dealing suspects he called as jailhouse informants against Galindo.""

But Justice Jonathan Papik said even if they found that trial counsel had been deficient and that the panel shouldn't have considered Lundell as an aggravator ""Wouldn't we then have to ask 'Well is there prejudice?'""

Is there a reasonable probability that the outcome would be different he asked.

Sipple agreed but said the allegations created legitimate issues warranting an evidentiary hearing which would lead to findings.

On the other side James Smith the solicitor general said even if the sentencing panel didn't consider the Lundell evidence and did consider Galindo's youth and remorse it wasn't sufficient to outweigh all the aggravating circumstances.

""In short if you go in and murder five innocent people saying that 'Gee I shouldn't get the death sentence because I really didn't kill the sixth' that doesn't really indicate a prejudicial error in the sentencing that would justify having a futile evidentiary hearing"" he argued.

The Supreme Court hasn't yet ruled.

Norfolk Mayor Josh Moenning wasn’t living there on Sept. 25 2002.

“But as a native of the area I precisely recall the shock and bewilderment I experienced upon hearing the news” he told the Journal Star on Friday.

Moenning called it an unthinkable horror that sent shockwaves throughout the community and entire state.

“Norfolk’s response though was telling” he said. “Immediately the community embraced the victims’ families supported their needs and recognized the importance of honoring their loved ones’ legacies.

""Ultimately created in the place of these heinous crimes was a place of solace and peace — a natural landmark that to this day welcomes travelers on U.S. Highway 81 with a profound message: love and community always outlasts hate and violence.”

MFA attacks are a form of social engineering consisting in spamming a target with repeated MFA requests until they eventually authorize access. This kind of attacks is possible when the threat actor has gained access to corporate login credentials but cannot access the account due to multi-factor authentication.

According to Uber

It is likely that the attacker purchased the contractor’s Uber corporate password on the dark web after the contractor’s personal device had been infected with malware.

To make sense of the likeliness of an MFA fatigue attack to succeed security researcher Kevin Beaumont recalled on Twitter this is the same technique used in the recent LAPSUS$ attacks about which the attacker allegedly explained: ""call the employee 100 times at 1AM while he is trying to sleep and he will more than likely accept it"".

In Uber's case the approach was different though. As reported by Lawrence Abrams for Bleeping Computer security researcher Corben Leo got in touch with the hacker behind the breach and learned they contacted the targeted contractor on WhatsApp claiming they were from Uber IT and that the only way to get rid of the unstopping notifications was to accept one.

Once the attacker got their device authorized for access to Uber intranet they began scanning the corporate network until they found a PowerShell script with admin credentials for the platform Uber uses to manage its login secrets including DA DUO Onelogin AWS and Gsuite. This allowed them to grab source code and more worryingly to get access to Uber's HackerOne bug bounty program. This in turn gave the attacker information about vulnerability reports that have not been fixed yet.

In conversation with InfoQ Cerby's chief trust officer Matt Chiodi stated that ""if what’s being reported is true this would be an unprecedented level of access even when compared to SolarWinds"". One way to mitigate the impact of such incidents according to Chiodi is applying a Zero Trust strategy consisting in trusting no device even within corporate network boundaries.

Zero Trust principles can greatly contain the blast radius. For example IBM found in its research that when Zero Trust principles are implemented by a company the cost of a breach is reduced by 42%.”

Varun Badhwar founder and CEO of stealth-mode startup Endor Labs released a statement for InfoQ hinting at the resurgence in social engineering and phishing attacks of late.

According to the 2022 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report 82% of breaches last year involved the human element. That’s astronomical number and it demonstrates humans are still the weakest link in cybersecurity.

In Badhwar's view this further reinforces the idea of applying zero trust and least privilege principles for securing employee access to sensitive data and code.

Uber's investigation into this recent breach is not complete yet and it will likely bring more light into it. InfoQ will continue informing as new detail emerge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kdWtlY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjIvMDkvZHVyaGFtLXB1YmxpYy10cmFuc3BvcnRhdGlvbi10cmlhbmdsZS1nb2R1cmhhbS11YmVyLWR1a2Utc3R1ZGVudC1ndWlkZS10by1saXZpbmctdWJlci1mcmVl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to live Uber-free: A Duke student's guide to the Triangle's public transportation,"In search of a public transit guide for your next car-free adventure off campus?

""On the evening of Thursday 22 September 2022 the City of London Police arrested a 17-year-old in Oxfordshire on suspicion of hacking"" the agency said adding ""he remains in police custody.""

The department said the arrest was made as part of an investigation in partnership with the U.K. National Crime Agency's cyber crime unit.

No further details about the nature of the investigation were disclosed although it's suspected that the law enforcement action may have something to do with the recent string of high-profile hacks aimed at Uber and Rockstar Games.

Both the intrusions are alleged to have been committed by the same threat actor who goes by the name Tea Pot (aka teapotuberhacker).

Uber for its part has pinned the breach on an attacker (or attackers) that it believes is associated with the LAPSUS$ extortion gang two of whom are facing fraud charges.

According to cybersecurity company Flashpoint the real world identity of the hacker behind the two incidents is said to have been outed on an online illicit forum.

""The administrator for that forum claimed that teapotuberhacker was the same individual who had allegedly hacked Microsoft and 'owned' Doxbin"" the company disclosed Friday.

This also means that the teapotuberhacker actor is likely the same party who is also known by the aliases White Breachbase and WhiteDoxbin and is believed to be ""LAPSUS$'s apparent ringleader.""

It's not immediately clear if these allegations hold water but if true could explain the latest arrest by law enforcement officials.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMTEyNDY2ODUvQnJpdGlzaC1ib3ktMTctY2hhcmdlZC1oYWNraW5nLVViZXItR3JhbmQtVGhlZnQtQXV0by1kZXZlbG9wZXItUm9ja3N0YXIuaHRtbNIBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTExMjQ2Njg1L2FtcC9Ccml0aXNoLWJveS0xNy1jaGFyZ2VkLWhhY2tpbmctVWJlci1HcmFuZC1UaGVmdC1BdXRvLWRldmVsb3Blci1Sb2Nrc3Rhci5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,British boy 17 is charged with hacking Uber and Grand Theft Auto developer Rockstar,"A 17-year-old boy from Oxfordshire in England has been arrested in relation to recent high-profile hackings of Uber and Grand Theft Auto developer Rockstar.

According to reporting from Matthew Keys' The Desk the unnamed teen is being held on charges that include conspiracy to attack at least two computing systems.

A brief statement from the City of London Police Department confirmed the arrested of a 17-year-old in Oxfordshire on suspicion of hacking on the night of September 22.

The teenager was apprehended at his mother's house where he lives.

He was arrested by the UK's National Cyber Crime Unit in cooperation with counterparts from the FBI in the United States

Due to his age he has not been named although The Desk shared a pixelated photo of the boy out fishing. The police in London have said he remains in custody as the investigation continues.

He appeared in youth court in the UK today to answer to two counts of breach of bail conditions and two counts of computer misuse. Youth courts in England are not open to the public.

In retweeting the City of London Police statement the BBC's Joe Tidy wrote: 'This is very significant. But we can't say why because of reporting restrictions...'

On September 18 the hacker released gameplay of Grand Theft Auto VI the next installment of the best-selling video game in one of the biggest leaks in gaming history.

The hack saw the release of 90 videos of gameplay as well as revealing the identity of the game's protagonists including for the first time a playable female character named Lucia.

The hacker was identified by the initials AK by The Desk and by the online moniker Teapottuberhacker.

Due to his age the suspect in the hacking has not been named

The original post by the alleged hacker known as Teapottuberhacker announcing the leak

Grand Theft Auto is one of the biggest-selling brands in gaming; the upcoming Grand Theft Auto VI has been in development since 2014

At the time of the GTA leak the hacker also claimed to be behind the cyber attack on Uber

The Desk went on to report that AK is associated with the hacker group Laspu$$ which has been linked to the hacks of Samsung Microsoft and Cisco.

The group usually steals source code from tech companies and then holds it for ransom while threatening to release it publicly thus making companies vulnerable for further infiltration.

Following those incidents AK was reported to have been living with his mother in Oxfordshire while those cases are pending.

His actions were also being investigated by the FBI.

A hacker has released gameplay of Grand Theft Auto VI the next installment of the best-selling video game in one of the biggest leaks in gaming history

At the time of the GTA leak the hacker also claimed to be behind the cyber incident at Uber.

Later he posted a message on the forum about seeking to 'negotiate a deal' with Take-Two Interactive Software owner of Rockstar which publishes the GTA games.

Multiple reports have said the hacker gained access through the company's Slack communication channels.

The hacker gained access by lying to employees of Uber and Rockstar and impersonating an IT worker reports the New York Times.

The unprecedented leak includes over an hour of footage showing robberies gunplay and open-world driving and was posted on the GTAForums message board last weekend.

It also shows some fully voiced conversations between characters including a female protagonist in a fictionalized modern-day Miami known as Vice City.

In a statement published on its social channels Rockstar said it was 'extremely disappointed' to have details on the game shared in this way but claimed the leak would not delay the project.

'We recently suffered a network intrusion in which an unauthorized third party illegally accessed and downloaded confidential information from our systems including early development footage for the next Grand Theft Auto' Rockstar said in a statement.

'At this time we do not anticipate any disruption to our live game services nor any long-term effect on the development of our ongoing projects.

'We are extremely disappointed to have any details of our next game shared with you all in this way.

'Our work on the next Grand Theft Auto game will continue as planned and we remain as committed as ever to delivering an experience to you our players that truly exceeds your expectations.

'We will update everyone again soon and of course will properly introduce you to this next game when it is ready. We want to thank everyone for their ongoing support through this situation.'

Multiple videos have been removed from YouTube and Twitter at the request of Take-Two confirming the legitimacy of the substantial leak which was first reported by Bloomberg News on Sunday.

Take-Two has also reportedly ordered two of the largest online Grand Theft Auto communities to take down any links to the GTA VI footage.

'Do not share media or links to leaked copyrighted material. Discussion is allowed' a banner on GTAForums' homepage read.

The hacker who goes by the name Teapottuberhacker claimed that the videos were downloaded from a Slack channel likely belonging to a Rockstar employee

'It's a PR disaster possibly sets back production and hurts morale' financial services company Jefferies wrote in a client note warning the potential leak of the game's source code could pose a bigger threat.

'If the source code leaks it could necessitate significant changes under the hood of the game to ensure its stability and the server integrity of GTA VI Online once it launches.'

Gamers and investors have been waiting for years for the release of GTA VI the development of which was confirmed in February leading to a more than 7 percent jump in Take-Two shares.

In July it was revealed the game will be set in a fictionalized version of Miami and will feature a playable female protagonist for the first time.

The woman who is said to be 'Latina' will allegedly be one of a pair of leading characters in a story influenced by the bank robbers Bonnie and Clyde.

The release could offer a much-needed boost to the US gaming company which forecast weak annual sales in August.

The gaming industry considered by some analysts as 'recession proof' has started to see some weakness as inflation-hit consumers rein in spending on entertainment.

Shares of Take-Two Interactive Software tumbled nearly 6 per cent in pre-market trading on Monday following the report.

However Jefferies analysts were optimistic about the game's success.

'Based on what we see the game is further along than many believe and (the leak) won't impact game reception/sales' the analysts said.

GTA VI is estimated to generate bookings of $3.5 billion at launch and an annual average of $2 billion thereafter according to Bank of America Global Research.

Many developers shared public support for Rockstar following the leak including Xbox corporate vice president Sarah Bond.

'My thoughts are with the team at Rockstar Games' Bond wrote.

'It can be disheartening to have a project you’ve worked hard on to delight fans revealed and critiqued before it’s ready.

'I know they’re creating something special and can’t wait to experience GTA6 when it’s officially unveiled.'"

For those of you that have never slugged anything before Dr. Deanne Mraz Robinson a board-certified dermatologist and co-founder of Modern Dermatology explained that it’s the nighttime process of layering nourishing and ingredient-rich oils or treatments on your nails and surrounding areas before following up with a hand cream and finally a rich occlusive layer. Arguably one of the most important aspects of slugging this thicker layer is typically a petroleum jelly that works to seal everything in prevent transepidermal water loss and promote better product absorption.

“Slugging really only seals in whatever you’ve applied beneath it so it’s important to seek out high quality ingredients in your cuticle oil serum [and] hand cream for this to really be an effective strategy” Robinson said.

If you have nails that are thin and peeling or cuticles that are raw and painfully dry then it might be worth your while to keep scrolling to see the steps and products that Chacon Robinson and other dermatologists recommend so you and your nails can live their best slug life.

And if spring touted the festival look and summer skin was all about a “Glazed Donut” finish then fall calls for a sophisticated upgrade that will usher in the cooler months (and warmer clothes). It’s time to leave behind the punchy fruity shades that popped next to sun-kissed skin in favor of more subtle tones with softer finishes. That’s where a softer more matte look comes in for the new season.“Matte makeup is a good option for those with combination to oily skin who want more of a polished finish whether it’s for everyday life events or photographs” explains Suzie Gerstein celebrity makeup artist. “The good news is that many of the new matte formulas offer shine control without going ‘newscaster’ flat.”

Matte makeup does require a few more products to get it just right without looking super heavy or cakey compared to a highly dewy or glossy look but that doesn’t mean it’s not worth the effort. To create a perfect clean slate for bold colors and velvety matte textures Nicole Cudzilo Vapour Beauty’s National Makeup Artist says she actually opts out of an oil-free moisturizer for matte skin as it’s important to ensure that you skin is deeply moisturized (and some oil-free formulas offer a lighter dose of hydration) in order for your makeup to lay smooth.

A primer is also an important first step for matte makeup (although you can go without it if you’re really pressed for time) but if you choose to use a primer she has a trick to make the formula even more effective: “To avoid that dreaded cakey finish consider dusting on a light coat of translucent powder after your primer but before foundation or concealer” she says. “This will extend the longevity of any products you lay over top and will also combat shine.”

If you’re ready to try the matte makeup look this season read on for all the ways to wear this fall-friendly trend.

Primer

The first step (especially if you have oily skin) should be a mattifying primer to help control shine and prevent excess buildup before applying any makeup. This will not only keep foundation in place but will create a grease-free canvas for anything that comes afterward. “I like to use a matte primer on the forehead and down the sides of the nose and then leave the rest of the face alone” adds Gerstein.

Foundation

Another key component to the matte look is foundation which of course comes in many different forms. Celebrity makeup artist Jamie Greenberg recommends looking for a light serum with nourishing skin care benefits or a pressed mineral foundation because both are super buildable. “Take your time and apply with a stippling or blending brush and make sure to blend around the neck” she says. She loves the Pur 4-in-1 Mineral Foundation for its lightweight texture and natural looking finish.

Concealer

“For raised areas that can be trickier to cover I recommend laying down a matte primer first and then applying the concealer with a small concealer brush in thin layers then topping with translucent powder” says Gerstein. Her favorite is Jillian Dempsey’s Spot Stick Concealer for its convenient stick and the dry texture because it’s easy to manipulate.

Blush

For cheeks Cudzilo likes Rare Beauty’s Soft Pinch Liquid Blush as it applies like a liquid but dries down to a matte finish making it perfect for those with combo-oily skin. “For the easiest application place a dab of product onto a makeup palette or the back of your hand before picking it up with a brush” she says.

Powder

Cudzilo stresses that it’s important to allow your skin care products to fully absorb in order to lock out shine. She also applies a tiny amount of shine control powder with the “press and roll technique” before foundation — after picking up a small amount of product hold the brush close to the top press the fibers onto the skin and then roll the brush as you lift it off. “Start setting the center of your face and work your way out” she says. Her favorite is Vapour’s Perfecting Pressed Powder to neutralize unwanted shine.

Lipstick

Brittany Lo professional makeup artist and founder of Beia suggests lining lips with a soft matte liner prior to applying lipstick for a natural looking base. “For an even more matte look dust some setting powder on lips to remove any shine” she says. She likes Sephora’s Cream Lip Stain Satin Lipstick for its long-lasting tinting powers.

Lipliner

Matte lipliners tend to have the extra perk of being waterproof so you can use them to fill in the entire lip for long-lasting staying power adds Cudzilo. “For a professionally sculpted result alternate between your pencil and a tiny angled brush to perfect and carve out your shape as you apply” she says. “And always make sure to keep your liner sharpened to a fine point.” She likes Nars Velvet Matte Lipstick Pencil for its ability to gently wash over lips without any dryness.

Eyeshadow

“A matte eyeshadow serves as a beautiful base for lids” says Lo. “Feel free to blend it up to the brows and add dimension with smudged liner or dark shadow along the lash line for more depth.” She likes Bobbi Brown’s Eye Shadow in Antique Rose. And don’t forget a lid primer to help your product stay put without any creases (the Urban Decay formula is a classic).

The little boy whose father is Travis Scott was originally introduced to the world as Wolf but the make-up maven later told fans she and her beau reneged on the moniker.

On Thursday's episode of their reality show four-year-old True is heard chatting to her mother Khloe shortly after she welcomed a new baby boy via surrogate with True referring to her baby brother as 'Snowy'.

But as her mother corrects that Snowy is not the baby's name fans are now speculating that it could be the name of Kylie's son - with True just getting her new brother and cousin confused.

Did she spill the beans? Fans who watched the season two premiere of Hulu's The Kardashians think Khloe Kardashian's daughter True Thompson may have revealed the name of Kylie Jenner's son

The episode documented the birth of Khloe's second child with love rat Tristan Thompson - with their firstborn child True meeting her new baby brother virtually.

During a FaceTime call True shouted 'Hi Snowy!' to the newborn before Khloe corrected her daughter: 'His name is not Snowy.'

During the episode Khloe joked that her son is 'No Name Johnson' because she's yet to decide on her son's moniker.

But the random 'Snowy' name drop has fans thinking that True could have actually gotten her new baby brother confused with another new baby in the family - her auntie Kylie's seven-month old son.

Viewers took to social media to speculate that True could've revealed her cousin's name to the audience when meeting her new brother.

'PLACE YOUR BETS!' TikTok user Marissa Spagnoli wrote in a caption accompanied by a video explaining her theory.

She clarified in a comment 'She's associating the baby brother thing to kylies baby since he was just born!' with other fans agreeing with her.

Talking about her own newborn Kylie said she was excited for him to have a 'forever friend' in Khloe's son.

Speculation: On Thursday's episode True four is heard referring to her baby brother as 'Snowy' shortly after his birth but it may have been a mixup

Introduction: Khloe showed her mom her new son via FaceTime in a segment from the new Kardashians episode

The beauty guru and beau Travis previously named their new son Wolfie before backtracking and changing their mind.

Earlier this month while on The Late Late Show Kylie Jenner told host James Corden her son still doesn't have a name.

She explained that the baby is legally still Wolf Webster: 'His name is still Wolf his passport is Wolf but that isn't gonna be his name. We're just waiting and simmering. We don't call him Wolf' she said.

The 25-year-old said she and her rapper boyfriend are 'waiting and simmering' and have narrowed down options.

It seems the hold up is Travis 31 who comes up with 'cool' name ideas but continuously changes his mind.

When the late-night host asked whether the name is still animal-themed the reality star replied 'No.'

In addition to their son the couple shares daughter Stormi Webster four.

Back in April her older sister Kim told Live with Kelly and Ryan: 'There's one name lingering but she really wants to make sure.'"

Over the last three years United Parcel Service (UPS 1.79%) has produced a higher total return than the S&P 500 and the industrial sector. And even after its 4.5% decline on Friday in response to a bleak outlook from FedEx (FDX 0.91%) UPS stock is barely underperforming the market this year.

The issue is that UPS last reported earnings in late July. And if the industry is as bad as FedEx is making it out to be then there's a risk that UPS will cut its full-year guidance and report worse-than-expected results when it announces earnings in late October.

Here's why UPS remains a buy despite FedEx's warnings and why investors would do well not to assume that UPS will cut its guidance to the same degree as FedEx did.

The better bellwether

Despite not even cracking the top 100 S&P 500 stocks by market cap many investors still turn to FedEx for a reading on the broader economy. On Sept. 16 financial headlines focused on FedEx's pre-announcement and many fear that FedEx's guidance for lower package delivery volumes signals weaker consumer demand.

While FedEx accounts for a large share of U.S. package delivery volume it provides more of a premium service than the U.S. Postal Service Amazon or even UPS. Its main premium service is expedited shipping through FedEx Express.

In fiscal 2022 FedEx Ground only accounted for 36% of revenue and 42% of total operating income while FedEx Express made up nearly half of revenue and 47% of operating income. FedEx Express continues to be the company's differentiating factor.

The drawback of FedEx Express is that its performance can be relatively volatile benefiting when customer demand is good and the economy is growing and slipping when the company's customers are facing compressed margins and begin cutting back on expedited shipping.

Meanwhile UPS should be viewed as more of a bulk shipping service. In 2021 its U.S. domestic package revenue accounted for 64% of total revenue while U.S. domestic package delivery made up 55% of total adjusted operating profit.

UPS and FedEx operate sizable high-margin international and freight segments. But the main difference between the two is that FedEx focuses on speed and convenience while UPS leans into affordable solutions that cater to a mix of residential customers big companies and small and medium-size businesses. In sum UPS is a better bellwether as a package delivery company than FedEx is.

The better business

Although UPS could cut its guidance when it reports earnings in October the differences between FedEx and UPS mean that the two companies are not an apples-to-apples comparison. The nature of FedEx Express might lead you to believe that FedEx tends to sport higher margins than UPS. But the opposite is true.

Beginning about eight years ago UPS began to separate itself from FedEx consistently posting much higher operating margins. UPS' success with small and medium-size businesses the healthcare industry automotive and its ""better not bigger"" framework have led to improved routes and efficient operations and UPS now is much more profitable than FedEx. One of the best ways to understand the differences between UPS and FedEx is by looking at the 10-year changes in capital expenditures (capex) revenue and operating income.

You'll notice that FedEx routinely spends more on capex than UPS. In fact its trailing-12-month (TTM) capex is at a 10-year high while UPS' TTM capex is at a five-year low. Although UPS makes slightly more revenue than FedEx its TTM operating income is more than double that of FedEx proving the company is much better at converting similar sales into higher profits.

UPS is an excellent long-term buy

UPS has a market cap of around $154 billion compared to FedEx's $42 billion market cap after Friday's sell-off. Although FedEx looks cheaper UPS remains a better buy.

The company has done a superior job managing expectations and exceeding goals ahead of schedule. The profitability of its business not to mention its ability to register a higher operating margin while deploying less capex is a testament to why it is a better company to invest in than FedEx.

If FedEx turns itself around it could very well outperform UPS given the depressed levels in its stock price. But with UPS' 3.3% dividend yield a reasonable valuation and an impeccable management team investors would do well to take advantage of the dip in UPS stock.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2IxODhkNjJjLTk3YTYtNDNhNC1hNjI5LWJkYzZjY2NjYjljN9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wall St blames missteps at FedEx as parcel service fails to deliver,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.ft.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /content/b188d62c-97a6-43a4-a629-bdc6ccccb9c7 (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673EC4BEB0>, 'Connection to www.ft.com timed out.

The report which formed the basis of the revocation of the contracts of the 17 institutions shows that the healthcare service providers did not only bypass the law but also abused their privileges.

The facilities made claims sometimes running into millions of shillings for services not provided or for those without supporting documents.

In other cases they colluded with some schools to defraud the government by making claims for payments without attending to students.

The Edu-Afya programme is a comprehensive secondary school students' medical scheme that was launched by former President Uhuru Kenyatta under Universal Health Coverage.

Its implementation is however at the centre of tension between NHIF board chairman Lewis Nguyai and CEO Peter Kamunyo.

The chairman has accused the CEO of suspending the contracts of the 17 institutions without involving the board but some board members who spoke with Sunday Nation in confidence said they were aware of the audit.

The report shows that some claims were not supported by relevant medical documents and sometimes school leave-out documents for students failed to provide health records; did not adhere to contract guidelines; or failed to maintain theatre notes for sampled cases.

Others also conducted procedures and admitted students before receiving approvals while some issued late notifications to the insurer.

In other cases dates of admission and discharge in patients’ files were not the same as those in the NHIF system.

In one case noted in the report one of the facilities claimed Sh40000 for two maternity cases under Edu-Afya instead of the Linda Mama programme.

Cases of outpatient services were also being claimed as an inpatient in one instance leading to the loss of Sh26000 claimed by one of the institutions.

“There were also cases of claims being made for procedures different from the ones carried out for the registered member amounting to an overpayment of Sh70000 and Sh120000. Another 3855 students said to have visited hospitals for treatment could not be proved leading to a loss of some Sh5.78 million” it reads.

Supporting documents

In another case some 905 students who are said to have visited a health facility could not be proved for lack of supporting documents leading to the loss of some Sh1.3 million.

This was also the case with another 22 visits leading to the loss of another Sh33000. “Hospital visits by another 924 students were not supported by introductory letters from the school principals or their designate.

This led to the loss of Sh924000. Another 1429 claims were made above contract amount of Sh1000 leading to the overpayment of Sh741500 and 120 amounting to Sh180000.”

The report says that with the cases identified it had become difficult for NHIF to verify whether it received value for money under the scheme leading to the suspension of the said facilities.

One facility recorded the ailment of 13 students who had been circumcised as typhoid pneumonia severe malaria convulsion and dysentery.

“The HCP officials amended the notifications in the system without indicating reasons for the cancellations thus misusing the system right.”

The audit was the work of a joint standing committee between NHIF and the ministry of education. It was conducted in February for the cover period of January 2021 to December 2022.

A multi-agency team was tasked with the responsibility of investigating the said institutions following reports that a number of them were abusing the Edu-Afya programme.

Mr Nguyai told Sunday Nation that the CEO had suspended the 17 institutions without involving the board contrary to the NHIF Act.

“I have been trying to guide the CEO. My role is to guide him on the rule of law and nobody is above the law.”

Contacted however Mr Kamunyo said his decision was guided by the law adding that the suspension was part of an ongoing investigation into Edu-Afya.

“What usually happens when a violation is identified is that an institution is suspended for 90 days and then given the right of reply. And after an investigation is completed a decision is made by the board” he said.

“And so the investigation of the said institutions began in April and an internal audit report was tabled on Thursday. Many facilities were investigated.”

A source on the NHIF board yesterday said the insurer lost about Sh21.2 million. The suspension the source said could be extended to between two and five years should the facilities be found culpable by the board.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vcWEucGhpbHN0YXIuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIvMDkvMjUvMjIxMTk3NC9nZW5lcmlrYS1kcnVnc3RvcmUtb2ZmZXJzLWZyZWUtY29uc3VsdGF0aW9uc9IBZWh0dHBzOi8vcWEucGhpbHN0YXIuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIvMDkvMjUvMjIxMTk3NC9nZW5lcmlrYS1kcnVnc3RvcmUtb2ZmZXJzLWZyZWUtY29uc3VsdGF0aW9ucy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Generika Drugstore offers free consultations,"Generika Drugstore offers free consultations

MANILA Philippines — Ayala-led Generika Drugstore is providing free medical consultation services as part of efforts to promote the overall health and well-being of its customers.

The drugstore chain part of AC Health Group expanded this free consultation with partner doctors last Sept. 17 for a nationwide Libreng Konsulta program to mark its 19th anniversary.

Yet Abarca president and CEO of Generika said the Libreng Konsulta is one of Generika Drugstore’s PLUS Services in its holistic approach of promoting the overall health and well-being of its customers.

Generika Drugstore customers can now regularly consult a doctor update their prescriptions and take proactive steps in managing their health.

The company has also partnered with the Department of Health (DOH) last month to mark Generics Awareness Month.

“We are one with the department’s conviction that optimizing the use of generic medicines is one way to sustain access to quality and affordable essential medicines and to reduce out-of-pocket spending aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals and the Universal Healthcare agenda. This is core to the vision and mission of Generika Drugstore and we stand ready to work with the DOH in this advocacy” Abarca said.

AC Health president and CEO Paolo Borromeo who referred to President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s thrust to provide generic medicine to more Filipinos emphasized the company’s commitment to improve healthcare for all Filipinos.

“We share this advocacy with the President and will broaden our network of Generika stores across the country to deliver more affordable quality generic medicines to more communities” Borromeo said.

Fanny Abundabar a retired teacher and a regular customer of Generika Drugstore said she appreciates how the drugstore gives access to affordable but effective generic medicines.

Generika Drugstore offers a wide range of generic medicines that can provide savings of up to 85 percent compared to their branded counterparts.

Ayala’s health care arm AC Health acquired a stake in Generika Drugstore in 2015 as part of the group’s vision of providing quality and affordable healthcare to all Filipinos.

Generika Drugstore currently has a network of over 700 community drugstores nationwide that offer quality and affordable generics. It is now offering medicine delivery services via the Generika Drugstore App and through the HealthNow app powered by AC Health’s Vigos Health and Globe Telecom’s 917 Ventures.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5zdC5jb20ubXkvbmV3cy9uYXRpb24vMjAyMi8wOS84MzQxNjQvdXRpbGlzZS1waGFybWFjaXN0cy1leHBlcnRpc2UtaGVhbHRoY2FyZS1zYXlzLWFtcmFoadIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5zdC5jb20ubXkvYW1wL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uLzIwMjIvMDkvODM0MTY0L3V0aWxpc2UtcGhhcm1hY2lzdHMtZXhwZXJ0aXNlLWhlYWx0aGNhcmUtc2F5cy1hbXJhaGk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Utilise pharmacists' expertise in healthcare says Amrahi,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5zdC5jb20ubXkvbmV3cy9uYXRpb24vMjAyMi8wOS84MzQxNjQvdXRpbGlzZS1waGFybWFjaXN0cy1leHBlcnRpc2UtaGVhbHRoY2FyZS1zYXlzLWFtcmFoadIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5zdC5jb20ubXkvYW1wL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uLzIwMjIvMDkvODM0MTY0L3V0aWxpc2UtcGhhcm1hY2lzdHMtZXhwZXJ0aXNlLWhlYWx0aGNhcmUtc2F5cy1hbXJhaGk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673EB6FEE0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

From a judicial review and the extraction of millions of tonnes of coal to the network of business interests in fossil fuels Wales is far from a green country.

By Carys Hopkins. Images by MS Redfern

Since voice.wales last reported on the Aberpergwm coal mine expansion Welsh Government have remained firm in their stance that they were powerless to stop the drilling of new fossil fuels in south Wales.

Now Coal Action Network (CAN) have now been granted a judicial review of the process and decision to expand the coal mine at Aberpergwm. The High Court has granted the review on the grounds that the Welsh Ministers can apply the Wales Act 2017 to the mine extension licence something they have repeatedly denied.

The judicial review has also been granted on the basis that the UK Coal Authority has misinterpreted its own powers and can still withdraw the licence for the extension prior to it being ‘granted’. Effectively this argues that the licence given to Energybuild Ltd is currently only ‘offered’ and can still be withdrawn.

Whilst the expansion at Aberpergwm is the biggest advance for the fossil fuel industry in Wales in recent years there are several other companies and mine expansions waiting in the shadows for the Coal Authority’s approval no doubt looking on in interest at what happens with Aberpergwm.

In the midst of an escalating climate crisis these projects include:

The Glan Lash mine is currently under review for “Permission to mine by surface mining operations 110000 tonnes of premium quality anthracite [coal]”. This has been an ongoing battle for Bryn Bach Coal Ltd — the company that owns the Glan Lash mine — as they have faced a backlash for years from the local community and environmental groups such as Friends Of the Earth Cymru.

Celtic Energy Ltd is another member of the Welsh fossil fuel industry. They have “three surface coal mining sites; Selar Nant Helen and East Pit producing in excess of one million tonnes of coal per year”. Boasting a website address of coal dot com Celtic Energy is as pro-fossil fuels as you can get and not going anywhere any time soon.

And then there is Valero PLC which has operated in Pembrokeshire since 2011 when it was bought out by Chevron (Texaco). Valero has been vocal through the years about the UK and Welsh government’s stance on climate change. “Valero urges Welsh policymakers not to use the Paris Agreement to go beyond current UK regulatory requirements”. This is typical of fossil fuel companies lobbying efforts against any meaningful action against climate change being taken.

At the same time the UK Government’s approach until recently headed by Kwasi Kwarteng MP former Secretary of State for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy and now Chancellor has been going full throttle toward fossil fuel and nuclear power.

The MP already has close links to big tobacco and big oil and has made it clear time again that he supports the fossil fuel industry wholeheartedly.

In this context lack of Welsh Government action against fossil fuel extraction is deeply concerning. We are being pulled along behind the fossil fuel industry and UK government approach putting profit over the planet and people.

Energybuild Ltd’s troubling state of affairs

In the past couple of weeks three different companies all under the same operation at Aberpergwm — Energybuild ltd Energybuild mining ltd and Mineral extraction and handling ltd — have faced some serious financial troubles.

As of the 16th May Keith Calder has resigned from the position of CEO of Energybuild Ltd. The new persons of majority control over Energybuild ltd is a company called IMR Asia Holding Pte Ltd. IMR is a global metals and mining group headquartered in Switzerland but is incorporated in Singapore.

Keith Calder came over to Energybuild group after Western Canadian Coal bought out Energybuild group in 2010 For £54.4 million. They shortly after then incorporated the company to Energybuild Ltd.

In the recent company fillings which Energybuild ltd have submitted IMR Ltd has lent both assets and money to bail Energybuild Ltd out of the troubles that they are once again in. IMR Ltd already has links to failing businesses in Wales and within the fossil fuel and industry sector. In 2018 Tata Steel Ltd sold one of their mines in South Africa to IMR.

The web of businesses that spins itself around the Aberpergwm mine is confusing and continuously changing directions. It is very difficult to get to the bottom of who the business owners are at any point of time or who the parent company is.

And this is exactly how they want it. Companies within the fossil fuel industry are not transparent about what companies are owned by the same people and what companies are being saved from financial ruin.

Here is the timeline of Energybuild ltd which proves how this complex web of ownership operates:

In September 1996 Mineral extraction and handling ltd was incorporated

In 2003 Energybuild ltd was incorporated

In 2003 Energybuild holdings ltd was incorporated

In 2003 Energybuild mining ltd was incorporated

In 2003 Energybuild opencast ltd was incorporated

In 2003 Llanwenarth properties ltd was incorporated

In 2005 Energybuild group limited was incorporated

In 2008 Energybuild aggregates ltd was incorporated

In 2009 Western Canadian Coal Corp lent money and assets to Energybuild group limited

In 2010 Western Canadian Coal Corp bought out Energybuild group

In 2010 Energybuild group limited was re-registered to a private limited group (ltd)

In 2011 Western Canadian Coal Corp was bought out by Walter Energy Canada holdings

In August 2015 Llanwenarth properties ltd changes it’s name to Speciality Carbons ltd

In February 2017 Cambrian energybuild holdings ULC lent Energybuild opencast limited money

In December 2017 Black diamond mining ltd was incorporated

In March 2018 Speciality Carbons ltd becomes person of significant control of Mineral extraction and handling ltd

In March 2018 Speciality Carbons ltd becomes person of significant control of Energybuild ltd

In April 2018 Black diamond mining ltd changed it’s name to Energybuild Resources ltd

In April 2018 Energybuild Resources ltd becomes person of significant control of Energybuild ltd

In April 2018 Energybuild Resources ltd becomes person of significant control of Mineral extraction and handling ltd

In 2019 Energybuild group ltd declared solvency

In 2019 Energybuild holdings ltd declared solvency

In 2019 Energybuild opencast ltd was dissolved

In March 2021 Energybuild group ltd was dissolved

In March 2021 Energybuild holdings ltd was dissolved

In May 2022 Future Carbons ltd was incorporated

In May 2022 Future Carbons ltd becomes person of significant control in the company of Energybuild ltd

In May 2022 Future Carbons Ltd becomes person of significant control of Mineral extraction and handling ltd

In April 2022 Pergwm holdings ltd becomes incorporated

All of this begs the question as to whether fossil fuel companies are even sustainable let alone their destruction to the planet. Over the course of almost 20 years the Energybuild companies have not managed to stabilise requiring bail outs from one another and constant changes of hand to stay alive.

Many would argue that what is needed instead is a publicly owned energy sector that prioritises sustainable development through expansion of public transport or the insulation of homes and the like.

The twisted web of businesses that spins itself around the Aberpergwm mine is continuously changing directions making it difficult to shed light on who the business owners are at any point of time or who the parent company is.

There are millions being transferred with each company buy out and millions lost to debt collectors and repayment of debt to lenders. Feeling through the dark all to extract coal from the ground and burn it during a climate crisis.

The increasing number of people who want action on climate change will be looking to the Welsh Government to oppose this not wash their hands of it.",,,,,,,,,

“La muerte repentina del primer personaje será cambiado y pondrán a otro en su reino” son las palabras que escribió el astrólogo.

Después de que se conocieran estos fragmentos y se hicieran virales en las redes sociales las ventas del libro de Nostradamus se han incrementado de acuerdo con el medio de comunicación The Sunday Times. Al 17 de septiembre se habían vendido alrededor de 8.000 copias de la obra.

Nostradamus realizó sus predicciones hace 450 años en un libro que fue publicado en 1555 titulado “Las profecías del señor Michel Nostradamus”. El libro tenía 353 cuartetas poemas de cuatro versos escritos en términos enigmáticos que supuestamente buscaban anunciar acontecimientos futuros en Francia y Europa.

El autor se hizo muy famoso luego de que aparentemente habría ocurrido una de sus predicciones. “Después de que en 1559 se produjera un acontecimiento trágico que Nostradamus supuestamente había pronosticado en 1555: la muerte del rey Enrique II en el curso de un torneo. En los años siguientes Nostradamus publicaría sucesivas ediciones de sus Profecías ampliadas cada vez con nuevas cuartetas de manera que la última edición contaba con 942 agrupadas en un total de diez centurias -de ahí que la obra se conozca también con este nombre” indica en su portal web National Geographic.

Para el 2022 el supuesto profeta predijo la guerra de Ucrania y Rusia: “Alrededor de la Gran Ciudad habrá soldados alojados en campos y suburbios” dice uno de sus escritos.

Otra de las predicciones para este año fue la de hambre e inflación. “La miel costará mucho más que la cera de las velas; tan alto el precio del trigo”. Esta resultó como una de las consecuencias de la guerra donde el precio del trigo se incrementó y causó estragos a nivel mundial.

Finalmente la ola que afectó a Europa también estaba en sus escritos según sus seguidores. “Como el sol la cabeza sellará el mar resplandeciente los peces vivos del Mar Negro casi hervirán” escribió Nostradamus.

¿Cómo murió la reina Isabel II?

El pasado 8 de septiembre el Palacio de Buckingham informó a través de un comunicado sobre los quebrantos de salud de la monarca. El documento señalaba que los médicos estaban preocupados por el estado de la Reina. Por esto recomendaban que estuviera bajo supervisión permanente. La cancelación de un Consejo Privado programado indicaba que su salud era delicada.

Sus problemas de salud se hicieron evidentes cuando por primera vez en setenta años de su reinado la monarca recibió en su casa de verano en Balmoral (Escocia) y no en el Palacio de Buckingham (Londres) a la nueva primera ministra de Reino Unido Liz Trizz después de que Boris Jonson dimitiera.

La Casa Real Británica había indicado varias veces que la Reina tenía problemas de movilidad y a causa de esto se habían realizado cambios en su agenda.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlcnZpbWVkaWEuZXMvbm90aWNpYXMvMjUwMC1hbnRpdGF1cmlub3MtbWFuaWZpZXN0YW4tdmVudGFzLWFib2xpY2lvbi10YXVyb21hcXVpYS8zNDYzODM20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Unos 2.500 antitaurinos se manifiestan en Las Ventas por la “abolición” de la tauromaquia,"© Esta imagen está protegida por derechos de autor y sólo puede ser utilizada por los clientes de Servimedia y sus medios de comunicación aliados para publicar exclusivamente junto al texto de esta noticia.

SERVIMEDIA

Miles de personas se manifestaron este sábado ante la plaza de toros de Las Ventas en Madrid para reclamar la “abolición” de la tauromaquia en una protesta convocada un año más por el Partido Animalista Pacma.

La manifestación comenzó en la explanada de Las Ventas y discurrió hacia la calle de Roberto Domingo para incorporarse a Avenida de los Toreros Francisco Silvela Juan Bravo y Conde de Peñalver hasta bajar a Manuel Becerra desde donde se dirigió de nuevo a Las Ventas. Fuentes de la Policía Nacional aseguraron a Servimedia que la protesta congregó a unos 2.500 manifestantes.

La acción estuvo encabezada por una pancarta en la que se podía leer ‘Misión abolición’ y tras la cual se situaron el presentador Jorge Javier Vázquez la periodista Rocío Vidal las actrices Beatriz Rico y Michelle Calvó la activista Aída Gascón el ‘influencer’ Epic Vegan el veterinario José Enrique Zaldívar la diputada portuguesa Inés de Sousa y el presidente del Pacma Javier Luna entre otros.

Amenizada por una batucada los manifestantes corearon consignas como ‘Derechos ya para los animales’ ‘España es antitaurina’ ‘Misión abolición’ ‘La tortura no es cultura’ ‘Toros sí toreros no’ ‘No me divierto con el sufrimiento’ y ‘Un bote dos botes torero el que no bote’.

También se vieron algunas pancartas individuales con mensajes como ‘Ninguna tradición por encima de la razón’ y ‘La tortura no es cultura’. Entre los manifestantes había personas pertenecientes a entidades antitaurinas de Castilla-La Mancha Asturias Córdoba Elche y Denia entre otros lugares.

Álvaro Tarancón de Dénia Animal Save apuntó a Servimedia que “ya está bien de esa tortura a toros vaquillas novillos y demás y que ese maltrato animal deje de estar subvencionado y sea abolido de una vez por todas porque gran parte de la población española está en contra de la tauromaquia”.

María José Pérez de Pacma Córdoba mostró su “repulsa” por “esa actividad cruenta y anacrónica que es la tauromaquia”. “En pleno siglo XXI no tendríamos que estar tratando ese tema pero esta ‘fiesta nacional’ está subvencionada y nos vemos en la obligación de salir a reivindicar los derechos de los animales. Cada vez hay menos afluencia de público en las plazas de toros” añadió.

El presidente de la Asociación de Veterinarios Abolicionistas de la Tauromaquia y del Maltrato Animal (Avatma) José Enrique Zaldívar comentó a Servimedia que “los espectáculos taurinos sean en plaza o en calle son una de las razones de que España sea un país en el que los maltratadores de animales campen a sus anchas”.

De vuelta a la explanada de Las Ventas las personas congregadas alzaron al unísono pañuelos verdes repartidos por la organización mientras coreaban ‘Misión abolición’. Anteriormente añadieron otros cánticos como ‘Esta plaza la vamos a cerrar’.

“RECHAZO RECIENTE”

La movilización se enmarca dentro de la campaña ‘Misión Abolición’ del Pacma y se produce dos semanas después de que esta formación lograra la paralización cautelar del Torneo del Toro de la Vega que se celebró el pasado martes 13 de septiembre como un encierro sin herir al animal en Tordesillas (Valladolid) tras una decisión del Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Castilla y León.

Según el Pacma “el declive de la tauromaquia es un fenómeno palpable”. Datos del Ministerio de Cultura indican que se trata de una de las actividades de consideración cultural o de ocio menos frecuentadas de España y una de las menos vistas en televisión (menos del 134%) e Internet (menos del 23%) justo antes de la pandemia.

“El descenso en las cifras de festejos taurinos celebrados en los últimos años es una muestra irrefutable del rechazo creciente y mayoritario de la sociedad a la brutalidad de la tauromaquia” señaló el presidente del Pacma.

En 2015 se celebraron 1.736 festejos taurinos en España cifra que cayó a 1.425 en 2019 algo que en el Pacma catalogan como “bajón del interés de la sociedad en la tauromaquia en solo cuatro años”."

Las Vegas Boulevard the epicenter of American gambling is dominated by New York landlords.

Now a big company from Las Vegas wants a bite of the Big Apple.

New York real estate heavyweight Related Companies announced recently that it’s partnering with Wynn Resorts to pursue a casino license with plans for a project in Related’s Hudson Yards development in Manhattan.

Their news release did not provide specifics on the project saying only it would be a “resort entertainment and gaming destination along the Hudson River” and that it would be near the sprawling Javits Center convention facility.

But Wynn’s venture marks a reversal of sorts from what Las Vegas has seen in recent years: New Yorkers snapping up property in Southern Nevada’s most lucrative stretch of real estate.

Of course Las Vegas has long been a destination for out-of-town developers house flippers and commercial-property landlords. (I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve written about Southern California firms buying apartment complexes here.)

But when it comes to the Strip one city in particular has emerged as the main source of buyers lately.

New York-based Vici Properties a Caesars Entertainment spinoff vastly expanded its holdings in Las Vegas when it acquired casino giant MGM Resorts International’s real estate spinoff in a $17 billion-plus deal.

As part of the buyout which closed this spring Vici acquired several MGM-operated properties along Las Vegas Boulevard including The Mirage Park MGM New York-New York Luxor and Excalibur.

Before that Vici also acquired casino operator Las Vegas Sands Corp.’s real estate on the Strip — The Venetian Palazzo and The Venetian Expo — for $4 billion in a deal that closed in February.

All told Vici now owns 660 acres of real estate along the Strip “the most economically productive street in the world” the company said this spring.

Another major landlord from New York is investment giant Blackstone whose portfolio includes Bellagio Aria and Vdara. It purchased those three for more than $8 billion combined and leased them back to MGM Resorts.

It also owns two other MGM-operated properties — Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand — in a joint venture with Vici.

Blackstone had kicked off a real estate buying spree in Southern Nevada after the economy crashed a decade or so ago and it owned and operated The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas for years.

It bought the flashy hotel-casino in 2014 for $1.73 billion and sold it for $5.65 billion. The sale which closed in May marked the “most profitable single asset sale ever” for Blackstone’s real estate business the company previously said.

Meanwhile New York’s Dreamscape Companies acquired the off-Strip Rio for $516.3 million in 2019 and New York investment firm Gindi Capital after it teamed up to buy Showcase Mall several years ago purchased more property along Las Vegas Boulevard in 2019 for $172 million.

Last month Clark County commissioners approved Gindi’s plans for a new three-story retail complex spanning more than 300000 square feet on that roughly 9.5-acre site — which Gindi had acquired from Spectrum Group Management another New York firm.

Related Wynn’s casino partner in New York is no stranger to Las Vegas either. Among other ventures here it partnered on the development of World Market Center downtown’s massive furniture-showroom hall that was acquired in 2017 by (drum roll) Blackstone.

Time will tell whether other Las Vegas firms plant a flag in New York. But odds are a company there is bound to buy something here first.

See Gina Ravera Now at 56.","Fans of the 1995 NC-17 flop-turned-cult classic Showgirls will remember Gina Ravera for her role as Molly best friend of Elizabeth Berkley's Nomi. While Molly is unfortunately relegated to the sidekick role she helps the protagonist find her footing in Las Vegas and later provides means for her redemption when Nomi avenges a horrific crime committed against her.

Showgirls may live in infamy but afterward Ravera stayed active in Hollywood with roles in a number of notable films and series—including a pivotal appearance in 1997's Soul Food in that one writer described as ""one of the most iconic moments in Black culture Black movie history Black history."" Keep reading to find out how the actor views the role of Molly almost 30 years later and see her now at age 56.

She played a doctor and a detective.

In the years following Showgirls Ravera had supporting roles in Spike Lee's Get on the Bus Kiss the Girls and the miniseries The Temptations before wrapping up the 1990s as a regular on the Party of Five spin-off Time of Your Life.

Her role in the movie Soul Food in which she plays the cousin and romantic rival of Vanessa Williams' Teri entered the pop culture lexicon when it inspired Williams to ad lib a now-iconic line. After Teri catches her husband having an affair with Ravera's character Faith and is told not to let it tear the family apart Teri exclaims ""Oh [expletive] the family!""

In the 2000s the Showgirls actor appeared in guest spots on The Fugitive Charmed and Boston Legal and was cast as a regular in the TNT series The Closer and in a 13-episode arc on ER from 2006 to 2008 playing radiologist Bettina DeJesus the love interest of Mekhi Phifer's Dr. Greg Pratt.

She left her most recognizable role at its peak.

Ravera would remain on The Closer through the fourth season in 2009 noting that her character Irene Daniels—who was once described in The New York Times as ""a young attractive detective who also happened to be the only member of the squad with no distinct personality""—was quite a departure for her.

""I'm very passionate and very expressive"" she told Fanbolt in 2008. ""This character Daniels is far more reserved than I've ever played. It was very difficult to play someone who was so buttoned down so straight.""

Perhaps unsurprisingly Ravera left the series after just four of its eventual seven seasons with Daniels deciding to transfer to another unit after her breakup with fellow squad member Sgt. David Gabriel (Corey Reynolds).

In the years since Ravera's acting career has slowed to occasional appearances on series including Lie to Me CSI: Crime Investigation and Castle. Ravera posted no credits between 2014 and 2018 before returning to television for three episodes of the CW comic book series Arrow. She has appeared on screen just twice since in two episodes of Station 19 in 2020 and as the voice of Room Service in an episode of the Apple TV+ series Calls.

While Ravera has been mum on why she left The Closer and what's next for her her IMDB profile does credit her as a writer on a production titled Exit suggesting that she may be putting her creative skills to new use.

She started a nonprofit.

In 2007 Ravera started Project Reina (PR) a non-profit focused on preventing the spread of HIV among Latina and Black adolescents and young women. Alongside The Closer assistant director Anna Notarides and fellow actors Angel Moore Ana Ortiz Teresa Randall and Lisa Vidal Ravera sought to empower young women with the message that ""they deserve to be cherished and adored"" as well as to provide them with information on sexual health.

""We function as big sisters giving young women information about life and sharing our experiences from when we were young"" Ravera said in a 2010 interview. ""It's not just about AIDS prevention; it's an acknowledgment that life is a gift and it's your responsibility to do something with it.""ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb

In addition to her work with Project Reina Ravera has teamed with organizations including Until There's a Cure which works to end HIV and AIDS and Common Threadz devoted to assisting children in rural Africa.

She has regrets about her role in Showgirls.

As Showgirls reached its 25th anniversary in 2020 Ravera reflected on the role of Molly in an interview with Yahoo! News. While she noted she ""felt seen"" by director Paul Verhoeven who she said acknowledged the difficulties of being a Black woman in Hollywood and gave her room to make the character her own she also expressed misgivings about Molly's place in the script.

""It's the Hattie McDaniel role where you take care of the needs of the white woman and you don't have a storyline of your own"" she said.

Ravera also shared the emotional difficulties of filming a scene in which Molly is brutally assaulted noting that she has since refused to take on jobs involving sexual violence and commenting on the problem she sees with the film using Molly to redeem the protagonist.

""You're just brutalizing this character; you tear the character apart and you don't do anything with it—she just sits there broken"" she said. ""That I still have a problem with. We're watching a Black girl be completely gutted for no reason except to have this character [Nomi] vindicated because she has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.""

Amid for the film's campy comeback Ravera has remained skeptical and skipped the reunions noting she has only seen Showgirls once since its release. ""People want to just call it camp but it isn't camp"" she told Yahoo! News. ""There's too much darkness in it to avoid all of the weight.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91dGRvb3JzZmlyc3QuY29tL2Jhc3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9wb2NoZS1wcmV2YWlscy13aXRoLWJhc3NtYXN0ZXItY2VudHJhbC1vcGVuLXZpY3Rvcnktb24tbG91aXNpYW5hcy1yZWQtcml2ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Poche Prevails With Bassmaster Central Open Victory On Louisiana's Red River | BassFIRST,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.outdoorsfirst.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /bass/article/poche-prevails-with-bassmaster-central-open-victory-on-louisianas-red-river/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002674004DB10>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91dGRvb3JzZmlyc3QuY29tL2Jhc3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9wb2NoZS1wcmV2YWlscy13aXRoLWJhc3NtYXN0ZXItY2VudHJhbC1vcGVuLXZpY3Rvcnktb24tbG91aXNpYW5hcy1yZWQtcml2ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vaG93LWRpZC1zYXZlZC1ieS10aGUtYmVsbC1lbmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Saved By The Bell Ended: Original Show College Years & Movie,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='screenrant.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /how-did-saved-by-the-bell-end/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002674004EE30>, 'Connection to screenrant.com timed out.

This year has served as an unpleasant reminder that the stock market doesn't move up in a straight line. Since the year began the benchmark S&P 500 and growth-centric Nasdaq Composite have each fallen into a bear market with peak declines of more than 20%. To boot the U.S. economy has delivered back-to-back quarters of gross domestic product declines on the heels of historically high inflation.

In other words it's a worrisome time for investors -- and especially retirees who can't afford to lose their principal investment.

But when trouble looms on Wall Street historically so does opportunity. That's because every major stock market correction has eventually been cleared away by a bull market rally. This means that in spite of heightened volatility in the short run it's the perfect time for aged investors to pounce.

What follows are three ideal high-yield dividend stocks for retirees that have the potential to turn an initial investment of $350000 into $1 million by 2030.

Walgreens Boots Alliance: 5.62% yield

The first perfect high-yield dividend stock that can generate a 186% return for aged investors by 2030 is pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 5.67%). Walgreens has been paying a consecutive dividend for more than 89 years and has increased its base annual payout for the past 47 years.

What typically makes healthcare stocks such a genius investment is their defensive nature. No matter how poorly the U.S. economy or stock market perform there's always going to be demand for prescription drugs medical devices and healthcare services.

However the COVID-19 pandemic proved to be one of the few exceptions to this rule at least for Walgreens Boots Alliance. Because Walgreens is reliant on foot traffic into its stores the lockdowns associated with the pandemic hurt its sales and bottom line. Like other retailers it's also contending with historically high inflation and the negative effect that can have on consumer spending.

And yet there are numerous reasons to be excited about Walgreens' prospects as it enacts a multipoint turnaround strategy designed to boost its operating margins organic growth rate and customer loyalty.

To begin with management noted at the end of fiscal year 2021 (the company's fiscal year ends on Aug. 31) that it had surpassed $2 billion in annual cost savings a full year ahead of schedule. But it's not the company's cost-cutting that's going to raise eyebrows. It's where management is aggressively pulling levers.

One area where Walgreens Boots Alliance is sparing no expense is with its various digitization initiatives. Even though the company will continue generating most of its revenue from its brick-and-mortar stores the pandemic has demonstrated the value of having a more prominent online presence. Walgreens has invested heavily in its direct-to-consumer platform which should lead to healthy organic sales growth.

What's more Walgreens Boots Alliance has partnered with (and become a majority investor in) VillageMD. The duo has opened 120 co-located full-service health clinics as of May 31 2022 with a goal of opening 1000 clinics in over 30 U.S. markets by the end of 2027. Offering physician-staffed clinics differentiates Walgreens' clinics from its competition and should drive repeat business.

Valued at roughly seven times Wall Street's forecast earnings for 2023 Walgreens has a safe floor to go along with its promising upside and rock-solid 5.6% yield.

Innovative Industrial Properties: 7.04% yield

A second ideal high-yield income stock that has the capacity to turn a $350000 investment into a cool $1 million over the next eight years is cannabis-focused real estate investment trust (REIT) Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR -0.04%). Over the past five years IIP as Innovative Industrial Properties is more commonly known has grown its quarterly payout by 1100%.

Just 20 months ago marijuana stocks were all the rage on Wall Street. With Democrats taking narrow control of Congress and Joe Biden winning the presidency the expectation was for sweeping federal cannabis reforms. Unfortunately no reforms have taken shape and pot stocks have been pummeled as a result.

However individual states maintain the right to legalize and regulate marijuana. Around three-quarters of all states have given the green light to medical cannabis which provides more than enough opportunity for a company like IIP to profit.

Innovative Industrial Properties' business model is just like any other REIT... except for the cannabis focus. As of early September IIP had purchased 111 medical marijuana cultivation and processing facilities spanning 8.7 million square feet of rentable space in 19 states. Although acquisitions are IIP's primary source of growth it does have a modest organic growth component built in that allows for inflationary rental increases to be passed along to its tenants each year.

What makes REITs so valuable for retirees is the predictability of their operating cash flow and their dividends. As of the end of June 99% of IIP's rents were being collected on time. Meanwhile REITs are required to pay out a majority of their earnings as a dividend which is what allows them to avoid normal corporate income-tax rates.

Another big catalyst for IIP is the lack of cannabis reforms at the federal level. Innovative Industrial Properties has benefited immensely from its sale-leaseback program which involves purchasing facilities from multi-state operators for cash and immediately leasing them back to the seller. Because access to basic financial services is limited for cannabis companies IIP has turned this lack of reform on Capitol Hill into a positive catalyst that bolsters its long-term rental portfolio.

Intel: 4.96% yield

The third ideal high-yield dividend stock for retirees that can turn $350000 into $1 million by 2030 is semiconductor behemoth Intel (INTC 3.53%). Intel's roughly 5% yield is the juiciest payout its shareholders have ever received.

Like most cyclical stocks Intel is taking it on the chin at the moment. A combination of economic weakness high inflation and employees returning to the office has slowed personal computer (PC) sales and data center spending -- at least temporarily. To boot Advanced Micro Devices has been chipping away at Intel's mobile and server central processing unit (CPU) market share.

While this would appear to be a less-than-ideal scenario for Intel a deeper dive points to an inexpensive cash-flow juggernaut that has multiple catalysts on the horizon.

First concerns about Intel's loss of market share look to be an overreaction. According to second-quarter market share data from Mercury Research Intel maintains desktop PC mobile and server market share in the neighborhood of 75% to 86%. Even if AMD were to continue slowly chipping away at Intel's PCU market share the sheer growth potential of mobile devices and data-center servers should allow Intel to steadily grow its sales and generate abundant cash flow.

Intel is also a prime beneficiary of the CHIPS and Science Act which was signed into law by President Joe Biden last month. The CHIPS Act will provide $52.7 billion in subsidies to chip designers and manufacturers with the goal of boosting chip production innovation and hiring within the United States. Intel which is spending $20 billion to build two manufacturing plants in Ohio could eventually up its presence to eight total factories with federal aid.

Sometime soon we should also witness the spinoff and initial public offering (IPO) of autonomous vehicle company Mobileye which Intel acquired in 2017 for $15.3 billion. Mobileye delivered 41% year-over-year sales growth in the most recent quarter with annual run-rate revenue of $1.84 billion. The expectation is for Mobileye to command a valuation of $30 billion for its IPO. In short Intel looks to have made a wise acquisition.

Despite short-term headwinds Intel has the catalysts needed to nearly triple the initial investment of retirees by the end of the decade.",,,,,,,,,,,,

When you think of low prices and incredible deals Walmart is likely one of the first stores that pops into your head. The corporation is well-known for their practically unbeatable price tags—but back in July one TikTok user made claims that the store is actually overcharging customers because those price tags might not keep their promises.

More recently Supermarket News reported last week that until now when online Walmart customers were offered a substitute item for an out-of-stock product the shoppers were automatically charged for the lower-priced item. Soon if the recommended substitute costs more Walmart customers will have to pay the higher price according to a leaked internal memo sent to Walmart store managers last Friday as reported by Business Insider. “Moving forward customers will now pay the list price for specific substitution items made on their order” the memo obtained by Business Insider states. “Customers and members will receive updates about this change in the Walmart app at various points in their shopping experience.”

According to the published reports this new policy will go live in the coming weeks. “As we continue to expand our popular online pickup and delivery service we’re giving our customers more control of how and when items are substituted including enhanced preferences and the ability to approve or reject substituted items” a Walmart spokesperson recently told Best Life. “This flexibility is an important part of how we continue to give our customers more control over their pickup and delivery experience.” Walmart apparently doesn’t expect much of a pushback from customers over their new pricing policy Business Insider reported. “There will be a bit of a transition period” the spokesperson told Insider “but overall this is pretty common.”

On July 29th TikTok user @brennasbakery posted a video to the platform warning shoppers about Walmart’s “overcharging” issue. “You guys Walmart is scamming people so listen up” she said. “They’re jacking up their prices. They’re ripping you off. I don’t know how this isn’t a lawsuit yet.” Wait… what?!

That certainly is a surprising allegation considering Walmart’s affordable reputation. But Brenna shared a pretty convincing anecdote in the video which has since garnered over 50000 likes. “I was just at Walmart” she begins explaining that she stopped by the store for some items to make a cake. She then goes on to say that she had previously checked the price of Wilton chocolates on Walmart’s website and saw that they were priced at $2.62 and found the same price listed on shelves. (Not bad!) However the issue arose when Brenna arrived at the store and went to check out.

“I went to ring them up but they were ringing up for $4 dollars each” she stated. Okay that’s definitely a little fishy. Luckily once Brenna pointed the issue out to the cashier she adjusted the price accordingly. However the shopper claims that five other items rang up as higher than their listed price. Yikes! (Sounds like the store is definitely trying to pull the wool over shoppers’ eyes.) “I understand inflation is making a lot of prices go up” Brenna reasoned. “But if the price is also indicating something online you can buy it for that price online and it’s that price in the aisle they’re scamming you. They’re purposefully marking up prices because most people are not gonna check that when they’re checking out.”

According to Walmart shopping experts at Tip Hero the US Sun reports there is a helpful hack customers can use to find out if you are indeed getting a good deal at the store (or not). ""There’s a hidden markdown language used by popular retailers to communicate to employees what items are being discounted"" the experts explained. They went on adding ""Pricing doesn’t always follow this format as retailers are constantly testing new prices.""

When customers look at the very last digit of a price they can see the reduction amount and Tip Hero reported that prices ending in '7c' amounts indicate the original retail value. For example if you see an item priced at $9.97 in Walmart the experts stress that the product you are looking was likely just placed on the shelf. When products become discounted at the department store Tip Hero experts say the first markdown will end in '5c' amounts.

A product that is $9.95 The Sun notes is likely to have been marked down once and for the final markdown ""products will be priced at an amount ending in '1c.'"" If an item is $9.91 the outlet adds then it is a ""safe bet that product is due for clearance.""

While the July scandal may have been shocking to some consumers it wasn't exactly fresh news. In fact The Charlotte Observer reported that five Walmart stores near Charlotte North Carolina were fined by the state for overcharging due to price scanning errors.

These fines are the result of inspections carried out by the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services' Standards Division in which they compare list prices to the price that comes up when items are scanned. They discovered that these Walmart stores were overcharging between 4 and 12 percent on multiple items at the register.

This also isn't the first time the store has been in legal trouble. Just last month they faced a lawsuit over coffee trademark issues and another due to the fact that they allegedly allowed fraudsters to take advantage of customers.

If you want to avoid overcharging at Walmart make sure to pay careful attention while your items are scanned and double check your receipt to ensure the prices you were charged match the prices that were listed. Or of course you can always choose to shop at a different store where you won't be blindsided at checkout.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9yZXZpZXdlZC8yMDIyLzA5LzI1L2Jlc3Qtd2FsbWFydC1zYWxlcy1kZWFscy84MTE0MTM1MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Updated daily: The best Walmart sales on Vizio Shark Mainstays and Apple,"— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors.

Check out the story below.

Recalls two women writing a letter to the Atlanta Constitution complaining about his action figure with the mannequin head:

“I was getting canceled before cancel culture was a thing. Two women who were of all things assistant professors of Communications at a college in Georgia … went into a Walmart and without any study without any homework without any research jumped to a very wild and completely innocuous conclusion that the action figure that I had which included a Barbie doll head that was popped off that had ‘HELP ME’ right across it was a decapitated women’s head and then wrote a letter to the Atlanta Constitution.”

How Walmart banned his figure leading to the doll selling out much quicker:

“And of course because wrestling was so hot at the time the Atlanta Constitution printed it without doing any actual research themselves … and then of course Walmart saw it panicked and then it led to where the toy was banned across the nation in every retail outlet which just led to them selling out that much quicker. Walmart will not sell (the figure) as they feel its an endangerment to the community; now granted you can still go to Walmart buy a hunting gun with ammo and a hunting knife to cut up your victim but you can’t buy pregnant Barbie or my action figure.”

If you or anyone you know has been to Disney World in the past few years then you probably noticed a big change: The prices for entry to both Disney World and Disneyland have gone way up. Disneyland raises its prices at least once a year according to the KTLA and The Los Angeles Times reported in 2021 that the prices for some tickets went up by 8%. Ticket prices at Walt Disney World are going up too according to Ziggy Knows Disney by as much as $3-$15 dollars per guest for simple base tickets.

But what some Disney fans really can't get over is the news that Disney's most expensive restaurant Victoria & Albert's has gotten pricier — allegedly more expensive than a meal at Disneyland's members-only Club 33 (via Today). The first thing that might tip diners off to the pricey nature of Victoria & Albert's restaurant located at Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa is that it's named after royalty. The restaurant was recently closed for renovation and has customers balking at the huge price increase now that it's reopening. Before Victoria & Albert's closed for renovation a prix-fixe meal at the restaurant cost $185 but now it will cost $295 (via Disney Tourist Blog). That $110 jump is pretty significant and if diners opt for the wine pairing to go with their meal that's a total of $445 per person for one dinner out.

A similar suit filed against Disneyland is moving forward as the company’s self-declared laser focus on managing and maximizing attendance and profits using new tools developed during the pandemic continues to generate controversy among fans.

Walt Disney Word passes require once unlimited holders to make reservations a situation plaintiffs say should have been temporary. And when attempting to reserve the suit says these passholders often hit blockout dates and lack of availability that others — like day trippers and tourists — do not.

“Platinum Pass holders and Platinum Plus Pass holders cannot make reservations to go to a Disney theme park even though there are single day passes available for purchase. Disney appears to be unfairly favoring single ticket or multi-day ticket holders while restricting Platinum Pass holders in order to make a larger profit” said the suit filed by two anonymous passholders identified as E.K. and M.P. that landed in District Court for the Central District of Florida Orlando division.

Read the full lawsuit here.

Those are the old names for the passes. Coming out of Covid Walt Disney World created a new roster of four tiers for purchase or renewal. Three of the four (the Pirate Pass the Sorcerer Pass and the Incredi-Pass) have been blacked out for new buyers since last year. The lowest tier Pixie Dust Pass limited to Florida residents during weekdays is available. Renewing passholders can move into any of the four tiers all more restrictive than the old Platinum and Platinum+.

“It was believed by the Plaintiffs and other members of the class that this reservation system would only be temporary and would end once the threat of the pandemic lessened because they had not been subjected to this system pre-pandemic” the suit says. “By restricting access to the park Disney effectively unilaterally modified all Platinum Pass holders’ and Platinum Plus pass holders’ contracts.”

Disney said its annual passholders “continue to be some of our biggest fans and most loyal guests. We’ve been upfront with Passholders about the updates we’ve made and we offered them the flexibility to opt in or opt out of the program early in the pandemic including refunds if they desired. This lawsuit mischaracterizes the program and its history and we will respond further in court.”

The lawsuit also complains that “park hopping” in Orlando which used to be unlimited for high-tier annual passholders is now only available after 2 pm.

“Disney has abused a global pandemic to take advantage of its Platinum pass holders and Platinum Plus pass holders even after the threat of the pandemic has subsided. Disney has altered the Platinum Pass and Platinum Plus Pass terms so dramatically that they do not even resemble the original agreement bargained for by Plaintiffs” the suit says.

Disney’s Parks division was decimated during Covid but has waged a massive turnaround as fans returned in droves many opting to pay higher prices for tickets and perks like Genie+ and Lightening Lane. The business saw revenue surge 70% to nearly $7.4 billion for the quarter ended in June with operating income of $2.1 billion up from $356 million."

Animated Series Is Being Removed Forever And Never Getting Released Again,"Warner Bros. Discovery has shelved Final Space to use as a tax write-off

By Nathan Kamal |

‘Final Space’ creator Olan Rogers confirms that the series is becoming a tax write-off for Warner Bros Discovery and will be gone forever from all official channels after Netflix takes the series down internationally.

Warner Bros. Discovery appears to be continuing its controversial tactic of erasing its own content in order to qualify for tax incentives with the well-regarded Final Space animated series being completely buried by the company. According to the above statement by Final Space creator and star Olan Rogers Warner Bros. Discovery has decided to allow the streaming rights to expire and when it is removed from Netflix not release it in any form again. The company has also ceased production of physical media like DVDs for the first two seasons of Final Space and DVDs for the third season apparently were never made in the first place.

This will make Final Space yet another casualty in the abrupt change in Warner Bros. Discovery’s business direction which appears to be focusing on maximizing tax loopholes as a form of decreasing expenditures on things like say animated or live-action scripted content. By far the most well-known project to be canceled by the company is the Batgirl movie which was intended to star Leslie Grace as Barbara Gordon Brendan Fraser as the arson-themed villain Firefly J.K. Simmons as Commissioner James Gordon and Michael Keaton returning to the role of Batman for the first time in decades. While it was initially implied that Batgirl had been canceled and shelved sight-unseen due to negative fan reaction to early screenings it is generally accepted now that it was so the unreleased movie could be claimed as a financial loss and thus a tax write-off.

Much of the blame for the cancelation of projects like Final Space and Batgirl is being laid on Warner Bros. Discovery President David Zaslav who assumed command of the merged WarnerMedia and Discovery Inc and immediately announced the main priority of reducing costs for the company. It is worth noting that in addition to David Zaslav’s annual salary of $3 million he contractually receives an annual $22 million bonus and receives stock options valued at $190 million all of which makes him one of the highest-paid entertainment executives in the world. It appears that his main concept for cutting costs for the company is actually to cut the content of the company which is an interesting tactic as Warner Bros. Discovery is a multimedia entertainment company that depends on producing content for long-term financial viability.



Final Space will no longer be available to find online and unless one already owns the physical media that has been produced so far will become increasingly difficult for fans and potential fans to find otherwise. Part of what makes the cancelation of programs like Final Space so shocking is that they are not being shut down over quality concerns controversy or even lack of public interest but simply to exploit tax laws that make it more profitable for companies to suppress creative work than to produce it. Perhaps someday in the future we will be able to find Final Space (or even see Batgirl in full) but for now they are being locked away in the dark.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vY29taWNib29rLmNvbS90di1zaG93cy9uZXdzL3JlbmV3LWZpbmFsLXNwYWNlLW9sYW4tcm9nZXJzLXRheC13cml0ZS1vZmYtbmV3LXQtc2hpcnQv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly9jb21pY2Jvb2suY29tL3R2LXNob3dzL2FtcC9uZXdzL3JlbmV3LWZpbmFsLXNwYWNlLW9sYW4tcm9nZXJzLXRheC13cml0ZS1vZmYtbmV3LXQtc2hpcnQv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Final Space Creator Throws Shade at Warner Brothers for Using Canceled Series as Tax Write-off,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vY29taWNib29rLmNvbS90di1zaG93cy9uZXdzL3JlbmV3LWZpbmFsLXNwYWNlLW9sYW4tcm9nZXJzLXRheC13cml0ZS1vZmYtbmV3LXQtc2hpcnQv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly9jb21pY2Jvb2suY29tL3R2LXNob3dzL2FtcC9uZXdzL3JlbmV3LWZpbmFsLXNwYWNlLW9sYW4tcm9nZXJzLXRheC13cml0ZS1vZmYtbmV3LXQtc2hpcnQv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673EAB76D0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

After shocking the corporate world last year with the news Discovery Communications would merge with WarnerMedia incoming Warner Bros. Discovery Chief Executive David Zaslav had a mission: learn as much about Hollywood as possible and choose the right leaders to help him run the combined company. Zaslav begun a year-long quest to inform his decision making. He reached out to dozens of Hollywood's elite including ex-Disney CEO Bob Iger former WarnerMedia CEO Bob Daley former chairman of Walt Disney Studios Alan Horn Endeavor Group Holdings CEO Ari Emanuel and Creative Artists Agency co-chairman Bryan Lourd. Lourd 61 isn't a household name but he wields a stunning amount of influence in Hollywood. He has helped run CAA one of the two largest global talent agencies since 1995. Lourd's Hollywood clients aren't just A-listers they're A+-listers: Brad Pitt. George Clooney. Scarlett Johansson. Octavia Spencer. Alejandro González Iñárritu. Lorne Michaels. The list goes on and on. While Zaslav solicited Lourd's advice about whom to hire for Warner Bros. Discovery he floated an idea by him: Would Lourd consider giving up his job at CAA to come run the famed Warner Bros. studio?

A constant in a time of upheaval

The entertainment industry is in an ""age of great anxiety"" Iger said earlier this month ""because this is an era of great transformation."" The biggest global media companies are consolidating and transforming their businesses to revolve around streaming video. Technology giants Apple and Amazon have become active deep-pocketed competitors. A new generation has taken over: The CEOs of Disney NBCUniversal WarnerMedia and CBS have all turned over in the past four years. On top of that investors have soured on streaming video leader Netflix  driving shares down about 60% this year. That's giving media leaders even more agita as an existential question hangs over the industry: Have the best days in media and entertainment passed us by? That has caused corporate leaders to lean on Lourd more than ever before according to more than a dozen media executives interviewed by CNBC. Zaslav calls him ""possibly the last true Hollywood star."" An old-fashioned talent agent who loves discussing old movies and doesn't mind pointing out the flaws in his own clients' work Lourd has become arguably the most powerful person in Hollywood. He's a ""wise consigliere"" in the words of ex-HBO chief Richard Plepler to nearly every major company in the entertainment industry. Whether it's advising Zaslav on whom to hire at Warner Bros. or convincing Apple TV+ to outspend everyone on his clients' future projects or advising companies on potential board members Lourd has become a man-behind-the-curtain figure who stands out not only for his power but also for his lack of public persona. ""He's one of the most powerful people in the history of Hollywood"" said Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos. ""But you'd never perceive him to be powerful."" Lourd declined to participate in this story.

This isn't 'Entourage'

""Trustworthy"" ""consistent"" ""supportive"" ""very nice"" and ""almost quiet"" aren't terms typically associated with Hollywood representation — an industry many associate with Plepler's old HBO show ""Entourage."" That series features superagent character Ari Gold who is played by actor Jeremy Piven and loosely based on the brash in-your-face Emanuel. But those terms of endearment are how five top showbiz executives – Iger Paramount Pictures head Brian Robbins Starz CEO Jeff Hirsch NBCUniversal chief Jeff Shell and Zaslav respectively – describe Lourd. ""He's unique"" said Iger. ""He's a statesman in an industry defined by superagents who rose to positions of power by being intimidating. He's honest. He'll say things like 'Yeah that could have been better.' He brings people together and takes positions that people galvanize around.""

While Emanuel has become famous for short conversations and one-word e-mail responses one executive after another noted Lourd always seems to have time for longer discussions about strategy problem-solving and checking in on personal lives. ""Bryan never feels rushed"" said Apple TV+ co-head Zack Van Amburg. ""He's ready to have as long of a conversation as it takes. That's a super skill as mundane as that may seem."" Emanuel's job also no longer mirrors Lourd's. Emanuel has become a public company CEO growing Endeavor first with a number of agency acquisitions and then buying popular professional mixed-martial arts league UFC. The purchases have turned Endeavor into an $10 billion company. Lourd's persona is ""brilliant counter positioning"" to Emanuel said Sarandos. Lourd and his co-chairmen have kept CAA private recently doubling down on the business with an acquisition of talent agency ICM. ""I don't think it's by accident"" said Sarandos. ""It's two very different styles at play."" Emanuel declined to comment for this story.

Born on the Bayou

Lourd has been a mainstay in Hollywood for decades despite growing up in New Iberia Louisiana (population 28143) a little more than a two-hour drive west from New Orleans. After graduating from the University of Southern California as a double major in international relations and journalism Lourd began thinking of becoming an agent after reading a New Yorker magazine article on the Hollywood representation industry according to a CAA spokesperson. Lourd joined William Morris Agency in 1983 literally working his way up from the mailroom to agent. He left William Morris to join CAA in 1988. By the time he was helping to run CAA in 1995 Lourd was already representing Woody Harrelson Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman among others. Lourd's obsession with Hollywood bled into his personal life. He dated actress Carrie Fisher from 1991 to 1994. The two had a daughter Billie who is also an actress. Lourd later married longtime boyfriend Bruce Bozzi who worked as executive vice president of the Palm Restaurant Group for decades including running its L.A. hotspot for entertainment industry stars and moguls. Lourd shares a second daughter Ava with Bozzi. She was born in 2007.

Sure he's nice but he's still an agent

Lourd is the quintessential behind-the-scenes maestro said Zaslav with aspirations that extend beyond Hollywood. Lourd recently held a dinner party at his home for Vice President Kamala Harris after strongly advocating on her behalf behind the scenes to be Joe Biden's running mate according to people familiar with the matter. He's on a number of charitable boards including New York's Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and two foundations developed by his clients — the Clooney Foundation for Justice and Sean Penn's J/P Haitian Relief Organization. When Plepler decided he would leave HBO in early 2019 Lourd was one of a very small handful of people with which he shared his decision weeks before he made it public or told his then-boss AT&T CEO John Stankey. ""He's an ally you can trust in a world that can be purely transactional"" Plepler said. Still in spite of his charm Lourd is an agent. His primary role is to extract money for his clients. That's not entirely lost on Zaslav.

""He's both charming and sensitively thoughtful but at the same time he can be a real killer shark"" said Zaslav. ""But unlike a shark where you feel the teeth you hang up the phone feeling good before a week or two later when you realize you've spent a lot more than you thought you were going to spend. But somehow you don't feel bad about it and you feel he'll make it up to you on the next one."" Or as Lionsgate Vice Chairman Michael Burns said: ""He'll tell you to go to Hell so nicely that you'll ask for directions.""

Not-so-mysterious ways

Lourd's hands are on nearly every part of the business of entertainment. That's part of why Zaslav considered him to lead the Warner Bros. studio. A standard agent has a list of clients and works to get those people as much money as possible. But Lourd's clients are such bankable stars that it's equally important for Hollywood executives to be friendly with him as it is beneficial for Lourd and CAA. Of all the people CNBC spoke with for this story not one had a single critical thing to say about Lourd other than blaming him for ballooning talent costs. It's a testament to his natural personality – several executives weren't as kind about Emanuel – but it may also speak to Lourd's power. While it seems random to outsiders how or why certain films or TV series end up on particular streaming services it begins to make more sense when viewed through the lens of Lourd. Step 1: CEOs ask him for advice on whom to hire because of his combination of trustworthiness and knowledge of the industry.

Step 2: Those executives many of whom can at least partially thank Lourd for their jobs and high salaries come to him to staff projects.

Step 3: Lourd gets top dollar for his clients through deals signed by those same executives.

Step 4: Those projects deliver billions in revenue for executives.* Step 4 comes with an asterisk because only some of Lourd's projects deliver. Not every movie is a hit even with Lourd's roster of stars. But his influence is only growing as the number of surefire stars dwindle. This year Lourd convinced Apple TV+ to pay more than $200 million for a Formula 1-themed movie starring Brad Pitt that didn't have a script. Lourd's asking price was so outrageous to Warner Bros. Discovery that some executives scoffed at the pitch privately calling it frothy and ""bells and whistles"" with no certainty it could be a tentpole franchise according to people familiar with the matter. Apple TV+'s Van Amburg and co-head Jamie Erlicht were also unsure of Lourd's pitch but they knew the movie would be written and made by the team that did ""Top Gun: Maverick"" — director Joseph Kosinski producer Jerry Bruckheimer and screenwriter Ehren Kruger. The only problem was ""Top Gun: Maverick"" had yet to hit theaters at the time of the talks.

So the Apple team got permission to screen the film early. After watching it they walked away confident. ""Top Gun: Maverick"" became one of the highest grossing box office movies of all time surpassing $1 billion globally. The Apple deal also includes unprecedented revenue sharing for key talent according to a person familiar with the matter. Lourd crafted a contract allowing Pitt Bruckheimer and other CAA clients to participate in a variety of future revenue streams that may set a new standard for how major talent is paid for streaming movies the person said. Apple TV+ will be relying on Lourd and his clients to deliver on several other big-budget projects including a yet-to-be-titled thriller starring Pitt and Clooney and ""Project Artemis"" a period romantic comedy starring CAA clients Channing Tatum and Johansson which cost Apple a reported $100 million. The industry's changing dynamics and how to pay movie stars as more viewing shifts away from the box office and toward streaming can make negotiating with Lourd challenging even as it feels like a partnership Van Amburg said. ""Bryan enjoys the role of being the ultimate diplomat"" Van Amburg said. ""But I don't think we have underpaid for anything we've ever done with him.""

Standing up for ScarJo

Lourd flexed his muscles last year in a move that caught industry executives off guard because it put him in a rare public adversarial role to a major Hollywood executive. Johansson sued Disney for simultaneously releasing ""Black Widow"" on Disney+ at the same time it was released in theaters. She claimed her salary was based on an exclusive theatrical release for the film. Disney shot back at the lawsuit with a public statement outing how much Johansson had already made on the movie ($20 million) and blaming her for being callous to industry changes around Covid-19. Lourd felt Disney's statement was both misogynistic and offensive not only to Johansson but to all of his clients according to people familiar with the matter. That prompted him to fire back a stern response at Disney and its relatively new CEO Bob Chapek who had taken over for Iger the previous year.

Marvel Studios

""Disney's direct attack on her character and all else they implied is beneath the company that many of us in the creative community have worked with successfully for decades"" Lourd said in a statement at the time. ""They have shamelessly and falsely accused Ms. Johansson of being insensitive to the global COVID pandemic in an attempt to make her appear to be someone they and I know she isn't."" Disney eventually settled the Johansson suit giving Johansson more than $40 million according to Deadline. Chapek said he and Lourd have put the incident behind them and continue to have a ""running dialogue"" that goes well beyond specific deals. ""[We talk] about the industry at large and how it's all evolving"" said Chapek. ""It's a relationship I value. Our industry is lucky to have him.""

This is the way

Navigating changing industry dynamics has pushed Lourd to get creative with several deals to meet the needs of both companies and clients. When Disney signed a deal with director Jon Favreau in 2018 to executive produce and write Star Wars series ""The Mandalorian"" Lourd worked with Disney's then-head of streaming Kevin Mayer to get Favreau a unique deal of cash and Disney stock. The thinking behind the contract was ""The Mandalorian"" would lead to a boom in Disney+ subscribers and Favreau wanted to be able to participate in the potential upside. Mayer and Lourd decided the best proxy for Disney+ performance was Disney stock understanding the company's shares would largely trade on the performance of the flagship streaming service.

That turned out to be accurate. Disney shares boomed during the pandemic even with theme parks closed because Disney+ subscribers grew by leaps and bounds each quarter. Favreau signed his deal with Disney shares around $90. By February 2021 they had doubled to more than $180 per share. They've since come back down amid broader market declines with Disney at just below $100 per share as of Friday's close. Disney+ ended its fiscal third quarter with more than 152 million global subscribers. ""He helps people with company-level strategic decisions"" Mayer who has since founded the media investment firm Candle Media said about Lourd. ""He's a great agent but he transcends that."" Shell of NBCUniversal and film producer Jason Blum also have Lourd to thank on a highly unusual so-called first-look deal struck in 2014 that's turned out to be ""wildly lucrative"" for both parties Blum said. Instead of NBCUniversal paying Blum fees for his films which have included 2017's ""Get Out"" and 2018's ""Halloween"" both of which grossed over $250 million worldwide on budgets of $10 million or less Blum wanted to build equity in his own production company Blumhouse. Lourd architected a deal with then-Universal Pictures Chairman Donna Langley in which NBCUniversal took a non-controlling equity stake in Blumhouse with Blum's fees going back into the company rather than into his bank account. At first Shell who at the time ran Universal was skeptical of the idea. But Lourd crafted a complicated 10-year contract giving the company a variety of network and cable television shows digital properties and of course low-budget horror movies. Shell echoed sentiments from Sarandos Van Amburg Starz's Hirsch and Zaslav that conversations with Lourd frequently go well beyond talent deals spanning subjects from potential hires to the metaverse to how live sports should be integrated in streaming video. ""Bryan is a problem solver"" Shell said. ""He's the closest thing in the industry to the age-old superagent of yesteryear."" Blum summed it up more succinctly. ""I don't see him as an agent"" Blum said. ""He's a Hollywood executive."" WATCH: Endeavor CEO Ari Emanuel breaks down the media and entertainment landscape.

Warner Bros. Discovery has been on a spree of making drastic decisions such as delaying Michael B. Jordan’s Superman movie completely disregarding the Batgirl movie and now by the looks of it cancelling if not completely removing Final Space from all media platforms.

Made by Olan Rogers the show had a run of three seasons which would now all be removed from all platforms including Netflix and no further television screenings will take place. The show will now be reduced to being a tax write – off completely discontinuing even the production of physical copies.

Final Space Has Its Final Run

The drama – comedy animated series Final Space released its third season in July of 2021 and it looks like that would now be its final season as well. WBD has ruled the series as a tax write – off with no way of anyone being able to see it until and unless they already own a copy of season 1 or 2 physically. Season three was never made into a physical copy at all and once Netflix is to take down the series internationally there would no longer be any trace of the show existing except for what our memories hold.

The protagonist of the story seems to be working off a prison sentence when he meets a new pal with whom he instantly connects unbeknownst to him that this friend of his is being hunted by a Lord Commander who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. Olan Rogers himself voices multiple characters including both Gary and Mooncake along with David Tennant as the voice of Lord Commander.

The show’s fourth season seemed to be in the works however that would no longer be the case with WBD’s decision. Olan Rogers himself was devasted by the news. Writing a heartfelt letter addressing the fans he states that he understands this to be purely business however he cannot forget the personal connection he has with his project.

“I’ve been trying to process how this feels; it’s been hard because it’s just so absurd.”

He also proceeded to acknowledge the banner of #renewfinalspace and claims to support it for as long as possible.

Imagine a clean energy future and you might picture giant turbines twisting in the wind or electric vehicles zipping quietly down the highway. Fossil fuels become relics or disappear altogether.

ExxonMobil has a different vision. In this story of the future oil refineries continue to distill crude. Fossil fuel-burning power plants churn away too.

Oil and gas aren’t the problem Exxon chief executive Darren Woods has said. The problem is their carbon pollution. So last year Exxon proposed a herculean industrial effort for the Houston area that would allow the region’s fossil fuel infrastructure to continue operating at full throttle for decades while steadily lowering its climate emissions.

Using a technology called carbon capture and storage Exxon said it could collect 50 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually from industrial smokestacks by 2030 and double that amount by 2040. The company would then compress the gas and deliver it through hundreds of miles of new pipelines to injection wells drilled beneath the Gulf of Mexico where the climate-warming gas would remain locked away forever in porous rock.

Exxon is proposing to create an entirely new industry built to capture carbon and reinject it all so that energy companies can keep on pumping and burning oil and gas. The $100 billion mega-project would tie together dozens of facilities owned by 12 of the world’s biggest corporate polluters including oil majors like Chevron power generators like Calpine and chemical giants like Dow. It would also require substantial government financing Exxon said.

Exxon and others have already made strides in securing this support. Since the company released its proposal Congress has given the Energy Department $20 billion to spend on carbon capture and clean hydrogen projects and authorized another $250 billion in loan guarantees for these and other emissions-cutting technologies. Lawmakers also increased the value of a carbon-capture tax incentive such that if Exxon and its partners meet their 2030 goals for Houston they would stand to reap more than $4 billion every year from taxpayers for up to 12 years. The prospect of these multibillion-dollar government handouts has riled many climate advocates.

“Paying them to do this is paying a ransom on the planet” said Corey Williams who until recently served as the research and policy director at Air Alliance Houston an environmental advocacy group.

“We’re not penalizing them we’re considering paying them” he added. “That to me couldn’t be more backwards.”

Many analysts and environmental advocates received Exxon’s announcement with skepticism. Some critics see the company’s commitment to carbon capture as a form of greenwashing a disingenuous gesture toward lowering emissions serving as cover for the real investments in oil and gas. Exxon’s only publicly announced investment in carbon capture this year has been a $400 million expansion of an operation in Wyoming compared with a projected $22.5 billion in total capital expenditures. The company has also said it expects to sell even more oil and gas five years from now than it does today.

Even if the world’s current capacity for capturing carbon were increased by a factor of 10 it would equal only 1 percent of global CO2 emissions. What’s more over the last several decades only a few dozen carbon capture operations have been built and collectively they capture far less CO2 than what Exxon said it could achieve over just eight years. Nearly every attempt to build these types of projects has hit delays failed to reach targets or simply never been completed.

The Houston region is home to one of the greatest concentrations of heavy polluters in the country but most of the emissions come from refineries and power plants which are among the most expensive applications for carbon capture technology. Every project needed for the Houston hub as the proposal is known would need to be unprecedented in nature and scale.

Exxon Chevron and others have proposed some of the first projects that could begin to make up the hub but they have yet to publicly commit anything beyond small initial investments despite raking in what could be record profits this year: Exxon earned $17.9 billion from just April through June.

Williams and other community advocates also worry that the carbon capture projects if built would do little or nothing to limit the release of cancer-causing air pollutants like benzene and heavy metals that spew from the refineries and petrochemical plants into surrounding neighborhoods. The people who live in these neighborhoods are predominantly Latino and the air they breathe is some of the dirtiest in the nation.

The hub might not deliver the climate benefits Exxon claims either. The carbon capture equipment would require vast quantities of power. Even if that electricity were generated by emissions-free sources many advocates and experts argue it would be more effective to simply send that power into the grid and displace fossil fuels altogether rather than run carbon capture operations.

Many of the Houston projects would involve converting natural gas into hydrogen a clean-burning fuel while capturing the associated CO2. But research indicates that upstream methane leaks in natural gas systems which remain widespread can reduce or negate the climate benefits of using the fuel to make hydrogen.

In short many experts say Exxon’s vision is an extreme long-shot—some would say bad-faith—proposal for the largest-ever deployment of a technology that has failed to prove itself at scale despite billions of dollars of public subsidies and private investments and decades of effort.

Still many policy experts have come to believe that some amount of carbon capture will be needed to meet climate targets and the Biden administration has made the technology a key part of its climate policies. So the Houston hub perhaps the biggest and boldest plan to capture carbon from smokestacks is drawing significant attention from major corporations and the federal government.

The hub inched closer to reality last month when Congress passed a major climate and tax bill that includes the substantial expansion of a federal carbon capture tax credit. The change could push many of the proposals including one announced this year by Exxon for its Baytown refinery across the economic threshold of profitability. Some academic modelers are now projecting a 13-fold increase in carbon capture by the end of the decade because of this tax credit expansion.

Oil and gas executives reacted to the bill’s passage with “wild enthusiasm” said Charles McConnell energy officer and director at the University of Houston’s Center for Carbon Management and Energy Sustainability who is serving as an academic adviser to Exxon and the other companies pursuing the hub. “To say any more would probably be more than I care to share.”

This lucrative incentive comes on top of the billions of dollars that last year’s infrastructure bill sent to the Department of Energy to help build carbon capture projects and clean hydrogen hubs. And when that money begins flowing next year a good portion is widely expected to land in Houston.

More Money for Carbon Capture Than Ever Before

Early last year Exxon’s top executives were in the uncomfortable position of playing defense. An upstart hedge fund had launched a campaign to replace several of the oil company’s directors trying to convince shareholders that fresh blood was needed to reposition Exxon’s business to address climate change. The hedge fund presented data about an inevitable transition away from fossil fuels and how Exxon’s investments were failing to anticipate that trend. The shareholder vote was scheduled for late May. A few weeks before the critical vote Exxon’s management floated a counter-narrative about its bright future that revolved around the Houston hub.

On the day the company announced the proposal Woods and Joe Blommaert who was then chief of Exxon’s low carbon business wrote a column for The Wall Street Journal arguing that the Houston hub would help the nation meet its climate targets and serve as a model for the world. As the central pillar of Exxon’s low-carbon strategy it would build on the company’s expertise “managing hydrocarbon molecules” as executives like to say rather than attempting to enter entirely new businesses like wind or solar energy.

“Based on Energy Department numbers we estimate there is adequate capacity along the Gulf Coast to store around 500 billion metric tons of CO2” they wrote. Tens of thousands of new jobs would be created in the process they said and thousands of existing jobs would be preserved.

The success of their proposal however was contingent on government funding. And Exxon executives and lobbyists had already been working to line up support from public officials.

The week before the announcement Woods had presented the hub proposal to Houston’s mayor Sylvester Turner in a phone call according to emails obtained in a public records request. The day after Exxon went public with the carbon capture plan Turner followed with his own press release praising the effort as “the type of bold ambition and investment we will need to meet our climate goals.”

Within weeks the commissioners of Harris County home to Exxon’s Baytown refinery and many of the industrial facilities along the Houston Ship Channel passed a resolution in support of the company and the proposal too.

Exxon’s shareholders nevertheless voted to replace three corporate directors in May. But the vote did not change the company’s pursuit of the Houston hub.

Most of the financing Exxon needed from government would come at the federal level where its lobbyists began discussing the Houston proposal with members of Congress and agencies last spring according to lobbying disclosures. One Exxon lobbyist pitched the hub to officials at the Department of Labor according to emails obtained in a records request claiming it would create “tens of thousands of new jobs.”

In May of last year Woods met with Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and discussed the company’s efforts on carbon capture and storage. To build the hub Exxon would need the department to expand or amend its loan programs according to a presentation given to state regulators last year by Erik Oswald vice president of strategy and advocacy at Exxon’s low-carbon business.

Charisma Troiano an Energy Department spokeswoman declined to elaborate on what was discussed at the meeting with Exxon saying only that “the department and the secretary meet with a lot of companies interested in carbon capture given the recognition that it is needed to reach President Biden’s net zero by 2050 goals.”

After a lobbying blitz from Exxon and many others Congress soon allocated more money to carbon capture and storage than any government anywhere has to date and much of it closely matched what Oswald said his company needed for the Houston hub. The infrastructure bill that passed last year for example created a new Energy Department program that will provide $2.1 billion in loans and grants for building carbon dioxide pipelines and authorized billions more for clean hydrogen and carbon capture demonstration projects. The bill also directed the Interior Department to issue regulations within a year that would open offshore areas to CO2 storage another step Exxon needed. Days after the bill was signed the company secured the mineral rights beneath a swath of federal waters off Houston that align closely with where Exxon has said it would inject the hub’s CO2.

Last month the climate legislation passed by Congress included a significant expansion of a carbon capture tax credit as well as a new clean hydrogen production tax credit. While the new value of the carbon capture credit isn’t as high as what Exxon has sought—$100 per metric ton—it comes close increasing the value by about 70 percent to $85 for every metric ton of CO2 captured and stored underground. That places the value not coincidentally just above the estimated cost of applying carbon capture to hydrogen production and close to the cost for several other applications.

This tax credit change is likely the most important subsidy of all for the Houston hub: 50 million metric tons of carbon dioxide could work out to more than $4 billion annually. Companies have until 2033 to begin construction to qualify for the credit and are eligible to receive it for 12 years.

The bill also authorized the Energy Department to offer $250 billion in loan guarantees for projects that would help energy facilities “avoid reduce utilize or sequester air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases.” This closely matched a request in Oswald’s presentation last year. Of the eight items he listed as “what’s needed” from government the infrastructure and climate bills delivered all or part of six.

In March of this year while the climate bill’s fate was uncertain Exxon announced the first proposal for the hub a plan to make hydrogen with natural gas while capturing the process’s emissions at its Baytown refinery complex. Chevron soon followed with its own proposal a CO2 storage project in state waters off the Gulf Coast. Two weeks later BP and Linde a chemical company that is among the 12 supporting corporations said they would team up to produce low-carbon hydrogen and “support the storage of carbon dioxide captured from other industrial facilities—paving the way for large-scale decarbonization of the Texas Gulf Coast industrial corridor.”

Exxon declined to make anyone available for an interview but spokesman Todd Spitler emailed a statement that pointed to several carbon capture proposals the company has announced around the world most of which are in the early planning stages as evidence of its intentions to deploy the technology.

Earlier this year Woods spoke directly of the company’s carbon capture efforts at a major oil industry conference in Houston.

“It’s not unlike the things that our industry has done and our company in particular has done as we move around the world is building some of these industries grassroots from scratch” he said. “We’ve got an opportunity to essentially build a new business here from scratch working with the government and with industry.”

‘If You Can’t Do it Here’

Buffalo Bayou was once a swampy mosquito-infested creek that seeped through Houston to Galveston Bay. Its shallow waters couldn’t accommodate oceangoing vessels so local leaders aiming to build a true inland port embarked on a series of projects beginning in the late 19th century to dredge and widen the waterway.

Today the Houston Ship Channel is lined by a nearly unbroken 20-mile stretch of refineries storage tanks and petrochemical plants. They comprise all the industrial pieces needed to convert hydrocarbons into the fuels fertilizers and plastics that feed the modern economy. Their smokestacks and flares form an industrial skyline of white plumes and orange flames belching greenhouse gases into the thick Gulf Coast air and toxic pollution into residential neighborhoods. Depending on the wind their stench can hang heavy above the houses carrying a foul smell of sulfur and crude even a hops-like tang.

Exxon’s Baytown refinery and petrochemical complex is the largest of these sprawling over 3400 acres four times the size of Manhattan’s Central Park. It is one of the country’s biggest sources of carbon dioxide pollution pumping out more than 11 million metric tons in 2020 the last year for which data is available according to figures reported to the Environmental Protection Agency.

This concentration of polluting industry happens to sit next to some of the best geology for storing carbon dioxide underground: Formations beneath the Gulf of Mexico could hold more than 100 billion tons of CO2 according to one study. Add in the fact that the companies already hold many pipeline rights of way and enjoy the permissive oversight of Texas regulators and you have what many experts say is the ideal place to build a major carbon capture hub.

“If you can’t do it here commercially you can’t do it anywhere” said McConnell of the University of Houston who has been advising Exxon and the other hub companies. McConnell led the Energy Department’s Office of Fossil Energy from 2011 to 2013 and he said his experience there is not lost on the companies as they seek federal funding. The United States and the world remain far off track for the larger goal of zeroing out greenhouse gas emissions by midcentury. Many experts have charted pathways for achieving zero emissions within the power sector by building massive amounts of renewable energy and light-duty transportation through electrification. But billions of tons of carbon pollution are emitted every year by the manufacturing of iron steel cement chemicals and many other products central to society. These sectors account for roughly one-sixth of global CO2 pollution and currently carbon capture and storage is one of the few tools for reducing them. “It’s not an option” McConnell said. “It’s a requirement.”

Some supporters of the technology also argue that applying carbon capture to a select number of fossil-fueled power plants could make the electric grid much more efficient and reliable than if it depended entirely on renewable sources. Because wind and solar power are intermittent an all-renewable grid would require building tremendous capacity to meet peak demand far more than what might be needed most of the time. There are substantial hurdles to building so much renewable energy production including opposition from communities where it would be sited and backlogs in permitting.

One of the people who makes this argument is Brad Crabtree who is now the Energy Department’s assistant secretary for fossil energy and carbon management the position McConnell once held.

“When you retrofit for example a power plant with carbon capture it has a special value in the broader decarbonized grid that often doesn’t get fully recognized” Crabtree said. “It can result in efficiencies elsewhere” driving down costs system-wide he added.

Before he joined the Biden administration Crabtree was the director of the Carbon Capture Coalition a collection of energy companies unions and environmental groups that advocates supportive policies. Now he is overseeing billions of dollars in federal funds created by those policies to help build demonstration plants pipelines and storage sites much of which could be done by coalition members.

McConnell said the Houston companies are serious about building the hub and have developed rigorous plans for doing so. “These guys know what they want to do” he said.

Substantial hurdles to developing a major hub remain including uncertainty about long-term liability associated with storing CO2 underground and securing the permits and investments needed to build pipelines. Still McConnell said the new higher tax-credit value means companies can now start running business modeling for specific projects.

“That’s what’s exciting” he said. “That’s what is going to put the tailwinds into the sail here. I think you’ll see a lot of interesting business developments. They won’t all move forward but it’ll be interesting. This is a big deal.”

Is Carbon Capture Viable?

Carbon capture and storage might be one of the best technologies for reducing emissions from certain polluting industries but there is substantial debate about which sectors those are. And just because it might be needed doesn’t mean it’s viable.

As of last year 27 carbon capture operations were running globally capable of preventing some 37 million metric tons of pollution according to the Global CCS Institute. Four more were under construction and another 102 in various stages of planning. Even if every one of those planned projects were completed all of the world’s carbon capture plants would prevent about 150 million metric tons of pollution annually or less than one-half of 1 percent of global CO2 emissions which amounted to about 36 billion tons last year.

Economics would suggest that the most cost-effective plants will be built first. Policy experts on the other hand want to focus on the most intractable sectors like cement that have few alternatives for cutting emissions. Houston’s industrial polluters by and large do not fit in either category.

Refineries are one of the largest sources of carbon emissions in the Houston region according to EPA data and they are among the most expensive to retrofit with carbon capture technology. They also hold a precarious position in the global transition away from fossil fuels. Declining demand would mean fewer refineries raising the question of why the nation would invest tens of billions of dollars to lower the emissions from facilities that might close soon.

“If we really think about what is the world that we need to make in order to achieve and stay at net-zero emissions within the next couple of decades I don’t really personally see a role for the ongoing dependence on fossil fuels at the kind of intensity that that would indicate” said Emily Grubert an associate professor of sustainable energy policy at Notre Dame who recently completed a year leading the Energy Department’s office of carbon management which conducts research into carbon capture. She added that while some diminishing volumes of oil and gas will likely be needed to produce materials or fuels for decades “for like bulk oil production and refining and transportation fuels in particular we are not going to succeed at decarbonization if that’s still a thing.”

The largest source of emissions around Houston in 2020 were coal- and gas-fired power plants. Grubert and many other experts say that because the costs of wind and solar generation have fallen so rapidly—and with the costs of battery storage now declining too—there is no compelling case for spending billions to retrofit these power plants rather than shutting them down. Building new wind and solar farms is simply cheaper and perhaps more reliable.

Utilities and the federal government have already spent many billions of dollars trying to launch commercial-scale carbon capture power plants. Only one was completed in the United States and it happens to be outside Houston—attached to a coal plant that was the second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the region in 2020 after Exxon’s Baytown refinery.

Five years ago NRG Energy began operating the Petra Nova carbon capture plant with nearly $200 million in Energy Department support and more in local tax breaks. By some measures the project was a success. It captured more than 90 percent of the carbon dioxide that passed through the system according to an Energy Department report.

But the project was designed to capture only a fraction of the coal plant’s emissions and according to the report it failed to reach its overall capture target because of numerous problems that arose including equipment outages and difficulties delivering the gas to its ultimate destination a nearby oil field. Ironically the project’s finances depended on using the captured CO2 to squeeze oil out of the ground and generate cash from the sales which helps explain Petra Nova’s largest failure.

In 2020 as oil prices crashed the project ceased capturing any carbon emissions. It hasn’t restarted since.

‘I Don’t Really Feel Like it’s Solving the Problem’

The Ship Channel has spawned an almost entirely industrial landscape. But just past the fence lines in many cases are the homes and schools of the area’s mostly Latino residents.

Valero’s Houston refinery for example borders two sides of the Manchester neighborhood. About 200 yards from the gate are a playground and community center. On the wall is a mural showing smiling children playing below industrial stacks topped with bright orange flames like a dystopian dream. One of the goals of the Houston hub effort is to keep refineries like Valero’s operating for decades albeit with new emissions-capturing equipment.

“With carbon capture I don’t really feel like it’s solving the problem” said Leticia Gutierrez the director of government relations and community outreach at Air Alliance Houston which campaigns for cleaning up the area’s air pollution.

To start capturing 50 million metric tons which is about one-third of the region’s industrial emissions might not deliver the climate benefits it would appear to.

Many of the projects including Exxon’s Baytown proposal and that of BP and Linde would convert natural gas into hydrogen while capturing CO2 emissions. The clean-burning hydrogen could replace natural gas used at the refineries and might fuel ships or heavy-duty trucks. Exxon has said the Baytown project could reduce the refinery’s emissions by “up to 30 percent” or about 3 million metric tons per year while also selling hydrogen to help others lower their emissions.

But academic research has shown that any benefits achieved by capturing CO2 can be offset by leaks of natural gas which consist primarily of methane a far more potent greenhouse gas. Even if these projects reduced carbon dioxide emissions they could increase methane emissions negating the larger goal.

Carbon capture equipment is also extremely energy-intensive. One utility in Wyoming for example said in regulatory filings that operating equipment at coal plants there would consume more than one-third of the plants’ electrical output a phenomenon known as “parasitic load.”

For the Petra Nova operation near Houston the company built a new natural gas turbine to power the carbon capture system which required nearly 15 percent as much electricity as was generated by the coal unit it was attached to. That natural gas turbine also sent its own carbon dioxide and all its other emissions straight into the air.

This power consumption raises one of the core arguments against the technology: If you power carbon capture systems with fossil fuels you generate additional pollution. If you power the systems with renewable energy you consume precious clean power that could be put to other uses. Either way you are effectively driving emissions higher at least somewhat in an elaborate attempt to reduce them. This hardly seems efficient.

For the people who live close to the industrial development however carbon dioxide is not the most important pollutant. The region’s refineries and chemical plants spew toxic chemicals like benzene which drive cancer risks far higher for workers and nearby residents. According to an analysis last year by ProPublica the greater Houston region has “the third-biggest hot spot of cancer-causing air in the country.”

Gutierrez grew up nearby and still lives in the area where she has raised three children. Her son developed asthma when he was a child she said and she found that his symptoms would clear when they would visit family in Mexico in the mountains outside Monterrey.

Gutierrez herself has developed headaches and rashes of which her family has no history she said. The companies have said the hub’s use of carbon capture and hydrogen fuel could reduce some air pollutants from the area’s power plants and trucks such as soot and sulfur oxides but it is unclear how it would reduce the emissions of toxic pollutants.

Exxon declined to answer detailed questions about the projects.

“People sometimes ask me why I don’t move” Gutierrez said while giving a tour of the area earlier this year. She stays because she loves her house she tells them and her community. Anyway she said she couldn’t afford to buy anything similar on Houston’s westside where the air is cleaner.

Few if any residents have heard of the hub proposal Gutierrez and other community advocates say but people in the communities around the Ship Channel are skeptical of any plan presented by Exxon or other corporations to clean up the industry. It is unclear whether they would welcome it. One thing for sure is that the companies haven’t come to ask.

This follows the arrival of vessels and equipment needed to fully execute the year-long exercise.

The vessels which arrived in Ghana waters at 6 am last Thursday from Lagos arrived in Saltpond on Saturday to complete the second phase of the exercise which involves the removal of pipes plugging and abandonment of the Louis Platform.

The decommissioning exercise is estimated to take 12 months. The exercise will be undertaken by Hans & Co Oil and Gas Company Ltd a Ghanaian company working with selected experts with support from a project management consultant.

Addressing the press in Saltpond on Sunday following the arrival of the vessels and equipment Dr Kwame Baah – Nuakoh General Manager – Sustainability and Stakeholder Relations at GNPC assured the public that the Corporation has received the necessary permits to undertake this important exercise.

He said “as the National Oil Company we are committed to safeguarding both human and aquatic life so we are working closely with the Petroleum Commission EPA Ghana Maritime Authority Ghana Navy traditional authorities and the fishermen in the catchment areas to ensure that all the necessary stakeholder consultations and permits are secured.”

He further emphasized that the Corporation has also put in place a robust emergency response plan of international standards to manage any incident in the unlikely event - it occurs.

It will be recalled that in August 2016 the Minister of Energy directed GNPC to decommission the field based on the recommendations from state institutions such as the PC and EPA.

Subsequent to that a field decommissioning process was initiated in 2018 with the first phase of decommissioning studies and the development of a decommissioning plan duly completed and approved by the Minister of Energy.

Background of the SOPCL

The Saltpond Oil Field is the oldest oil field offshore Ghana which was discovered in 1970 by Signal-Amoco Consortium.

Amoco Consortium relinquished the concession in 1976 citing the field as non-commercial.

The concession was then assigned to Offshore Hydrocarbons Ltd. which later entered into a development farmout with Agri-Petco of the United States.

In 1977–1978 Agri-Petco drilled six appraisal wells from a centrally located jack-up rig called Mr Louie. After the drilling the jack-up was converted into a production unit and the field was put on stream in October 1978.

In 1984 the field was reassigned to Primary Fuels Inc. which took over the operation for a year. In July 1985 GNPC took over the operation of the field after the field had been shut-in due to non-commerciality.

From 1978 to 1985 the maximum oil production was 4800 barrels per day (760 m3/d) of oil. When operation stopped in 1985 the volume of production was 580 barrels per day (92 m3/d) of oil.

The estimated percentages of oil and gas that had been exploited from the field at the time of shutdown were 10.4% and 25% respectively with three of the six wells unable to produce oil.

On 18th January 2000 GNPC entered into an agreement with Lushann International of Houston Texas for the rehabilitation of the Saltpond Oil Field and the implementation of the rig-less workover proposal.

Lushann International contracted Eternit Universal Ltd. of Nigeria for the financing of the rehabilitation works. In August 2000 rehabilitation works commenced with the repair of the Mr Louie platform.

In 2002 Oildata's programme of rig-less workover discovered obstructions in the wells which prevented access to the bottom of most of the wells.

When the workover was completed only two wells were able to produce between 480–600 bopd (76– 95 m3/d). Lushann International was also granted the right to develop up to 400 MW of power generation facilities to commercialize natural gas from the Saltpond Field.

In 2002 the Government of Ghana began re-negotiating the agreement between GNPC and Lushann-Eternit Energy Ltd.

The negotiations ended in 2004 with a new agreement in which GNPC's stake was increased from 40% to 45% with Lushann- Eternit Energy Ltd. having 55%.

The new agreement led to the creation of the Saltpond Offshore Producing Company which marketed the oil from the fields on the world market.

The rig-less workover could not sustain high production resulting in a drop of about 450 barrels per day (72 m3/d) of oil. In 2005 operations were suspended so the rig-less workover could be replaced.

Operations resumed in April 2006 with an increase in production to 700 barrels per day (110 m3/d) from two wells.

The Field recorded a continuous decline in production until December 2015 when oil production was below 200 bopd.

Production operations ceased on 23rd December 2015 due to financial issues and Saltpond Field’s inability to remain economically viable. The remaining reserve is about 0.35MMBO.

The Minister of Petroleum constituted an inter-agency committee to review the state of the Saltpond Field and advise the way forward. In June 2016 the committee presented its report.

Among other recommendations were two main ones: termination of the Petroleum Agreement for non-performance and cessation and subsequent decommissioning of the Saltpond Field.

In August 2016 the Minister of Petroleum wrote to Lushann Eternit to terminate the Saltpond Field Petroleum activities.

Why Saltpond Field Decommissioning

The Production on the field has depleted over the years. The Field has exhausted almost the recoverable reserves and therefore oil produced is so low that it is unable to meet operational costs hence it has become unprofitable.

Production has moved from 4800 bopd in 1985 to below 200 bopd in 2015. Production has gotten to a stage where the flow of oil had become economically non-viable.

Subsequently the Petroleum Agreement was terminated by the then Minister of Petroleum in August 2016 upon the advice of an inter-Ministerial committee.

In September 2016 GNPC publicly announced the decommissioning of the Saltpond Field.

This was informed by some of the conditions stated below:

The Platform and wells are in a deplorable state posing danger to the crew on board and seafarers.

The wells and wellheads are in a deplorable state a breach of which may lead to spillage of oil which would adversely impact aquatic life and the lives of the fishermen and those with facilities along the beaches.

If the structure is not removed it may pose a danger to workers sea aquatic life and in a worst-case scenario community along the coastline.

Major incidents could affect the reputation of GNPC and ultimately affect the social license to operate.

Decommissioning of the field is therefore considered a milestone not only to stop a financially disastrous operation but also to protect the environment

To realize the promise of the Internet of Things (IoT) companies cannot continue to use legacy technologies. Legacy data centers process discrete files and objects but the constant flow of data from IoT devices represent something new: data streams.

Data streams don’t have a beginning or an end to provide natural starting and stopping points for processing. Legacy data processing technology that depends upon batch processing cannot expand quickly enough to avoid throughput bottlenecks and the resulting delays affect the critical functions of ingestion processing and analysis.

To make practical use of real-time data streams from sensors security cameras medical devices and other time-critical information flows the data must be ingested and processed quickly. Dell’s Streaming Data Platform provides a scalable solution to rapidly accommodate high volumes of IoT data and make it available for real-time analysis.

See below to learn all about Dell Streaming Data Platform and where it stands in the storage sector:

Dell Streaming Data Platform key benefits

Customers that pursue solutions such as the Dell Streaming Data Platform hope to gain the following key benefits.

Consolidate infrastructure

Dell’s Streaming Data Platform not only enables rapid data flows that keep up with IoT information sources it also can expand to encompass and replace existing legacy infrastructure. The expandability of a single platform eliminates the need to maintain and secure multiple technologies.

Edge data control

The Dell Streaming Platform solution installs into local or cloud data centers completely under the control of the organization. The solution directly ingests data feeds and provides a single solution incorporating analysis and alerting. After processing the Streaming Data Platform can directly feed the data into local data centers or whatever cloud storage provider might be desired for long-term storage.

Maximize IoT information insights

The surging quantities of information from IoT devices continues to grow in number and in richness. However if an organization cannot keep up with the pace of the information it will fail to receive information on a timely basis and be able to act.

Adopting the Dell Streaming Data Platform enables an enterprise to continuously match the growing needs of the IoT feeds for ingestion processing and analysis. If needed the system can also scale to incorporate historical data flows to help catch up to information backlogs and provide the maximum information for alerts and artificial intelligence (AI) analysis and to minimize the delays for intelligent reactions.

Simplified deployment

Enterprises always have the option to build their own stream solution but these do-it-yourself (DIY) solutions consume enormous development time for integration vulnerability testing debugging and deployment. The true value to the company comes from the information extracted from the data stream so deploying a packaged solution enables companies to extract value more efficiently and much faster.

Dell Streaming Data Platform use cases

RWTH Aachen University

The scientists mathematicians and software developers collaborating in the Laboratory for Machine Tools for RWTH Aachen University (WZL) seek new insights from machine product and manufacturing data. Various sensors in WZL’s custom metal fineblanking incubators generate more than 1 million data points per second and small localized data processing created huge delays in making necessary adjustments.

“We wanted to use high-frequency data to help manufacturers analyze changes in their processes monitor output and process quality and make adjustments in real time” explained Philipp Niemietz head of digital technologies for WZL.

Adopting Dell’s Streaming Data Platform provided the lab with the capabilities to make AI-guided adjustments based on real-time analysis of the sensor data.

“No matter how many sensors we use once we set up the analytics pipeline and the data streams we don’t have to address any load-balancing issues” said Niemietz.

Other use cases

Itzik Reich VP technologist of ISG at Dell published a blog in which he illustrates real-world test cases to which the Dell Streaming Data Platform was successfully applied to replace batch and real-time processes. These use cases cover a broad variety of applications such as:

Video feeds from a fleet of drones monitor the real time health of cattle.

A sheet metal manufacturer uses real-time temperature sensor data streams to replace ineffective real-time and variance batch pipelines to make automated adjustments and maintain temperature within optimal thresholds.

Real-time video footage of airplane take-offs and landings can be used to automatically detect abnormalities that might require maintenance.

The faster data processing of the Streaming Data Platform permits more responsive preventative measures and subtle adjustments than legacy solutions.

While the blog does not quote specific customers Reich notes that customers often enjoy a reduction in their physical infrastructure and management time required for software and stack operations. The blog also focuses on the infrastructure savings from simplified IT architecture and the elimination of redundant data storage.

Dell Streaming Data Platform differentiators

When selecting the Dell Streaming Data Platform over other possible edge processing solutions an organization will typically do so because of the following differentiators.

Dell management platform

Dell’s proprietary management software for the Streaming Data Platform uses dynamic and automatic management of systems to turbo-charge the open-source foundation of the platform. The management software:

Distributes data processing and analytical jobs over the available infrastructure

Satisfies processing requirements in real time

Configures data stream properties

Controls application deployment

Provides critical information such as operations metrics and job status

Deployment options

Streaming Data Platform is available in various versions for flexible deployment:

SDP Core: On-premises data center implementation that enables real-time data ingestion and feeds from other SDP deployments. Supports 3–12 nodes.

SDP Edge: Edge deployment implementation with local processing filtering and enriching capabilities. Deployable on single (no high availability requirement) or three physical nodes (high availability requirement).

SDP Micro: Lightweight version of SDP Edge specifically for low-volume data from sensors without gateways. Can only be installed on a single virtual or physical node.

Open-source with support

Built on open-source community built-and-tested components Dell’s Streaming Data Platform provides the flexibility to avoid future vendor lock-in. However the solution is also backed by Dell ProSupport Plus as well as Dell’s enormous sales and support network. This support network delivers the expert consulting needs an organization may want for an effective implementation.

Unified platform

Organizations can create their own mix of technologies to duplicate the capabilities of the Dell Streaming Data Platform. Yet Dell’s unified solution provides turn-key availability for rapid deployment and integrated features that eliminate the need for tedious operational and security testing.

Conclusions

Not all enterprises have a need to process real-time data streams. However as IoT and operational technology (OT) continues to evolve and become network connected more businesses and governments will find themselves developing the need to handle streaming data sources.

The actress posted a photo to her Instagram story of a biopsy scar on the side of her breast covered in surgical tape. Alongside the photo Zegler wrote a caption detailing her experiences with the scare.

""Two years ago I found a lump in my breast and went through what was undoubtedly the scariest week of my life"" Zegler wrote.

@rachelzegler // Instagram

""No OB/GYN was taking new patients due to the backlog of the pandemic but I was fortunate to have the care of my pediatrician who prescribed me an ultrasound which led to an out-patient biopsy procedure. Thankfully it was benign.""

Zegler continued: ""And now the scar serves as a reminder to check my breasts regularly for any irregular growth – the fibroadenoma in my left breast is a common occurrence but nevertheless extremely scary to find.""

She finished by writing: ""Early detection saves lives!!! Check your titty meat :).""

The biopsy Zegler went under is a diagnostic procedure to determine whether a lump is cancerous or benign. A small sample of tissue is taken from the breast and tested. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in the UK but the survival rate for 10 years or more post-diagnosis is 76%.

Zegler is best known for her lead role as Maria in Steven Spielberg's Oscar-winning movie West Side Story which was her first-ever film role. She will also star in the Hunger Games prequel The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes and Disney's live-action remake of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. She will play the lead role of Snow White while Gal Gadot will play the Evil Queen.

He died almost instantly.

Shortly before Rossa’s death Frank had started work on a portrait of Belfast man Kieran Conlon (21) who was also killed by car thieves the year before.

In 2003 five men – aged between 17 and 28- were charged in connection with his son’s death but in the years following Frank campaigned along with his wife Josie and other families as part of the group ‘Families Bereaved Through Car Crime’ for more to be done.

Fellow car crime campaigner Tommy Holland paid tribute to Frank on Facebook.

He said he was “a great guy” who “will be very much missed in many circles of people”.

The post read: “Sorry to hear this very sad news. RIP Frank 'Lucas' Quigley. Condolences to Frank's children family circle and his friends. Frank was a great guy to know and especially to meet and he was also a great artist he done several wonderful artworks for us Suicide Awareness Garden of Reflection mural our Court Celtic art entrance was outstanding and he also taught my son Thomas to draw at BIFHE. HE was part of Families Bereaved Through Car Crime as Josie and himself had lost their son Rossa and both took part in the ""Ripple Effect"" film his art piece for FBTCC was dedicated to his son Rossa. He will be very much missed in many circles of people. Tommy.”

The Whiterock Westrock Historical and Cultural Society also paid tribute to Frank who said the area has now “lost a great friend and neighbour.”

The post on Facebook read: “Frank 'Lucas' Quigley. RIP. It is with deep regret that Whiterock Westrock Historical & Cultural Society has learnt of the passing Lucas. he will be sadly missed by his many friends in theWhiterock/Westrock areas we have lost a great Friend and Neighbour. Thoughts and prayers are with all the Quigley family at this sad time.”",,,,,,,,,

""Since the filing of this lawsuit my firm has been inundated with calls from former and current Amex employees from all around the country who read the allegations of the complaint and couldn't believe how accurately they described their own experiences with the company"" attorney David Pivtorak told FOX Business.

On Aug. 23 Pivtorak filed a class action on behalf of former Amex employee Brian Netzel and potentially thousands of other similarly situated employees following what the complaint described as ""an avalanche of bad things coming to White people in that company once George Floyd was killed.""

The lawsuit alleges that Amex implemented ""anti-racism"" policies throughout its corporate structure in the wake of Floyd's death that ""gave preferential treatment to individuals for being Black and unambiguously signaled to White employees that their race was an impediment to getting ahead in the company.""

AMERICAN EXPRESS SLAPPED WITH LAWSUIT ALLEGING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WHITE EMPLOYEES

In an amended complaint three new class representative plaintiffs allege discrimination similar to that which Netzel described.

Netzel told FOX Business at the time his complaint was filed that Amex's racial policies flooded the workplace with ""a tremendous amount of animosity."" He alleged White employees were unfairly punished or passed over for promotions while some Black employees were promoted merely to meet racial quotas and that some felt empowered to ""root out in McCarthy-era fashion people who didn't agree with this overall philosophy.""

Stocks In This Article: AXP $242.30 1.32%

In his original complaint Netzel alleged that his female manager who is Black would ""aggressively harass and berate White employees"" and that Amex was not only aware of her behavior but provided financial incentives to executives to reduce the number of White employees.

One of the new plaintiffs who resides in a different city than the original plaintiff claims to have been subjected to racial harassment and discrimination from that same manager. Another alleges to have been harassed and denied a promotion on racial grounds by a different manager. All three of the new plaintiffs say they were forced to resign from well-paying positions in the company to escape its racially toxic environment.

EX-AMERICAN EXPRESS EMPLOYEE SPEAKS OUT ON ‘WOKE’ CORPORATE AMERICA: ‘SHAME ON YOU’

""It's hard to put into words how racially toxic that working environment must have been from top to bottom where you can just hear it in these people's voices. I only hope that more employees come forward to challenge these abhorrent practices because that is how we will finally bring the wrongdoers to justice"" attorney Pivtorak said.

Amex did not provide comment on the amended complaint but denied the claims of the original suit with a spokesperson telling FOX Business at the time: ""The allegations made about our company in the lawsuit are false and without merit. We have a longstanding commitment to living our company values which include fostering a diverse and inclusive culture where all colleagues can thrive.""

""Advancement hiring and compensation within our company is based solely on individual qualifications business and leadership performance. Any claim to the contrary is wrong and we do not provide any incentive for behaviors that discriminate against or favor any group of employees"" the spokesperson added.

Amex has faced previous allegations of discrimination. Nick Williams a White male who served eight years as a manager of business development at Amex until he was suddenly let go in March 2021 turned down a six-figure settlement offer after refusing to sign paperwork forbidding him from speaking out against the credit card behemoth.

In 2021 five current and former employees told FOX Business on condition of anonymity that the company engaged in ""reverse discrimination"" against White employees and steeped the workplace in the tenets of critical race theory. Amex categorically denied the accusations at the time."

How to Afford It Is Another Matter. (Published 2022),"Although Devangi Patel 33 has been working as a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist at a large medical center outside Atlanta for only two years her goal is to afford to walk away from her job at 50.

“That to me is the American dream” she said.

Dr. Patel is not alone in her quest to become financially independent — and at a relatively early age. It seems that a generational shift is well underway: Many millennial workers don’t aspire to retire in their mid- or late 60s like their parents. Instead many with professional careers are seeking to leave their jobs by 50 and work for themselves or take a lower-paying role that is more aligned with their interests studies are showing and financial advisers are finding.

“I want to get to a point where I don’t have to work for money anymore and I can work for pleasure” Dr. Patel said.

But reaching that goal has been harder than Dr. Patel anticipated.

Las Vegas Boulevard the epicenter of American gambling is dominated by New York landlords.

Now a big company from Las Vegas wants a bite of the Big Apple.

New York real estate heavyweight Related Companies announced recently that it’s partnering with Wynn Resorts to pursue a casino license with plans for a project in Related’s Hudson Yards development in Manhattan.

Their news release did not provide specifics on the project saying only it would be a “resort entertainment and gaming destination along the Hudson River” and that it would be near the sprawling Javits Center convention facility.

But Wynn’s venture marks a reversal of sorts from what Las Vegas has seen in recent years: New Yorkers snapping up property in Southern Nevada’s most lucrative stretch of real estate.

Of course Las Vegas has long been a destination for out-of-town developers house flippers and commercial-property landlords. (I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve written about Southern California firms buying apartment complexes here.)

But when it comes to the Strip one city in particular has emerged as the main source of buyers lately.

New York-based Vici Properties a Caesars Entertainment spinoff vastly expanded its holdings in Las Vegas when it acquired casino giant MGM Resorts International’s real estate spinoff in a $17 billion-plus deal.

As part of the buyout which closed this spring Vici acquired several MGM-operated properties along Las Vegas Boulevard including The Mirage Park MGM New York-New York Luxor and Excalibur.

Before that Vici also acquired casino operator Las Vegas Sands Corp.’s real estate on the Strip — The Venetian Palazzo and The Venetian Expo — for $4 billion in a deal that closed in February.

All told Vici now owns 660 acres of real estate along the Strip “the most economically productive street in the world” the company said this spring.

Another major landlord from New York is investment giant Blackstone whose portfolio includes Bellagio Aria and Vdara. It purchased those three for more than $8 billion combined and leased them back to MGM Resorts.

It also owns two other MGM-operated properties — Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand — in a joint venture with Vici.

Blackstone had kicked off a real estate buying spree in Southern Nevada after the economy crashed a decade or so ago and it owned and operated The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas for years.

It bought the flashy hotel-casino in 2014 for $1.73 billion and sold it for $5.65 billion. The sale which closed in May marked the “most profitable single asset sale ever” for Blackstone’s real estate business the company previously said.

Meanwhile New York’s Dreamscape Companies acquired the off-Strip Rio for $516.3 million in 2019 and New York investment firm Gindi Capital after it teamed up to buy Showcase Mall several years ago purchased more property along Las Vegas Boulevard in 2019 for $172 million.

Last month Clark County commissioners approved Gindi’s plans for a new three-story retail complex spanning more than 300000 square feet on that roughly 9.5-acre site — which Gindi had acquired from Spectrum Group Management another New York firm.

Related Wynn’s casino partner in New York is no stranger to Las Vegas either. Among other ventures here it partnered on the development of World Market Center downtown’s massive furniture-showroom hall that was acquired in 2017 by (drum roll) Blackstone.

Time will tell whether other Las Vegas firms plant a flag in New York. But odds are a company there is bound to buy something here first.

Of course most people know about the high rollers and casino whales extremely rich individuals who love nothing more than gambling millions of dollars in a single session.

However the richest people at casinos are usually not the gamblers but the casino owners themselves.

Out of all these owners there are a few who are at the very top of the US casino business.

These individuals are some of the wealthiest people in the States and many of them own multiple resorts that are worth billions of dollars.

Some were born into the business others only got involved with casinos much later in life.

However all are extremely ambitious and have built a reputation as some of the best businessmen and businesswomen in the country.

1. Sheldon Adelson – $33.5 Billion

Adelson made and lost millions of dollars multiple times in his adult life.

He only really established his fortune after launching Comdex a Las Vegas computer trade exhibition in 1979.

Adelson began building his casino empire the Las Vegas Sands Corporation in 1989 when he purchased the Sands Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas for $128 million.

After honeymooning in Venice Adelson decided to demolish the Sands and build a new casino-hotel in its place. The Venetian opened in 1999 and cost $1.5 billion to construct.

Adelson took his casino empire to Asia in the early 2000s building Sands Macau the island’s first Las Vegas-style casino in 2004.

During the same year Adelson decided to take Las Vegas Sands Corporation public. After he did his net worth reportedly grew by $1 million every hour for two years!

Other developments soon followed including The Venetian Macau which opened in August 2007 and cost $2.4 billion.

In 2010 Adelson outdid himself building the Marina Bay Sands resort in Singapore. At a cost of $5.5 billion it was the most expensive building in the world.

These resorts continued to make fantastic amounts of profit for Adelson earning him a top ranking on Forbes’ Annual “Biggest Winner” List in 2013 after his casinos added an estimated $15 billion to his net worth during the year.

In September 2020a few short months before his death Sheldon Adelson was estimated by Forbes to be worth an incredible $33.5 billion.

Adelson died in January 2021 at the age of 87. He is survived by his wife Miriam Adelson who still owns more than half of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation gambling empire.

She has a current net worth of $27.7 billion.

2. Tilman Fertitta – $7.9 Billion

Tilman Fertitta initially made his money during Houston’s real estate boom in the 1980s. He then moved on from real estate and became an investor in seafood restaurants owned by the Landry family.

Fertitta became the sole owner of these restaurants in 1988 and has steadily grown the business portfolio by purchasing a number of well-known restaurant chains such as Bubba Gump Rainforest Cafe and Joe’s Crab Shack.

In 2005 as his restaurant empire continued to grow Fertitta moved into the casino business by buying Golden Nugget Hotel and Casinos for $295 million.

This bought him both a casino in Laughlin Nevada and the famous Golden Nugget in Las Vegas one of the oldest casinos in Sin City.

Since purchasing the property Fertitta has spent over $300 million renovating it. This included constructing a new hotel tower and expanding the casino floor itself.

Fertitta has opened three more Golden Nugget casinos including one that replaced Trump Marina in Atlantic City.

Fertitta bought this property at a massively discounted $38 million nearly a tenth of the $316 million Trump Enterprises was asking for before the 2008 financial collapse.

3. Phil Ruffin – $3.1 Billion

Image: Twitter/LindaSuhler

Phil Ruffin built his wealth through owning a chain of convenience stores. He then moved into the hotel business and finally in 1995 when he was 60 years old the casino industry.

He began his casino empire by buying the Crystal Palace Resort in the Bahamas.

Three years later Ruffin bought his first US-based casino taking over The Frontier Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.

The Frontier had been struggling for years because of a long workers’ strike that was being performed by members of the Frontier’s staff.

Ruffin resolved the strike in a few short hours and remodeled the casino for $20 million dollars.

He would ultimately go on to sell the 36-acre property for more than $1.2 billion in what was the largest per-acre price in The Strip’s history.

Ruffin currently owns two of Las Vegas’ most iconic casinos Treasure Island and Circus Circus. Both of these properties have undergone extensive renovations.

Ruffin now aged 87 is still fully committed to his casinos. So much so that he told Forbes that he has no intention of retiring and aims to “die at his desk.”

4. Lorenzo and Frank Fertitta III – $2.6 Billion

The two Fertitta brothers who are third cousins of Tilman Fertitta each have a net worth of $2.6 billion and have had shockingly similar career paths.

They both got their start in the casino business from an early age thanks to their father Frank Fertitta Jr. who launched Station Casinos in 1976.

Station Casinos began as a casino for locals to enjoy and has become one of the largest local casino operators in Las Vegas.

Having worked for Station Casinos as young men Lorenzo and Frank led the company to its first IPO after their father retired in 1993.

They raised $294 million and became principal shareholders and co-founders of Station Casinos Inc. in the process.

Both Frank and Lorenzo were early investors in the UFC purchasing the fight promotion company for $2 million dollars in 2001.

In 2016 the brothers sold their shares for an estimated $4 billion.

Station Casinos Inc. now owns numerous hotel-casinos including Red Rock Casino and Spa in Las Vegas and Sunset Station in Henderson Nevada.

The company also manages a large number of casinos for other owners.

5. Elaine Wynn – $1.7 Billion

Nicknamed the “Queen of Las Vegas” Elaine Wynn is a woman who along with ex-husband Steve transformed the Las Vegas casino industry.

The two of them launched Mirage Resorts in 1973 which would go on to build some of Las Vegas’s most iconic casinos including The Mirage Treasure Island and Bellagio.

These developments were among the first to offer the full range of glitz and glamor that Las Vegas casino resorts have become known for.

In 2000 following their great success the couple sold Mirage Resorts to Kirk Kerkorian for $6.4 billion.

The Wynns wasted no time in launching their new venture Wynn Resorts.

Their first property the flagship hotel and casino Wynn Las Vegas was opened in April 2005 and cost $2.7 billion to construct.

Wynn Resorts now operates a total of six hotel-casinos two in Las Vegas three in Macau and one in Boston.

Elaine and Steve divorced in 2010 evenly splitting their 38% stake in Wynn Resorts.

In 2018 Steve Wynn resigned as CEO of Wynn Resorts and sold the majority of his shares following accusations of sexual misconduct from Wynn Resort staff members.

This has made Elaine the second largest shareholder of Wynn Resorts and one of the most powerful casino owners in the world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhdGVyZXJtaWRkbGVlYXN0LmNvbS9wZW9wbGUvd3lubi1yZXNvcnQtcmFrLXJlc3RhdXJhbnRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why own-brand restaurants are on the menu for RAK's Wynn Resort,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.caterermiddleeast.com/people/wynn-resort-rak-restaurants on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhdGVyZXJtaWRkbGVlYXN0LmNvbS9wZW9wbGUvd3lubi1yZXNvcnQtcmFrLXJlc3RhdXJhbnRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvcmxkcG9rZXJ0b3VyLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NsdWJ3cHQtaG9zdGluZy1hbmRyZXctbmVlbWUtd3B0LXdvcmxkLWNoYW1waW9uc2hpcC1ib3VudHktcG9rZXItdG91cm5hbWVudC10aGlzLXN1bmRheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ClubWPT™ Hosting Andrew Neeme WPT® World Championship Bounty Poker Tournament This Sunday,"World Poker Tour® Ambassador Andrew Neeme will headline the second WPT World Championship Bounty Poker Tournament on ClubWPT™.

PAUL — No one said a turnaround was going to be easy for Miami's men's hockey team for Chris Bergeron who took over as head coach before the 2019-20 season.

It has been some tough sledding for the RedHawks who have finished last in the eight-team NCHC each of the last two seasons. And Miami has been picked to finish last in a preseason poll of the media who cover the conference.

Bergeron went through a rebuild when he was the head coach at Bowling Green before he took over at Miami. Last season the RedHawks struggled despite having a returning All-NCHC First Team goalie in Ludvig Persson. So what will be the start to turning things around?

""(Persson) has brought a work ethic that I've seen very very little of in the last 20 years"" Bergeron said. ""The problem comes that he just takes on too much on himself. He doesn't need to be Superman.

""We need to help him. We need to play better in front of him. The other thing is he believes we should be winning and isn't OK with losing. Unfortunately — but the reality is — too many people have gotten used to losing at Miami. That's going to take a bunch of kids saying 'No more.'""

There are a lot of new faces on the roster with nine freshmen to try to take up that mantra.

""We got to campus a couple weeks early and did a golf outing trying to get to know everyone before we really get into it for the season"" Miami senior defenseman Jack Clement said. ""I'm really excited about the guys we've brought in. Looking forward to it.""

Head coach: Chris Bergeron (4th season at Miami 20-66-9 overall 14-52-6 NCHC; 13th overall 191-220-53 overall).

Last season’s record and finish: 7-27-2 overall 4-19-1 NCHC. Lost in opening round of NCHC playoffs at Denver.

Last season’s NCHC finish: 8th out of 8 teams.

NCHC preseason media poll: 8th.

Notable changes: The RedHawks lost captain and defenseman Derek Daschke — the team's leader in points (28) — to the transfer portal (he is with Minnesota Duluth this season). Forward Matt Barry who finished third on the team in points (23) graduated. Assistant coach Eric Rud left to become the head coach of the USHL's Sioux Falls Stampede.

Outlook: Ludvig Persson was an All-NCHC First Team selection as a freshman but saw his numbers slide last season under a heavy workload (32 games 37.6 shots against per game the most in the nation). Look for a bounce back season for a player known for his work ethic desire to win. The RedHawks need to help with more offense (2.6 goals-per-game 34th nationally) and a better penalty kill (74.5% 53rd).

The Claudia Sanders Dinner House — a 63-year-old eatery in Shelbyville Ky. that draws locals and tourists alike with its fried chicken cole slaw and homemade pies — was put up for sale in June. Some interested buyers say they want to franchise it and expand its footprint outside the town for the first time.

But the prospect of a rival fried-chicken chain that uses the Sanders name has attracted the attention of KFC’s parent YUM! Brands whose legal team promptly submitted a filing to the US Patent & Trademark Office days after the properties were put up for sale.

4 The former primary 5000-square-foot residence of Colonel Harland Sanders located in Shelbyville Ky. Andrew Kung Group

The filing seeks to reinforce protections of KFC trademarks including “Colonel Sanders’ Original Recipe” “Col. Harland Sanders” and “It’s Finger Lickin’ Good.”

“It’s a very unique situation” said Jonathan Klunk of Six Degrees Real Estate which has been hired to sell the properties. “We are selling Claudia and she doesn’t have as much name recognition as her husband but a buyer can’t describe her without mentioning both her husband and KFC.”

4 Sanders lived out his final years at Blackwood Hall before his death in 1980 at the age of 94.

Col. Harland Sanders married Claudia in 1949 and opened the Claudia Sanders Dinner House for his wife in 1959 on a 3-acre property that also includes their 5000-square-foot private residence known as Blackwood Hall. Sanders lived out his final years at Blackwood Hall before his death in 1980 at age 94. Claudia died in 1994 when she was 90.

The property has been in the hands of Sanders family friends Tommy and Cherry Settle since the 1970s. Cherry who is 78 was a hostess at the restaurant when she and Tommy now 80 bought the property from the Sanders. Tommy had run a plant that supplied the restaurant with hams. The couple run the restaurant and currently live in Blackwood Hall but want to retire.

YUM! did not respond to multiple calls and emails for comment but KFC is famously secretive about its fried chicken recipe Sanders’ original 11 spices and herbs. Klunk says there are “a lot of similarities” between the restaurants’ menus but that the Dinner House has “no connection to the KFC recipe.”

The Settles had a run-in with YUM! in 2001 when Tommy found a leather-bound datebook from 1964 in the basement of Blackwood Hall that belonged to Col. Sanders and contained a list of 11 herbs and spices. Settle wanted to authenticate the recipe so he could sell it according to reports at the time but YUM sued him to keep it private until the company could vet it. The lawsuit was dropped when YUM! claimed the recipe wasn’t even close to the original.

YUM! a $6.5 billion conglomerate headquartered in Louisville Ky. that also owns Pizza Hut and Taco Bell has not expressed an interest in buying the restaurant brand or property Klunk said.

The Settles are seeking $9 million for their intellectual property as well as the two buildings the three-acre lot and some memorabilia including the first KFC flag and bucket and a birthday letter to Sanders from President Richard Nixon. A 2013 auction of the Colonel’s memorabilia that included one of his white suits fetched $21510 and his 1973 Kentucky driver’s license went for $1912.

Six Degrees is now considering unbundling the estate selling each piece separately to attract more buyers Klunk said.

So far interested buyers include local and large restaurant groups serial entrepreneurs who have global businesses and even some local bourbon brands according to the real estate firm.

One potential buyer talked about turning the Colonel’s house into a high-end Airbnb rental while a couple of Kentucky bourbon brands are weighing expansions into comfort food Klunk said. Others are exploring licensing its popular dishes especially its famous yeast rolls for sale in supermarkets Klunk said.

But none of the bidders are moving forward before talking to YUM! about what they can do with the brand without inviting litigation.

“If you want to use the Claudia Sanders brand you have to have a team of intellectual property lawyers” Klunk tells potential buyers.

The Claudia Sanders Dinner House has been a mainstay in Shelbyville Ky. since 1959 even serving as the first KFC headquarters for a time. Its menu includes boxes of chicken wings thighs and tenders yeast rolls creamed spinach cole slaw and homemade pies.

It’s one of the few establishments in the area that has a liquor license. Locals celebrate holidays weddings and reunions at the grand two-storied pavilion that features wide patios.

Even international tourists especially from Japan – where KFC is a staple of Christmas dinners – have posted images of themselves roaming the vast parking lot between the dinner house and Blackwood Hall.

The restaurant has peacefully co-existed with the fast-food empire largely because the Sanders and Settles have never aggressively promoted the brand or touted it on social media.

That could change – but it won’t be easy to slap the Sanders name on other restaurants selling chicken said Brad D. Rose a trademark attorney at Pryor Cashman who isn’t involved in the case.

“Whoever is going to take on the Claudia Sanders name is probably in for an uphill and expensive battle” Rose said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTExMjQ4Mjg3L0tZLXJlc3RhdXJhbnQtY3JlYXRlZC1LRkMtZm91bmRlci1IYXJsYW5kLVNhbmRlcnMtd2lmZS0xOTU5LXN0cnVnZ2xpbmctc2VsbC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,KY restaurant created by KFC founder is struggling to sell,"Klunk said there's 'a lot of similarities' between KFC's menu and Claudia's Dinner House but the dinner house's offerings have 'no connection to the KFC recipe'

The brand owners of KFC are stalling the purchase of the Kentucky restaurant and estate created for Harland Sanders for his wife in 1959 over trademark concerns.

Claudia's Dinner House - located in Shelbyville - was owned by the Sanders and their friends Tommy and Cherry Settle and now the Settles are committed to finding a new 'caretaker of this historic brand.'

The Settles are reportedly seeking $9million for the estate which includes the dinner house the mansion known as Blackwood Hall the three acres of land and the intellectual property including a KFC flag and a birthday letter to Sanders from President Richard Nixon.

Despite there being a few offers from franchising it for the first time to making it into an Airbnb the KFC brand owner Yum! Brands' legal team has stalled the transaction by submitting a filing to the US Patent & Trademark Office just days after the estate hit the market in June.

The filing seeks to reinforce the KFC trademark protections including 'Colonel Sanders' Original Recipe' 'Col. Harland Sanders' and 'It's Finger Lickin' Good' according to the New York Post.

'It’s a very unique situation' Realtor Jonathan Klunk of Six Degrees Real Estate told the Post. 'We are selling Claudia and she doesn’t have as much name recognition as her husband but a buyer can’t describe her without mentioning both her husband and KFC.'

Klunk said there's 'a lot of similarities' between KFC's menu and Claudia's Dinner House but the dinner house's offerings have 'no connection to the KFC recipe.'

The Settles did however have a run-in with Yum! Brands in 2001 according to the Post when Tommy found a datebook from 1964 that contained a list of 11 herbs and spices in Blackwood Hall. He wanted to have it authenticated to sell it but Yum! sued.

The case was later dropped after the brand owners said the recipe was nothing close to the now-famous combination sold in stores today.

Despite the stand-off between the brand and future owners Klunk said the $6.5billion conglomerate has not offered to buy the property.

The realtor also said they are considering unbundling the estate to sell each property separately to attract more buyers.

Potential buyers so far have ranged from a local bourbon company interested in expanding to comfort food as well as local and large restaurant groups and serial entrepreneurs with many brands.

All potential buyers have to talk to Yum! to detail how they plan to use the brand without inviting litigation.

'If you want to use the Claudia Sanders brand you have to have a team of intellectual property lawyers' Klunk has warned buyers according to the Post.

'Whoever is going to take on the Claudia Sanders name is probably in for an uphill and expensive battle' Trademark Attorney Brad D. Rose told the Post.

The dinner house originally served as KFC's headquarters after the Sanders closed their Corbin KFC location in 1952. That same year Sanders would begin franchising his company which would eventually become a global icon.

The couple opened Claudia Sanders Dinner House in 1959 when they moved to Shelbyville. It would become know for its yeast rolls massive buffet pies and fried chicken Kentucky.com said.

The dinner house would eventually burn down in 1999 but it was rebuilt and the legacy continues on.

'Claudia was the unspoken hero of her husband's success in business' Jonathan Klunk a listing agent said in June in a statement according to Kentucky.com.

Outdoor tables overlooking lots of greenery are also on the property allowing customers to enjoy the Kentucky weather

'And he wanted to honor her by creating Claudia Sanders Dinner House and associated brands. There is so much rich history included in this sale; it is exciting to think about the potential that lies ahead for the right buyer - to honor and protect this legacy and grow the brand even further.'

The Settles have fully owned the estate since the 1970s and are now looking to retire. Cherry who is now 78 started out as a hostess at the restaurant while her husband now 80 supplied the establishment with hams from a plant he owned when they bought the place.

Claudia and Harland met in the 1930s when she was working at his restaurant in Corbin as a waitress. Claudia would become a huge part of the brand even packaging food and spices to send to the franchises while Harland was out selling the brand.

They sold the restaurant to Tommy and Cherry in 1974 six years before Harland died in December 1980. Claudia died 16 years later in 1996.

However even after selling the business the pair still actively promoted the brand traveling the world in his iconic white suit and her antebellum dress.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL2VuLm1vZ2F6bmV3cy5jb20vV29ybGQtTmV3cy8yMDMxMzgzL1N1bmRheS0yNS1TZXB0ZW1iZXItMjAyMi0wNzM4LVBNLUtZLXJlc3RhdXJhbnQtY3JlYXRlZC1ieS1LRkMtZm91bmRlci1IYXJsYW5kLVNhbmRlcnMtZm9yLWhpcy13aWZlLWluLTE5NTktaXMtLXRyZW5kcy1ub3cuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sunday 25 September 2022 07:38 PM KY restaurant created by KFC founder Harland Sanders for his wife in 1959 is ...,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='en.mogaznews.com', port=443): Read timed out.
